      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31, dealing with four different topics, from Deputies Neville, Crawford, Naughten, Joe Higgins, Ó Caoláin, Timmins and Jim Higgins. I will deal with these topics separately and I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider an urgent and important matter, namely, the continuing industrial relations dispute which has closed down the Anglo-Irish Beef Packers plants at Rathkeale, Nenagh, Clones and Waterford, the difficulties this creates for the employees and suppliers, and the serious implications it has for the beef industry at a time of crisis due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and the need for immediate intervention by the Labour Court to facilitate a resolution to the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the fact that the AIB plants at Clones, Nenagh, Rathkeale and Waterford are closed due to strike action at a time when the cattle industry is in crisis due to foot and mouth disease. In the national interest there is an urgent need for Government intervention via the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider a matter of <Col N="822" /> urgent importance, namely, the threatened loss of more than 250 jobs and the postponement of a £20 million investment creating a further 100 jobs in Imagine, due to the delay in opening up competition to the mobile telephone market and a need for immediate action to be taken by the Minister for Public Enterprise to expedite the Telecommunications Regulations Bill to ensure full competition and to reduce the cost of mobile phone charges.</P>

        <b>:</b> I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider a matter of urgent public importance, namely, whether, in light of revelations on RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme last night, which dealt with the 1970 Arms Trial, a conspiracy was enacted at the highest levels of political life, and-or the Army and-or the Garda Síochana, to pervert the course of justice in this State, to falsely accuse an innocent person or persons of criminal activity for reasons of political expediency and arising from intra-party rivalries, and to discuss how this matter should be investigated and innocent persons vindicated.</P>

      <P>I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider an urgent matter of national importance, namely, the revelation that the key witness statement of Colonel Michael Hefferon was fundamentally altered in the Department of Justice, and the altered statement included in the book of evidence for the 1970 Arms Trial, and that, at a time when defenceless Nationalists in the North of Ireland were under daily attack, powerful elements in this State conspired to make scapegoats of people involved in the effort to import arms for their defence, while the knowledge and approval of the operation by the then Minister for Defence, Jim Gibbons, was covered up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal regarding the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 5, Second and Remaining Stages of the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, agreed? Agreed. Is the <Col N="824" /> proposal for dealing with Nos. 25 and 26, the motions on the referendum, agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, Sir, we are accepting this but the Taoiseach might be able to indicate to the House when we will have details about the referendum commission and matters related to the conduct of the four referenda that are proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the referendum commission, the Financial Resolutions have gone through but the work and all the appropriate arrangements will be made as soon as possible. I will inform the party leaders as soon as we move on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question I put to him. Will a booklet be issued to each household?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for the referendum commission. The same rules will apply but once it is set up, the commission will be independent so I am sure it will do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot continue with questions and answers on that matter. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 25 and 26 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6, the conclusion of Second Stage of the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If you force me I will oppose it. The position, Sir, is that this is a measure to amend the Constitution. I will not be opposing it but a number of speakers on Second Stage may not be accommodated up to 10 o'clock. On that basis an opportunity should be provided for them to contribute to the debate. Committee and Report Stages of the Bill are scheduled for tomorrow morning. I do not anticipate that will <Col N="825" /> take much time. On the other hand, if I had a formal understanding from the Government that speakers on Second Stage who could not be accommodated this evening would be accommodated tomorrow morning instead, I would be prepared to agree to the proposal if the Government would fall in with that arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow. Perhaps, with a bit of latitude, they could make some of their points at that stage. If that is possible, and with the agreement of the Chair, I have no problem with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being disorderly. You can only speak once on this matter. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6 agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Tánaiste is not here this morning. Will the Taoiseach agree that his proposal on the new national stadium is now a complete shambles and that this monument to his own ego is no longer viable? Will he agree that there is a complete contradiction between the commitment he has given to the Tánaiste that £60 million will be given to the GAA only if they open Croke Park to other codes and the commitment given to the GAA as confirmed by its president that the offer was made without any strings attached? I put it to the Taoiseach also that if and when, and it is clear now that that will be the case, Croke Park is opened up to other sporting codes, the national stadium is no longer viable and makes neither financial nor sporting sense. Does he appreciate that the commitments now made to both the GAA and the FAI have reached the original estimated cost of the stadium which he presented to this House when he first talked about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach like to take the opportunity to correct the record as reported in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, among others, that the proposals that were discussed at the congress over the weekend did not purport to make it a requirement that every GAA pitch will be open to all other kinds of sports, particularly soccer and rugby, but that the motion from Roscommon was confined to give to the central council the power to open Croke Park, and Croke Park alone, to soccer and rugby should they so decide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, I would not share that view. My vision of sport is shared by most of the national sporting bodies, namely, that this country needs two stadiums and proper sporting complexes. Hopefully that will happen as soon as possible &ndash; in 2005 or 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the decision made on the congress motion is concerned, my difficulty with that motion, as I said many times in the past few days, <Col N="826" /> is that it was a limited motion. The fact that it only included Croke Park is not what should happen in the long run.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The infrastructure that the Government and the taxpayer puts in throughout the country should be used. I cited the other day the case of a Limerick rugby ground which held 12,000 or 13,000 people while the athletic ground could hold far greater numbers, and that those facilities should be shared. Ultimately that is a matter for the conventions at Croke Park. The Government will give its view and it will urge that those facilities should be developed.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, and this point has been missed, the reality of Stadium Ireland never existed. The Government was faced with the position of having to help Croke Park. Croke Park ran into enormous difficulties, not all of their own making. The costs escalated dramatically and they required assistance. Their resources would have been entirely soaked up by Croke Park and it would not have been able to use those facilities in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next few years I hope we will see the full development of Croke Park. As the GAA and its advisers and technical experts have stated, Croke Park will not, when it is fully developed, be able to host soccer, Gaelic and rugby matches. That is not even a likely dream, not to mention an eventual possibility. Senior officials of the GAA have made it absolutely clear to the Government that the ground will not be able to host those matches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty we face on this side of the House is that the Taoiseach's principles change on a daily basis. We have been informed by the president of the GAA that money was offered with no strings attached. The Tánaiste has objected to this and the Taoiseach is now suggest<Col N="827" /> ing that not only must Croke Park be open to other sporting codes, particularly soccer and rugby, but so also must all GAA grounds throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary shift. Will the Taoiseach clarify the position to the House? We are not discussing small amounts of money, we are discussing enormous amounts. The Taoiseach has already committed almost £1 billion to his extravagance at Abbotstown which, I presume, he believes will stand as some sort of monument to him. What is the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>his relationship with the Tánaiste? Has he said the offer is conditional? Has he informed the GAA authorities &ndash; particularly the president and the chairman of the Leinster council who are both on the record as saying there are no strings attached &ndash; that there are now strings attached? Has the Taoiseach informed them about this morning's new set of strings, namely, that every GAA ground throughout the country and not merely Croke Park will have to host other codes?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered Deputy Noonan's question yesterday. The offer had nothing to do with the Roscommon motion. The GAA had to put to its annual congress its position on playing matches in Stadium Ireland and details on its financial position. That had to be cleared because the consortium which will build the stadium and which is obliged to make its proposal by 31 May needed to have the position clarified. That was the reason the GAA urged the Government to make its position clear before the end of last week.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, the Government and I have sent letters to the FAI and the GAA. We are still in discussions with the IRFU because there are a number of outstanding issues which must be resolved. These mainly involve coaching, which means the position is different to that involving the FAI and the GAA, but they must be resolved in fairness to the IRFU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A legal agreement will have to be drawn up with the three organisations. The process for doing so has not commenced but it will eventually have to be put in train. The discussions and negotiations on that matter will allow the Government to put forward its views on certain matters. We cannot force them to do anything. However, the Government will put forward its view that <Col N="831" /> because the State and the taxpayer are expending large amounts of money on sports infrastructure, that infrastructure should be used in as wide a manner as possible. It is not always practical that one sporting body can use another sporting body's facilities. However, where possible, different sporting organisations should be able to use each others grounds and there should not be a ban in that regard. That is the Government's position. We cannot force organisations to comply, but we have made our views known.</P>
    <P>Croke Park is already used for Gaelic football, hurling, ladies' football and camogie. It will also be used for the special Olympics and for many other events. It is used extensively for GAA field sports. It is the view of the GAA that Croke Park will not be able to be used for other sports. However, that does not mean other grounds throughout the country cannot be shared on an agreed basis. We will state our position but we cannot force it or make it a precondition. We can only state that is what we think should happen. That is our view even if there was not a Stadium Ireland.</P>

When will the memorandum be brought to Government &ndash; I am repeating of necessity because the question was not answered &ndash; and will it contain the conditions described by the Progressive Demo<Col N="832" /> crats, the junior partners in the Government for the time being? Will the Taoiseach publish the correspondence to which he referred in relation to Stadium Ireland? Is the £60 million, as reported by the Progressive Democrats, conditional on only Croke Park being made open for set rugby and soccer fixtures? Will the memorandum contain those conditions?

It will include the points we have put in our various discussions.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present to this House today the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 2001. The enactment of this Bill will enable the Government to proceed with the referendum to abolish the two references to the death penalty in the Constitution and to prohibit its reintroduction in any circumstances by the inclusion of specific provisions to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1964, abolished the death penalty for offences other than treason, <Col N="838" /> capital murder and certain military offences. The death penalty was finally abolished in our statute law under the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, but not in our Constitution. Therefore without a constitutional prohibition it could be reintroduced by statute. The Constitution still contains two references to the death penalty and these are to be found at Articles 13.6 and Article 40.4.5.</P>
    <P>Article 13.6 provides that the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment are vested in the President but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities. Article 40.4.5 is part of the <i>habeas corpus</i> provisions of the Constitution and provides that where an order is made by the High Court or a judge thereof for the production of the body of a person who is under sentence of death, the High Court or such judge thereof shall further order the execution of the said sentence of death shall be deferred until the body of such person has been produced before the High Court and the lawfulness of his detention has been determined, and if, after such deferment, the detention of such person is determined to be lawful, the High Court shall appoint a day for the execution of the said sentence of death.</P>
    <P>In addition, Article 28.3.3 is also relevant. That Article, <i>inter alia</i>, provides that nothing in the Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, is proposing the making of amendments of a technical nature to enable the referendum on this issue to be held. These technical amendments are intended to reflect the situation which pertains in Irish law since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, and to take account of our international obligations. The Bill comprises two sections and a Schedule. Section 1 details the proposed changes to the Constitution by reference to the Schedule and section 2 is a standard citation provision. The proposed changes set out in the Schedule relate to four Articles of the Constitution, Articles 13, 15, 28 and 40. These changes are as follows.</P>
    <P>There will be the deletion of the reference to the death penalty in Article 13.6 which deals with the commutation and remission of sentences and specifies that such powers cannot be used in capital cases except by the President. There will be the deletion of Article 40.4.5, which makes provision for <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings in respect of a person who has been sentenced to death. There will be a new subsection 15.5.2 to the effect that &ldquo;the Oireachtas shall not enact any law providing for the imposition of the death penalty&rdquo; which is to be inserted in Article 15.5 which deals with the powers of the national Parliament. There will be the amendment of Article 28.3.3 to exclude the new Article 15.5.2 from the override provisions of that Article so that the prohibition on the <Col N="839" /> reintroduction of the death penalty will apply even in time of war or armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in the Bill takes into account the views and recommendations of a number of important bodies. In proposing the removal of the words &ldquo;except in capital cases&rdquo; in Article 13.6, the Bill reflects the recommendation of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on that provision. Likewise, in proposing the prohibition of the death penalty by the inclusion of a new section, in Article 15.5, the recommendation of the Constitution Review Group is being implemented in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government is of the view that mere deletion of the references to the death penalty in Articles 13.6 and 40.4.5 is not enough and that any constitutional amendment relating to the death penalty should include a constitutional ban on its reintroduction. This is reflected in the Bill by the insertion of a provision in Article 15.5 to the effect that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law providing for the imposition of the death penalty. This approach is also in line with the recommendation of the Constitution Review Group. That group further recommended that, in the event of a provision being included in the Constitution prohibiting the reintroduction of the death penalty, Article 28.3.3 should be amended so that the death penalty could not be imposed even in the circumstances contemplated by Article 28.3.3, that is, where a state of emergency is declared in accordance with that Article.</P>
    <P>In their consideration of Article 40.4.5 the Constitution Review Group, noting that the death penalty had been abolished in 1990, pointed out that unless the death penalty were to be specifically prohibited by the Constitution and an appropriate amendment made to Article 28.3.3, then Article 40.4.5 would not be redundant and should be retained. Their reasoning was as follows. Article 28.3.3 provides that nothing in the Constitution should be invoked to invalidate any law passed by the Oireachtas which expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group pointed out that unless an appropriate amendment was made to Article 28.3.3 the override provisions of that Article which permit the declaration of a state of emergency together with legislation in pursuance of that emergency could be used by a future Government to re-impose the death penalty and it would be necessary, as a minimum check on the legality of the operation of such emergency legislation, to retain the provisions of Article 40.4.5. The Bill follows the recommendations of the review group in relation to the amendment of Article 28.3.3. The amendment comprises an insertion into that subsection to exclude the new Article 15.5.2 from the override provisions of the Article so that the prohibition on the re-introduction of the death penalty will apply even in time of war or armed rebellion. The Government fav<Col N="840" /> ours this approach on the basis that since, as a matter of principle it is of the view that the death penalty is wrong in all circumstances, Article 28.3.3 should be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>In making the proposed changes to Articles 15.5 and 28.3.3 the retention of Article 40.4.5 as a safeguard provision would not arise. There are further provisions relating to our international obligations which are of relevance. Ireland has ratified two international instruments relating to the abolition of the death penalty. They are Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights ratified on 24 June 1994 which abolishes the death penalty but allows for a derogation in time of war or imminent threat of war and the Second Optional Protocol to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified on 18 June 1993, which also abolishes the death penalty but allowed for the possibility of a reservation in time of war, which possibility the Government in 1993, on ratification, declined to avail of.</P>
    <P>Given our stance on the subject at international level and our ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the proposals as outlined in the Bill are in line with our international commitments. Sweden has recently introduced a proposal for an additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights to abolish the death penalty and the Government has supported this proposal.</P>
    <P>The terrible reality of the death penalty has not been a part of our criminal law system for some time now. Although only finally abolished by the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, the death penalty has not been used in this country since 1954. The deletion of the references in Articles 13.6 and 40.4.5 and the insertion of a prohibition in Article 15 give constitutional protection to what has already been done by statute. More importantly, however, the amendment relating to Article 28.3.3 means the override provisions of that Article enabling the re-introduction of the death penalty in time of war or armed rebellion will not be used at any stage in the future. That sends out a forceful message to the international community of Ireland's strong stance against the use of the death penalty and is one of which we as a modern democracy can be rightly proud.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his speech. The Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill brings the Constitution into line with legislation as amended in the Criminal Justice Act, 1990. It seeks to do four things: to delete reference to capital cases in Article 13.6; to delete Article 40.4.5 which makes provision for <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings in respect of a person <Col N="841" /> who has been sentenced to death; to include a specific provision to the effect that no one shall be sentenced to death; and to amend Article 28.3.3 to prohibit the re-introduction of the death penalty even in times of war or armed rebellion.</P>
      <P>These changes take into account the recommendations made by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in November 1998 which recommended that the re-introduction of the death penalty should be prohibited by the Constitution. The Constitution Review Group in May 1996 recommended that deleting the reference to capital cases would reflect the present state of law. In addition, the Bill reflects our stand and ratification of the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which abolished the death penalty except in time of war and our ratification, without reservation, of the Second Optional Protocol to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides for the abolition of the death penalty even in time of war.</P>
      <P>The death penalty is not something that clicks into the Irish psyche and most of us associate it with the dim and distant past. The last execution in Ireland took place in 1954 with the hanging of a Limerick man. The Criminal Justice Act, 1964 abolished the death penalty for all except a very limited number of serious offences: capital murder, treason and certain offences by people subject to military law under the offence Acts, such as mutiny with violence. Capital murder included the murder of a member of the Prisons Service or a member of the Garda Síochána acting in the course of their duty. It also included murder committed in the course of certain offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 or in the course of furtherance of activities of an unlawful organisation or the murder of a diplomatic officer of a foreign State or the murder of a member of Government. The Criminal Justice Act, 1990 abolished the death penalty for these remaining offences. However, reference to it still remains in the Constitution. It is now hoped that we will update the Constitution in line with the legislation.</P>
      <P>Between 1964 and 1990 several persons were convicted of capital murder. Some of the convictions were quashed on appeal and in the remaining cases the sentence was commuted by the President to imprisonment for 40 years. It will be a surprise to many people, whenever they go to the poll on this referendum, to discover that traces of the death penalty still exist. More than half the countries in the world have now abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. On average more than three countries per year have abolished the death penalty for all crimes in the past decade. Having been abolished, the death penalty is seldom re-introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1985 more than 40 countries have abolished the death penalty and during the same period only four abolitionist countries re-introduced the penalty. One such country, Nepal, has since abolished it again; the Philippines has resumed <Col N="842" /> executions and no executions have taken place in Gambia and Papua New Guinea. It is very difficult to pinpoint the exact number of executions world-wide. In 1999 there were at least 1,813 prisoners executed in 31 countries. It is likely that figure is higher. Approximately 60% of the known executions took place in China in 1999; 98 executions took place in the USA. They are the ones with which we are most familiar from a public awareness point of view. As a recognised leader of the free world we would expect certain standards from the USA and it is difficult to reconcile its self-proclaimed image of goodness with the fact that since 1990 it is the country, according to Amnesty International, which carried out the greatest number of known executions of child offenders, numbering 13. The USA can exert such an influence on the western world.</P>
    <P>President Bush, in particular, has been associated with the death penalty. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have a role to play in raising this issue with the US President at every available opportunity. Repeated scientific studies have failed to find convincing evidence that the death penalty deters crimes more effectively than other punishments. It is important that those in favour of the death penalty take note of the following statistics. The homicide rate in Canada per 100,000 population fell from a peak of 3.09 in 1975 &ndash; the year before the abolition of the death penalty for murder &ndash; to 2.41 in 1980 and it has declined further since. In 1999, the rate was 1.76 per 100,000 population. However, the most disturbing aspect of the death penalty is that the risk of executing the innocent cannot be eliminated. It is appropriate that I refer to last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which showed that documentation which could have resulted in the death penalty for some of the people being prosecuted may have been tampered with. It is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform investigate this matter and refer it to the committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The allegations made on that programme, which I have no reason to doubt as there is documentary evidence, are very serious. We cannot gloss over this matter. It is disturbing and makes one wonder how often events like this occurred. Since 1973, more than 90 United States prisoners have been released from death row after evidence emerged of their innocence of the crimes for which they were sentenced to death.</P>
    <P>However, when supporting this amendment of the Constitution it is important that the Government signal its determination to support gardaí and prison officers against criminal and terrorist elements who have no respect for life. This is particularly apt in view of recent reported incidents in our prisons. Sometimes it can be facile for Members to articulate from their lofty perch what should be done, but it is important to remember that ordinary human beings have to carry out these measures at the coalface. Any person or group who carry out such reprehensible <Col N="843" /> crimes or seek to instil terror in our law enforcers and their families should meet the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>I want to know what discussions the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had with members of the security forces or the diplomatic corps with respect to this amendment. If he had discussions, what were the views of those officers? It is imperative that the mandatory 40 year sentence stay in place and that gardaí and prison officers, who frequently put their lives on the line, are aware that there is a recognition of their role. This is particularly important in the context of an unarmed force but, whether armed or unarmed, the murder of a prison officer or a member of the Garda must be dealt with in the same manner. We must at all times protect those who serve society. The present level of serious and violent crime is intolerable and there is a duty on us to maintain law and order and to create a public confidence that crime does not pay. Regrettably, this is a confidence that has been eroded in recent years.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill, I acknowledge the fine work carried out over many years by some human rights groups. I pay tribute to the Irish branch of Amnesty International whose sole motivation on this issue has been a human rights one. Fine Gael would like also to acknowledge the sacrifice made by many members of the security forces and the suffering of their families. We must at all times have the means available to protect society from the criminal and the terrorist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be no surprise to the Minister that once again I state my support for the death penalty in this House and regret that it is to be removed from the Irish Statute Book. My colleague, Deputy Timmons, said that the purpose of that removal was to ensure that nobody could be sentenced to death in this country. However, that is not quite correct. Every year, up to 200 people are sentenced to death. Their lives are snuffed out by animals. What about their rights? Are we just to wring our hands and say we can do nothing to the person who took their life?</P>
      <P>Society must have deterrents. What we see in the current upheaval of Irish society is the dismantling of deterrents. I would shed a tear for any person who had to be executed, but the deterrent must apply to all. It should apply to me as well as anyone else. We are living in an increasingly violent society and if society is to have any chance, there must be some type of deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No person has the right to take a life, go to jail for seven years, possibly not serve the full seven years, and then expect to get away. There is a total finality to death and up to 200 unfortunate people per year are done to death. That is almost one person each day. In 1949, there was one murder in Ireland. Today, it is totally out of control. There are at least 200 murders per year. Many of those cases are reduced to manslaughter but the <Col N="844" /> reality is that over 200 people per year are butchered. Why? Because there is no deterrent. The deterrent should apply to me as well as to the public. I fear that the removal of these references in the Constitution could militate against a future Dáil ever reintroducing capital punishment.</P>
    <P>Some 25 years ago the majority of states in the United States abolished capital punishment and while Deputy Timmons did not refer to this, such was the upsurge in murder that one by one almost every state in the US had no option but to reintroduce capital punishment. We have a duty to protect young boys and girls &ndash; those at tender ages. The media regularly give details of their tragic deaths, savagely violated by animals, brutalised, and then having their lives snuffed out. Old people living in remote cottages are also butchered with regularity. What about protection and rights for them? It is not enough to say that this was a terrible thing, or to say that someone will be sent to jail for seven years, and then move on. This final act in the removal of the possibility of at some future date reintroducing capital punishment, if it was deemed necessary by the Oireachtas, should not go ahead.</P>
    <P>I know that mine is a lone voice in the wilderness but I must make a comment on the farcical alternative sentencing. Seven years in jail and murderers get out again, in some cases to reoffend. This illustrates how the liberal society has taken over. There is no value placed on life. One looks at the recent tragic war in the north of Ireland in which almost 4,000 people were killed over 30 years. Many of those who were guilty by association in the deaths of most of those people have got away &ndash; I am referring to Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness and their ilk. These men are international war criminals yet they have been regularly entertained at Leinster House. They are entertained in Downing Street and in the White House.</P>
    <P>This makes a mockery of democracy and is a nightmare. The appeasement of criminals who take life has reached an all time high. Is there no concern about the treatment of the killers of Garda Gerry McCabe? Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform let them out of jail also? Unless law and order is reinstated and unless the most heinous crime in the book, the taking of life, is reinstated as the most unacceptable crime, Irish society is in for a very difficult time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Deputy McGahon has very trenchantly and forthrightly expressed his views as is his right. I fundamentally disagree with him when he says that if someone takes a life, the response of the State should be to take that person's life. The Labour Party fully supports the removal from the Constitution of all references to the death penalty. We support the Bill introduced in the House today and will strongly advocate its approval by the people in the forthcoming referendum on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> The death penalty has not been invoked in this jurisdiction for many years. The last person to be hanged was 25 year old Michael Manning from Limerick in 1954. The circumstances of Mr. Manning's crime, in which drink played a major role in the lead-up to the brutal, but unpremeditated, murder of Sr. Catherine Cooper, make the case to abolish the death penalty in all circumstances. Since the death of Mr. Manning, those found guilty by the courts of capital murder have served long prison sentences instead of facing the hangman's rope.</P>
    <P>Many people are unaware that the death penalty is part of the Irish penal code and may be surprised to learn of the intention to hold a referendum on the issue. Since the passage of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act in 1990, the death penalty cannot be imposed by a court. However, the references to the death penalty are still found in the Constitution and Article 28.3 allows for its reintroduction in a time of war or armed rebellion. The fact that the Constitution is in need of amendment is not in doubt.</P>
    <P>Despite the current practice, the reality is that those who framed the 1937 Constitution contemplated and provided for the death penalty for the most serious crimes. The death penalty is a cruel and inhuman punishment which has no place in a modern democracy. It is only right that all references to this evil act are removed from our most fundamental legal document, a document upon which all institutions of the State are founded.</P>
    <P>Constitutions not only provide the fundamental law for a jurisdiction, they also reflect its philosophy, history and basic values. This is true of the 1937 Constitution in particular. Our society and our values have changed in the 64 years since that Constitution was narrowly passed in a referendum and it is only proper that our Constitution is amended to reflect these changes.</P>
    <P>Some would propose to go further. The Progressive Democrats once argued it was time to rip up Bunreacht na hÉireann and start again. They went so far as to publish a &ldquo;Constitution for a New Republic&rdquo; in 1988, a document which, unfortunately, received more coverage for its failure to include a reference to God than for its proposed reform. I believe the document was a thought provoking and inventive development. That reforming zeal seems to have evaporated from the Progressive Democrats in recent years. Given the extent and scope of the report of the Constitution Review Group and the extensive deliberations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee, which are ongoing, the idea of framing a new constitution and putting it before the people is worthy of examination. However, that is an argument for another day.</P>
    <P>The reasons our Constitution includes references to the death penalty are clear from a historical perspective. In 1937, the memories of rebellion, the War of Independence and the Civil War were everyday realities for Irish families. For the first decade, at least, during which the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann was in force, the very <Col N="846" /> foundations of the State and democracy were under threat. The pro-treaty side in the Civil War battled to establish and maintain the very basic structure of civil society. The bitterness and pain sown by that war resulted in a substantial section of the citizens of the new State being opposed to its very existence. The presence of a large number of weapons in a society which had been in a state of armed turmoil for more than five years heightened the danger to democracy.</P>
    <P>The decision of Fianna Fáil to enter Dáil Éireann in 1927 was a critical event in the evolution of the Irish State. The result of the 1932 election and the Fianna Fáil Government which was subsequently formed, with the help of the Labour Party, was a further watershed. The statesmanship demonstrated by W.T. Cosgrave, in particular, which resulted in the relatively smooth transfer of power on that occasion is one of the most remarkable acts of selflessness in Irish political history.</P>
    <P>By 1937, the Irish State was secure. However, the anti-treaty rump still maintained a private army and engaged in lethal, if somewhat sporadic, acts of violence during these years. That threat was one of the main reasons for the State maintaining the provision to kill persons convicted of particular crimes and the references in Bunreacht na hÉireann to the death penalty. The wording of Article 28.3 also allowed for the use of the death penalty during a &ldquo;time of war or armed rebellion&rdquo;. While we can look back and understand the historical reasons for the death penalty, the fact is that such a practice is repugnant in a civilised society. The Bill before the House is a logical conclusion of the Criminal Justice Act of 1990, the report of the Constitution Review Group, which recommended the prohibition of the reintroduction of the death penalty, and the European Convention on Human rights to which Ireland is a signatory.</P>
    <P>To a great extent, this Bill and the forthcoming referendum are symbolic. I strongly believe the Irish people will support the referendum. If that happens, the Government should use this new mandate to actively campaign for the abolition of the death penalty world-wide. It would be a tragedy if the Irish people were to support this referendum but the Government were to subsequently decide its job was done and move on to other business.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental human right of all, the right to life, is being violated by states across the world. The United States of America, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran are the leading state executioners. Ireland should play a leading role in supporting organisations which campaign against the death penalty in these and other countries, organisations such as Amnesty International which has achieved so much on behalf of victims of state violence across the world.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the UN Security Council must be used to campaign against the death penalty. If we believe this issue is sufficiently important to introduce legislation in this House <Col N="847" /> and ask the Irish people to vote on it, we should surely have the courage to put our heads above the parapet on the international stage and voice our opposition to state murder, loud and clear.</P>
    <P>The recent election of George Bush as President of America will be a test of our resolve and determination on this issue. I support Deputy Timmins's comments on the need to exert pressure on the US Government. As Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush demonstrated his willingness to carry out the death penalty. In spite of the overwhelming evidence collated to the effect that the death penalty in Texas and other US states is used in a racist and class-ridden manner, Mr. Bush continued to send people, primarily poor and black people, to their deaths in the months and weeks before the presidential election.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys a special relationship with the US. The critical involvement of the Clinton presidency in the peace process, from the granting of a visa to Joe Cahill to the former President's visit here towards the end of last year, was of vital importance to the progress made on this island since 1994. That special relationship works both ways. We now enjoy access at the highest level to the corridors of power in Washington, in both Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Avenue.</P>
    <P>We should use our access, moral authority and diplomatic skills to demonstrate, in no uncertain terms, our opposition to state execution in the United States. Since 1990, more than 350 people have been executed in the US. That is an appalling toll. I vehemently disagree with the comments of the previous speaker on this issue. The majority of those executed are black and poor. Others are juveniles or people who are mentally handicapped. Many are also innocent of their crimes. In the past 20 years alone, more than 70 people have been released from death row in America after evidence of their wrongful conviction came to light.</P>
    <P>Many people in this House and in wider Irish society campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six. Those familiar with that case will be only too aware of the words of Lord Denning during the sentencing of these six men when he made clear his desire to impose a death penalty. This chilling incident reveals the truth behind a number of state executions, namely that innocent people are killed.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the United States in the peace process does not require Ireland to take a vow of silence on human rights abuses. The death penalty is a human rights abuse, its widespread use in the United States, the self-proclaimed leader of the free world, is a disgrace and we should have the courage to say so. We should also have the courage to put our views to all other countries which maintain the death penalty. Will the Minister give a guarantee to the House today that, in the event of the passage of this referendum, the Taoiseach will write to the leader of each country where the death penalty is enforced, informing them of the democratic decision of the <Col N="848" /> Irish people and urging them to follow our lead? I note the Minister's point on supporting a proposal from Sweden but I hope he will address this broader issue at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is part of a raft of referenda on which the Irish people will vote. The legislation for the referenda on judicial conduct, the death penalty and the international criminal court are all under the tutelage of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am deeply disappointed that one other referendum, for which thousands of people have been waiting, has not seen the light of day. I refer to the promised referendum dealing with the human rights of people with disabilities. Since the striking down of the original Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act, it has been abundantly clear that an amendment of the Constitution to ensure the human rights of citizens comes before ownership rights of employers and owner's property is urgently needed. The Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act passed by the 28th Dáil have been significantly watered down to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment. The Government has promised to introduce a disability Bill but it continues to slip back on the list of proposed legislation. In all likelihood, the Bill will not be passed by the Oireachtas during the lifetime of the Government. There are two possible reasons for this, lethargy and complexity. Given the tone of this debate, I will give the Minister and his Department the benefit of the doubt and accept the complexity of the issue is holding up the legislation. That complexity could be unravelled if the Government proposed a relatively straightforward amendment to the Constitution. The Labour Party has already published a comprehensive amendment Bill which the Minister could adopt. Will he consider that proposal?</P>
    <P>It seems that people with disabilities must still wait. It is an appalling record and I cannot let this debate pass without referring to the priorities of the Government when it comes to constitutional referenda. The electorate is informed and sophisticated and, given this raft of amendments, the Government could easily have decided on another issue of fundamental rights, the right of people with disabilities to enjoy those things which able bodied people take for granted. Unfortunately, through the lack of political will, this important constitutional change will not be decided on by the people this time round and I am sincerely disappointed at that. There was an indication earlier in the session that this might be one of the referenda put to the people, but that does not now appear as if it will be the case.</P>
    <P>On the issue before the House, I repeat my party's support for the Bill and our commitment to campaign for its passage. I take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and his officials on the introduction of the Bill. Given two Bills dealing with constitutional referenda and a spell at Question Time this week, it will be a busy week for the Minister. I note he is also making other <Col N="849" /> public announcements. I just wish another constitutional amendment was forthcoming from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister may not thank me for wanting him to be busier this week, but many people throughout the country who are concerned about equality of rights and the rights of people with disabilities will agree with me that the proposal of the Constitution Review Group and the proposals of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities should have been given priority, together with the other proposed referenda.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party fully supports the removal of the death penalty from the Constitution, particularly the fact that the way in which it is being removed will ensure it cannot be reintroduced. That is an important point which the Minister stressed also. The Labour Party supports the proposals before us today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Fleming.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes an amendment to the Constitution to delete references to and prohibit the introduction of the death penalty under any circumstances in the future. I can safely say that proposal will be well received throughout the country. I firmly believe that only God can give life and only God can take it away. It was disgraceful to read the coverage given to the death of an Irish person in yesterday's edition of <i>The Star</i>. It showed no understanding or appreciation for the trauma and difficulties being experienced by that man's family. It was an all time low in Irish journalism and I hope this type of coverage will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people throughout the country share the Government and Parliament's desire to abolish the death penalty. However, we are very conscious that it still exists. It is alarming for many people that the country which is considered to be the trend setter for the remainder of the world, the USA, still carries out the death penalty and that, unfortunately, one of its greatest advocates is the President of the United States of America. When hostilities erupt throughout the world, the rest of the civilised world often looks to the USA to bring peace, therefore, it is most unfortunate that the death penalty continues to exist there. It is a barbaric act which has no place in a modern civilised world and we should use every opportunity possible to express that view. It is often said in Ireland that one should not bite off the hand that feeds one but, as other speakers have said, we very much appreciate the wonderful role the USA played in bringing peace to this country. However, we have a duty to highlight wrong and there is no greater wrong than the imposition of the death penalty. I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use every opportunity possible to express our abhorrence of the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a decline in public interest in referenda. Given the consensus <Col N="850" /> in this regard, it is unlikely there will be much debate on the issue or that it will get many headlines in the newspapers. For that reason, it is important that we as parliamentarians make every effort to ensure the public is aware of exactly what is being proposed. We will present four different referenda to the people in a few weeks or perhaps a few months. While people have become very cynical and show a certain lack of interest in referenda, it is vital they are given the information in regard to something as serious as this. If there is a high turnout for these referenda, it will reinforce our message when we try to talk to those who use the death penalty.</P>
    <P>Human life is sacred. I know that some families who suffer believe it should be a case of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but that is not acceptable in the modern world. I am pleased the Minister is giving the public an opportunity to show their abhorrence for the death penalty. No matter what crimes people commit, we do not have the right to take their lives. I am convinced the public will vote overwhelmingly for what is being proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 2001, the purpose of which is to facilitate holding a referendum which will remove the death penalty from the Constitution. I am pleased to be a Member of the Oireachtas which is bringing forward this referendum and I look forward to its full support by the Irish people. I hope very few will cast their votes against it.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that legislation was passed in this House in 1964 to abolish the death penalty for most offences. The death penalty was finally abolished in 1990 but it was not removed from the Constitution. It is approximately 50 years since the last death penalty was implemented and an execution was carried out in Ireland. The overwhelming majority of the people have no recollection of a death penalty being enforced in this country. Given that the practice for at least two generations is not to implement the death penalty, it is correct that the Constitution should reflect the reality and the wishes of the people. I look forward to this taking place in the near future.</P>
      <P>I would say to those who might be in favour of the death penalty that it does not work. The USA has a much higher murder rate than most other countries despite its extensive use of the death penalty. Clearly it does not act as a deterrent. While speaking of the USA, I would like to highlight the case of Roger Collins who is on death row in Jackson, Georgia. Roger's case has been highlighted for me by Billy Colbert in Portlaoise who is heading up a very active committee to secure the release of Roger Collins from death row. I support the call to have Roger Collins's death sentence commuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I would like to explain what can happen when a country <Col N="851" /> becomes used to the death penalty and death row. Roger Collins is approximately 42 years of age and has spent the last 24 years on death row for a crime in which he was involved when he was 18 years of age. He has spent most of his life on death row. He was not the killer but was there when the crime was committed. The killer, who was convicted by the courts and who confessed to the killing, only received a life sentence because he had the money to pay for a good attorney. Roger Collins's problem is that he is poor and black and was a victim of abuse as a child and was not fully aware of the legal proceedings. The state appointed an attorney for him who had never dealt with a capital case before and who was given the princely sum of $600 to defend Roger Collins. For people in Ireland who are aware of what legal costs can run into for a short appearance in court, $600 is a paltry sum and is an indication of the support that state gave him. It would only provide $600 to pay for legal fees to fight the case when the person who admitted to carrying out the offence had the money to pay for a good attorney, got a life sentence and did not have to go on death row.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people in Ireland to support Roger Collins's case to have his death sentence commuted. Roger is only one of many such cases throughout the world. I would like Ireland to use its influence through the EU and its seat on the United Nations Security Council. Through the EU, we have been working to try to introduce a moratorium on death penalties throughout Europe. A declaration by the Presidency of the European Union welcomed the introduction of a moratorium on execution in the US state of Illinois. This was issued in February of last year. The Presidency of the European Union felt it was an issue on which it could appeal to the United States.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. It will be easy to convince the people as we know the death penalty does not work. We have seen in numerous other countries that are happy to use the death penalty that it does not reduce crime, does nothing for human dignity and, above all, it flies in the face of God because it is God who gives life and it is God who should take it away. Legislators throughout the world should not take it upon themselves to have the death penalty on their statute books. I urge other countries to follow the example set by the Irish people who will remove this provision from our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction will almost all other speakers, I welcome this provision. I strongly disagree with the comments made by a colleague, Deputy McGahon, who is in favour of the retention of the death penalty. The Fine Gael Party is totally opposed to the death penalty or its reintroduction at any time. We believe the death penalty is and has been shown to be wrong. I <Col N="852" /> remember listening to the late Seán MacBride, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, in UCD one night. When I went into that debate I was strongly in favour of capital punishment but I listened intently to the arguments presented by Seán MacBride and I came away convinced that the carrying out of the death penalty by the state is wrong and should not be countenanced or supported at any time. We should be quite vociferous in our opposition to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>One can look at what happened in Britain over the years, at the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and at quite a few other such cases in which in years gone by the death penalty would have been imposed. Those people were subsequently found to be totally innocent, were released and were paid compensation. It shows that mistakes can be made. For somebody to be hanged, executed by the state, for a murder of which they are innocent, shows that we must ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I was pleased that the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, abolished the death penalty for offences other than treason, capital murder and certain military offences. I was also pleased that the death penalty was finally abolished in our statute law under the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, but not in our Constitution. I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that dealt with fundamental rights. The report of the review group referred to appeals relating to death sentences. The review group noted that the death penalty had been abolished as a sentence but may be imposed by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, 1990. The recommendation of the review group was to prohibit the reintroduction of the death penalty. If this is not deemed desirable, Article 40.4.5. should be retained. If it is prohibited, Article 28.3.3 will require amendment so the death penalty cannot be imposed in any circumstances. I am pleased we are going to have a constitutional referendum on this matter and I will actively support this amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I would like to state clearly and unequivocally that the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer or an elected Member of either House of Oireachtas should mean life imprisonment &ndash; a lengthy sentence. I am retiring at the end of this Dáil as are Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Andrews. We have served the people and in my time in the House, I have seen a colleague in Fine Gael, the late Senator Billy Fox, shot. I strongly believe elected Members of the Houses should be protected in the same way as a member of the Garda Síochána and that anyone found guilty of the murder of an elected Member of the Houses should serve a lengthy sentence. The Garda Síochána is an unarmed police force and it deserves protection from this House and the people it represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we examine how people are tried for and convicted of murder. We have to be careful to see how we are examining cases of murder and of missing people. Every Member <Col N="853" /> of the Oireachtas will have received a letter in the last few days from a man whose sister is missing. The Minister will also have received this letter in the last day or two. In his letter, this man speaks of his sister who has been missing since 3 November 1999. He states that the assistance they have received has been very poor. He also refers to the fact there is no helpline for the relatives of those who are missing. There was a helpline run on a voluntary basis. It was a great help but it lost its telephone line because of a lack of funds. The trauma of losing a relative is horrific in terms of the worry, concern and the money expended. When people who have lost relatives want a fully staffed help line and it is not possible to provide funding, there is something seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the cases of a number of missing persons. I raised this matter with the Minister previously. Operation Trace, which is based in Naas, is working quite well and I welcome that, but I am concerned that six ladies are missing whose bodies have never been found. I share the hope of their families that they may some day be found. Hopefully, progress is being made under Operation Trace. The six cases are Annie McCarrick, 26, who went missing in 1993 and was last seen in County Wicklow; Jo Jo Dullard, 20, who went missing in 1995; Fiona Pender, 25, from my own constituency, who went missing in 1996; Ciara Breen, 17, from Dundalk, who went missing in 1997; Fiona Sinnott, 19, from Wexford, who went missing in 1998; and Deirdre Jacob, 19, from County Kildare, who went missing in 1998. These were all young women from counties in close proximity to one another &ndash; Kildare, Wicklow, Offaly, Wexford and Louth. That makes me uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>Four other women were also missing. Antoinette Smith, 27, went missing in 1987 and Patricia Doherty, 30, went missing in 1991. The bodies of both women were found in Kilkeel. Eva Brennan, 40, went missing in 1993. Her body was not found. The body of Marie Gilmartin, 38, was found on the Laois-Offaly border.</P>
    <P>A former Garda detective, Gerry Carroll, recently pointed out in regard to missing persons that there may be a connection between some of those murders. One person may have been involved in the loss of these women. I am concerned and the issue needs to be further examined because it is of the utmost importance. The numbers of missing people have increased dramatically from 1,358 to 2,015 in 1998. We need to be more vigilant in helping to trace missing people because it is essential to make a greater effort to trace them. Their families are worried about them. It is obvious that some of them have been murdered and the people who committed the murders must be brought to book for them. I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I strongly welcome this proposal by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the prohibition of the death penalty <Col N="854" /> under this legislation, which is to be taken with a series of other proposed constitutional amendments. Statutorily, as Deputy Enright correctly adverted to, the death penalty has been abolished but it remains part of our Constitution. There was a suggestion that perhaps in times of war or on other occasions it could be resurrected. The legislation provides finally for the death of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>I always look with a certain awe, shock and horror at the way the death penalty is used in countries where it remains in existence. While it remains in countries such as China, it also remains in the free world in the United States. I know a little about the position in America in terms of the publicity arising from the exercise of the death penalty. The issue is more in the public domain in the US than in China. The death penalty is exercised in most states in America. Prisoners are put on death row having been convicted of a murder or murders and the horror of this is that in many instances they are held on death row for many years.</P>
      <P>That is one of the terrible spin-offs of the application of the death penalty in the US. I strongly urge the authorities there to look into their own hearts. They will not listen to a mere mortal such as myself but there is a strong enough voice in various countries, including Ireland, to which the US authorities might listen. I reflect on the terribleness of the death penalty, more particularly in the context of its use and application in the US. One is placed in a death cell and then brought to a room to receive a lethal injection. It might take a considerable time to descend into unconsciousness and finally death after lingering in one's death cell for ten, 15 or 20 years.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing Ireland finally to the position where the death penalty cannot be applied in any circumstances. The legislation provides for the amendment of the Constitution to delete references to the death penalty and to prohibit the reintroduction of the death penalty under any circumstances, even in time of war. The legislation provides for the deletion of references to capital cases in Article 13.6 in reflecting the current position regarding the abolition of the death penalty. The article deals with the commutation and remission of sentences and specifies that such powers cannot be used in capital cases, except by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation also provides for the deletion of Article 40.4.5, which makes the provision for<i> habeas corpus</i> proceedings in respect of a person who has been sentenced to death. The Bill provides for the inclusion of a specific provision in Article 15.5.2 to the effect that no law shall be enacted providing for a sentence of death with regard to the prohibition of the death penalty and an amendment to Article 28.3.3, the effect of which would be that the prohibition under the new Article 15.5.2 would continue to apply even in time of war. Article 28.3.3 allows for the Constitution to be overridden for the purpose of sec<Col N="855" /> uring public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>These latter provisions reflect the stand taken internationally by Ireland in its application of the sixth protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, which abolished the death penalty except in time of war, and its ratification, without reservation, of the second optional protocol to the United Nations International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which provides for the abolition of the death penalty even in time of war. That is what the people are being asked to do in this amendment to the Constitution on which they are required to adjudicate in an upcoming series of referenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister helpfully gave the background to the death penalty. He said it is almost 50 years since the death penalty was used in Ireland as the last execution took place in 1954. The Criminal Justice Act, 1964, abolished the death penalty for offences other than treason, capital murder and certain military offences. The death penalty was finally abolished in statute law under the Criminal Justice, Act, 1990, but not in constitutional law. I pay tribute to the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the constitutional review group which considered the death penalty provisions of the constitution. The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which reported in November 1998, recommended the deletion of the reference to capital cases in Article 13.6.</P>
    <P>The report of the constitutional review group in May 1996 recommended the deletion of Article 40.4.5º and a provision banning the reintroduction of the death penalty, including an appropriate amendment to Article 28.3.3º. The report of the Constitution Review Group succinctly set out its views on matters relating to death sentences. I pay tribute to the chairmen of both bodies and the individuals who produced these reports which are helpful not only in discussions about the death penalty, but many other matters relating to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I had the honour of being appointed by Mr. Seán Lemass to the 1966 constitutional review committee, a year after my election to the Dáil. The committee discussed much of what continues to be discussed in relation to the Constitution. However, much has been achieved since that time as a direct result of the farsightedness of a great and patriotic Irishman. It is also fair to point out that I was elected to the Dáil under the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass. He was in office for a short period before he stood down as Taoiseach. He then became a member of the 1966-67 constitutional review committee and I had the great honour and privilege of sitting with him on that committee. It was a hugely important experience for a young man and I have great recollections of his views on this and other subjects relating to the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I also welcome the nature of the debate and the contributions of Deputy Andrews and others. It is clear there is agreement among all parties, with the exception of a few individuals, that the death penalty is questionable as a deterrent, but barbaric and inhuman as an instrument. In many ways, it represents the antithesis of human rights.</P>
      <P>The passage of this legislation, which will allow for a constitutional referendum, is perhaps theoretical because nobody living in the real world would have expected the instrument of the death penalty to be used having regard to legislation passed previously and particularly the debate 11 years ago when capital punishment was abolished. The alteration of the Constitution to include a provision whereby no law may be enacted to allow for the introduction of the death penalty is welcome. However, I am not sure how close it is to reality or practicality.</P>
      <P>I wish to make three points and the first refers to capital murder. Over the years, sanction was reserved in the legal code whereby the death penalty could be used in certain circumstances, such as capital murder. That was abolished and our police force is largely unarmed. In his reply, will the Minister comment specifically on the release or otherwise of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe? This matter appears in the newspapers frequently as the Northern peace process progresses and Sinn Féin appears to become more active in national politics in the Republic. Given recent newspaper speculation and utterances on the part of certain Sinn Féin politicians, it is appropriate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform clears up any ambiguity or ambivalence that might surround the future detention of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe for the duration of their sentences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to missing women and the Chair did not intervene. I do not wish to question the Acting Chairman's ruling, but it is appropriate to mention the killing of a member of the Garda Síochána in the context of a constitutional change that will prevent a future Oireachtas, of whatever hue the people may ordain, from introducing a law that will <Col N="857" /> revert to the position that existed for many years regarding a sanction for capital murder. I disagree with the Acting Chairman, but I have made my point on the issue.</P>
      <P>My second point is equally appropriate regarding the removal of a sanction of capital murder in the case of the murder of a prison officer. As a Member of the House representing the people of Laois-Offaly, it is my right to mention the extraordinary situation that exists in Portlaoise Prison where a convicted criminal, Mr. John Gilligan, has, from the confines of his prison cell, issued threats to prison officers and their families. What sanction in law is open to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that this does not continue on the part of Mr. Gilligan or any other individual that might be convicted and held at the Minister's pleasure in my constituency? It is totally unacceptable that prison officers, who are employed as guardians of the State's places of detention, and their families should be subjected to intimidation, threats and undue pressure from Mr. John Gilligan, a convicted criminal who drew from the trial judge an extraordinary statement regarding the type of individual with whom we are dealing. It is totally unacceptable that this man, who lived a life of terror and intimidation in this city and beyond, should come to my constituency and continue in the same vein.</P>
      <P>Regarding our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States of America, I find the recent reintroduction of the death penalty in many US states repugnant. I agree with what Deputy Andrews said regarding our position on that, but I disagree with him when he describes himself as a mere Member of Parliament. He has had a distinguished career and served as a very capable and honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs. I hope that, in whatever style he represents the people in Parliament, he will continue to fight this battle and make his voice heard.</P>
      <P>I hope every Member joins him in ensuring we do everything in our power to persuade the President of the United States and various state governors to halt the inhuman and degrading treatment of many of their citizens caused by the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty. A constituency colleague, Deputy Fleming, mentioned the case of Roger Collins, and I agree with him on that. However, there are many other such people throughout the United States who are on death row and many of whom will suffer death at the hands of the state, which is a case of the state acting beyond the scope of the power vested in the state's leaders by the people. I congratulate groups like Amnesty International for their tireless work, energy and dedication over many years in highlighting instances throughout the world where the consequences of the barbaric death penalty can be seen periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that Ireland has a seat on the prestigious UN Security Council, I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs can convey to the American leadership, especially to President Bush, that we do not agree with the manner in which, under his juris<Col N="858" /> diction, the death penalty is applied regularly and with ease throughout the United States. I hope we can convey our displeasure to the US Ambassador. In this regard, I acknowledge the contribution towards the peace process of the current incumbent, Mr. Mike Sullivan, and wish him and his wife well when they depart our shores later this spring. I hope we convey to the new incumbent, Mr. Richard Egan, that we are not happy with the manner in which his country applies the death penalty and that we do all in our power to ensure we add our voice in strong terms to the opposition to the barbaric and inhuman treatment meted out to citizens, irrespective of their position in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom labhairt ar an ábhar seo mar is comhair dúinn sa Teach, má táimid ag cur ábhar ós comhair na ndaoine, díospóireacht a bheith againn ar an ábhar. Creidim go láidir san ábhar seo, sé sin, deireadh a chur leis an píonós bháis. The death penalty is a major denial of human rights. It is for that reason I wish to speak on the subject. Our Constitution defends our rights. It has rights which are enumerated and which are not. Above all, surely the right to life and, in this case, the right to life of serious offenders, is something which needs to be protected. As a modern democracy, we should promote all these fundamental rights. Life is a basic right and to remove that right, for whatever reason, and to include that in our Constitution is cruel, inhuman, degrading and does not reflect the modern thinking of the people or the way we respect life.</P>
      <P>It is an issue of relevance not just for our Constitution but is a human rights issue throughout the world. The abolition of the death penalty is in keeping with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights of 1948 and with many other declarations and treaties signed since then. The fact the death penalty has not been used in Ireland in almost 50 years shows our thinking and belief. The fact the last execution took place here in 1954, that the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, abolished the death penalty for offences other than treason, capital murder and certain military offences, and that the death penalty was abolished in statute law under the Criminal Justice Act shows our forward thinking and belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is our Constitution which guides all our legislation. It protects the rights of the people. For that reason, I am pleased that we are putting it to the people not only to decide whether to remove the death penalty from the Constitution but also that a more positive recommendation is included that the sanction cannot be reintroduced again by statute. The proposals to be put to the people will ensure that the laws changed in this House can be given the imprimatur of the people by having the Constitution changed. Recommendations in this regard from the All Party Committee on the Constitution and <Col N="859" /> the Constitution Review Group show that Ireland is a forward thinking country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about those countries which still maintain the death penalty. Using our position on the Security Council and as a forward thinking democracy, we should be able to give the lead to those other countries. There is no good reason to maintain the death penalty. It is not used in many countries and, where it is used, it is not of any benefit to society and there is no solid evidence that it deters violent crimes. There is evidence in the US to show that, where it is implemented, it is neither fair nor consistent. Evidence gathered by organisations such as Amnesty International show that various deciding factors come into play which have nothing to do with the crime and which may have more to do with the race of the perpetrator, the social and economic status of the victim and the location of the crime. These elements should not be taken into account when a person's life is at stake. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is not the type of justice system which should be used anywhere in the world, and we should give the lead in this.</P>
    <P>The death penalty never allows for a mistake. It is irrevocable and we have evidence that the innocent have been executed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy can make that point in his contribution. I was about to come to that same point because I was speaking in the context of the whole right to life which is well protected in Irish thinking. When a person has been executed it is irrevocable. Innocents have been executed and there is no going back from <Col N="860" /> that. I am seriously concerned that, on the day we are doing this, in another European country, like us a signatory of so many treaties, they are introducing euthanasia. It is a very regressive step which flies in the face of the right to life of citizens the world over. I am also concerned that, as we are in the process of passing the Children Bill, 1999, which goes to great lengths to ensure we do not detain children or juveniles, except as a very last resort, the death penalty still exists for juvenile offenders in some countries. That flies in the face of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is very worrying that in the last ten years at least six countries have implemented the death penalty against young offenders who committed their crimes when they were under the age of 18. Those countries are Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and, even more worryingly, the USA. Debate has taken place here about the role of the USA and its attitude to the death penalty and it is particularly heinous in relation to young people who should be given an opportunity to reform and to look forward to the rest of their lives. The direction we are taking through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue's, Children Bill, 1999, is one that will protect children, young people, even their victims and will ensure that they are not subjected to detention, let alone the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Already half the countries of the world have abolished the death penalty, either in law or in practice, but there are still 90 countries which retain it. Various countries have signed declarations and statutes, so there is obviously a consensus throughout most of the world that the death penalty should not be employed. There are many countries which have it on their books but do not use it. That the consensus is there is one thing, the fact that they should remove it from their books is quite another, and we are taking a lead in that direction today. Not having it in our laws will mean that no Member of this House would ever wish to introduce it and the people will welcome an opportunity to remove it from the Constitution. They will also welcome the opportunity to include a subsection to say that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law providing for the imposition of the death penalty. Therefore, not only is it a removal, it is a positive statement to the effect that we abhor the death penalty, ar son cearta na ndaonna, and I hope that we as a modern democracy, as members of the Security Council of the UN can give that lead, don domhain ar fad.</P>

      <P>I am glad I was in the House to hear Deputy Gay Mitchell give the shortest speech of his political career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment, not only on the debate that we are having here today, but generally on the provisions for the referendum. Clearly a referendum to alter the Constitution is a major weapon and instrument of our democracy. It is not <Col N="861" /> something that exists automatically and in western Europe there are 17 democracies, some of which have no facility for referenda. The Netherlands has never had a referendum while Ireland, compared to other countries, has had a high number. It is a fundamental part of our democracy and is the people deciding the constitutional framework within which we all must live.</P>
    <P>There are two issues to examine when approaching any referendum proposed by any Government. One is the substance of the referendum and the other is the process, as in the mechanism or the procedure, by which it will be put to the people. It is disappointing that on neither count does this Government score. The death penalty has almost no relevance on any practical level; it has been eliminated to all intents and purposes and is not allowed in law. There is no coherent campaign or argument for its return, there is no demand for this referendum and no one could envisage there being such a demand in the foreseeable future. If one were to ask any member of the public what issue they would choose on which to have a constitutional referendum, not one of them would be likely to choose this. If the Government is serious, and we have heard a certain amount of cant about protecting lives, I suggest it might be better positioned if it looked at the argument being presented today by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who cogently argue that the right of access to health care should be enshrined in the Constitution. People die because that right is denied them and we live in the country with the lowest life expectancy in Europe. That is a devastating fact, particularly for those families who suffer the loss of a loved one simply because that person could not access health care. Sadly, that is not being addressed by this Government, yet the constitutional right of access to health care could save lives and would do more to protect life than simply removing this particular section of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>A point ably made by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, relates to discrimination, in particular, towards those who suffer disability. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, gave a clear indication on this issue. I refer to the proposal of the Constitution Review Group that all persons should be held equal before the law, that no person should be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on grounds of sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, colour, language, culture or religion. That the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, as it turned out, was simply flying a kite is very disappointing. People thought there was at least the possibility that a change could be made to the Constitution that would have a real impact on the quality of life. The Taoiseach made it very clear that that was not going to happen, that it was not going to be in this tranche of referenda and people who experience discrimination, and would <Col N="862" /> like to have their rights enshrined in law, are to be told to wait in line.</P>
    <P>There are many, many amendments which could be made to the Constitution and we have a series of reports, most importantly from the expert group on the Constitution, which went sedulously through it to find where the fault lines were and where the needs lay. It is a pity I have to say this now in relation to a possible future referendum &ndash; the Taoiseach is on the hook trying to devise an anti-abortion clause to put into the Constitution &ndash; by an amendment to be put to the people. The expert review group on the Constitution made it very clear that that was not the way to go. The way to go is to legislate in line with the X case. This was not an expert group with any agenda, it was not on the pro choice side, anything but. In fact, the current EU Commissioner, David Byrne, was one of the members, and no one would see him as a proponent of the pro choice stance. It was a practical, coherent presentation made by experts about our Constitution, what needs to be done and what needs to be left alone. It is most unfortunate that the Taoiseach is running with this proposal. We do not know what the proposal is but presumably we will find out at some point in the future, unless he is to change his mind.</P>
    <P>We should have the opportunity for serious debate on a resolution about issues that relate to the quality of our daily lives but this proposal does not provide such an opportunity. We are not getting the substance that should be part of any referendum proposals, and neither does it appear that we will get the process. When this debate began there was a helter-skelter approach by the Government whereby everything would be done and dusted before the public was fully conscious of what was happening. That approach has slowed down now, however, and I am glad there has been a deceleration. Experience tells us the trend in referendum campaigns has been for a low and falling turnout, and for high and growing confusion among the public. That should alert us to the fact that we need to address the ways in which these proposals are presented to the people. I would like to hear more from the Government on how it intends to address these problems. Time and information are absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>The third component is the kind of stimulation which in the past was generated by political parties engaging fully in debate, and Governments being able to avail of public funding in order to spearhead such debate. The McKenna judgment has set down parameters which have changed the nature of such debates. The fact that has happened, however, should not alter the necessity for ensuring that there is time, information and stimulation of debate so that people are fully informed.</P>
    <P>I do not think we will get a debate on the death penalty because people will not stand up and argue in favour of it. It is not an issue and I would be very surprised if it became one. I have been <Col N="863" /> proved wrong in the past but generally speaking people will say that this is not something that is causing conflict or which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was very taken with the US penal system and styles of punishment there. He came back with the idea of zero tolerance which he has not really lived up to. It is true that, generally speaking, in Ireland we abhor the American penal system and its punishments encompassing the death penalty which is anathema to us. This is particularly so as we have seen people being murdered by paramilitary groups over an extended period. Death has not been far away from us as a result of that kind of ongoing criminality over the years and so we do not believe fire should be fought with fire. We should deal with these issues in a different way. The peace process stemming from the Good Friday Agreement has shown there are other ways to deal with political violence and murder. The death penalty is not the way to deal with violent attacks and murders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply, I will deal with some of the points raised by the main spokespersons. Deputy Timmins referred to the situation in other countries. The enactment of this legislation is the best example we can give to the international community at large of where we stand on the death penalty. That we will remove all reference to the death penalty from our Constitution is a signal to the world that we strongly disapprove of it. It is a very relevant statement by a civilised society which has matured enough to recognise that there are other appropriate sanctions which may be imposed when people breach the criminal law of the land.</P>
      <P>The ratification, in 1993, of the Second Option Protocol to the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights has already committed us not to reintroduce the death penalty. Nonetheless, in our Constitution the death penalty is still referred to for <i>habeus corpus</i> proceedings and for purposes of commutation by the President of a death sentence. The power still exists in the Constitution for the death penalty to be reintroduced in time of war or in the case of an emergency. In short, the provision which we are putting forward will ensure that all references to the death penalty will finally be deleted from the Constitution so that it will, in effect, be unconstitutional for any future Government or Legislature to bring forward legislation which would reintroduce the death penalty. If the people pass this referendum, the death penalty may only be reintroduced should the people themselves decide that it is appropriate to amend the Constitution again in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the question of a world-wide abolition of the death penalty. Ireland has already expressed support for a Swedish proposal to abolish the death penalty. <Col N="864" /> If that proposal, which was made in the Council of Europe, is eventually carried, more than 30 European countries will no longer apply the death penalty in any circumstances. That will be a strong message to other countries to consider following the European model in this respect.</P>
    <P>We must always be careful to ensure that information which is conveyed to the House is accurate. In this context, while I have always had the greatest respect for Deputy McGahon and find his contributions in the House very entertaining, I must say that he is exaggerating to no little extent when he speaks of 200 murder and manslaughter cases every year in Ireland. The number of recorded murders has been contained for 1998 and 1999 &ndash; the two most recent years for which we have records &ndash; at 38 per year. That compares to 43 murders in 1995 and 42 in 1996.</P>
    <P>There has also been a steady decrease in manslaughter cases since the Government took office. In 1997 there were 15 cases of manslaughter, 13 in 1998, and nine in 1999.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to all Deputies for welcoming the Bill and for their constructive comments. The removal of the references in the Constitution to the death penalty reflects the reality of the situation that has pertained in Irish law since 1990, and in practice since 1954. The inclusion of a specific provision prohibiting the reintroduction of the death penalty and the amendment to the override provisions of Article 28.3.3 will give constitutional protection to our obligations under Protocol VI to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the Second Option Protocol to the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. In respect of the UN Protocol, the possibility of entering a reservation to allow for use of the death penalty in time of war was open to states only at the time of ratification. When ratifying that agreement in 1993 the Government declined to avail of that possibility and so in honouring our international obligations we are precluded from using the death penalty, even in time of war. Aside from those important international obligations, it is the Government's fundamental belief that the death penalty is, in any event, intrinsically wrong and that there should not be an exception to that principle, even in time of war. The Bill is a very public and positive manifestation of that belief.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as I regret that Deputy McGahon's comments were inaccurate, I also believe Deputy McManus's comments about us having the lowest life expectancy in Europe is equally inaccurate.</P>

The substance of the debate on Committee Stage relates to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment contained in the Schedule to the Bill. The sections of the Bill are merely technical. Therefore, in accordance with long standing practice, the sections are postponed until consideration of the Schedule has been completed. As I understand there is general agreement to this proposal, I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to formally move, in accordance with Standing Order 114, that consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the Schedule has been disposed of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to open the debate on the Second Stage of the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001. The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on 17 July 1998. The Statute provides for the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court, in relationship with the United Nations system, with jurisdiction over persons in respect of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. The Statute of the Court is an international agreement which will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states <Col N="869" /> have become party to it. Ireland signed the Statute on 7 October 1998. To date, 139 states have signed the Statute and 29 have ratified it or acceded to it.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court is something which Ireland has advocated for many years and the Government took an active part in the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Rome at which the statute was adopted. The Government has also participated and continues to participate in the Preparatory Commission, whose task it is to prepare proposals for practical arrangements for the establishment and coming into operation of the court. The European Union is a strong supporter of the early establishment of the International Criminal Court. In pursuit of this objective, it led international efforts to encourage as many states as possible to sign the Rome Statute before the 31 December 2000 deadline for signature and has undertaken to assist countries associated with the Union to ratify or accede to the Statute. By ratifying the Statute, we will again signal Ireland's ongoing commitment to the court.</P>
    <P>Over the past 100 years, great progress has been made in the fields of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, in Europe, the European Convention on Human Rights all provide guarantees of respect for human rights, including during time of armed conflict. There have also been significant developments in international humanitarian law, that is, the rules specifically intended to protect persons in time of armed conflict.</P>
    <P>The four Geneva Conventions of 1947 deal with the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, the Treatment of Prisoners of War and the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, while the two Protocols thereto, adopted in 1977, relate to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts and of Non-International Armed Conflicts respectively.</P>
    <P>It is clearly accepted that even in a time of war, there are basic rules that must be observed. However, repeated violations of these rules highlight a significant flaw in their operation: the lack of an adequate enforcement mechanism. This may be appropriately illustrated by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide which was adopted in 1948. Article 6 of the convention allows for trial by the courts of the state where an act of genocide occurs or by &ldquo;such international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction with respect to those Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its jurisdiction&rdquo;. When the UN General Assembly adopted this convention in 1948, it also invited the International Law Commission to &ldquo;study the desirability and possibility of establishing a <Col N="870" /> judicial organ for the trial of persons charged with genocide&rdquo;. This was found to be both desirable and possible and a draft statute was prepared in 1951 and revised in 1953. However, it was not until 1989, in response to a request by Trinidad and Tobago, that the General Assembly asked the International Law Commission to resume work on a statute for an international criminal court. In 1994 the International Law Commission submitted its draft statute to the General Assembly. Since then, swift progress was made.</P>
    <P>The General Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court to a consider major substantive issues arising from the draft and this committee met twice in 1995. After considering the committee's report, the General Assembly created the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court to draw up a draft text for submission to a diplomatic conference. The preparatory committee held its final session and completed the drafting of the text in March and April of 1998. The United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court was held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998 and the result was the Statute which we now seek to ratify.</P>
    <P>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is the culmination of 50 years of work on the matter. During this period genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression have repeatedly been perpetrated in various parts of the world, despite the existence of instruments of international law outlawing such acts. The existence of international agreements for the prevention and punishment of such crimes provides little comfort for the victims if the perpetrators of such acts never face trial. However, it has often been difficult to bring such persons to trial. They may enjoy immunity as a result of their official capacity. Furthermore, the political will may not exist to bring them to trial or the institutions of the state may have collapsed completely. The establishment of the international criminal court is an attempt to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>Having determined that the situations in the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the early 1990s constituted a threat to international peace and security, the United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, set up two tribunals to ensure that the perpetrators of the atrocities committed at that time should not escape punishment. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have made great progress, but their jurisdiction is limited to the particular geographical areas concerned and is subject to certain tune constraints.</P>
    <P>The international criminal court, once established, will have much broader jurisdiction. In addition, the creation of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals is always open to criticism. The setting up of tribunals for some circumstances and not for others <Col N="871" /> will always be questioned. Those standing trial will question the independence of the tribunal and claim to be the victims of &ldquo;victors' justice&rdquo;. <i>Ad hoc</i> tribunals can have little deterrent effect because nobody can ever be certain that such a tribunal will in fact be established. Furthermore, there is invariably a delay between the commission of the crimes and the establishment of the tribunal. All of these difficulties inherent in <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals are addressed by the establishment of a permanent international criminal court. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides for a permanent independent institution within the United Nations system. It should not be possible for any state to interfere with the court in the execution of its function and it will be difficult for those who will still cry &ldquo;victors' justice&rdquo; to claim any legitimacy.</P>
    <P>The statute adopted at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Rome is a comprehensive document consisting of 13 Parts and 128 Articles. The statute deals with the establishment of the court, its jurisdiction and the general principles of criminal law to be applied. It sets out the composition of the court and its administration, the procedures for investigation, prosecution and trial, the penalties which can be imposed on conviction, and provides for appeals. There is an obligation on the states parties to co-operate with the court and provision is also made for the enforcement of the judgments of the court and for the carrying out of sentences. The statute also provides for an assembly of states parties and for the financing of the court.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the statute sets out that &ldquo;the most serious crimes of concern to the international community&rdquo;, namely, the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression are within the jurisdiction of the court. The court will exercise jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed after the date on which statute enters into force. The court will, however, not exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until a provision is adopted by the states parties defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. A review conference is to be held seven years after the entry into force of the statute and a provision governing the crime of aggression may be adopted at this conference.</P>
    <P>The definitions of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes contained in the statute codify existing international law. The definition of genocide is identical to that contained in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It involves the following acts when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group: killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part; imposing measures to <Col N="872" /> prevent birth within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</P>
    <P>The concept of crimes against humanity also embraces particularly serious violations of human rights &ndash; such as murder, extermination, slavery, forcible transfer of population, unlawful imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution of a group, enforced disappearance and apartheid &ndash; when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population. Crimes against humanity can be committed both in time of war and of peace. War crimes include grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Further examples of war crimes, for the purpose of the Rome Statute include attacks during armed conflict against civilians and against humanitarian and peacekeeping missions; attacks which will cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the environment; attacks directed against religious, educational and cultural buildings; pillaging; rape; sexual slavery and enforced prostitution; and the use of child soldiers.</P>
    <P>Members will agree it is not pleasant to think and speak about such crimes. For those of us lucky enough not to have experienced such horrific circumstances, it is difficult to imagine what it must be like for the victims of such crimes. However, in the past ten years we have witnessed the commission of these crimes in different parts of the world with shocking frequency. It is our duty to do all within our power to ensure that such crimes are not committed again and that when they are, those responsible are punished. It would be unrealistic to believe that the creation of a court would entirely prevent the occurrence of such events in the future. The court will undoubtedly have a deterrent effect, but there will always be individuals and governments who will carry out such horrific crimes. The difference will be that they can no longer confidently expect to escape punishment.</P>
    <P>Once established, the court will sit at The Hague in the Netherlands. In addition to the court, an assembly of states parties will be established when the statute comes into force. This assembly will consist of one representative from each state party. The assembly will elect 18 full-time judges who will be &ldquo;persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity&rdquo; and possess the qualifications required in their respective states for appointment to the highest judicial offices. As is to be expected, the judges will be independent in the performance of their functions. There may not be more than one judge of the same nationality and, in selecting judges, the states parties will take into account the need for the membership of the court to represent the principal legal systems of the world, equitable geographical representation and a fair representation of female and male judges. There will also be an independent Office of the Prosecutor and the prosecutor, like the judges, will be elected by the Assembly of States Parties by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>A situation in which a crime appears to have been committed may be referred to the pros<Col N="873" /> ecutor of the court by a state party or by the Security Council of the United Nations acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter or the prosecutor may initiate an investigation. Where a state party has referred a situation to the prosecutor or the prosecutor has initiated the investigation, the court may exercise its jurisdiction if the state on the territory of which the alleged crime was committed is a party to the statute or if the person accused of the crime is a national of a state party. States parties are obliged to co-operate fully with the court in its investigation and prosecution of crimes within its jurisdiction. The statute contains numerous provisions governing the conduct of a trial and the rights of an accused which will ensure that due process will be observed.</P>
    <P>The court will be complementary to national legal systems. The primary obligation to investigate crimes covered by the statute and to prosecute the perpetrators will remain with the states parties. Only where the state party in question is unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate the crimes alleged or to prosecute the accused person may the court exercise its jurisdiction. In this way, the court provides an additional means of administering justice where serious international crimes are committed without detracting from existing domestic structures which states may have already put in place.</P>
    <P>In addition to its function in electing judges and the prosecutor, the Assembly of States Parties will also be responsible for the budget of the court and will provide management oversight to the president of the court, the prosecutor and the registrar regarding the administration of the court. Draft rules of procedure and evidence were adopted by the preparatory commission for the court in June last year. These provide further detail on the way the court will function. It is envisaged that the assembly will adopt these rules and the financial rules and regulations. The court will be funded by contributions from states parties and by the United Nations and may also accept voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the description I have just given, the Rome Statute is an extensive document which creates a substantial new international institution with the power to administer justice where serious crimes have been committed. Article 34.1 of our Constitution provides that &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.&rdquo;. I have been advised by the Attorney General that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides for the administration of justice outside the terms of this constitutional provision and that, consequently, an amendment of the Constitution is needed before the State may ratify the statute. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution by the addition of a new section 9 to Article 29 of the Constitution allowing the State to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This provision will read as fol<Col N="874" /> lows: &ldquo;The State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on the 17th day of July, 1998.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment of the Constitution must always be undertaken with care. Our Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, is our basic law and the foundation on which our State is built. For this reason, when amending the Constitution, the effect should be considered of the proposed amendment on the Constitution as a whole. The amendment proposed in this Bill will complement existing provisions of the Constitution. Udder the heading, &ldquo;International Relations&rdquo;, Article 29 begins by affirming Ireland's &ldquo;devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality,&rdquo; continues by affirming our &ldquo;adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination&rdquo; and then states that &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By ratifying the Rome Statute and participating in the International Criminal Court we will demonstrate our belief in the principles set out at the beginning of Article 29 of the Constitution. The Rome Statute will bring into being a permanent court based on the idea of international justice and morality and with the power to enforce generally recognised principles of international law in the furtherance of peace. We adopted our Constitution, containing this devotion to peace and justice, only a few years before one of the most destructive wars the world has ever seen. During that war genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression were carried out. The efforts made in the intervening period were not sufficient to prevent the recurrence of such terrible crimes. We hope the establishment of the International Criminal Court will change this pattern. This court will have the power to enforce the principles by which we promised to conduct our international relations over 60 years ago. I, therefore, propose that we amend our Constitution to enable us to ratify the Rome Statute as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope I have succeeded in demonstrating the importance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. As recent conflicts have shown, the existence of laws prohibiting genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are of little use if there is not a method of ensuring that persons who commit such crimes are brought to trial. The International Criminal Court will at last provide a permanent and independent enforcement mechanism. By amending our Constitution as proposed in this Bill, we will take the first and most important step towards ratification of the Rome Statute and ultimate establishment of the International Criminal Court. I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael wholeheartedly supports the ratification of the Rome Statute to <Col N="875" /> establish the International Criminal Court. In the past I have been extremely critical of the delay by the Government in bringing forward the ratification procedures. As was mentioned by the Minister, agreement was reached at the UN conference in Rome almost three years ago to set up the International Criminal Court. All member states of the European Union agreed to complete their ratification procedures by the end of last year and they urged other states to do likewise. My reaction to the Government Bill to amend the Constitution to permit ratification is that it is better late than never.</P>
      <P>My main concern with the ratification procedure is that amending the Constitution alone will not be sufficient to enable Ireland to become a founding member of the International Criminal Court. It is clear from replies to parliamentary questions and from comments made by the Taoiseach that implementation legislation will be required for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the Rome Statute. The type of legislation needed will be similar to the International War Crimes Tribunals Act, 1998. I want the Minister to outline in his reply what is happening with that legislation. The Taoiseach made clear that other administrative measures may need to be adopted for Ireland to meet all its obligations under the statute. I have raised these issues in the Dáil a number of times. Last October the Taoiseach wrote and told me he had asked for all this work to be completed at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I raise the issue now again because there may be a tendency to shuffle off the responsibility to another Minister. It would probably be more appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with some of the legislative aspects, although I am not sure about the administrative measures. I do not know what administrative measures the Taoiseach was talking about. There is no evidence that steps have been taken in relation to the other legislative or administrative measures. There should be no further delay on the part of the Government even after the referendum process has been competed and that would be a focus of delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The administration costs for the Moriarty tribunal, including counsel fees, are met from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach. Issues in this regard which may be raised from time to time by officers of the tribunal are dealt with in the normal course of business by my Department which is also responsible for processing requests for payments from the Vote.</P>
      <P>From time to time there have been requests by each tribunal for records and files and my Department has submitted these. It will continue to co-operate with the tribunals in making available any records sought. Normally these requests are received by the Secretary General and assigned to the appropriate departmental official by him. All are dealt with on a highly confidential basis as required by the tribunals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Civil Service staff of the Department who deal exclusively with these requests or do the political staff get involved on occasions? Does the Taoiseach confine co-operation to requests made by the Moriarty tribunal or do the civil servants and political staff on occasion volunteer documents which they consider relevant even if not requested?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may recall that in the early months of the Administration his former programme manager undertook a trawl of the files regarding the award of the second GMS phone licence in the Department of Public Enterprise. This would have been done with the Taoiseach's knowledge and, perhaps, on his instruction. Was this related to the Moriarty tribunal? Was such a trawl undertaken following a request for information from the Moriarty tribunal? If not, did any material emerge which the Taoiseach, the Secretary General or the Minister for Public Enterprise should have been forwarded because of its relevance to that tribunal?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check, but I have no recollection of files on either of the matters being trawled for in my Department. An entire examination of files on the health issue was undertaken in my Department at the beginning of this Administration. I believe that I now know the issue the Deputy is interested in. That examination of files was carried out on a health issue relating to one of my former staff in the first week or two of the Government coming in. I do not remember any such check related to the GSM licence, but I will check.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of a request for files from the Moriarty tribunal or the Flood tribunal, can I ask the Taoiseach if the practice is that the relevant official, such as the Secretary General or someone appointed by the Secretary General, takes the request, identifies the material in question, sources it and any related matter, and refers it directly to either of the tribunals? Is the Taoiseach saying that at no stage is either he or a political adviser appointed by him consulted on the appropriateness of sending material to such tribunals? Did the Taoiseach have no direct or political involvement in censoring, editing or withholding information that the civil servant in question, acting on behalf of the Secretary General, would have deemed relevant to the request of the particular tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is a categorical yes, as the Deputy outlines the question. Many, possibly most, of the replies to the tribunals would not be seen by me. Perhaps this has happened on one or two occasions when the matter was directly relevant to me. However it is normal that such matters are dealt with by the Civil Service. I believe that most Departments would operate in a similar fashion, but am certain this is the case in my Department. If the matter in question concerns past files and Government records, I have no involvement. I have heard from time to time that there were long or major letters to my Department but would have no involvement with them. I have never sought to find out what the tribunals were checking into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying the practice is that a senior civil servant, including the Secretary General, receives the request, evaluates it in terms of the relevant material, and decides to send that material direct to the tribunal while the Taoiseach is neither involved nor informed in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I am not involved in those <Col N="879" /> cases, nor have I sought to become involved. There have been an enormous number of files and issues but I have not been involved in any way either with requests from the Secretary of the Government, or the Secretary General of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Many of the areas in the Government's action programme for which my Department is responsible were subsequently reflected in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As is clear from the latest PPF progress report and the progress report of July last on the Government's programme, which are both available in the Oireachtas Library, a considerable amount of the undertakings in both programmes have either been already delivered upon or are well on the way to being implemented.</P>
      <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of implementation can be broadly summarised as follows. Supporting the development and implementation of policy in a co-ordinated way across Departments, including servicing the activities of Cabinet committees in respect of Northern Ireland, European affairs, infrastructure and social inclusion; taking a lead role in respect of Civil Service modernisation, including regulatory reform; supports for the social partnership process, including the steering group on basic income; NESC and NESF, including national progress indicators and the action plan for the information society. They also include specific responsibilities in relation to Oireachtas reform, the re-establishment of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the review of the law offices and the implementation of the recommendations of the McCracken tribunal. I have reported to the House on all these areas in recent times and I do not think it would be the most efficient use of Question Time to repeat all the details here again.</P>
      <P>Another area, however, for which my Department is responsible is the National Implementation Body which was established on foot of the 4 December 2000 agreed adjustment to the terms of the PPF. The purpose of the body is to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF and, in that context, it obviously considers the potential implications for the PPF of any ongoing disputes of special national importance. However, responsibility for the resolution of disputes continues to rest primarily with the parties concerned and with the pre-existing industrial relations machinery of the State, as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the progress that has been made in the health services, not in terms of the amount of money that has been lavished upon them which is not in doubt? How does he reconcile the increases in funding with the stinging critique published today by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul about what <Col N="881" /> it describes as the chaos in the health services? Does the Taoiseach believe there is a problem in the health services? Does he believe the problem is more than just about money? If so, what action does he propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have resourced the health service adequately and I do not believe we have reached the plateau of resourcing. I agree with Deputy Quinn that money is not the only solution to problems in the health service. At the same time, I do not believe that the health service is in crisis or in tatters. The health service is continually improving in terms of its output, the number of bed days, the number of out-patients, and the number of procedures. The increase in staff numbers, including up to 300 consultants, is positive but there is clearly more to be done on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>The manpower policy published one month back following an enormous amount of work needs to be negotiated and implemented. There will be much negotiation required to extend the hospital day and to extend facilities and services. I have long believed that costly medical procedures cannot be done in a seven hour day. However, the situation cannot change overnight but must be negotiated. Accident and emergency services is many hospitals are still deficient. There are plans to rebuild or relocate these areas in many hospitals. This has happened in many hospitals but many are still not up to the standard required. This year's capital programme again devotes enormous resources to solving a number of problems.</P>
      <P>All of these issues, including the sub-committees and other work which the Minister for Health and Children outlines to the House on a regular basis, must be encompassed in the framework document. In that way, we can build on the enormous improvements made in terms of capital equipment, service provision etc., over the coming years. We must continue to improve resources in these areas for some years yet. Improvements are not only required in terms of staffing numbers; they are also required on the administrative side, not in terms of the war between medical and administrative staff but in terms of developing procedures which will provide for longer and more meaningful working days. These changes, which comprise a fundamental part of the strategy, must be negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who has professional knowledge of medical accountancy and political experience as a former Minister for Finance, how can the Taoiseach reconcile what he has just said with the announcement on today's &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; to the effect that the Department of Finance has effectively blocked the appointment of an additional 1,000 consultants which most people, including those on the Medical Manpower Forum, would argue are necessary? Does the Taoiseach accept it is very difficult for ordinary people to hear that £60 million can, on the <Col N="882" /> one hand, be promised to the GAA albeit in a good cause, without necessitating the passage of a single piece of paper through the Department of Finance, while, on the other, the Department can block the appointment of 1,000 consultants whose appointment could save lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already far exceeded the recommendations of the Tierney report, which is only a few years old, in terms of the recruitment of consultants. Some 270 consultants have been appointed in a short period of time. The Medical Manpower Forum report states that many more consultants are required and I agree with that. However, we had a position until recently where accident and emergency consultants were not available after 6 p.m. in our hospitals. While some improvements have been made in this area, it is ludicrous that such services are not widely available. The consultants are not entirely to blame for this as negotiations are necessary when people are asked to work different hours to those which have prevailed for hundreds of years. The recommendations of the Medical Manpower Forum must be implemented and they, together, with the recommendations of the strategy due to be published this summer and implemented over a definite period, will result in continued improvements in our health service. Those improvements will cost money. I have supported and argued for such improvements because I have had significant experience with health boards, apart from my former paid position in hospitals, to recognise that such improvements are necessary and that they must be resourced. We have not yet reached a plateau fundamental issues remain to be addressed and the Medical Manpower Forum and the health strategy will offer a sound base on which to proceed.</P>
      <P>Recent announcements of massive increases in terms of capital equipment have been made in Portlaoise, Cork and elsewhere. Some £100 million has been spent in this area; expenditure on the new extension at St. Vincent's Hospital is not far off that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but we are discussing the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, of which health is a major element. The Department of Finance has vetoed the appointment of an additional 1,000 consultants. The Taoiseach just indicated his support for these appointments and acknowledged that additional resources will be required for that purpose. Does the Taoiseach understand the public's frustration and anger that the Department of Finance is all-powerful in blocking the appointment of consultants necessary to save lives but is powerless in terms of the Taoiseach giving money to the <Col N="883" /> GAA? There is an incomprehension and anger among the public, not because the GAA is receiving money &ndash; good luck to it and any other sporting organisation which receives funding &ndash; but that another group of people in society, whose lives are at risk, are being denied money by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's argument does not stand up. The budget of the Department of Health and Children has increased from £2.5 billion to more than £5 billion in a few years. The Department's capital programme, the implementation of which is ongoing, involves the allocation of enormous capital resources of the order of £2 billion, provided for the first time in the national development plan, together with ongoing increases in the non-pay side. The new health strategy which is not covered by the PPF is being pursued. The bed capacity in acute and non-acute settings is being pursued under the PPF and improvements are also being made in a range of other areas, details of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Between now and 2006, the provisions of the national development plan must be implemented. Projects are already on the drawing board and the Department is being facilitated to proceed with these far quicker than previously. However, some health issues are not merely issues of resources although they may entail indirect costs as negotiations proceed. The Department of Finance has increased funding to the Department of Health and Children by 100% in under four years, an enormous increase by international standards.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that anyone believes it is worse. People on waiting lists always feel aggrieved; if they are on a week-long list, they still feel they should be seen sooner. However, improvements in terms of buildings, equipment, the range of services, the new Eastern Regional Health Authority and strategic planning are progressing steadily. I agree with Deputy Quinn that the consultative document on the additional staff and the framework document must be implemented. That will require huge resources and will not happen overnight.</P>

      <P>Some 270 positions have been approved, including additional accident and emergency department positions. The Department of Finance wants to see changes in the working day and staffing levels in hospitals. Essentially, it wants to see some return in terms of productivity and that is not unreasonable. Comhairle na nOspidéal is filling posts as they are approved but it is not feasible to simply appoint a <Col N="884" /> further 1,000 consultants in one go. The appointment of 1,000 consultants does not merely involve the appointment of 1,000 people; ancillary services and resources must also be provided. The structure of the health service must be improved and the health service itself does not argue otherwise. The framework document, due to be published mid-summer, will be considered by the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware of the widespread concern, particularly among young couples, at the lack of child care facilities in this country. The provision of child care facilities was a primary concern highlighted by ICTU, IBEC and other social partners, including the voluntary and community pillar, in the negotiation of the PPF. Is the Taoiseach aware that some 85% of the funding provided for this purpose to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not been spent? I refer the Taoiseach to recent questions tabled by Deputy McGrath seeking details of the total allocation and expenditure in this area and details on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>On at least two occasions last year, the Minister made very high profile announcements of major investments in child care. That is all mythology. Child care facilities have not been provided. The money was returned last year on the departmental balances. Approximately £3 million of the £20 million under one heading was spent. The same is happening this year to the extent that the Minister for Finance in his prudence at the end of the first quarter cut back the allocation because it would not have been spent. Will the Taoiseach look at the commitments to child care under the PPF which were supposed to be delivered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask him why there is such little progress in his area of responsibility? I put it to the Taoiseach that the PPF is becoming frayed around the edges for many reasons, including the fact that the commitment to issues other than tax reduction and pay are being fulfilled in a very loose fashion, and many of them are not being fulfilled at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can pursue the figures directly with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the PPF, the health boards have been provided with financial supports for a number of areas. The money is provided to a number of health boards which will distribute it separately. I believe the Deputy is referring to the direct grants to agencies under the PPF. Given that practically no money was being provided to community child care facilities throughout the country, it was agreed last year under the PPF that £40 million would be provided to help existing schemes. It took time for a number of these community child care schemes to get up and running. Under the national development plan, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to <Col N="885" /> develop child care facilities in the coming years. The objectives of the new resources are to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities. If the take-up on the money has been slow, that is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because the resources have been made available. Many of the community child care facilities are almost totally funded by the State either directly through the health boards or by way of straight community grants. I saw a statement recently where the Minister allocated a further £5 million.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why the resources are not being fully utilised. Under the PPF the resources promised have been surpassed at this stage. I will check the matter with the Minister because, following the initial start-up period, facilities should be set up for seeking grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's comments and agree with him that an allocation of £250 million for child care purposes to be paid by way of grant through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems a decent commitment to child care. However, the problem is that this is just an estimate. The money is supposed to roll out over three years but less than 15% of what was allocated was spent last year. As the summer months approach, no progress is being made this year either. While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform makes frequent announcements about extra allocations for child care purposes, the money is not drawn down county by county.</P>
      <P>There is something seriously wrong here. I say in all sincerity to the Taoiseach that this is one of the problems with his Administration. On the one hand, the health budget has been doubled, while in most parts of the country the service is actually worse, therefore, the spending is not effective. In the area of child care the plans and money are in place. However, the Minister does not seem to be able to allocate the resources and the money rolls back into the Exchequer at the end of the year. The Taoiseach has a serious &ldquo;can do&rdquo; problem in getting things done right across the range from public transport to health and child care. This is the biggest problem facing the Administration. I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a huge breakdown in Government between theory and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered Deputy Quinn in regard to the health issue. There are more people, more bed days, more patient facilities and there is more throughput in hospitals right across the board. It is unfair on the Department and the health boards to say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two aspects to the child care question. Given that the health boards provide financial support to pre-schools, disadvantaged areas and so on, the money is paid straight to them. I am surprised they are not using up the resources <Col N="886" /> and I will raise the issue with the Minister. The implementation of the child care measures is being facilitated by the interdepartmental policy committee on child care. There is a national co-ordinating child care committee, the county child care committees, and an equal opportunities child care programme and appraisal committee. While the Department plays the role of vice chair of the committee on child care the national co-ordinating child care committee is represented on the appraisal committee. All the main players work together and are on the one committee. The health boards participate in the national committees and the establishment of county child care committees has been facilitated by the relevant health boards. Subject to a check, all the groups are working together as part of the national co-ordinating child care programme. Given the demand that exists, I would be surprised if they do not use the full amount of money paid either directly through the health boards or by the committee.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Taoiseach address the subject matter of Question No. 7 on the National Implementation Body? Is it not a fact that this body which was set up to police the industrial relations clause of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is simply not working? Is it not a fact that the nurses, teachers and the gardaí have been on strike, that each sector in Aer Lingus has been on strike in the past six months, that there has been a rail strike, and another is threatened, and that this day week there will be nationwide black-outs? Is it not a fact that one of the cornerstones of the Celtic tiger, the PPF and its predecessors was that we could offer a stable industrial relations climate, but that is now effectively gone? Is it not true that the partnership, spirit and underpinning industrial relations stability we could offer is gone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. Given the thousands of industries throughout the country, there have been only a small number of disputes. However, these public sector strikes were more high profile than one would wish. It is unfair to blame those who work hard on the National Implementation Body for disputes that took place before the body was set up. This body was set up at the beginning of the year and has been involved in a number of high profile strikes. It was involved in the recent Aer Lingus strike and in the earlier strike in February, with which it was successful. They were triggered by either ICTU or IBEC who believed there was a breach of the agreement of 4 December. The body has been very busy in relation to a number of these high profile disputes. There is now a threatened ESB dispute which I hope will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in this House last week that difficulties surround some of these disputes. There is no point in my highlighting these inter-union difficulties because that will not help to resolve them. The Labour Court, Labour Relations Com<Col N="887" /> mission and the implementation body are doing their utmost to deal with the issues. To date, they have had reasonable success in most of the disputes but, ultimately, their role is trying to bring together the sides at the end of a process. IBEC and ICTU do not wish to become involved at the beginning of the process. They prefer to play a role at the end of the Labour Court's work by reminding people of their responsibilities and bringing them together either under IBEC or ICTU because they believe the mantle of blame does not always lie with one side. These bodies play a useful role.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> It is not really IBEC in that all the disputes I mentioned &ndash; the high profile ones and those really hitting the consumer &ndash; are in the public sector. Effectively, industrial relations problems in the public sector are causing the problem. From the point of view of the effectiveness of the National Implementation Body, is it not a fact that ICTU is on that? From the point of view of resolving many of these disputes, the disputes arise from inter union rivalry &ndash; for example, in the case of Aer Lingus and, by extension, in the teaching profession. From the point of view of resolving inter union rivalry, which seems to be the key &ndash; in other words, competition between the unions as to membership and numbers &ndash; that is where ICTU comes in. It should be playing a vital role in banging heads together and keeping the spirit of partnership which has underpinned the agreement and the success of the Celtic tiger. Something needs to be done otherwise there is no point in having the National Implementation body, particularly if ICTU cannot play an effective role within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a number of high profile disputes, a number of which have centred around Aer Lingus from last autumn to this week. I know the difficulties that lie behind them. I assure the Deputy that all my information is that ICTU has been doing its level best at all levels to try to help in this area. It cannot at all times control the unions or the shop stewards involved. In fairness to it, it does its level best. In any of the ones in which IBEC &ndash; maybe this does not involve the more high profile ones &ndash; is asked to become involved, they certainly work together. ICTU and IBEC when requested in their various roles, even if it is not directly under their remit, do their utmost to work on an issue. There are some particular difficulties and I will not go into personalities and the other issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Labour Court. It has made some very good progress this week on the Aer Lingus dispute, as it did on 7 February. It is not easy because there are knock-ons and people in different positions watching relativities, but it is doing its utmost. I have no difficulty in urging the National Implementation Body, as others do, to continue to remind those who signed the amended agreement of 4 December that they <Col N="888" /> have responsibilities. Over the last two months or so, the public service committee of the congress, in particular, has shown its position to be very strong and clear on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the agreement of 4 December was signed by three parties &ndash; not only congress and IBEC but also the Government &ndash; and that it was signed on the basis that the budget, which was due to follow quite soon afterwards, would be significantly enhanced in terms of the pay deal that was part and parcel of the PPF? Surely the Government has a role, on foot of what Deputy Higgins said, specifically through the Department for which the Tánaiste has responsibility. She takes no interest in industrial relations &ndash; the labour component which was in the original Department of Enterprise and Employment. Surely that Department, in addition to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, has a direct role to play in terms of the personnel management functions of the Department of Public Enterprise in the main and the relevant State companies which are the subject of the disputes to which Deputy Higgins referred and which affect virtually every citizen when they impact in the manner they do. Why is the Government not taking a direct role in ensuring that the relevant line Department &ndash; in this instance, the Department of Public Enterprise &ndash; is properly resourced in a manner that enables it to perform its task because it is clearly not doing it at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has the remit that Deputy Quinn and I had at one stage. The Labour Relations Commission is now there and it has a substantial amount of resources, as does the Labour Court, to carry out some of those functions. The officials in that Department still involve themselves in it. Over the last decade or so, we have endeavoured to resolve most of the disputes through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. That is the right way to do it. The implementation body of which I spoke is to remind people and to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF. That is one of its functions. I do not have any knowledge of a lack of resources in the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's, area of responsibility. On the Deputy's question on the budget, the Government more than honoured the commitments signed on 4 December and that has been accepted by all the social partners.</P>

      <P>I would like to pursue a point raised by Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Quinn with the Taoiseach. Is the Taoiseach aware of the widespread concern that the Government as an employer is reneging on its responsibilities towards workers and that when industrial disputes break out or are signalled, the Government's attitude is to leave their resolution to the industrial relations machinery of the State as if it had no responsibility itself?</P>
      <P>For example, is the Taoiseach aware that last month the CPSU, which represents 11,000 civil servants, voted by 3:1 to withdraw from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness because the pay of its members had fallen so far behind other public servants? Will all 11,000 members of the CPSU be allowed to drift on until this becomes a crisis when the Government will go to the Labour Court or some other forum in the industrial relations machinery of the State rather than taking hands on responsibility as an employer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the State and the Government as an employer, whether in the semi-State area or otherwise, I regularly hear the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, being blamed for being too hands on in some of the semi-State companies. Within the Civil Service, the public service committee of congress, which includes the CPSU, were in support of the change of 4 December. It subsequently voted against it. It has already presented its report for benchmarking and its case. It has balloted for strike action but it has also presented its case because it believes it has fallen behind. People in this area of the Civil Service have many choices outside and they have been leaving those categories in particular. Their case will be examined and that has been made absolutely clear to their leadership. I wish them well in their case which they have to make and pursue under the benchmarking process. That mechanism is there. The Government worked very closely with the <Col N="890" /> public service committee at congress which represents the views of that union and all the other grades as well, and has given an enormous amount of time to their concerns. There is probably no area of the Civil Service that is watched as closely as the public service group at congress.</P>

      <P>Undertaking cost benefit analysis of expenditure programmes within their remit in regard to the Irish language or otherwise is primarily a matter for individual Departments. An overall cost-cultural benefit analysis, as suggested by the Deputy is not proposed as the merits of such an undertaking would be very costly and not particularly apparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. However, it underlines the difficulty in this area. She said this work could be undertaken only by individual Departments. Does the Minister of State agree that much of the problem with Irish language provision is there is not co-ordination and integration between the policies pursued by various Departments and that is having a detrimental effect in the context of benefits arising from the spending of taxpayers' money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was difficult to reach the nub of the question in trying to analyse exactly what the Deputy asked. The difficulty is that a number of Departments are involved in dealing with Irish language provision. I hope in the context of the Bille teanga that there will be a more co-ordinated approach regarding Irish language provision. Prior to the preparation of the scheme there was consideration of a cost-cultural benefit analysis relating to the proposed legislation. A number of Departments will factor in the proposed developments in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I can advert only to the effectiveness of Irish language policy in my Department. Value for money audits have been and continue to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General on organisations such as Údarás na Gaeltachta. Proposals are being considered by An Foras Teanga in the context of a cross-Border initiative so that the Comptroller and Auditor General and his counterpart in Northern Ireland will jointly carry out value for money audits on that body. Value for money audits and cost-cultural analyses are carried out on the institutions for which I have responsibility. I do not have similar information regarding other Departments.</P>
      <P>It would be expensive to do so but perhaps there could be a more planned and strategic approach to Irish language provision in the context of the Bille teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree the fundamental flaw in the State's approach to the Irish language is that there is no stated policy in place? I have proposed previously that a bilingual society should be our objective but that is not a stated policy of Government. Some Department must take the initiative regarding co-ordination. If the Department responsible for the <Col N="893" /> Gaeltacht does not, which Department will do so? The Bille teanga is too narrow a base to evaluate what is happening <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish language in both the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree there is a completely haphazard approach to the development or usage of the language. It was agreed that dátheangathas was the policy. In the context of the Bille Teanga, which I hope will be before the House by the end of 2001, there will be a strong focus on its implementation. The Department will have a leading role in ensuring the proposals for the teanga are implemented. As the Deputy said, the proposals are fine, but their implementation is most important. There must be a structure to ensure that happens. I hope, in the context of the completion of the Bill and in conjunction with the Minister, to establish a system where people are aware of the consequences of not adhering to the legislation. I hope what happened in a haphazard way in the past will not happen under the Bille Teanga.</P>

      <P>Against the background of the decline in the use of the language in the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht, a Bill that enables people to conduct their business with State Departments in Irish is of no significance in terms of what I am seeking.

      <P>As I indicated previously, RTE lodged a formal outline application with me on 5 October 2000 for an increase of £50 in the television licence fee. On 31 October 2000, RTE lodged detailed documentation in support of the application. My Department engaged PriceWaterhouseCoopers to advise on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants' report was received in late January 2001. During the course of their work, PriceWaterhouseCoopers sought and received a considerable amount of further information from RTE in support and justification of its application. The report identified a number of significant issues with the RTE application that were <Col N="894" /> not resolved by the further information supplied by to the consultants. These issues were of sufficient significance as to preclude any submission by me to Government in the absence of additional information from RTE.</P>
    <P>I have had meetings with the chairman of the authority arising from the findings in the consultants' report. The director general of RTE was present at one of these meetings. In addition, at my request, PriceWaterhouseCoopers met the chairman and senior management of RTE to set out the type of information that RTE needs to provide in the form of an additional submission to address the issues identified by the consultants. RTE has indicated that the additional information will be supplied towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring this matter to Government for decision at the earliest possible date. However, I cannot consider doing so until RTE has provided the necessary additional information and it has been objectively and independently examined.</P>

Is the Minister familiar with the report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> which states that she &ldquo;carpeted&rdquo; RTE for what it calls a &ldquo;cock up&rdquo; in its application? It is strong language. The report also states that the Minister expressed her annoyance at the meeting to which she referred between her and the chairman of the authority and the director general of RTE, both of whom are honourable gentlemen.

      <P>I agree. There has been some movement since the last parliamentary question about the proposed increase in the licence fee for <Col N="895" /> RTE was tabled. I am sure everybody agrees in the context of public moneys that it is incumbent on me to have the application examined objectively and in detail by consultants. RTE had no problem whatsoever with that move. The consultants feel they cannot report because they are seeking further information from RTE. I understand this information will be supplied by RTE at the end of the month and it will then be possible to have it examined independently.</P>
      <P>The additional information relates to issues such as sources, content and scheduling of additional programming; RTE's transformation process; projected capital expenditure; plans for digital television services; cost base going forward; key performance indicators; and transparency of activities, for example, between radio, television, commercial and other activities. This is some of the information that needs to be furnished so that the process can proceed.</P>

      <P>The matter is in the hands of RTE because additional information has been sought from it. It is not a case of any delay on my part or that of the Department. Once the information comes to hand, the consultants I employed can deal with it before the matter is passed on to me. As I said earlier, I am interested in ensuring this matter can be brought to Government at the earliest possible opportunity. However, that cannot be done because I am not in a position to make a decision on the matter until all the facts are to hand. I understand RTE has indicated that the additional information will be supplied to the consultants I appointed by the end of the month. As soon as that information is forthcoming, I will be in a position to consider the case further.</P>

      <P>The <i>Asgard </i>is owned by the Minister for Defence who agreed to the removal of the vessel from Kilmainham Jail, where it has been located since 1979, by the <i>Asgard </i>restoration project. My Department did not raise any <Col N="896" /> objection to this on condition that appropriate accommodation and suitable insurance cover was provided and subject to the National Museum of Ireland being satisfied with the accommodation.</P>
      <P>The housing of the <i>Asgard</i> has recently been examined by officials of the National Museum of Ireland. The ARP has been verbally advised that the current accommodation is unsatisfactory and a formal notice to this effect has been issued to the ARP.</P>
      <P>The licence to alter issued by my Department in respect of the <i>Asgard</i> requires the <i>Asgard</i> restoration project to provide the director of the National Museum of Ireland with a detailed proposal or work schedule regarding the proposed work of alteration. It is also a condition of the licence that access is provided to the National Museum of Ireland to inspect work in progress. This work has not yet commenced. I understand a schedule for the work involved will not be prepared until after the <i>Asgard</i> restoration project has raised the additional private funding necessary to carry out the restoration. In the meantime, the allocation of funds to the <i>Asgard</i> is primarily a matter for the vessel's owner, who is the Minister for Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the reason she had to issue a licence to alter is because the <i>Asgard</i> has been classified an archaeological object and that our first priority is conservation and preservation, not restoration? Does she also agree that, if this restoration plan proceeds, less than 10% of the original <i>Asgard</i> will remain and that it will not be a restoration and more a desecration of a national treasure? Did the Minister seek advice from the National Museum, the Heritage Council and from independent consultants? Will the Minister confirm that their advice was that the emphasis should be on conservation and the <i>Asgard</i> being on display in a maritime museum for future generations rather than on this so-called restoration which will result in less than 10% of the original <i>Asgard</i> remaining?</P>
      <P>It will not be restoration or conservation but desecration. I am surprised the Minister agreed to such a course given from where she comes and given her responsibility. Does the Minister agree she may be in violation of the 1992 European Convention on the protection of archaeological heritage which we signed in 1997 in allowing this nonsensical restoration to proceed which flies in the face of all advice from anyone who knows anything about archaeology?</P>

      <P>The view expressed by the Deputy is held by a number of people and formed the essence of the debate which took place on the <i>Asgard</i>. There are some, like the Deputy, who believe the <i>Asgard</i> should not be made a seagoing vessel but should be in a museum. There are others, and I share their view, who believe it should be a seagoing vessel. I sought advice on this from the National Museum of Ireland and <Col N="897" /> the Heritage Council. It is fair to say the thrust of their general advice was closer to the former rather than the latter view. I brought the matter to Cabinet and it supported the licence being given to allow the <i>Asgard</i> to be restored as a seafaring vessel. The licence was issued by my Department with certain conditions attached.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that, as Minister with responsibility for heritage, I have the responsibility of deciding on whether a licence should be issued. The vessel is owned by the Minister for Defence and any Exchequer funding for its restoration would come through that Department and not mine. Discussions are also ongoing on sponsorship and private moneys to be made available for the vessel.</P>

If this project is allowed continue as planned, we will have the <i>Asgard</i> in name only. The vessel is unique. What is proposed is like adding diamonds to the Ardagh Chalice or putting a coat of pebbledash on the high cross of Monasterboice. Conservation must be the order of the day. If the restoration project proceeds, we will have a replica masquerading as the <i>Asgard</i>. The only original feature which will remain will be the name.</P>

I am sure he realises the licence was issued in December 1999 and it was at that stage, and previous to it, that discussions took place and views were expressed and given an airing. It was on foot of those discussions and views that I brought the issue to Cabinet which supported the proposal to restore the <i>Asgard</i> to being a sailing vessel. The Deputy is right in saying the <i>Asgard</i> has played a very important part in our history and the fact it will be a seagoing vessel will create further interest, especially among younger people who may be in a position to learn more about the history of the <i>Asgard</i> than they might were it to remain a museum setting.</P>

This is the last site of the Gaelic courts where Fiach McHugh of the O'Byrne family gave his word. &ldquo;Follow me up to Carlow&rdquo; is a very famous line of our anthem in Carlow. The estate dates back to the times when its occupants resisted the Pale. It comprises 4,000 acres of woodland, mountain and river. With all its history, does the Minister not believe it would be preferable if it were a national asset rather than being taken over by a commercial interest which would sell the deer herd and forest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct to state this estate has important historical resonance, not only for the history outlined by the Deputy but also for the considerations of natural heritage. The woodland in this estate is primarily oak and there is a great diversity of habitat there. There are a number of mechanisms to address this situation, including designations such as natural heritage areas, which come under the wildlife Acts, management agreements, which are also covered by the wildlife Acts, the planning Acts, and an assessment of forestry proposals by the forest service. There are many ways of protecting what is a valuable resource without having to acquire further lands.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 15 of 14 December, 2000, no survey or research has been carried out on the level of interest in archaeological excavations of medieval Dublin. When my Department commissions research on heritage sites it tends to be in respect of the experience of visitors to particular sites and this has, in the main, produced positive feedback. At this stage, it is not a priority for my Department to undertake research of the type referred to by the Deputy. However, given the remit of the Heritage Council to propose policies and priorities in relation to the protection, presentation and enhancement of heritage, it might be something that body would undertake. It must be remembered that much of the archaeological excavation in Dublin in recent years has been development led. The priority with such excavations is to preserve archaeological remains by record.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the reason she has decided not to proceed with the proposed committee of experts to carry out a review of the procedures whereby courtesy recognition of chiefs is granted by the Genealogical Office; when the review by the Chief Herald of decisions regarding the granting of courtesy titles will be concluded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to a previous Parliamentary Question No. 28 on 21 Feabhra 2001, that I have decided that the establishment of a committee to review procedures in the Genealogical Office, whereby courtesy recognition of chiefs of the name is granted, is not warranted at this time. The Direc<Col N="900" /> tor of the National Library, in his capacity as Chief Herald, has commenced examination of a number of high profile individual cases where courtesy recognition of chiefs of the name was granted in the past. His preliminary examination has elicited the need for legal advice on certain complex aspects of the cases and this advice is awaited. Detailed consideration of these cases by him, as Chief Herald, cannot be concluded until he has received and considered the legal advice. The work of any review committee would be severely constrained by the absence of both the legal advice now sought and formal consideration by the Chief Herald of these cases. The legal issues need to be fully resolved before the question of a formal policy review can be revisited.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am somewhat constrained with regard to elaborating the specific nature of the legal issues involved. I take the opportunity to point out again that a chief of the name has no legal standing. It is a person recognised by the Chief Herald of Ireland as the senior descendant of the last inaugurated Gaelic lord of that name, granted courtesy recognition. Recognition is therefore no more than the acknowledgement of a genealogical fact which does not carry with it any rights or privileges in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister says, it may be quite some time before there is any substantial progress on this issue. Can we take it there will not be any further recognition of bogus titles, or of any titles in the interim, until this issue is dealt with? Would the Minister agree that there are grounds for the abolition of the Genealogical Office and its full integration into the National Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say how long it will take to get the necessary legal advice. That may well take some time. Once that advice has been obtained the Director of the National Library, as Chief Herald, will have to take time to consider those points of view and it will not be until then that we will get a clearer picture. The Genealogical Office and its responsibilities sit well on the shoulders of the Chief Herald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if there is a full record of the number of bogus titles that may be out there at the moment and, when the review is carried out by the Chief Herald, will there be a mechanism whereby such titles can be withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the number of such titles and in relation to the matter which is under review by the Chief Herald, as it is a question of law, I do not want to discuss it. It would not be appropriate for me to discuss legal issues in this House. There have been some high profile cases and they are being considered at the moment and it is not until all due procedures have been completed that we will know the full <Col N="901" /> facts on these issues. Only then will I be in a position to report to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the steps being taken under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to provide protection for seals; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Ireland is now the only coastal EU country without a seal sanctuary; if her Department has received an application for funding for an Irish Seal Sanctuary at Skerries, County Dublin, where a site has been provided by Fingal County Council; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The seal is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and cannot be hunted, killed or injured other than under licence. Any complaints received about interference with seals or unauthorised shootings are investigated by conservation rangers employed by Dúchas, the heritage service. The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, enhances the level of protection for seals and other protected species in that it provides for the protection of the resting places of these animals in addition to the breeding places, which are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, provides that where damage is being caused by a protected wild animal, in this case seals, to a fishery, the Minister may cause such steps to be taken, by an authorised person, to stop the damage. Permission issued under section 42 provides for the shooting of seals at nets that are subject to damage and each specific application is considered on its merits. Ten licences under section 42 were issued last year in respect of seals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Ireland is the only coastal EU country without a seal sanctuary. My Department has received a number of applications for funding for an Irish Seal Sanctuary, as referred to by the Deputy. I met representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary, at their request, to discuss their future plans, and officials from my Department later examined their draft development plan. The Irish Seal Sanctuary has made many approaches for aid in the past in running its existing facility at Garristown, but the fact remains that the proposed new sanctuary is a rehabilitation facility catering to a relatively small number of injured seals rather than contributing to the overall conservation of the species which is my concern. I have made it clear on previous occasions in this House that my responsibility, under the wildlife Acts, is to protect seals and other mammals to ensure the conservation of the species as a whole. The work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary is primarily of a welfare nature and, as such, does not come within the remit of my Department. While I recognise the continuing excellence of the work done by the Irish Seal Sanctuary from a conservation point of view, such work does not impact <Col N="902" /> significantly on overall seal numbers and would not warrant funding from my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister has told us, that she is legally precluded from giving any assistance, be it capital or revenue, to a seal sanctuary? In relation to the other coastal EU member states, which Department of Government, in those countries, provides financial assistance to these sanctuaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being legally prohibited from giving such help in this regard. I have stated on many occasions that the question of animal welfare comes directly under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Conservation is my direct responsibility and I hope that in my initial reply I differentiated sufficiently between both responsibilities.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, there may be an opportunity to contact the Department of the Environment and Local Government with regard to making a strong appeal for environmental tourist interests. From time to time, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has assisted animal welfare projects and, therefore, this source could also be considered if such funding is to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister has said that if applications are made either to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or to both Ministers, she would support them in so far as that course is available to her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met those concerned about this issue it was put to them that these outlets could be considered in the hope that some financial assistance might be made available. From a personal point of view, I would have absolutely no problem with funding this particular sanctuary but my responsibility is for conservation, not animal welfare which is the responsibility of other Departments. I cannot speak for other Departments and would not attempt to do so. That is why I believe it may be wise to contact those particular Departments to see what response will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>Following the advice by the expert group on foot and mouth disease set up by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, I have commenced a phased reopening of heritage sites with visitor facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Castle and the Rock of Cashel were the first sites to reopen to the public on Friday, 16 March. These sites, as well as 21 other fee paying sites which are open on an all year round basis, had been closed as a precautionary measure following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Armagh. Since then, on the basis of advice from the expert group, 22 other sites have reopened and a further six will reopen next Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of Easter Sunday, 30 sites will be open of the 39 sites at which my Department provides a guide service and which would normally be open to the public. The Deputy will appreciate that the majority of the fee paying sites open on a seasonal basis only and would be due to open from Easter onwards.</P>
      <P>In the case of sites where susceptible animals have had access since 1 February, I have today received the agreement of the expert group to those sites being reopened, subject to fencing being provided to prevent further access by animals and to the expiry of a quarantine period of 28 days.</P>
      <P>A further 21 fee paying sites are due to open to the public in May and June and it is my intention to open all of those sites to the public where the guidelines laid down by the expert group can be complied with. This situation is, of course, dependent on no further outbreaks occurring in this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation informed the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is engaged in a programme of temporary fencing to keep deer and other susceptible animals out of lands around visitor centres. Will the Minister advise the House on the up to date situation with regard to this matter? Has the fencing been ordered and will the sites we are discussing be open for Easter? I am thinking, in particular, of Muckross House in Killarney, Derrynane House, the monastic site at Glendalough and Newgrange. It is vital for the tourist industry that these locations should be reopened as soon as possible but the Minister's Department must ensure that these sites will be fenced off as a matter of urgency. I would ask the <Col N="904" /> Minister to refer, in her reply, to the particular sites I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Private Members' motion that was debated last week when we had an opportunity to highlight some of the issues, including the steps we are taking at heritage sites to support the tourism industry. The Deputy is perfectly correct in saying that we have been examining some of the more sensitive sites, such as Muckross House and its environs in the Deputy's own constituency. We are particularly concerned about susceptible animals there, such as deer, so we are erecting fencing as we have done at Glenveagh. We hope that the fencing at both locations will be completed by the end of this week. We received information today from the expert group which advises the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and other Ministers, on the best procedures to adopt. The expert group has given the go ahead for reopening Muckross House and Glenveagh once the quarantine period of 28 days has expired. The fencing of those sites will have been completed by the end of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still not clear to me whether Muckross House, Derrynane, Glendalough and Newgrange will be open for Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be open for Easter for the simple reason that fencing is ongoing at these particularly sensitive sites. According to the expert group, once that fencing has been completed there must be a quarantine period of 28 days. My Department has issued press releases on the decisions that have been taken with regard to opening such sites, some at the end of March, some on 8 April and others on 15 April. We will continue to examine this situation daily.</P>
      <P>The visitor centre at Newgrange has been reopened to the public, although the actual site has not because it is a sensitive area. We are happy with that situation because it is possible to contain and control access to the visitor centre there. Normal precautions have been taken in an effort to ensure that a fair balance is stuck between avoiding further outbreaks while at the same time trying to live life as normally as possible, particularly for those involved in the tourism industry.</P>

      <P>The resources required by my Department to meet changing statutory responsibilities are constantly under review.

      <P>I have no immediate proposals to add to the existing list of 362 candidate SACs, apart from the position as outlined in my separate reply to the Deputy regarding salmon sites. Having regard to the number and extent of candidate SACs that I have now proposed, I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be found sufficient for most habitats and species at the second Atlantic region seminar. Only then will it become clear whether Ireland should propose more sites for particular habitats or species, in order to contribute to the Natura 2000 network in proportion to the contributions of other member states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to what the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Belfast has termed a &ldquo;hot suspect&rdquo; case of foot and mouth disease in the Cookestown area of County Tyrone is that the results of the samples taken from a number of bovine animals on the farm are still awaited from the Pirbright laboratory.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps worth quoting from the statement issued this morning by Minister Brid Rodgers which states:</P>
      <P>The Veterinary Service last night examined cattle on a dairy farm near Cookestown. A number of these animals were showing symptoms suggestive of foot and mouth disease. Samples have been taken and have been sent to Pirbright. Results are expected by midafternoon today.</P>
      <P>Minister Rodgers went on to state:</P>
      <P>This suspect case shows that the risk of foot and mouth disease is still with us. I very much hope that this case will not be positive, but at this point in time we must expect the worst. I would reinforce my advice to farmers to continue to be vigilant and to comply with the guidelines for protection against the disease.</P>
      <P>That is the statement of Minister Rodgers a few hours ago.</P>
      <P>As yet, the results from Pirbright have not been received. I do not wish to speculate on the matter and we must wait until those results are received. Until then, we must keep our fingers crossed and hope that for the sake of the industry in Northern Ireland, here and in other European countries that the results will be negative.</P>
      <P>The experience of the past six weeks or so has amply demonstrated the wisdom of not jumping to conclusions before laboratory test results are to hand. Needless to say, we are hoping the worst fears of Minister Rodgers will not be realised. However, we can only wait for the outcome of the tests. The protective measures which have been in place along the Border and at ports and airports in this State since the early days of the current crisis have been rigorously maintained. This has involved a massive effort on the part of all concerned, including the Garda, the Army, the Civil Defence, Customs and Excise, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and a range of individuals and organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed the need to ensure that in every area of activity we follow the appropriate advice <Col N="910" /> and take all necessary precautions. While recognising the inconvenience and disruption which such measures cause, I have resisted pressures for a general relaxation of controls across the country. The current foot and mouth scare in Cookstown underlines the prudence of continuing this approach for some time to come. I take this opportunity to remind the House and the general public that the threat from foot and mouth disease will overhang this country for a considerable period and certainly for as long as the situation in Britain remains the same. Even if, as we hope, there are no further cases of foot and mouth in this State or on the island as a whole, we cannot relax our guard while the disease is present in other countries in western Europe and further afield. As regards arrangements for the provision of disinfectant facilities at British ports, this matter is being dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing Members with the opportunity to obtain this briefing on the situation in Cookstown. Perhaps the Minister might also outline the position which obtains in Bray at present.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there appears to be a somewhat lax attitude to disinfectant procedures at all checkpoints? I visited the Border in recent days and there does not seem to be the same enthusiasm as there was a number of days ago. Is the Minister aware that vehicles are being waved through the main checkpoints in County Louth, near where the outbreak occurred and is he satisfied that sufficient care is being taken? I accept that the rules have been laid down, but is it not time to reconsider the tightness of the controls. It is extremely frightening that Cookstown is situated only 30 miles or so north of the Border and if it is proven that mammals have contracted the disease, we will have entered a new stage.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister considering allowing farmers to move cattle to out-farms, etc., particularly in light of the serious implications for animal welfare and so on? There is a great deal of pressure on farmers and, while I appreciate that the emerging situation does not make it any easier, we must adopt a common-sense approach or we will otherwise face greater difficulties than at present from an animal welfare point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford is correct to stress the importance of the tightness of the controls and the replenishment of disinfectant facilities. Each morning I hold a meeting with a strategy group among the members of which is the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. As late as this morning he confirmed that there has been no relaxation whatever in the controls along the Border and in County Louth. A considerable number of vehicles entering the Republic have been turned back because they were carrying sandwiches, meat or dairy products which should not be coming into this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> I have communicated directly with farming organisations, written to every farmer in the country and communicated with a range of voluntary bodies. I have also contacted ICOS to seek to ensure it communicates with its co-operatives. In addition, I have appealed to people to continue the good work they have been doing, to continue replenishing disinfectant facilities and to report suspicious symptoms of any kind in all of the flocks or herds throughout the country. By and large, this is being done. There is no doubt there is some variation in the degree of adherence to the guidelines in certain instances. However, we are appealing in every possible way for people to keep up the good work.</P>
    <P>In relation to achieving a balance between tight restrictions and the need to allow animal movement, particularly for welfare considerations, there will be no relaxation in terms of general animal movement. Where sheep or cattle are on out-farms and there is a need to return them to the main property for fodder, calving or lambing purposes, this can be done under very strict certification procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is not much point in speculating about the case in Cookstown. However, it would be a matter of serious concern to discover that a new case had occurred at such a remove in time from the case in Meigh. That said, we can only wait until the results become available.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's final point, how long will it be necessary for the exclusion zone in County Louth to remain in place? In the absence of any further cases in the Republic, how long will it be scientifically justified to keep in place strict controls on the movement of animals. It seems there is a case for facilitating a public exchange of views between the expert group that advises the Minister and those involved in livestock production in order that the basis for the maintenance of controls can at least be discussed and aired. Will the Minister consider establishing a dialogue of that kind with a view to sharing information and carrying out a clear and public risk assessment. I believe the Minister will agree that the more publicly we share information on these matters, the greater the level of likely support will be garnered for whatever policy emerges from that sharing of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Cookstown, we must await the results and there is no point in entering into speculation. This is a serious matter, however, because all the expert advice available up to now indicated that 28 days was the longest incubation period. The outbreak in Meigh occurred on 1 March and it is now 11 April. The experts to whom I have spoken are completely baffled by events at Cookstown. If the results prove positive, their assessments and the indications to date will be thrown out of kilter. We must <Col N="912" /> await the outcome but the seriousness of the situation cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>If there are no further cases in the Republic and all going well, restrictions can be lifted in relation to the ten mile exclusion zone in County Louth on 27 April. For the remainder of the country the restrictions will be lifted on 19 April, Thursday of next week.</P>
      <P>In relation to animal movement, the difficulty is that the movement of susceptible animals poses the highest risk of spreading infection. While the farming organisations have met directly with Professor Monaghan and the expert group, there would be merit in encouraging a more public debate on this issue. The farming leaders, through their network of organisations, communicate with the public and are understanding of the fact that there must be a degree of restriction and inconvenience. While measures have been relaxed in relation to assembly points so that people can take animals to abattoirs, direct movement from one farm to another is prohibited. I will see to what extent there can be public debate on the matter, although the farming organisations and ICOS have met directly with the expert group. I will also raise the suggestion made with Professor Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to participate in the speculation game. I hope the result is negative and I wish the Northern Ireland authorities and Minister Rodgers well in their endeavours in that regard.</P>
      <P>This suspect case clearly illustrates that we must remain on red alert. We must emphasise to the farming community and to the public the need to remain vigilant. What contact has the Minister had to date with the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture on the reported suspect case of foot and mouth disease in the Cookstown area? Has he had discussions with the authorities on whether there is a link between this suspect case and the previous one? What are the origins of this suspect case? Is the Minister considering reviewing the level of restrictions in place to control the spread of foot and mouth disease? In light of what Mrs. Rodgers said in her statement, which the Minister read into the record, is the Minister considering adopting an all-Ireland approach to tackling disease at all levels? Is there evidence available in the Department that bovine animals have been smuggled into this jurisdiction from Northern Ireland and, if so, what steps is the Department taking to deal with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions to Minister Bríd Rodgers. Our chief veterinary officer, Dr. Colm Gaynor, and Dr. Bob McCracken, his counterpart in Northern Ireland, spoke to each other today. They must also await the outcome. Last Friday Minister Rodgers, Dr. McCracken and a number of their experts came to Dublin and we had an exchange of views. It was agreed in a communiqué that we would continue and sustain our efforts to deal with the <Col N="913" /> problem of foot and mouth disease and other veterinary matters on an island-wide basis. There is not any evidence that animals came into this jurisdiction illegally since controls were put in place on the Border on 21 February. There is evidence of some illegal movements prior to that time and they are being followed up. We had culls on a number of farms and we had a court case in County Carlow in recent days. If there is anything to be learned from this &ndash; there are many lessons to be learned &ndash; it is that we need to considerably tighten our traceability system, particularly for sheep. As Deputies know, from early next month a traceability regime will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to speculate about this case and I hope the results from Pirbright will be negative. It is not a positive development that there is a suspected case in cattle. It is important for the Minister to reiterate the restrictions in place and the disinfection procedures which must be maintained. Measures have become lax in recent weeks. It is important for the Department to make that point at every possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>What measures is the Minister putting in place to ensure animal welfare? As the Minister is aware, fodder is scarce in many parts of the country as there is little grass or growth. While farmers can move animals from outer to inner farms, they cannot move them off the farms. The Minister may be aware of the concern in the Shannon basin where the callows were flooded in recent days. It will be seven weeks before stock will be allowed on those lands. There is a crisis in that area because of a shortage of fodder. Will the Minister put in place measures to deal with that specific problem?</P>
      <P>What procedures are in place for the importation of dairy products from the UK? Are permits in place? Can we be assured that those products undergo the proper heat treatment prior to being imported into the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should try to get people to replenish disinfectant and to ensure they maintain their vigilance and surveillance. Farmers, who are a high risk group, are doing that. Apart from a small group of individuals who are becoming increasingly known to the gardaí and the special unit which is following various leads, the rest of the community is behaving well. There is not another country in Europe whose controls are as tight as ours. Nonetheless, one finds dry mats in various places and people must put additional disinfectant on them. I have continued to repeat that message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards fodder, there are instances of fodder shortage. The Department and the expert group relaxed some of the controls on the movement of fodder. It is more difficult with the movement of cattle or any susceptible species because of the difficulty of animal to animal contact in the spread of the disease. We are allowing movement within the one herd on animal welfare grounds where there is an outside farm and certification <Col N="914" /> within a herd ownership. At a meeting last week, the expert group felt it was too early to relax any further the movement of cattle with outside herds.</P>
    <P>As regards the importation of products, dairy products can be imported on certification. There is double heat treatment and other PH requirements. That must be done with certification. I do not have the figures with me, but I get a report on the truck loads or consignments of products returned if the certification does not measure up with the product being supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the suspect case in Tyrone, does the Minister consider it prudent to introduce additional measures by way of an increased inspectorate at meat factories? Unfortunately, there continues to be newspaper reports of movement of animals to and from meat factories under suspicious circumstances. Have any samples been taken from bovine animals and sent to Pirbright for analysis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increasing inspection and surveillance at the factories around the country. That is one of the reasons we have had a number of suspect cases at ICM in Navan and at Bray yesterday evening. We got good news about an hour ago on the suspect sheep in Bray. The initial tissue sample was negative. We also got the final blood results from Navan about an hour ago and they were also negative. That is good news from our point of view.</P>
      <P>As regards the suspected case in Tyrone, it is a considerable distance from the Border. It is well outside the ten kilometres surveillance zone. It does not mean we have to take precautionary measures in relation to a zone, which is different from Meigh and Augher which was the last scare we had. On that occasion at Augher, we had arrangements for a precautionary zone in County Monaghan. We must await the outcome of the test results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the two results are clear on this part of the island. We must hope and pray that the other one is similar. In light of the Minister saying that there is no chance of any movement of cattle from yard to out-farm etc., does he accept that there is great urgency now to ensure that all grants and REPS payments that can be paid are paid? Payments could be at the highest level and any refunding required could be deducted from later payments. It is important to get money to the farmers to allow them to feed the stock because in many cases they have much more stock than they normally would have.</P>
      <P>The payment of building grants is another issue. If a qualified builder can certify that a job has been done, that should be sufficient to allow a building grant, or some portion thereof, to be paid. We should try to get money out where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the extensification grants be paid immediately? They are more important now in early <Col N="915" /> April than they will be in May or whenever they would normally be paid. I urge the Minister to get all these into operation as quickly as possible to ease the pressure at every level. It will avoid people doing things they should not do but might do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave instructions some weeks to ensure that all grants, subsidies and premia that could be paid should be paid. If they could be paid without inspection and without the requirement of a derogation from the EU, then that should be done. My information is that payment of subsidies and headage and premia is well ahead of any other year and that where they can be paid, they are being paid.</P>
      <P>There is some difficulty on capital grants for farm buildings because our staff is prohibited from visiting farms for inspection purposes. When we reach next Thursday, 19 April and some of the trade restrictions are lifted, I hope we will be able to get a formula or code of practice to allow inspections to continue. A code of practice has been agreed to allow AI to go ahead from next week and I hope similar arrangements can be made for on farm inspections. I also gave instructions that where people are eligible for compensation, as most are, then they will be paid without delay. I understand that those payments have commenced and continue to be paid at an accelerated rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I go back to my original question about the disinfection facilities being offered at British ports. I do not like to introduce a contentious note here, but I am very disappointed that the Minister in the House should have simply said that this is a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources would not be doing this if it were not for the urging of the Minister who is here in the House. I ask the Minister to go a little bit outside the terms of his brief and to tell the House as much as he knows about what is being done there. It is important in the context of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>It was a good idea and it is a pity that we had to question the Taoiseach yesterday to find out exactly what was going on. The Minister will remember that many of us were surprised to hear the Taoiseach saying that this offer had been made and then that Downing Street and the MAFF in London did not know anything about it. It was useful to be told yesterday that, since the ports in Britain, in the main, are in private hands, the matter was being dealt with directly by the ports. I invite the Minister to step just a little bit outside his brief and tell the House as much as he knows about what is being done so that we can encourage people to comply with that.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has had communication with the port authorities in Britain and has a very good understanding with them. Automatic disinfectant spraying equipment is being installed in six UK roll-on roll-off ports. Those six ports are positively disposed to the installation of the spraying equipment and that will be done over the next few days. I and, I am sure, the House would have liked if that had been done six weeks ago rather than in the next six days. They did have some mats and mobile equipment, but this will be permanent. I understand the cost involved is around £75,000 for the six ports. The ports are Holyhead, Liverpool &ndash; Mersey port and docks, Heysham, Fishguard, Pembroke and Swansea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any samples from bovine samples been taken from this jurisdiction and sent to Pirbright? Is it a cause of greater concern to the Minister that there is now a suspect bovine animal? There is a greater potency from a carrier viewpoint. It is much more likely to spread from bovine animals than from sheep because of the larger capacity when exhaling and the aerosol effect. What measures has the Minister put in place to counteract that?</P>
      <P>Are the lairages at factories for the reception of animals strictly operating during normal work hours and not outside those hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting last Friday, I discussed the Larne to Stranraer route with the Minister Bríd Rodgers and I was assured that the disinfectant facilities were up to standard there and this will continue. In our communiqué we agreed to liaise closely on the prevention of the importation of susceptible animals from Great Britain because this was the cause of our problem in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Samples from bovines have been taken and they have proved negative so far. We are fortunate so far that no bovines or porcines have shown symptoms of the disease because as the Deputy rightly said they exhale far greater amounts. The experts advise that they also get <Col N="917" /> infection more quickly. However, this strain of the virus seems to be harboured in the ovine species more than in the other two. In Britain some bovines and porcines have got infection.</P>
    <P>It was worrying that some of the new British cases occurred in a geographic spread well outside the immediate areas of infection. The authorities now tell us that that was caused by some illegal animal movement within Britain involving trucks that were not properly disinfected.</P>
    <P>I am not certain of the hours during which there is surveillance and inspection of animals but I know that all animals are inspected for health reasons and to ensure that they are suitable for human consumption as they go through the various lairages. With sheep tagging and additional traceability that will be intensified considerably.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister totally happy &ndash; given the court situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Carlow and the fact that sheep were imported from Cumbria; given that animals have been roaming around the Glen of Aherlow and that 15 animals were found in a forest in Mullinahone &ndash; that there is no smuggling of animals here? Has the situation whereby ESB crews are unable to enter farms to connect the electricity supply for new houses been relaxed? Is the Minister aware of the hardship being imposed on such people?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister or the Minister for Finance had discussions with the banks regarding the problems being experienced by farmers and their inability to meet their payments? A number of agricultural shows are held here annually. The Tullamore show is one of the most outstanding in the country and is nationally and internationally famous. Will the Minister consult with the committees involved in this area on whether these shows can proceed? A question mark hangs over a number of them. We may lose our priority for these events if we do not address the problem now.</P>
      <P>We have always operated a quarantine on the importation of cattle. As we enjoy excellent relations with the Minister for Agriculture in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Bríd Rodgers, will the Minister seek a derogation of five to eight years on the movement of cattle into Ireland?

The Minister is as aware as I that tens of thousands of farmers have store cattle to sell and an equal number want to buy them. Would the Minister agree that the marts, under strict supervision of the permit system &ndash; I understand they have indicated their willingness to do so &ndash; could be asked to act as honest brokers putting the buyer and seller in contact with each other? It could be operated on the same system whereby farmers move from one part of the farm to another. This would put money into farmers' pockets.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to reply to the argumentative element of Deputy Finucane's question. The individual concerned in County Carlow <Col N="919" /> illegally imported animals from Britain and will be brought before the courts. I have asked officials of my Department to pursue that matter with the DPP and ensure the case is brought to prosecution at the earliest possible date. The full rigors of the law will be applied in all cases of illegal activity. We unanimously passed legislation in this regard in both Houses recently.</P>
      <P>I will follow up the matter in regard to the ESB for the Deputy though, in consultation with the expert group, An Bord Gáis, the ESB and others were given the go ahead, with certain codes of practice, to install utilities so that people could go about their business.</P>
      <P>The issue relating to the AIBP plants is not directly related to foot and mouth. I will take up the matter with officials in my Department to see what positive contribution we might make. Deputy Belton raised the issue of buying farm machinery. Difficulties have been identified regarding the purchase of second hand farm machinery. This matter has been raised with Professor Monaghan and guidelines are being drawn up in that regard. I would hope, if we remain free of any problems for another week, that we can allow some relaxation in that area. Farm machinery which is not properly disinfected and fumigated would be very high risk as this fungus is known to survive for very long periods in dung and waste material.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright raised the subject of quarantine, shows and the banks. I have communicated directly with the banks who have indicated they are prepared to be helpful in this situation. Departmental officials met with marts, the ICOS and the IFA regarding animal movement. There are many difficulties regarding animal movement because of susceptible animals moving from farm to farm. The expert group were not then in a position to allow any relaxation, other than on animal welfare grounds and directly to abattoirs. Nonetheless, they asked the marts and the IFA to draw up codes of practice, and they will review the matter in one week. So there is an intensive review of that matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to quarantine, the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Britain, the north of Ireland, Ireland, and the worrying situation in the Netherlands where there are more than 20 cases, show how transport is a problem. Similarly, the two cases in France show how resting points for animals can be lethal sources of infection. The transport problem will be negative for Ireland due to the long distance travel required for our live exports. We will address that issue at the Council of Ministers. In relation to addressing of this problem on an all island basis&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. The Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Ms Rodgers MLA, and her <Col N="920" /> officials have said that North and South would liaise closely in the prevention of the importation of susceptible animals from Great Britain. We are doing that. That was said on Friday and yesterday Northern Ireland officials visited Agriculture House to pursue that goal. It would make life a great deal easier for everybody if we could keep susceptible animals out of the island of Ireland. We are pursuing that very actively.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton asked about the marts and store cattle in particular. That is being reviewed intensively but it is the single most difficult problem and the highest risk activity. I can understand the frustration of farmers but I also understand that it will be well worth waiting. The next week will be critical, and 19 April is an important date. Grass growth is slow this spring and it is a difficult time for farmers. I would not go as far as saying that a subsidy will be introduced but I encourage the farming community to do what they can in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the restocking of farms, some farms have been depopulated due to diseases other than foot and mouth disease, such as brucellosis and BSE among others. We are looking at protocols on restocking those farms. In relation to restocking County Louth and the Cooley Peninsula, there will be very strict controls and we are giving that matter some thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael whole-heartedly supports the ratification of the Rome Statute to establish the International Criminal Court. My initial focus was on the delay on the part of this Government in that it is almost three years since agreement was reached at a UN Conference in Rome and we are only now at the stage of debating the Bill to amend the Constitution to enable us to ratify.</P>
      <P>My main concern is that amending the Constitution does not affect ratification. Other measures are necessary. Further legislation will be necessary as was made clear by the Taoiseach in response to questions I raised with him last year.</P>
      <P>We need a Bill enacted similar to the War Crimes Tribunals Act, 1998. I have not seen such legislation and I want the Minister to tell me when that reply is to be circulated. I do not want to be told that this is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is only passing the buck. It is for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, who is in the House dealing with this issue, to tell Members the full state of affairs. I want to know what kind of legislation there is, when we will see it and what provisions will be in it. I also want to know what kind of measures will be necessary to enable us to ratify it.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that anything has been done about legislation or about such administrative measures, and my main concern is that there will be further delay on the part of the Government even after the referendum process has been completed. It is normal at a time of constitutional change for a Government to circulate legislation underpinning the policy approach proposed. There is in this instance a gaping gap. Legislation has not been circulated nor have details been given. Neither do we have details of the administrative measures which the Taoiseach said last year would be completed at the earliest possible date. When the Taoiseach wants to rush things he can run as fast as anybody in Croke Park, but I want to see more interest taken in the detail of this ratification process.</P>
      <P>As a general principle the people are entitled to the benefit of maximum information before being asked to vote on a constitutional measure. My main worry is that there will be further delays after referendum day before Ireland fulfils its international duty and ratifies the Rome Statute. I have immense enthusiasm for the International Court, so much so that I drafted a Bill to enable us to amend the Constitution. My approach involves fighting crime at home and abroad with a commitment to international law and order as well as law and order at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Establishing a permanent International Court will be a major contribution towards deterring crimes against humanity. At present there is no permanent international body to which the Pol Pots and Saddam Husseins of this world would be answerable. International tribunals such as <Col N="922" /> those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia are limited to one area in each case. It is entirely right that we should move away from an <i>ad hoc</i> system to permanent deterrents. As the Minister mentioned, <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals cannot be a substitute for a stable international judicial mechanism. This is clear also from the fact that in the half century since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, massive human rights and humanitarian law abuses have been committed and continue to be committed worldwide. It is time for the international community to demand official accountability for such acts. Once it is in place, the International Criminal Court will always be there to call the world's tyrants to account.</P>
    <P>A permanent International Court is necessary for many reasons. It is time to end impunity since, despite the precedents of Nuremberg and Tokyo, it is clear that most perpetrators of gross human rights abuse and violations of humanitarian law are not punished by national or international bodies. Human rights and protections guaranteed under international humanitarian law will not be translated into practical behaviour unless potential offenders become aware that a price for violations must be paid. Impunity not only encourages the recurrence of abuses against human dignity but strips human rights and humanitarian law of their deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court can provide a measure of relief to victims and their families and affected communities. Where populations are victims of atrocities the punishment of perpetrators is crucial to enable the process of reconciliation with other groups to begin. While, ideally, atrocities should be dealt with by the national authorities of the state in which they are committed, practice has shown that governments rarely call their own citizens to account for war crimes or similar atrocities especially when those responsible occupy positions of political or military authority. The situation in regard to President Milosevic is a case in point. There was no question of his being accountable to anyone until such time as he was ousted from office. No machinery of the state could bring him to justice and he is only now facing his just desserts, whether through domestic law or the<i> ad hoc </i>tribunal in the Hague. Milosevic will be better off if his case is transferred to the Hague as the death penalty does not apply there whereas it does in his home country.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were established precisely because domestic authorities would not or could not punish those responsible for atrocities. In any event, conflicts often lead to the disruption or even disintegration of domestic legal systems. <i>Ad hoc</i> tribunals cannot substitute for a permanent war crimes court. It is not possible to predict whether the UN Security Council will always have the political will or the logistical capacity to respond to massive human rights violations. As in Ireland, there is a danger that tribunal fatigue could set in in the UN.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Under the current system, one of the main failings of international criminal law is the lack of a permanent and effective enforcement mechanism and the establishment of the International Criminal Court is, therefore, a logical step in the development of the international legal order. The court will also serve as a model of justice and act as a standard-setting institution in the area of due process and fair trial rights, while at the same time acting as a major deterrent to the perpetration of serious crimes which are an affront to mankind.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland, with our long record of UN service by our military peace-keepers, should recognise the benefit of such deterrence as providing, if not a shield, at least a measure of legal protective support for members of the Defence Forces and the Garda serving abroad. I welcome the specific reference to the role of peace-keepers and the provision that any attack on them will result in the perpetrators being brought before the International Criminal Court. We have a domestic interest in this area as many Irish people have served and will, hopefully, continue to serve as UN peace-keepers.</P>
    <P>The statute itself, comprising 128 articles, appears somewhat intimidating at first sight. However, it logically combines the various provisions agreed for establishing the seat of the court in The Hague with jurisdiction initially focusing on cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Once a definition and the conditions under which the court will exercise jurisdiction are established, the crime of aggression will also be included. I particularly welcome the special focus on crimes against women and children in the statute. The absolute prohibition of crimes such as pillage, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution and crimes against children, including enlisting them as child soldiers, is specifically outlined.</P>
    <P>Article 124 provides for an opt-out clause whereby a state may declare, on becoming a party to the statute, that it does not accept jurisdiction by the court over war crimes committed by its nationals or on its territory for a period of seven years. The Minister did not refer to the opt-out clause and I want him to give an undertaking to the House in his closing remarks that Ireland will not only refrain from exercising the opt-out clause but will raise its voice in encouraging other states to do likewise, particularly EU member states. France was primarily responsible for the inclusion of the opt-out clause and we should exert any influence we can, as EU members and colleagues of France on the Security Council, to encourage it and other countries not to invoke the clause. I am hopeful that when the court is up and running, other serious crimes such as drug trafficking and terrorism will be added to its jurisdiction arising from agreement at later review conferences. I appreciate this will take time.</P>
    <P>Until the statute is universally ratified, it will not have universal jurisdiction. Regrettably, many <Col N="924" /> of the nations on whose territory the crimes subject to the court's jurisdiction are likely to be committed or whose nationals are likely to be responsible for such crimes will not be among the early signatories to the statute. However, I hope this will be rectified in time with changes of Government.</P>
    <P>The vote in Rome brought together strange bedfellows with the United States and Iraq being among the seven who voted against the statute. Iraq's position is perfectly understandable; its tyrannical dictator, Saddam Hussein, being a prime candidate for attention by the court. I would not expect that country to join until the government changes. However, the US is in a different category. I am glad President Clinton signed up before he left office, but ratification under the new US Administration may prove problematic. Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, recently opposed accession to the statute, on the basis of protecting American men and women in uniforms from the jurisdiction of what he called &ldquo;this kangaroo court&rdquo;. It may take some time for a view to emerge in Congress which is more sensitive to international opinion. All this points to the importance of Ireland giving a lead on this issue and not dragging its feet further in the completion of the ratification process. We should become a founder member of the court in order that from that position, allied to our membership of the UN Security Council, we can encourage others to join.</P>
    <P>The idea of an international war crimes court has been in gestation for almost a century. After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles provided for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the German Emperor but Kaiser Wilhelm never stood trial. The international tribunals set up following World War II at Nuremberg and Tokyo to try major war criminals were far more successful. The Nuremberg Charter specified crimes which are still considered the key crimes under international law of crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. More important, those trials and judgments forever shattered the notion that state sovereignty could be used as a defence for acts considered outrages on the conscience of mankind.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of the genocide convention and the Geneva conventions in the late 1940s, the UN General Assembly asked the International Law Commission to examine the possibility of creating a permanent international criminal court. Unfortunately, by the time the commission produced draft statutes, further progress proved unfeasible during the political and ideological confrontations of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that it was a small country which reopened the issue at the UN in 1980. Trinidad and Tobago proposed that efforts at drafting an international criminal court statute be resumed. The focus of attention at the time was drugs trafficking which, unfortunately, had to be dropped during the final complicated nego<Col N="925" /> tiations on the statute but which, I hope, will at a later stage be included within the jurisdiction of the court.</P>
    <P>While discussions continued over the years, the Security Council enhanced the prospects of establishing a permanent court when it set up the two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals, thus signalling the international community commitment to supporting the principle of individual accountability for crimes under international law. Discussions culminated in their own statutes, setting out the terms of the treaty three years ago. Now we in Ireland have an opportunity to express our support for an international court to bring barbaric criminals to justice. Let us seize this opportunity with enthusiasm and ensure the constitutional legislation and referendum are both passed with huge majorities. This Government must also do its job by ensuring there will be no further delays in bringing forward the ancillary legislation and administrative measures to complete the process of ratifying the statute to create the international criminal court.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the questions I want dealt with by the Minister of State in his reply. I wish to know the proposed date of the referendum. Subject to the foot and mouth situation, I am very happy to have an early referendum in relation to this change in the Constitution. I would also like him to deal with the possible confusion that may arise if the four referenda are taken together. I hope everyone will support this referendum and that the same will apply in the case of the death penalty. It is obvious at this stage that will not be the case in regard to the Nice Treaty where the usual suspects are gearing themselves up to promote their anti-European approach. Clearly there will be strong opposition to the treaty and, given that some of the smaller parties will get in on the act, there will be an anti-vote in this regard.</P>
    <P>It seems clear there may be an anti-vote on the referendum on judicial conduct. I question the advisability of holding the four referenda together. I am particularly concerned that the referendum on the Nice Treaty should, first, be given an opportunity for proper discussion and, therefore, be deferred until the autumn and, second, that it should not be coupled with other referenda, thereby increasing the possible confusion that may arise or be deliberately caused in relation to the treaty.</P>
    <P>I also want the Minister of State to deal with the date of ratification of the international criminal court. I have outlined my concerns that just passing the referendum to change the Constitution does not result in automatic ratification and that other measures must be taken. I wish to know the details of these measures and the details of the ancillary legislation, when this will be circulated and when is it proposed to have it passed through the Oireachtas. I want to know the details of the administrative measures to which the Taoiseach referred. What are they? There has been a vague reference to them but no details. The House and the people are entitled to know what exactly is involved. I want an absolute assur<Col N="926" /> ance that Ireland will not declare to take the benefit of the opt-out clause 124, which a colleague described in a letter to me as the licence to kill declaration. Under no circumstances should we be involved in this. We need to be assured that we will do what we can to try to discourage others from using this clause.</P>
    <P>I want this legislation to be adopted and the referendum to go through. I also want answers to the very legitimate questions I have raised because the House is entitled to such answers. It is a basic fundamental principle when any Bill to amend the Constitution is going before the people that every piece of information which could influence their judgment should be laid before the people and the House before asking them to vote. It is wrong to begin the process of seeking to amend the Constitution, the basic law of the State, without making all the information available. That has not been done in this case and I urge the Government to do so. Based, I hope, on a positive reaction from the Government in this regard, I will be supporting whole-heartedly an approach to have the Bill accepted by the Oireachtas and approved by the people at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to indicate the Labour Party's position in favour of the speedy ratification of the establishment of the international court. I would like to make a few preliminary points on the significance which attaches to the court. I believe all parties are in favour of the coming into existence of a new institution of international justice dealing, first, with the possibility of steps being taken to achieve justice for all, second, ending impunity in relation to enormous crimes against humanity, third, the possibility of ending conflicts, fourth, its replacement of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals by a permanent structure, fifth, to take over where national criminal justice institutions are unwilling or unable to act and, sixth, its possible deterrent effect on future war criminals.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Keeffe said is interesting. The force of the new international court and the force of what it will be doing following a successful constitutional referendum, a referendum in which I would urge the public to overwhelmingly become involved and to vote in favour of, will be limited by ratification. There is a long history attached to the proposal for such a court. It goes back to Resolution 260 of 9 December 1948 when the General Assembly passed a resolution &ldquo;recognising that in all periods of history, genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity and being convinced that in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required&rdquo;. The long journey for 50 years between 1948 and 1998 tells us something about the nature of international power politics and the great difficulty issues of human concern had in surfacing in such an atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even today, it is very important that we bear in mind what is likely to happen in relation to the <Col N="927" /> court should the appropriate number of ratifications become available. Some 60 states are needed for ratification. In January 2001, more than 130 countries had signed up for the new instrument and more have done so since. At that time approximately 27 countries had ratified, in other words, the new instrument establishing the international court had made it half way through the ratification process.</P>
    <P>The most significant and contentious factor has been the attitude of the United States to the court. I need to make one point perfectly clear. The international coalition in favour of the international court of justice contains many distinguished lawyers from the United States, many non-governmental organisations and many human rights organisations with which I have had some dealings in the past. They have all been urging the coming into existence of the international court. In a report in <i>The Guardian</i> of 11 April 2001 reference was made to a recent statement by Jesse Helms, the chair of the foreign affairs committee in the United States. He called President Clinton's action an extraordinary <i>volte face</i> when in the last days of his administration, December 2000, he signed the convention. Unusually, or perhaps predictably, he did not send it to the Senate for ratification. Senator Jessie Helms described it as &ldquo;a blatant attempt by a lame duck President to tie the hands of his successor&rdquo;. He added that he had a message for the outgoing President that this decision would not stand.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic and morally courageous and we also have to exercise our friendship in a moral way. Our influence through our membership of the Security Council and with the United States with whom we have friendly relations should be such as to urge the United States to ratify the treaty. The prospects will be very bleak and the arguments being made by those in the United States, such as Senator Jessie Helms, against signing the new convention, ratifying it and bringing it into existence are singularly immoral and offensive. The attitude of Jessie Helms has been that the United States will not give jurisdiction away to try what it sees as some of its own people acting in uniform. One of the most moving posters I have ever seen during my long interest in international relations was of the My Lai massacre. Senator Helms would defend the perpetrators of that massacre by excluding such people from anything that the international court might decide. This is an unacceptable attitude. It also turns to ashes statements that are being made regarding those dictators we can identify in countries that are not in the club of geopolitical powers. There is now what someone has referred to as a &ldquo;major hyper power&rdquo;. If the international court is to be in the instrument of jurisprudence we want it to be and if it is to be the mechanism and institution of defence of children and civilians and of all groups in the family of nations, it should apply equally to all. It seems <Col N="928" /> to be an indefensibly arrogant position to suggest that it can apply to everyone on the planet, except to Americans. That is the present position of the United States, which is an unforgivable one.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that the draft treaty was significantly watered down at the conference in Rome in 1988. A number of amendments suggested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees did not find their way into the final text. A number of conditions were included which considerably reduced the impact of the treaty. There were other mechanisms about which there could be some questions &ndash;  the mechanisms of referral and discussions on what would be appropriate sanctions. Despite all this and with US involvement and influence on watering down the draft of the terms of the new international court, it was still left to the last dying hours of the Clinton administration for it to be signed in almost the full knowledge that was as far as it would get. This is very depressing.</P>
    <P>The enthusiasm for the international court is indicated by the fact that in the first six months after the original Rome conference, 73 world leaders signed up. What is even more encouraging is that 27 countries have moved to ratification. I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that the test for us is to move quickly to ratification and to put such legislation in place to enable us to do so speedily.</P>
    <P>There are other questions that arise as well. I already mentioned that one of the advantages of the court is that it brings a new institution into existence. The International Court of Justice in the Hague really deals with states rather than individuals. This new institution will be able to deal with individuals. That fills a glaring lacuna, if you like, in responsibility. Should it come to be that the court is up and running, it will deal with the issue of impunity in a much wider sense. I find it very difficult to accept that while a country has delayed its signature and is likely not to ratify, it still seems willing to identify those who might appropriately come before the court and who might be subject to its sanctions.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate on the positive achievement it is, that the court may now come into existence. The <i>ad hoc </i>tribunals in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were not sufficient and a permanent court is a major advance on that. It is, however, instructive to reflect on the establishment of even these <i>ad hoc </i>tribunals. In relation to former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, involvement came very late and Britain and the United States stood in the way of the tribunals coming into existence for a long time, which was a great pity.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of universality which is a very important test of such institutions. The institution acquires its credibility, force and greatest moral strength and strength of deterrents from it being perceived as applying to anybody who participated in any of the crimes listed. In that sense, what one can seek so clearly is that something aimed at the universal vindication of the rights of the person, is something that takes precedent over other interests, including econ<Col N="929" /> omic and military interests and the interests of particular countries within the geopolitical framework. It either does, or it does not. Those who respond to me on this matter argue that normative theories that suggest the universality of application in such a way are now no longer possible and, therefore, it is something practical and acceptable to be operating, as it were, pragmatically, that is, that some countries, some of the most powerful, will go along with the court with serious conditions pushed out in front of them or they will accept its remit when it has been seriously qualified. What that is saying is that interests are prevailing over norms and the norms of which we speak are ones of international law and international jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>It is important to try to understand why these reservations are being put in place. As I understand, the biggest worry the United States had was about the prosecution of its soldiers. For the international court to work, the support of these bigger countries is vital. The case of the Yugoslav tribunal I mentioned is also instructive. It only became effective from 1995 when the United States and the Allies got engaged on the ground in Bosnia. It is possible that the United States may yet find a way to collaborate with the international court. In practice, the US has often done this &ndash; observing provisions of treaties, including ones on the conduct of war, which is has not ratified. Even within the United States forces, there is evidence that they take the laws of war seriously and they are slightly more advanced in the preparation of manuals and so forth. What is also unfortunately true is that with the development of surrogate wars, that is, where a major country provides the armaments to lesser groups, the remit of the court would be limited. It is also tragically true that with the evolution of what has been described as high technology warfare, where, for example, one can bomb from the safety of 15,000 feet with alleged smart weapon targets that are reputedly ones participating in the war effort but which turn out to be civilians, means there is a net interest among some countries that are in possession of high technology warfare instruments to avoid the remit of the treaty altogether.</P>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, when one cuts away the rhetoric, is the new international court of justice to be aimed at those to whom it can be aimed with safety, usually developing countries and countries of the south? Will it leave completely untouched those who wage war with the greatest abuse of intelligence, science and technology that is available on the planet? It is the test of a democratic country to submit itself to the remit of the court. That is, sadly, what is at stake in the refusal of the US to ratify the court.</P>
    <P>Many of those who are anxious to adopt an international code of law and anxious about the morality of international relations are the most distinguished scholars and activists in jurisprudence in law in the US but they are not represented in the warmongering rhetoric of Jesse <Col N="930" /> Helms. The Minister must reply to questions from Deputy O'Keeffe. I would like to elaborate further on the relationship of the international court with the UN system and how matters are to be referred under the remit of the court, whether it is in terms of a decision of the Security Council, nation state or individuals. These matters are not clear. If it required, for example, a referral by the Security Council of the US, then issues of law would not prevail but rather issues of permanence on the council.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise how people can get past the imbalances that exist in regard to national jurisdictions and legal systems and processes. It is of the utmost importance that the founding principles of the court are addressed from the outset. The court must be universal in its thrust and acceptance and it must be seen as an important buttress to the international institutional framework of which the UN is the best example, even if it needs to be reformed. That is an area upon which the Government I hope will be active.</P>
    <P>It is important that the suggestion that somebody is acting, following a declaration of war or the identification of a conflict, in the name of one's country should not confer immunity. Many of us, for example, have wondered how an international legal system could be constructed given that the four major conventions of the Geneva Convention were broken in the 1940s. Are they to be exempt? Many of us witnessed the sinking of <i>The Belgrano </i>and the celebration of an act of international terrorism on the front pages of the British tabloids. If one is to say certain issues will not be before the court and the largest country will not send a diplomat to it because it does not believe in it, a framework must be constructed in the hope that such countries in time will accept the same civilised disciplines that they ask to be observed by the international community.</P>
    <P>It is my hope in regard to foreign policy and international affairs that all parties in the House will have the courage to speak about these moral concerns. Recently I witnessed an unedifying spectacle where people qualified their remarks on the rights the Aboriginal people on the basis that we should be careful about this matter because the county involved was contributing to the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The international court of justice is aimed at the legacy of Dachau and the concentration camps. The suggestion was that human rights had fallen to a low point which shocked people. It gave a great impetus to the original human rights movement. Such a court cannot be constructed to sit as an international institution that has the respect of lawyers and citizens in any part of the world and, at the same time, allowing significant exceptions to it.</P>
    <P>I have almost set a problem for the new court by saying its relationship with the UN should have been specified. There are many ways of killing matters at the UN and former President Robinson drew attention to one recently. One does <Col N="931" /> not block a matter formally but starves it to death. There is the issue of the funding of the court. I do not recollect the Minister making any reference to the mechanisms for funding it and to assurances of autonomy and its ability to work speedily, yet these are important matters.</P>
    <P>I would like to know more about the autonomy, independence and adequate funding for the prosecutor attached to the court. It would be useful if the Minister, in his reply, referred to those elements in the draft legislation that were changed before we received the final text, which will transfer jurisdiction from Ireland to the new court and on which the people in turn will be asked to vote. There are major unresolved issues, some of which had to be left aside to produce a final text. However, they are still important and should be articulated.</P>
    <P>Another unclear issue in the early draft related to the structure of penalties. I am not sure whether that draft included the death penalty. I presume that is addressed in the other constitutional amendment. Jose Ayala Lasso, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, once said that a person stands a better chance of being tried and judged for killing one human being than for killing 100,000. When we reflect on that, it is time to end the impunity of people who are involved in the crimes listed such as genocide. I welcome the listing of crimes which include, for example, sexual slavery. Slavery itself must be addressed given that 27 million people live in slavery, 20 million of whom are in bonded labour.</P>
    <P>However, there are consequences to excluding some of the major powers. In 1999 the total amount of the world's resources spent on the production of armaments was £886 billion and the total value of the drug industry was £400 billion while the budget for that which the World Heath Organisation had responsibility was £65 billion and £15 billion was spent on four preventable diseases, such as malaria, measles and TB. That gives an account of the kind of world in which we live. I will put a question which should be put in every parliament: how logical is it to leave those who produce armaments and are in charge of such a vast proportion of the world's resources which is spent on war and death outside the remit of the court?</P>
    <P>It will take a great diplomatic initiative to convince those who are reluctant to participate. As someone who is not a lawyer but is interested in the sociology of law, if one says one is ending impunity against listed crimes, then one should lift the impunity from everybody who is a possible perpetrator. If one says one will qualify it, then one must have a strong system that is an alternative which must show, for example, the execution of people with the mental age of 12 in the case of the countries which have been the slowest to sign up to the court and the most unlikely to ratify the court.</P>
    <P>If it is to help end conflicts, the new permanent institution must be put on a more open and trans<Col N="932" /> parent basis than the two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals I mentioned. If the new court is to take over where national criminal justice institutions are unwilling or unable to act, it must be borne in mind that the 31 current conflicts on the continent of Africa are not inter-state conflicts. They are internal conflicts between ethnic and tribal groups and the mechanism of referral and access to the new court will be most important.</P>
    <P>One of the areas from which the new court could draw some strength would be to eventually bring the production of arms under some control. As I said, £886 billion was spent worldwide on arms in 1999, which is approximately 65 times more than the amount spent on preventable diseases. However, all the illegal arms used in different conflicts, including the ones I mentioned in Africa, began somewhere as legal arms. They were produced by somebody. If one takes it that it is an infringement of somebody's rights to be able to trace a gun, a rocket or some means of chemical warfare, one is conferring an impunity on arms that is now being removed from individuals. In terms of the court, we should move speedily towards being able to participate. I want to be fair to the Irish diplomatic service which worked on this matter. Officials were members of the preparatory commission and they did good work in the preparation of the draft and handling the many representations that were made.</P>
    <P>In terms of the preparation for this amendment to the Constitution, several other countries signed quickly. As I said, approximately 70 signed within six months and the Canadian Government has a website that promotes the establishment of the international court. I do not want to be accused again of being anti-American or having a knee jerk reaction so I wish to point out that among those funding the coalition for an international criminal court were the Ford Foundation, the McCarter Foundation and the Open Society Institute as well as a number of governments.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, we should welcome the fact that we have an opportunity to speak out in favour of the international criminal court. We should also reflect on what it means when the largest power in the world &ndash; the hyper power &ndash; can have somebody like Jesse Helms speak for it, refer to the court as a kangaroo court and decide to take it and its people out of its remit. It challenges us because if it succeeds in this, it should not succeed in anything else that it will try at the Security Council. If we believe in the international rule of law and, most importantly, as Kofi Annan said, the right of every citizen of the world to live under the blanket of rights, we should pursue whatever diplomatic efforts can be made to ensure that the maximum international shame falls on those with the greatest resources in terms of military might but the lowest commitment to international moral decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. As the Minister pointed out, it is required because the traditional power under the <Col N="933" /> Constitution is reserved to the courts established under it. When Ireland was admitted to membership of the European Community in 1973, one of the reasons a constitutional amendment was required was to enable the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to exercise jurisdiction in matters before it concerning disputes in Ireland. The tribunal established under the Rome statute will be covered by an expressed constitutional provision, which will enable the State to ratify the Rome statute in relation to these international crimes.</P>
      <P>When the Constitution was enacted in 1937 the idea of an international crime had not been developed in any great detail in international legal jurisprudence. At the time Ireland operated as a member of the League of Nations. The Minister referred to the ideals of the League of Nations which are enshrined in Article 29 of the Constitution. It was only at the conclusion of the last world war that a decision was taken to instigate proceedings against those who were alleged to have waged aggressive war on humanity. This happened at the Nuremberg trials and because this jurisdiction was not a party to that dispute, there probably has been more criticism of them in Ireland than in most European countries.</P>
      <P>There was a serious doubt from a legal and judicial point of view about what happened at the Nuremberg tribunal because it was not clear that the offences with which various culprits were charged were defined at the time of their commission. No procedure was in place and there was no advance warning. The horror of humanity at the unspeakable atrocities and outrages committed in that most bestial of wars meant there was an understandable hue and cry for vengeance at its conclusion. However, there was always a grave doubt about the legal and judicial propriety of what happened on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Under the United Nations system, an attempt has been made since the last world war to codify principles in relation to international crimes and how these crimes can be prosecuted. One of the central defects of international law is the lack of any enforcement or ability to bring them beyond the level of diplomatic or mutual understandings and treaties between states that can be so easily dishonoured. In the period since 1945, there have been tremendous developments in the recognition of international human rights, such as the establishment of the whole system around the European convention on fundamental rights and freedoms in Europe. This has been most important in establishing a beacon and a template for the extension of civil, political and human freedoms throughout the continent of Europe. The United Nations also built on the universal declaration after the war in the covenants on civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights. All these international instruments have attempted to set a standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times, one can be frustrated when committees established to police and enforce these covenants make adverse comments about this <Col N="934" /> State. Ireland has an exemplary record by international standards in the field of human rights. It was one of the first states on the continent of Europe to accept the right of individual petition to the commission in Strasbourg under the Council of Europe system. Ireland was also one of the first states in Europe to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the court in matters pertaining to its citizens. Ireland has been to the forefront in this area. At times, one can be impatient with some of the criticism that is levelled because one's catalogue of human rights must be coloured by national cultural conditions to some extent.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with something of a different nature in this Bill, namely, the issue of international crimes and the establishment of effective enforcement machinery to ensure those who perpetrate such crimes are punished. The statute which has been submitted to us and, effectively, to the people through the medium of the referendum seeks to do that. It is a worthy proposal and it is appropriate it should be put to the people along with the Nice Treaty. One of the criticisms made of the treaty during the debate on it was that the United Nations system should be developed further. The bulk of criticism of the Nice Treaty has been that there are dangers in moving towards a regional security arrangement involving our European partners without paying attention to the problem of world government and the importance of strengthening the United Nations. This arrangement is under the aegis of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In a sense, in this referendum we are taking a real and practical step, arguably the most practical which can be taken, to strengthen the United Nations system. The step we have decided to take is to establish an international criminal code. We know laws require execution and enforcement. It is a truism of the law student that international law has always lacked an effective system of enforcement which has characterised domestic law. It is not to devalue its character as law that I say it has not had the same sanction or clarity in the minds of the population the provisions of domestic law have had where the policeman, judge, bailiff and jailer exist to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>Member states will be allowed police these offences but I note the court will be in a position to investigate an offence. This is an important provision and Deputy Michael D. Higgins touched on it previously. Many of the disputes which have arisen in former colonies throughout the world have been tribal in origin but have also involved the abuse of state power by certain tribal groupings, factions or brigands who have managed to place the apparatus of Government under their direction. It is all to the good that this new court will be in a position to investigate these matters directly and assemble proof with a view to a prosecution. It means the necessary investigative phase cannot be frustrated at the level of an individual state in the world community. I welcome this measure in so far as it provides for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> As regards the court, it will have to operate on the basis of the international rule of law. It is a milestone in the establishment of the international rule of law. The Minister and other speakers outlined the history of this matter and traced the genesis of the provisions. The simple question to be put to the people in the referendum is whether the State should ratify the statute. If so, it means that, if a perpetrator of crimes under the statute were resident in Ireland, we would be obliged to send him or her to this international tribunal for trial. It is important this country is not a haven for such persons. It is a prospect faced by many small European states with a long history of non-involvement in military quarrels that they may be a favoured haven for such parties. To that extent, ratification of this statute will send a signal to the world that Ireland will not be a welcoming place for people with that type of record.</P>
    <P>Regarding consultation of the people, this is a Bill to amend the Constitution and is one of four to be submitted to the people. There is argument about the merits of such a procedure. It is a good idea a number of questions are to be put to the people. They are sufficiently intelligent to give an answer on all of them. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution discovered, among other things, that a number of amendments to the Constitution similar to this are desirable and to which there could not be any great objection but which, for want of time for a referendum, cannot be dealt with. Ministers often have the experience of being told there is no parliamentary time for a Bill. Likewise with the Constitution, the argument has been made that there is no referendum time for an amendment to it. In effect, we have with these four amendments the provision of referendum time. I spoke on the Nice Treaty last week and it struck me that the proposal is not as contentious or controversial as has been represented and that the other three referenda do not have any great controversy attached to them, although I appreciate the Opposition has various points to make on the details of the amendment relating to the Judiciary. This constitutional amendment certainly does not occasion any controversy.</P>
    <P>I am anxious about the turnout at referenda. Deputy Owen was the sponsor of a constitutional amendment some years ago which elicited a very low turnout. It was a necessary amendment dealing with bail and giving the Houses the power to regulate that. I appeal to the Minister to consider the option of a weekend poll for these referenda. We have gone along with the practice of having a poll generally on a Thursday and occasionally on a Friday in recent years. To hold a poll on such a day is a throwback to an agricultural society which existed in Ireland 40 years ago or so and in more ancient times but which no longer exists. The movement of people throughout Dublin city and the different parts of Ireland during weekdays makes it obvious that a weekday poll is <Col N="936" /> completely unsuitable for citizens in the circumstances in which they live.</P>
    <P>This is not just a plea from a suburban Dublin Deputy, although, for the majority of voters in my constituency, the available time to cast their ballot is limited to three or four hours in the day. That is the practicality of when they can vote in any one day. Given the traffic congestion in Dublin, the difficulties of transportation, the more flexible working times which now exist and the more responsible attitudes to parenting which are encouraged across the gender boundaries, it can be seen clearly that it is very difficult for people to vote in a suburban area on a weekday. They have more time at their disposal on Saturday or Sunday.</P>
    <P>I appreciate under the relevant legislation the Minister is free to select any day, although I also appreciate the principal Churches have objected to the holding of a poll on Sunday. That is a pity. There is nothing wrong with voting. It is not a mortal sin, whatever about shopping or drinking in a pub. I had always understood voting belonged to the province of theological virtue and that the creature participated to some extent in the eternal law by casting his vote. Apparently, however, it is not right to vote on a Sunday for whatever reason. There might be some merit in that argument if we still had canvassing at polling stations, but we do not. However, I appreciate why the Government would not wish to set itself against the conscientious wishes of individuals where a referendum or election is concerned. That said, I appeal to the Church authorities to review their position on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is important for everyone that a proper sense of social obligation is developed where voting is concerned. The Government would take a step forward in that regard were it to try the experiment of a weekend poll on this occasion and I strongly urge it to do that. If Saturday were the chosen day, the polls would have to be left open until 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have difficulties on a Saturday, but the Government can consult on that to see what arrangements can be made in that regard. It is an issue we will have to address because the turnout is declining and the problem is not confined to suburban areas in Dublin. It now exists in every constituency in Ireland and when I visit provincial towns I am amazed by the number of people who commute to work over a very long distance. There is now a very large group of such voters and holding a poll on a weekday has no reality for them. It is therefore a little unfair to blame the voters for not voting when we do not facilitate the exercise, by them, of their franchise. I urge the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to examine the question of whether this poll can be conducted on a weekend.</P>

      <P>As our spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, has said, Fine Gael supports this legislation. However, it is a pity that it took the publication of a Bill by Fine Gael to stimulate the Minister to produce legislation and, when one considers that the idea of an International Criminal Court was first mooted a half a century ago, it is an indictment of all political parties that it has taken until now to fulfil a commitment given in 1948 with the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is interesting that it was Trinidad and Tobago that stimulated the debate. My history is not good enough to know why that was &ndash; were the people in those areas perhaps subjected to slaughter and genocide? However, it is an indictment of Europeans who knew the horrors of war and of the Nazi regime atrocities against the Jews, Travellers, Poles and Hungarians, that we could not have been to the forefront in ensuring that an international criminal court was established within 50 years of the adoption of article 6 of the relevant convention. One could say &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo;, but I am disappointed that since 1998, when the Statute of Rome was agreed, goodness knows what has been happening. With no disrespect to the excellent officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is not a Department on which there is a big call to produce legislation and, at the very least, this Bill to have a referendum should have been introduced much more speedily. If it had been, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform might also have got its act together and brought in the Bill to allow us to ratify this Statute. I am disappointed we do not, with this Bill, have the legislation from the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform to allow us not only to put a referendum to the people, which I assume they will vote for, but to proceed post-haste to implement the legislation. We might have another six months to wait for the legislation to come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it might even be another year, so we should not clap ourselves on the back about having got this far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 60 countries which have ratified this convention and 29 that have brought in national legislation. Ireland still has a long way to go to ensure that we are the 30th country to ratify. I give credit where it is due and there has been an increase in the speed with which we take up our responsibility to ratify and make law a number of the conventions of the UN that have been hanging around for many years. I am glad that, in my time as Minister, I legislated for a number of those conventions and it pleases me that my successor is doing the same. However, we should not praise ourselves too highly for having this legislation before us because it is well overdue and, when one considers that since July 1998 there have been opportunities for this Government to introduce this legislation, it is not a great source of joy that it is being done so late. We have to remind ourselves of what this court will do and <Col N="938" /> of the kinds of things with which it will have to deal.</P>
    <P>It was not until the war in Bosnia Herzegovina and the other areas in the former Yugoslavia that we of this generation began to realise that human nature had not changed. We now look with absolute horror at what happened during World War 2, what happened in Germany and what happened in other parts of the world and say, &ldquo;that was then, it could not possibly happen now with the international availability of information&rdquo;, but we in this House have lived through the events of 1993, 1994 and 1995 in places like Srebrenica and Rwanda, where I saw the effect of genocide. The bodies were still on the roads where they had fallen having been slashed down with machetes by people killing their next door neighbours in their own streets. Young children were exhorted to kill their neighbours, to kill children and to kill their teachers and their doctors. It is with horror that we must realise, in 50 or 100 years people will read about what happened in these places they will say, &ldquo;imagine, the EU was healthy and vibrant yet this was happening on its borders&rdquo;. It really is frightening and I am ashamed to say that we will have to take the blame for letting this happen on our watch.</P>
    <P>I decided to remind myself about it because I remember being appalled at the time Kofi Annan published his report on Srebrenica. I admired his ability to put such graphic material into the report and to accept the blame for the failure of the UN, and other international bodies, that were supposedly helping in places like Srebrenica. I decided to reread some parts of the report and in it, Kofi Annan reminds us, on 16 November 1995 the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which was established in 1993 when people began to realise what awful things were happening there, indicted Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who were both convicted for their responsibility for atrocities committed in July 1995. After a review of the evidence submitted by the prosecutor, Judge Riad stated:</P>
    <P>After Srebrenica fell to besieging Serbian forces in July 1995, a truly terrible massacre of the Muslim population appears to have taken place. The evidence tendered by the Prosecutor describes scenes of unimaginable savagery: thousands of men executed and buried in mass graves, hundreds of men and women mutilated and slaughtered, children killed before their mothers' eyes, a grandfather forced to eat the liver of his own grandson. These are truly scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human history.</P>
    <P>That is terrifying to read. It is even difficult to read in a debate like this, but that is what happened in July 1995. Think about that. In July of 1995 most of us were in this House, apart from a few elected in 1997, which is only five short years ago, and that is the description of what went on in Srebrencia with UN forces visible and trying to protect the safe areas. This report describes how <Col N="939" /> the Dutch battalion watched people being put into trucks they were not able to follow, how they heard gun shots and then found the bodies. That was on our watch, under our UN mandates and under UN Security Resolutions. It is really frightening. These are the kind of crimes over which this international court will have jurisdiction. When it is established, I hope it will act as a force for good in countries whose leaders perpetrate such crimes against their own people.</P>
    <P>Along with some colleagues, I have just returned from a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union. One of the issues discussed at the special meeting of women parliamentarians there was the protection of women and children in times of conflict, and the growth in the use of rape and sexual assault as an act of war. The descriptions of people who have witnessed such acts were shocking. The bodies of young girls have been ravaged by the act of rape. Their little bodies have been destroyed forever and they will never have the opportunity of bearing children of their own. Young women have been raped and left with babies born from such violent acts. We heard about the difficulties they encountered &ndash; loving their baby yet knowing it had been conceived in this kind of violence. Mothers watched their daughters being raped, and young girls watched their mothers being raped. We must describe what has been done by soldiers perpetrating these crimes in various countries. I am glad the analysis of war crimes now includes descriptions of sexual assault, rape, pillage, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution and the use of child soldiers. All of this forms part of the kind of crimes with which I hope the new international court will be able to deal.</P>
    <P>We have <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals in the Hague dealing with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and at Arusha in Tanzania dealing with war crimes in Rwanda. After a slow start they are doing good work and people are being prosecuted. I hope we will see Milosevic being brought before the tribunal in The Hague. In the absence of a permanent international court, and with tribunals being established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, there is always a danger that the murderous evil people who perpetrate such crimes may not be called to justice. That is why I am glad that, even though it is somewhat late, we are putting in place this referendum legislation so that we can put this issue to the people. As Deputy Lenihan said, I hope people will turn out to show their disgust at what has been happening in the world in their time.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that there are other crimes, including sanctions, which may not necessarily be war crimes. We have to guard against such crimes so that they do not become instruments for punishment causing damage to populations. The use of sanctions is a relatively new concept and up to recently had been used in South Africa. Now, however, sanctions are operating in about ten international jurisdictions but there is no UN system to constantly monitor <Col N="940" /> their effects. Such a system could ensure that what was established in good faith as an instrument to attack a tyrant like Saddam Hussein, could not be used to punish a country's population. In future, a case may be made to an international court that such sanctions constitute a force for evil rather than good. It was for that reason that during the debate on the UN sanctions in Iraq, I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take a lead in the Security Council by calling for an end to those sanctions. We must find some other way to attack Saddam Hussein and let him know that we do not support what he is doing. We know the UN sanctions in Iraq have led to the deaths of 500,000 children. Those sanctions cannot be a force for good. They are ceasing to be a punishment against Saddam Hussein, which is what they were originally designed to be, so it is time we lifted them.</P>
    <P>In Zimbabwe, we see President Mugabe using his power to negate human and civil rights, and do down his country's courts of justice. There is not a war going on in Zimbabwe but I hope the international criminal court can investigate what is happening there. Built into the Statute of Rome is a provision whereby every seven years there will be a full review of how the court is operating. We may have to tell leaders of such countries that while there may not be a conflict going on, their acts in Government are leading to a gross violation of people's human and civil rights. We will have to examine a method whereby the international community can demonstrate its disgust for that kind of action. It is not enough for countries to say they are democratic and to participate in democratic fora.</P>
    <P>Many of the countries represented at the recent IPU conference which I attended, were voting for motions but I would be ashamed if I were from such countries which pretend to be democratic. I heard delegates from Iran and Algeria saying how wonderful things are in their countries but some Members of this House know, from personal experience, about the lack of human rights in some of those countries. There is a lack of rights for women in Iran and Iraq, for instance, yet these countries can participate with impunity in international fora without receiving any sanction for continuing to violate human rights.</P>
    <P>We heard about slavery at the IPU meeting and have heard the same here from Trócaire which ran its Lenten campaign against slavery. Slavery is a crime that can be tried under the new international court. In fairness to the countries where slavery is most rife, it is not being caused by Governments. However, lack of action and acquiescence by some Governments allows slavery to continue in their jurisdictions. When the new international court is established they may have to re-examine what action they are taking to prevent millions of people having to live their lives as slaves for generations. Slavery is a crime against humanity.</P>
    <P>I am glad this referendum is to be held and I appeal to the public to vote for it. I am also glad <Col N="941" /> that the legislation sponsored by Fine Gael stimulated the Minister into taking some action. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to urge her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to introduce the necessary legislation when this referendum has been passed. If the Minister was on this side of the House he would be ranting and raving about the delay involved and, God knows, I suffered enough from that. Will the Minister tell us exactly when it is hoped to hold the referendum?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Lenihan. The referendum on the Treaty of Nice should be on a separate day. I am nervous about some of the other referenda being held on the same day as that for the Treaty of Nice. The treaty contains many issues about which people require a full explanation and they will need to concentrate on those issues alone. This referendum, however, can be held with the other two but it should be handled in such a way that people will understand what they are doing. They should overwhelmingly give their support to it. I fear that if all the referenda are taken together there might be a low turnout. In addition, a low &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on one referendum may carry over into another referendum. This referendum should be overwhelmingly supported in order to get the international criminal court up and running. In that way, this generation will not be indicted by future generations for having failed to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The variety of amendments to our Constitution, which are set to be put to the people in future referenda, are important. We have to hold a referendum to enact the provisions of the Nice Treaty. That is in line with past referendums to implement the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Maastricht Treaty, the Single European Act and the original accession treaty for Ireland to join the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution Bill will remove from our Constitution all references to the death penalty. I fully support that provision because it is important that we take a strong stand on the issue of the death penalty. Recent statistics published by the United Nations demonstrated that the number of cases in which the death penalty has been invoked across the world is on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill entails putting in place procedures to guarantee that the conduct of the Judiciary in this <Col N="942" /> State will be of the highest standard. That is extremely important and it is equally important that the division lines between the way the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature operate are clearly drawn. It is on the issue of the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, to which I will now turn.</P>
    <P>This amendment is proposed to enable the State to ratify what is known as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which was brought into effect on 17 July 1998. The statute was signed by the vast number of members of the United Nations when they met in Rome in July 1998. The statute provides for the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>This International Criminal Court will have the specific jurisdiction to try persons charged with the most serious crimes, namely, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. The court, when it is established, will be complementary to all national criminal jurisdictions. The statute of the court is an international agreement which will come into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it.</P>
    <P>The statute may be ratified by Ireland only when all measures necessary to enable the State to meet key legal obligations have been completed. The Attorney General has advised the Government that an amendment to the Constitution is required to enable Ireland to ratify this statute. That is mainly because the submission to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court would entail a partial transfer to this court of the sovereign power of the State to administer criminal justice.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution lays down specific rules with regard to the administration of justice. We know the role the Director of Public Prosecutions plays in this regard and the role the Attorney General plays in prosecuting specific criminal matters. The setting up of the International Criminal Court is one of the most significant developments of international law since the Second World War. Once it is established, it will obviate the need for the creation of <i>ad hoc</i> international criminal tribunals such as those which were established in the 1990s in respect of the atrocities perpetrated in the former Republic of Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court has been supported by Ireland and its partners in the European Union for many years. The EU has undertaken to assist countries associated with it to ratify the Rome Statute in order to facilitate the early establishment of this court. Ireland's support for the International Criminal Court fits in fully with the principles of our foreign policy. We have been an active participant within the United Nations ever since we became a full member of the UN in 1955. We have supported UN peacekeeping operations throughout the world over the past 45 years and we continue to do so. We know the great service our troops have given in Lebanon, <Col N="943" /> Cyprus and in the former state of Yugoslavia. With more regional conflicts opening up around the world, it is important that mechanisms under the auspices of the United Nations are put in place so that the necessary peacekeeping operations can be established.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports peacekeeping operations once they are carried out under the auspices of the United Nations, and we will continue to do so. Irish troops have served in countries where persons who have committed war crimes are now being tried by courts set up by the United Nations. I do not support the setting up of <i>ad hoc</i> international criminal tribunals alone when an opportunity can be availed of to set up a permanent international structure.</P>
    <P>It is without doubt that the setting up of the International Criminal Court will command widespread public support. We have seen too many cases where persons who committed serious war crimes have walked away with impunity. That situation cannot and must not continue for ever. If the United Nations as an international body is to command the full support of our people, it is imperative that it supports the setting up of international structures which command widespread public support. It is certainly the case that key UN bodies such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the International Labour Organisation and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades are examples of international bodies under the auspices of the UN which carry out effective, international duties.</P>
    <P>It is an accepted fact that the United Nations and the international community have failed to prosecute war criminals in the 1990s. We all saw the butchery, savagery and slaughter which took place in Rwanda in 1994. The United Nations set up an <i>ad hoc</i> international tribunal but only a handful of people have been successfully prosecuted. We should recall that within a 100 day period 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda. The western world ignored warnings from top political personnel in Africa about the upcoming butchery that would take place in Rwanda. The western world and the United Nations Security Council turned their backs on the victims which allowed the Tutsi population in Rwanda to be brutalised and exterminated <i>en masse</i>.</P>
    <P>The killing of 800,000 people is certainly a triumph for evil. What is nearly equally as evil is that there has been such a grotesque lack of criminal prosecutions for this mass slaughter. The <i>ad hoc</i> international criminal tribunal in Rwanda is ineffective. That is also the reason we should support setting up an International Criminal Court because a more experienced and permanent international criminal court would effectively prosecute more criminals such as those who committed the acts of atrocity in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>It remains disturbingly easy for people to do nothing, even when faced with evidence of the kind of pure, unambiguous genocide that occurred in Rwanda. That is why I support the <Col N="944" /> efforts of the European Union and other key member states to set up this International Criminal Court. Such a court will send strong messages to prospective war criminals that the United Nations will prosecute them for criminal acts.</P>
    <P>Equally, an International Criminal Court would be the forum in which to try war criminals who have committed war crimes in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. For the first time since World War II we witnessed a war on the borders of the European Union. The European Union did not succeed in stopping the fighting and the events that took place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia highlighted the failure of world diplomacy. Criminals who should have faced prosecution have walked away with impunity. I hope that the Hague tribunal, which is now trying war criminals, will succeed in bringing a number of them to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Collins for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs in bringing forward this amendment to the Constitution which will, in effect, ratify the Rome Statute and establish a new international institution. Such an institution has been anticipated for some time. It has been promised for the past 50 years and has been in preparation for the past three or four years. I am glad that 139 states have now signed the statute and 29 have ratified it so we can expect to see this institution established in a very short time. I am glad that there are 13 parts and 128 articles in the Rome Statute which cover all the areas in need of attention.</P>
      <P>While the statute was a long time in preparation, action has, nevertheless, been taken in respect of some of the international problems to which other Members referred such as the events that took place in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Even though there has been a lack of progress in establishing the international criminal court, a number of issues of extreme importance have not been neglected. The Minister outlined in great detail the various developments that have taken place in the area of international law. These developments have been extremely important in terms of helping to establish the rule of law internationally and to deal with the effects of many of the humanitarian disasters that have occurred throughout the world in recent years.</P>
      <P>The international criminal court, which will deal with crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, is long overdue. I am satisfied the initiatives that have been taken will ensure that it will be established in a short period. However, there are a number of matters which require clarification and I hope the Minister will comment on them when he replies to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these is that there will be 18 judges working at the international criminal court and that this may inhibit its work. I am sure there must be provision to increase the number of judges. I raise this point because the European Court of Human Rights &ndash; a long-established <Col N="945" /> institution based at Strasbourg &ndash; as a result of the enlargement of the Council of Europe, which now has between 41 and 43 members following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the emergence of new democracies in central and eastern Europe, has an enormous backlog of cases with which it has not dealt. There are insufficient numbers of advocates and judges to deal with these cases and the courts are stumbling from crisis to crisis. If remedial action is not taken, there will be major delays and a major backlog of cases.</P>
    <P>Originally there were 11 members of the Council of Europe but there are now 42 or 43. As a result, the European Court of Human Rights will be obliged to deal with an increasing number of matters. The court is experiencing these difficulties because of the inadequacy of budgets and the absence of personnel to deal with cases. I highlight this matter because I believe the international criminal court may face problems similar to those being encountered by the European Court of Human Rights. Is the Minister satisfied that the budget allocated to the international criminal court will be adequate to allow it to deal with the matters that will come before it? Will 18 judges be sufficient to deal with the number of cases that will come before the court when it is established on a permanent basis?</P>
    <P>As already stated, a number of <i>ad hoc</i> committees were set up to deal with situations which arose, for example, in Yugoslavia. Will the Minister indicate whether the international court has sufficient powers to allow it to bring war criminals before it? As Members are aware, Slobodan Milosevic, who committed such horrific crimes, has still not been brought before the courts in The Hague. He has been brought before the courts in Yugoslavia to face criminal charges but he has managed to evade the main charges of war crimes and crimes of genocide levelled against him by the courts in The Hague. In establishing an international institution to deal with matters such as those to which I refer, we must ensure it has the power to deal with an individual such as Slobodan Milosevic &ndash; I am not singling him out because there are many others like him &ndash; even if the state in whose jurisdiction he resides is not prepared to bring him before it.</P>
    <P>Will the international criminal court be empowered to hear the cases of people who are detained in their home countries and can these individuals be brought before it to have their cases dealt with? If it will have such powers, what will be the position in relation to the enforcement of judgments? I am not certain that the court will have adequate powers to enforce any judgment at which it might arrive. It is long past time that we should establish this international institution based on the Rome statute. How will the court operate in practice if the powers of the statute in respect of the enforcement of judgments are not adequate and if it is not possible to ensure that those guilty of terrible crimes against humanity cannot be brought before the court or tried in <Col N="946" /> areas outside the court's jurisdiction? Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I find with statutes such as that under discussion is that there is always a need to compromise and this whittles away the real power of institutions. We are often left with institutions which do not have the necessary enforcement powers and which experience long delays in making people appear before them. In certain cases, such institutions find it impossible to make witnesses and accused persons appear.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. I appreciate the work being done by Justin Harmon, Ireland's Ambassador in Strasbourg, who has been chairing a sub-committee which is endeavouring to deal with the lack of finance and personnel that has caused the backlog of cases waiting to come before the court. If we establish an international criminal court and do not put in place the adequate human and financial resources, our efforts will be wasted. However, I am sure that will not be the case. I compliment the Minister on expediting this legislation and I hope it will be passed by the Houses as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill which will enable us to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and which requires an amendment to the Constitution. I hope the enactment of the legislation will lead to endorsement by the people in the referendum and that, soon after, Ireland's name shall be added to those of the 29 states that have ratified or acceded to the statute. This will bring nearer the day when the necessary 60 states will bring a permanent international court into existence.</P>
      <P>The new international criminal court will be securely anchored to the United Nations and owes its birth to the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries, at which the statute was adopted. This country has advocated the establishment of such a court for many years but, unfortunately, it has taken 50 years to reach the stage at which we now find ourselves. The link to the United Nations is of fundamental importance, particularly for small countries such as ours. The UN, with all its imperfections, is still the best guarantee of protection, fairness in world affairs and protection of the weak against the strong. It is more important than Europe in that context and I am a confirmed European and European federalist. I support the protection of our European institutions and I want Europe to play as important a role as possible in the world. However, on this issue the United Nations is paramount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we are a small country with no military muscle, we exercise an influence in the world through our membership of the UN and the EU. That influence was greatly increased recently by our membership of the UN Security Council. Let us be realistic and clear about our position. In international affairs, adherence to the UN and its resolutions must remain the base and benchmark <Col N="947" /> of our activities. This must be understood, particularly by countries such as the United States who, on most occasions, we support almost automatically, but who, unfortunately, are often tempted to adopt a cavalier attitude to UN resolutions. It is important we know exactly where we stand in relation to the United Nations and its resolutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support this Bill and the proposal to set up an international criminal court. However, my enthusiasm does not blind me to the fact that the proposed court has its weaknesses. Unfortunately, as always, only the losers will be amenable. Winners invariably write history and while they remain winners, they escape the punishment for their crimes. That is unfortunately one of the lessons of history.</P>
    <P>The Germans and the Japanese suffered for the atrocities committed by them in the Second World War. Their political and military leaders deserved to suffer for their atrocities, particularly the Germans for the liquidation of almost six million Jews. However, the winners were also responsible for dreadful atrocities which would have justified their appearance before this type of international court if it had been in existence then. Were the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki justified? They were not justified in any circumstances but not in circumstances where the defeat of Japan was already inevitable. If this court had been in existence then and if there had been fairness in charging those responsible for war crimes, would those responsible for the mass bombing of the German civilian population in cities without any military significance, such as Dresden, been charged as war criminals? </P>
    <P>I remember getting a moving account of what it was like in Dresden during the bombing from my uncle who was born in Glasgow and was drafted, against his will, into the army during the war. He was captured and became a prisoner of war in Dresden. He was one of the prisoners of war who was sent out during the bombing to rescue the civilian population. That dreadful time and atrocity lived in his memory. Were those responsible for that atrocity not war criminals? Should the Bomber Harris not have shared the same fate as the Germans or Japanese who were responsible for similar crimes? If the Bomber Harris was arraigned, what about the political leaders under whose direction he operated? In what category would that have put Churchill and Truman who took the decision on the atomic bombs? However, Churchill, the Bomber Harris and Truman were winners and they made the rules.</P>
    <P>Will the ratification of the International Criminal Court make a difference if, unfortunately, something similar happens in the future? I hope so but it will require great changes in the attitude of humanity. One hopes the existence of this court will be a deterrent and that politicians and generals who contemplate these crimes will be afraid that if they lose they will be held respon<Col N="948" /> sible and will suffer the consequences. However, in a hypothetical future, will such people ensure they do not lose and that they eradicate the enemy root and branch by using whatever methods are necessary to achieve that? In those circumstances, an arraignment before an international court will not become a deterrent to such activity but an incentive to do it properly.</P>
    <P>There is the problem that if they do not win but are not totally defeated, it may be difficult to make them amenable to justice. There was a reference to Slobodan Milosevic and the problems involved in making him amenable in circumstances where one would have thought it would have been reasonably easy to do so. What about the Saddam Husseins of the future? Will they continue to evade justice? Unfortunately, the lessons of history, of the real world and of <i>realpolitik </i>must intrude on our vision in this respect. What does one do when there is not a total defeat? What can be done about people who have not won, but it is not transparent they have lost, and how can they be made amenable to this court in the future? </P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Garda Reform: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Howlin on Tuesday, 10 April 2001:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognising the escalating impact of crime on our citizens and recognising, in particular, the continuing and unacceptably high level of murder, gangland shootings, intimidation, drug dealing, joy-riding and public disorder afflicting both urban and rural communities;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;believing that crime is demoralising people, terrifying our elderly and destroying the lives of many young people and that to tackle crime we need an efficient and effective police force operating in and with the full confidence, support and co-operation of the population it serves;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledging that the Garda Síochána has served us well since the foundation of the State, that its bravery, particularly in standing up to the threat posed by the IRA and other paramilitaries, must never be forgotten but believing that, like every other organisation, the Garda has to change and evolve, in accordance with principles of accountability and modernisation;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;aware that at present the Garda operates under legislation dating back to 1925 and that since society and the demands of pol<Col N="949" /> icing, have changed radically in the past 75 years, it is therefore time the law governing the Garda changed as well;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;affirming that an essential part of that change is the forging of a new relationship between the Garda Síochána and the communities it serves so that those communities are involved in deciding policing priorities in consultation and real partnership with the Garda;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;convinced that policing works best when it is based on partnership between local people and the local gardaí and aiming therefore to give ownership of our policing strategy back to the community;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;conscious of the danger that, in the absence of such close liaison, paramilitaries and vigilantes are in a position to organise in recognition of the unmet need of local communities and to take the law into their own hands;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting also the need for a new system for investigating complaints levelled against the Garda;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;bearing in mind the comprehensive package of recommendations proposed by the Patten Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, many of which are of direct relevance and applicability in this jurisdiction;</P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his inaction in the area of systematic reform of policing, both at legislative and administrative level; calls upon the Minister to introduce a legislative package of reform, including at least the following three elements so as radically to reform policing in Ireland&ndash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>) the establishment of a new Garda Authority, to set the priorities for fighting crime at national level, to make the key decisions relating to policing more open and accountable, to be responsible for senior appointments in the Garda Síochána and to receive and consider reports from the Garda Commissioner on operational decisions,</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>b</i>) the establishment of county policing liaison committees, to agree a county or city policing plan, with regular meetings between the committee and local gardaí to monitor progress and address the concerns of local communities, and</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>c</i>) the abolition of the Garda Complaints Board, the role and functioning of which is widely agreed to be unsatisfactory, and its replacement with a Garda Ombudsman to be responsible for investigating complaints against the Garda, such an officer to be provided with his own staff and to be responsible <Col N="950" /> for a new, independent system for ensuring Garda accountability; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">calls also for a significant increase in Garda resources and personnel so as adequately to equip the force to meet the challenges which it faces.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1: </P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;&ndash;welcomes the substantial decrease in serious crime of the order of 25% since the Government took office and the role which the Garda Síochána has played in bringing this about;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the unprecedented level of resources which have been made available to the Garda Síochána including the increase of £226 million, 48%, in the Garda Vote from £472 million in 1997 to £698 million in the current year; by the end of this year the strength of the Garda Síochána will be close to 11,800, which represents an increase of approximately 1,000 gardaí since the Government took office and is well on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by 2002;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges that for the first time, the Garda Síochána has the resources and equipment to enable it to police not only the streets of this country but also our waterways and airspace;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;endorses the measures that have been adopted on the basis of the additional funding in the sum of £87 million allocated under the national development plan for crime prevention directed towards young offenders; in that context youth diversion projects have already been successfully established and others are on the way;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the expansion of the Garda CCTV programme for which £12 million has been allocated over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million allocated in 2001;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises the provision of substantial additional resources to other areas of the criminal justice system to underpin the work of the Garda Síochána including increasing the number of prison places by 1,207 to date, with approximately 700 additional closed places on the way;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges the significant structural reforms being made to the criminal justice system through, for example, the appointment of additional judges, the establishment of the Courts Service and the Prisons Service and the signifi<Col N="951" /> cant progress which is being made in reforming the administration of the Garda Síochána particularly through the strategic management initiative;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the important steps that have been taken in relation to dealing effectively with crime through the establishment of the national crime forum and the national crime council;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;supports the measures that have been put in place and the results that have been achieved in connection with the establishment of the witness protection programme;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges the successful operations undertaken by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the excellent results it has secured;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;approves of the intention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward at an early date considered proposals to improve arrangements for the making of complaints against the Garda Síochána</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises the underpinning of the work of the Garda Síochána through the Government's unprecedented and comprehensive programme of criminal law reform;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges that the Garda Síochána has served the country well since the foundation of the State particularly in dealing with threats to the State;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the high level of support among the community for the Garda Síochána and </P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;approves the Government's continuing commitment to give priority to resource structural and legislative measures to build on the significant advances which have been made in the fight against crime.</P>

      <P>Last night in his speech the Minister referred to the increased strength of the Garda Síochána and said he hoped it would have increased to 12,000 by 2002. I do not know where the Minister is putting these people because every community of which I am aware is crying out for extra and replacement gardaí. Will the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation relay the message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he should <Col N="952" /> prioritise the areas undergoing radical development? I am talking about the greater Dublin area and places in north Wicklow, such as Blessington, Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy, which should be catered for in the allotment of additional gardaí.</P>
      <P>He speaks about bringing in the CCTV system. This has been announced by the Minister on several occasions, but it is still not operable. Last weekend in Bray, the tyres of 25 to 30 cars were slashed on the Florence and Galtrim roads. If this system, announced more than two years ago, had been in place, these incidents might not have occurred. The Minister has been in office almost four years; it is important that he expedites this.</P>
      <P>Some of my colleagues and Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the shortage of gardaí in the Tallaght area. This is causing grave difficulties for us in Wicklow and Carlow where gangs leave Tallaght at all hours of the morning and come down to rob commercial premises on a repeat basis. Some shop owners have had their premises robbed twice in the one week by the same group and nothing seems to happen. They despair that this Government is doing anything to assist them.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, is here now. Any young person that I come across can tell me where drugs are available. The Minister will say there is an onus on us to report this information to the Garda. I do not know what efforts the Garda are making to apprehend the individuals that are supplying drugs. There are many night clubs not too far from here that are assisting in and perhaps even promoting the use of illegal drugs.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the spirit of Deputy Howlin's motion. I have some problems with some parts and I will outline these in my comments. There is a serious problem with crime. Even if the Minister wants to delude himself, crime is rampant especially weekend violence in our towns. Tullamore, Clara, Portlaoise, Birr, Kilcormac, Portarlington and Edenderry are different towns across my constituency that suffer from this. The people in Laoighis-Offaly are generally law abiding. Policing is not being provided at an adequate level to help to combat the violence at weekends. I am reasonably fit and in good health but on occasions I am nervous walking the streets of these towns at night. That should not happen. Garda overtime needs to be increased at weekends and there needs to be sufficient manpower. We need groups of gardaí that are mobile and able to move from one area to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the Patten report recommendations and policing here is that our police force is unarmed and the gardaí are <Col N="953" /> members of the community and represent of all sections of it. I would not like to see the Garda Síochána working under a local authority or having elected political representatives or other local organisations directing day to day administration of policing.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear more detail about the establishment of county policing liaison committees, to agree a county or city policing plan, with regular meetings between the committee and local gardaí.</P>
      <P>I have had many dealings with the Garda Complaints Board and I find it reasonably satisfactory. Where a fictitious or malicious action or claim is brought by a citizen against a member, then the garda who suffers this complaint should have some come back to defend his good name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I have a sister and had an uncle in the Garda Síochána as well as many other relatives. I have nothing but the highest of respect for the force. The Garda Síochána has served us very well. As a Fine Gael person, it is a source of great pride for me that it was the founders of this party that set up the Garda Síochána. It is an exemplary unarmed force.</P>
      <P>This motion is fairly expansive. There is room for more community involvement in the Garda Síochána especially on policy making. We could model some changes on what is being proposed for Northern Ireland. Having policing boards in the various areas could be replicated here. If there is one weakness now, it is that we, as politicians, are not involved in policing policy. We are involved in health, local authorities and education but not in policing and I would see a very positive role for the community and for politicians to get involved with the policing boards that are envisaged in the Labour Party motion.</P>
      <P>It is important that the integrity of the Garda is at all times protected. Recently in my constituency, another political party carried out investigations into various crimes, mostly burglaries. This is totally unacceptable in any democracy. We must not allow the authority of the Garda Síochána to be undermined. I ask the Minister to tell us if the report, which he sought, is now ready.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs problem developed as a result of the inability of the Garda Síochána to deal with it. Things got out of hand and control, in many cases, was taken by the vigilantes who were seen to be able to respond more dramatically and effectively. We need to be careful of this because <Col N="954" /> it is something that threatens the whole concept of our democracy.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in street violence and incidents occur with alarming regularity. There is great concern among parents who sit at home at night wondering whether their teenage children are safe. This is something that affects our entire society. What is most alarming is the number of fatalities arising from these incidents. Something has to be done as a matter of extreme urgency to deal with this before it gets completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>Those issues affect everybody in the country and I ask, in support of the motion, that something be done about it.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ryan, O'Flynn, Power, Kitt and P. Carey.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for bringing this motion before the House. It provides a great opportunity for the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, and the Government to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the many advances he has made since taking office in 1997. He has increased the strength of the Garda from 10,800 to 11,800, a figure that will shortly rise to 12,000, and 2,000 extra prison spaces are now on stream. The CCTV schemes evident throughout Dublin are having a very valuable effect on reducing crime in and around our main thoroughfares in the Temple Bar area, James's Street and Dublin south central in general.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is giving consideration to allowing smaller schemes of CCTV to operate in areas experiencing social problems. Grant assistance will be given to people in such areas who may not be able to afford such a system. These communities, working in conjunction with the local authorities will have in place systems which operate so well in other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the community gardaí working in areas such as Rialto, Dolphin's Barn, Fatima Mansions and St. Michael's Estate where drugs problems were prevalent not too long ago. They have become part of the community working with the people and public representatives to help address crime in these areas. Their efforts have resulted in a reduction in crime there. We must also address the problems experienced with children in the 15 to 17 year old group. The families of these children think they are the brightest and best in the world but they are out late at night throwing bottles and creating problems for others. It is a very difficult problem but we must ensure we provide whatever resources are necessary to deal with it. People living in a particular area of my constituency have had to move as a result of the mayhem created by these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Timmins and Shatter said yesterday that the Minister was trying to score cheap political points by referring to the Patten Commission and what is happening in Northern Ireland. I <Col N="955" /> refute that allegation. Deputy Howlin validly referred to the situation in Northern Ireland and the Minister then addressed the issue. He addressed the problem raised in the motion and said he does not agree that the ombudsman system would be appropriate in the Republic. He also expressed his intention to bring forward legislation regarding a new complaints mechanism within which everyone recognises that problems exist. It was wrong of Fine Gael Deputies to politicise that very vital important element. The matter was raised and was properly addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am keenly aware of the vital role which the Garda play in the formulation and delivery of this strategy, through its involvement on the national drugs strategy team and at a local level through its very active participation on the local drugs task forces which were established in the areas worst affected by the heroin problem. The establishment of the local drugs task forces, with a remit to design and oversee the implementation of a strategy to address the drug problem at a local level has been acknowledged as an important milestone in the fight against drugs, particularly heroin misuse. The great innovation with the task forces is that for the first time, the relevant statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sectors were able to work together to address the complex issues surrounding the drug problem. In this regard the Garda Siochána should be praised for the enthusiasm with which it has adopted a pro-active approach to making this partnership process work in practice.</P>
      <P>The task force initiative has done much to strengthen and, in some cases, rebuild relations between the Garda and the local community and this has resulted in a much greater level of co-operation &ndash; the type of co-operation which is necessary in apprehending drug dealers and curbing supply. The Garda Siochána has made important strides in recent times to improve relations and communications with local communities. The term community policing has been defined as a new philosophy, based on the concept that police officers and private citizens working together can help solve contemporary community problems related to crime, fear of crime, social and physical disorder and neighbourhood decay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The launch, last year, of the pilot community policing forum in the south inner city district was a strong indication of the commitment of the Garda to this new philosophy. The main objectives of the forum are to create dialogue between the Garda and the local community; to seek the views of the local community in relation to their concerns on crime and policing; to hold formal meetings of the community police forum to pro<Col N="956" /> vide solutions to concerns raised through dialogue and action within an agreed time frame; and to provide formal feedback through meetings of the community police forum.</P>
    <P>The forum is providing a formal mechanism to respond to issues around drug dealing through communication and transfer of information in a structured way, aimed at reducing the supply and availability of drugs. The success of the initiative depends very much on the participation of everyone working together to achieve results. Knowing the communities involved in the south-east inner city area as I do, there is never any difficulty in generating community participation in this kind of process. I look forward to this community policing forum expanding into other areas.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as this are vitally important as a way of encouraging local groups to play an active and constructive role in protecting their communities from drug dealing and related anti-social behaviour and in helping to promote good relations between the community and statutory agencies. Law enforcement and interdiction are crucial elements of this Government's national drugs strategy. However, this strategy, with its emphasis on local partnership and a multi-disciplinary approach, recognises that enforcement measures no matter how successful are not the sole solution. A vitally important element of the current drugs strategy are those measures aimed at preventing young people from becoming involved in drug misuse in the first instance. In this regard, the Garda should again be commended for the manner in which they have engaged with young people at risk through the 51 diversionary projects which have been established throughout the country. These projects have proven very effective in reaching out to young people who are most at risk of crime and drugs misuse and engaging them in a programme of recreational and developmental activities designed to divert them from the dangers of drugs and crime. These projects are further evidence of the willingness of gardaí to adopt a preventative approach to tackling crime and demonstrate their commitment to engaging with communities in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Justice. Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the priority he has attached to the drug problem. This Government has committed an unprecedented level of resources to tackling this problem across all Departments and agencies, particularly the Garda Siochána and the various initiatives which they have undertaken in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As an elected Member of the Oireachtas I view it as sickening that some members of the country's second largest democratic party seem intent on damaging confidence in the Garda Síochána. Deputy Jim Mitchell, the current Deputy Leader of the Fine Gael Party, has questions to answer in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the State police force was officially launched in 1924 it has been a source of great <Col N="957" /> pride to all who served in its ranks that the political independence of the Garda has not ever been questioned. This was the case until Deputy Jim Mitchell, a former Minister for Justice, sought to blacken the name of the Garda Síochána in a perverse point scoring exercise. Deputy Mitchell's scurrilous claim that political pressure had been applied, by members of the Government, on the Garda Síochána to arrest a person prior to the Presidential election has not been withdrawn. I see it as an affront to a democracy that the deputy leader of the main opposition party has alleged that arrests made by the Garda were a measure of political convenience for the Government. I challenge him to state whether he stands over those comments.</P>
    <P>Last year a senior Garda told <i>The Independent</i> that Garda operations had never been subject to political interference during the lifetime of this Government or the rainbow Government. I call on Deputy Mitchell to come to the House and apologise for the gross disservice his remarks have done to gardaí. His outrageous suggestion, that the arrests made by gardaí investigating the leaking of confidential Government material during an election campaign were politically motivated, is a dangerous slur on both the Government and senior members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>All in public life have an obligation not to undermine the institutions of the State which they exhort the people to uphold. Deputy Jim Mitchell's slight on the political independence and integrity of the Garda Síochána runs down the forces of law and order. As far back as 1991, the president of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors felt compelled to say that comments Deputy Mitchell made about the Garda handling of a case involving the stabbing of an Englishman on O'Connell Bridge were disgraceful.</P>
    <P>At the time of the rainbow Government, the ineptitude of Fine Gael and Labour Ministers, and their unwillingness to give the Garda the resources and power they needed, saw a situation develop where drug barons and criminal gangs could act with impunity. Rather than criticise his party's inadequate response, Deputy Mitchell chose to lay the blame at the door of hardworking members of the police force. He is on record as saying that he is puzzled by the lack of action by gardaí over recent years when complaints of drug dealing were passed on to them. He said that what was needed was some outside oversight of gardaí such as an independent body. Does this sound familiar?</P>
    <P>In a further attempt to deflect attention from the rainbow's incompetent response to the deteriorating crime situation, Deputy Mitchell went on to call for a shake up in the way the Garda Síochána is run. AGSI president, Mr. John Durkan, said Deputy Mitchell's use of the words &ldquo;lethargic&rdquo; and &ldquo;incestuous&rdquo; in relation to the Garda were completely unacceptable and showed his contempt for the gardaí. The AGSI viewed Deputy Mitchell's remarks as so unacceptable <Col N="958" /> that they called for his resignation from the Dáil. Deputy Mitchell's response was another calculated insult. He said that he would like to see outsiders from the private sector and overseas police forces appointed to the Garda. The clear implication from Deputy Mitchell was that the police force is incapable and that it was necessary to go outside the jurisdiction to bring new ideas and methods to the force.</P>
    <P>In the lifetime of this Dáil, Deputy Mitchell's contempt for the Garda has reached a new low. Only last year he called gardaí sloppy and lacking in respect.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to support the Government amendment and to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the fine work he is doing in the Department. We can never be complacent about crime and there is not an acceptable level of crime, but the situation has improved greatly since this Government took office. At the last election, we said we would cut <Col N="959" /> crime and Deputy O'Donoghue as Minister has delivered on this promise in a comprehensive way. He deserves great credit for the steps he has taken and for his readiness to use the full machinery of Government to protect people and neighbourhoods from crime and the fear of crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister's overriding aim is to rebuild Ireland's civic society. His aim also is to strengthen our communities and to restore confidence in law and order. We should be clear that this Government is winning the battle and take pride in that. The figures show that crime has fallen by an unprecedented 25% since this Government took office. Alongside the drop in crime, the detection rate for recorded crime has increased significantly over our period in office. Ireland now has a detection rate of 44% compared to 25% in the USA and 25% in the UK. This is because the Government has provided the resources to police our streets, waterways and airspace as never before.</P>
      <P>For the first time in years, police numbers are increasing. There are almost 1,000 more gardaí on our streets and we are on target to ensure the force reaches its full complement of 12,000. I stress that extra gardaí should be available for our smaller towns and they should not be taken away at weekends to the cities and bigger towns. CCTV should be available in town centres to improve security.</P>
      <P>People have not forgotten what happened when the rainbow Government was responsible for law and order. In 1995, well over 102,000 crimes were recorded in the State &ndash; an all time historic high. It was a time of utter paralysis in Government which communicated a sense of despair and hopelessness to our citizens as the criminal fraternity ran amok.</P>

The Garda now has the resources and equipment to police the streets. The people of the smaller towns and villages see the patrol cars and this is very important, as is providing security in rural areas. I hope the Minister will continue with this policy. The Government amendment has said clearly what the Government is doing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate. I read the motion. It is a wish list of condemnations and aspirations with little positive in it. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána for the sterling work they have done. I will be parochial and compliment the gardaí in my constituency, Dublin North West, for the work they have done. I pay tribute particularly to those who work at the coal face. I do not pretend that policing in Dublin is easy. It is hard, draining and demanding work. Unfortunately, there are some members of the Garda who lose their lives in the course of duty. I pay tribute to the two young gardaí from Finglas station who lost their lives in the course of duty last year. They were young and valued members of the community.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of gardaí is at an unprecedented level. The Garda are looking at new ways of policing. I support the Garda unreservedly.  There is no room in any part of this city or country for B-Special or militia type activity by individuals or groups. We are aware of the activities of certain organisations in north Kerry and, unfortunately, such activities are not confined to that part of the country. Recently, a 17 year old man in my constituency was viciously and savagely beaten by a gang of thugs who took the law into their own hands. There can only be one police force here to apply law and order and we must support it unreservedly. I call on any organisation which believes it will gain kudos from the public by administering its own version of justice to desist from its activities. There are times when it is difficult for local communities to support the Garda; some yobs and thugs make it difficult for people to give statements to the Garda. However, I urge people to work on an interagency basis with the Garda and local authorities to ensure such practices cease as they do nothing to further the cause of justice.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of a wide ranging body of legislation. I look forward to the enactment of the Children Bill which contains some extremely enlightened measures. I have long advocated that the issue of parental responsibility should be more seriously addressed and that alternative methods should be devised to deal with young people at risk of becoming involved in crime. The Children Bill addresses these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Garda stations in my area are badly in need of refurbishment. The Ballymun area is being regenerated through a massive investment programme. Garda management has recommended the construction of a divisional headquarters in the area and I urge the Minister to make a decision on that without delay. Finglas Garda station was built at a time when Finglas village was a small rural community. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs office in Finglas was built at a time of high unemployment and is now substantially under used. At the risk of provoking interdepartmental rivalry, I <Col N="961" /> recommend that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform consider the possibility of that office being retained for Garda use. I compliment the Minister for including Finglas as one of the areas in which closed circuit television will be introduced. There is clear evidence to suggest that CCTV is a good counter measure in the attack on criminal activity, be it in O'Connell Street, Temple Bar or Ballymun. The pilot drug courts project introduced in January is also an extremely important initiative and I look forward to its extension in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, referred to the innovation of the community policing forum in the south inner city area. I compliment Assistant Garda Commissioner, Jim McHugh, his staff and the community for taking the idea on board. This initiative will prove worthwhile in a number of areas throughout the country, some of which are more difficult to police than others.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We have waited a long time for the Opposition to table a motion on this issue. I commend the Government's success, particularly the success of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in identifying crime as a major issue prior to the last election and in tacking it successfully on taking office. I am not so blinkered that I do not realise crime is still a major problem.</P>
      <P>The motion addresses a number of issues which it would be difficult to deal with comprehensively. It acknowledges that the Garda Síochána has served the country well since the foundation of the State and that its bravery, in standing up to the threat posed by the IRA and other paramilitaries, must not be forgotten. It is a pity that the main Opposition party is not conscious of that. Deputy Hayes recently received significant publicity for criticising the role played by the Garda in the Omagh bombing. His comments should be corrected. The Garda has worked diligently on this matter and we wish the gardaí continued success. No crime affected this country to the same extent as the Omagh bombing and it is most unfortunate that some politicians tried to use it to their own advantage.</P>
      <P>I support the proposal to abolish the Garda Complaints Board. Even those directly involved in the board openly admit it is not working as successfully as they would wish. The Labour Party is seeking its replacement with a Garda ombudsman. It is important that any complaints mechanism is viewed as independent and the Garda Complaints Board, due to its composition, is not viewed as such. We should not be afraid to assess the board's operations; if the Minister were to sit down with those working in the board, he would share my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has addressed the crime issue with the seriousness it deserves and has provided an unprecedented level of resources to tackle crime. The installation of CCTV in urban areas is a simple but effective measure. The programme is due <Col N="962" /> to be expanded with the allocation of £12 million over the next three years, £4 million of which will be provided this year. The installation of speed cameras on the roads and CCTV in urban areas is self-financing. These cameras act as a deterrent in making people more conscious of their behaviour and, therefore, result in a reduction in crime levels. It is important that we build on the success of these measures to date. There is no point clapping ourselves on the backs for the provision of £12 million which is money well spent.</P>
    <P>There is much discussion in the House on the prevention of fatalities on our roads. The installation of additional cameras on our roads would make people slow down as it would make them realise their movements are monitored. The presence of cameras, on roads and streets, makes people change their behaviour and encourages them to behave in a more rational manner. Over indulgence in alcohol and drug use makes people behave abnormally and, in some cases, very violently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey spoke about the need for one force of law and order. We cannot allow a situation to develop in which political parties set themselves up as a second police force. It is important that all Members of the House exhibit confidence in the gardaí and stand four-square behind them. Their job is becoming increasingly difficult and it is important that they be supported by the Oireachtas. Members should express their support and avoid ambivalence in this matter. A couple of Garda houses beside Newbridge Garda station have been vacant for some time. Despite their being located right beside the Garda station, they seem to attract the wrong element and the wrong type of activity. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the necessary repairs to these houses are made and that gardaí are again allowed to live in them.</P>

This represents a radical change which will bring about a democratically accountable Garda authority, county liaison committees to deal with the gardaí at local level, a Garda ombudsman to deal with complaints to the Garda and full trade union rights for members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This radical change is needed to bring policing in this State into a modern accountable mode, as is the case elsewhere in Europe. As of now, gardaí are accountable only to themselves. They effectively make policy, set strategy and adjudicate on complaints made against them. This is no longer acceptable. In my constituency, including <Col N="963" /> the police district covering Deputy Power's constituency, indictable crime grew by 8% in 2000, the largest growth in indictable crime in the country. While this was occurring, we were 80 gardaí short of the normal Garda levels. In the new round of Garda allocations, one additional garda was sent to Maynooth.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we are witnessing a degree of lawlessness which has not been seen before. Large convoys of black economy mobile merchants invade the county at regular intervals. They destroy public and private property on a grand scale, without fear of penalty. They break a whole range of our laws. I will give a few examples of the effects of their actions. St. Wolstan's school in Celbridge, a brand new school, was invaded under the noses of the Garda, over a period of days, and £30,000 worth of damage was caused. There were not any arrests and nobody was charged. Some £100,000 worth of damage was done to Naas athletic grounds which was invaded by a similar marauding gang. There were not any arrests and people were not charged in the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are mobile black economy merchants who move around the country in large convoys, masquerading as Travellers.</P>
      <P>Castletown House was broken into and Naas Mart is the latest victim of this daylight criminality. These people demand money with menaces from the public and threaten to invade their property if they do not pay up, and sometimes they do. Celbridge town is now like a town waiting for an invasion, with entrances to private and public property barred in a variety of ways. There was a Garda presence during all these incidents and they did not take effective action. When we spoke later to Garda officers, they said the law was insufficient to deal with the situation and/or some officers might be hurt. That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There are large gatherings of aggressive youths in every housing estate, mostly white collar housing estates, in my constituency. This is not a tiny minority, it is large-scale gatherings of aggressive, mostly male, young people who seem to be alienated from society. They congregate on pedestrian ways, green areas and in wooded areas which have become &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas for the public. The Garda simply is not using the Public Order Act in this regard. These youngsters gather mostly to smoke cannabis, which is their social drug of choice. They are forced into criminality by the lack of recognition by Government or the authorities of the reality that cannabis is the social drug of choice of this large group of people.</P>
      <P>The radical change required has been outlined in our document and statements and I ask the House to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Garda who very often work in difficult and sometimes <Col N="964" /> dangerous conditions and who in the past worked under the additional threat of paramilitary violence. Like all of us, they are affected by the background against which they operate. It is important to recognise that this background and society at large have changed dramatically in a relatively short time. This motion is about adapting an institution in response to these changes in a way that other institutions have changed. It is time to consider modernising the Garda and the way it operates.</P>
      <P>There has been a drop in the level of certain crimes, largely crimes relating to property. We must recognise the changes in society which were crucial to that reduction, including higher employment levels and the fact that there is greater availability of drug treatment which stabilises many addicts and leads them away from stealing to feed their habit. These are important changes in terms of crime reduction. In the area of violent crime, particularly rape, there is grave concern about what is happening. We can accept in regard to rape that there may be a certain time lapse between the time the crime took place and reporting of the incident and there may now be more openness. Generally speaking, if one includes anti-social behaviour, it is quite clear that communities and individuals are very afraid of the level of violence.</P>
      <P>The general culture is not helpful in reducing the levels of violence, particularly given the constant television images giving the impression that somehow violence solves conflict. One of the best ways to deal with anti-social behaviour in young people is through the close co-operation of public representatives, local communities and the Garda by way of liaison committees. There is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee in my community which is extremely effective in reducing crime, encouraging greater Garda activity and eliminating vigilantism. One of the strongest arguments for having these committees enshrined in law is to make them obligatory rather than simply based on the goodwill of the local gardaí.</P>
      <P>The proposed Garda authority is an extremely important body which must be introduced if we are to ensure true independence of the Garda. Judges have a very clearly defined independence. It is time for a much greater degree of independence for the Garda from whatever Government happens to be in power. It is not appropriate for all senior appointments to be in the gift of any Government. There would be fewer tribunals today were gardaí able to operate in a totally non-political framework. For example, the investigations carried out by gardaí into the nexus between politics and business in the Dublin County Council area might have been more effective were it not for the fact that when some of these investigations were carried out the Minister for Justice happened to be Ray Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That type of unfortunate connection can be perceived if only because of the way senior appointments are made. We must ensure there is <Col N="965" /> total separation between the appointment of senior gardaí and&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was deeply disappointed recently by a response I received to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that he does not propose to set up a task force on organised crime similar to the Northern Ireland organised crime task force. The Northern Ireland organised crime task force was set up last September by the former Northern Secretary, Peter Mandelson. The first report of the task force entitled, The Threat to Northern Ireland Society from Serious and Organised Crime, stated that 78 groups involving some 400 members had been identified by the police. The report also said that 43 of the crime gangs had current or historical links to republican or loyalist paramilitary organisations. However, 35 had no such known links. If the people of Northern Ireland are provided with this kind of detailed information, the people on this part of the island should also have it. If we are serious about openness and transparency, our Minister's decision is not in line with that.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me that the tackling of organised crime remains one of his highest priorities and that the legislative and law enforcement measures which have been introduced in recent years have had a significant impact on organised crime. The Minister stated that major organised crime gangs had been dismantled and a number of prominent criminals had fled this jurisdiction. He further stated that the Garda Commissioner and he are satisfied that there are adequate structural measures and resources in place to provide an effective response to fight organised crime. It is absolutely essential to identify the extent of organised crime in this jurisdiction, particularly organised crime with links to paramilitary organisations. The ongoing attitudes of paramilitaries in both parts of Ireland to law enforcement agencies remains a major matter of concern and, in the interests of democracy, it is imperative that the political establishment does not stand idly by in the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the recent Sinn Féin incursions into vigilantism, I call on Sinn Féin Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, a democratically elected Member of this House, to state fully and unequivocally his support for the Garda Síochána. The Minister informed us last night that there was no place in our society for vigilantism no matter how it is dressed up and that, try as they might, people will not be allowed to electioneer by disregarding the law. He quite rightly said that anarchy ensues when summary justice is <Col N="966" /> dispensed by people who act as judge, jury and executioner. He was talking about Sinn Féin. The leaders of that party, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, were recently reported as being members of the IRA army council. To the best of my knowledge, this report has not been denied. Punishment attacks continue in Northern Ireland. South Armagh has figured in regard to events surrounding foot and mouth disease on this island. There is little doubt that cross-Border smuggling is now big business indeed and that paramilitaries are no strangers to that practice.</P>
    <P>The new Garda authority proposed by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, in the House last night would set the priorities for fighting the sort of crime I have outlined and would do so at a national level. It would be a very important support for the commissioner. The Garda authority would lead to more accountability and openness regarding key decisions on policing. It would operate in conjunction with the county policing liaison committees proposed by Deputy Howlin &ndash; a mechanism for communities throughout the country to engage more fully with the Garda Síochána &ndash; and thereby provide more support or assistance for the members of the force. The idea of a Garda ombudsman, which I fully support, has much to offer, not least the saving of Garda time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on our Private Members' motion. At a time of unparallelled growth when the standard of living of many, although not all, has improved in recent years, the effects of crime, serious and petty, is percolating through our communities. Murder is becoming a daily news item. Gangland shootings, drug pushing, loitering with intent and public disorder are becoming an unacceptable norm. Our parents, grandparents, the elderly in general and our law abiding tax complying citizens and their families are being harassed and intimidated nightly. This is not restricted to any particular area, urban or rural. This is modern Ireland in the 21st century and it is not pretty.</P>
      <P>The Minister for zero tolerance has failed the people. Speaking to people, there is clear evidence that members of the public, by and large, are no longer contacting gardaí and reporting harassment and intimidation. They simply believe that telephoning the gardaí will not achieve anything. On the contrary, if they contact the gardaí and wait for them to arrive in the fullness of time, they will be targeted by the criminals and the gurriers. Stone throwing, egg throwing, group congregation and intimidation are the result and the gardaí are unable to cope. I am not blaming the gardaí, many of whom I know personally, who are carrying out their duties in an excellent manner but with insufficient personnel and lack of back up resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency is one of the fastest growing areas in Ireland and it is urban and rural in character. However, the number of gardaí has not kept pace with the increase in population in the <Col N="967" /> Swords and Malahide sub-district and the Balbriggan district areas. The Swords area, which covers 12 square miles, has a population of approximately 35,000 and is served by one superintendent, eight sergeants and approximately 36 operational gardaí. On the basis of three shifts, this means that nine gardaí are on duty at any one time. This does not take into consideration holidays, sick leave and court duties.</P>
    <P>In Balbriggan, 44 gardaí are required to cover the towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk and the wider rural areas with a population in excess of 31,000. The Malahide sub-district, with a population of 28,000, is served by seven gardaí and 29 operational gardaí covering Malahide, Portmarnock, Kinsealy and the large housing estates of Seabury and Melrose. The concept of community gardaí is an excellent one provided the gardaí are available. Large housing estates with in excess of 2,000 houses do not, by and large, have the benefit of a community garda.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, there have been occasions when some of the few patrol cars we have have not been in use &ndash; they have been grounded due to the shortage of drivers. This is a scandalous situation which has been allowed to develop by the Minister for zero tolerance and the Government. They need to listen and respond to the needs of the people and not try to con them. The statistics show that the Minister has discriminated against Dublin and the people of Dublin in the allocation of gardaí and in the reduction in the number of gardaí on the street. I ask the Minister to take on board the excellent proposals put forward by Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party. Let us work together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the proposals drafted by Deputy Howlin. They are in the best interest of the Garda, which has served our nation well. Eight or nine years ago Dublin City Council established a control of crime committee and a liaison committee with the assistant Garda commissioner at the time, Barney Curley. The assistant commissioner used to meet us in City Hall and hear at first hand from councillors about the various incidents occurring around the city. We also met him at Harcourt Street. Unfortunately, perhaps for his own reasons, the assistant commissioner decided to discontinue those meetings and it was a great loss. However, I witnessed the success of this attempt to introduce a local control element in the administration of the fight against crime at first hand. That is why I commend Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for a county policing liaison committee and a Garda authority adopting the hallmarks of accountability and democracy with echoes of the Patten report. The Garda in the Dublin region, through initiatives such as the Priorswood anti-joyriding task force and Finglas crime forum, has tried to interact with local communities. The harsh reality, however, over the past four years is <Col N="968" /> that the Minister has a lamentable and desperate record on the provision of resources to fight crime. As I tried to point out to the Taoiseach earlier, nobody believes the Garda reports anymore. Even at a rough estimate, as the <i>Irish Independent</i> reported last year, crime levels are running at perhaps twice the level stated by the Minister through Garda reports. The reality is brought home to those living in west and north Dublin night after night, as the Taoiseach could tell the Minister, with major outbreaks of larceny and car theft. The elderly and people living alone live constantly in fear.</P>
    <P>For example, over the past four and five weeks, there has been a massive and intensely frustrating revival of joyriding. Some nights up to five and six cars are tearing around estates south of the M50 from Coolock to Donaghmede and Baldoyle. I have photographs of these cars taken in daylight when the Garda was recovering them. It is dangerous for gardaí and residents and it is also desperately unfair and totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Fourteen months ago the Labour Party gave the Minister an opportunity through the Anti-Joyriding Bill to take action and do something about joyriding. We set out a programme of action relating to education, youth clubs and local communities and proposed a specialised Garda joyriding/car crime unit and education in mechanics. The Minister has done absolutely nothing and is sitting in an arrogant manner in the House tonight. He met the anti-joyriding task force once a few months ago to examine the report David Farrington compiled for him. I asked the Minister six weeks ago to provide extra Garda and educational resources and a single co-ordinator. I am still asking and I am very angry.</P>
    <P>It is annoying that the Minister is prepared to allow this outrageous behaviour to continue night after night and to allow the constituents of Dublin North Central and Dublin North West to be treated in this manner. If it was happening in Kerry South, there is no doubt the Minister would declare a state of emergency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many citizens night after night find their cars interfered with and live in terror for hours afterwards. The Minister is a disgrace. The gardaí in the districts most affected, in particular the J and R districts, on the north side are extremely hard pressed and lack manpower. I agree with Deputy Stagg. How can 80,000 or 90,000 people be policed with a few hundred gardaí? It is an outrageous scenario. I draw the Minister's attention to the palpable anger among the public at his failure to deal with a rash of assaults, larcenies and drink and drug fuelled mayhem which happens <Col N="969" /> late at night throughout many parts of Dublin. He has not taken action and will not take on board even the most basic and common sense proposals from the Opposition, such as this fine proposal from my colleague, Deputy Howlin.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to support the motion. I compliment the Garda and acknowledge the work it does in difficult and often dangerous circumstances. I am disturbed by the Government's response to the motion because it demonstrates little or no understanding of the level of crime and anti-social behaviour in our communities. The amendment reflects a head in the sand approach and a case of opposition for opposition's sake.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment points out a 25% reduction in crime levels. That statistic may be true but we all know that a large number of crimes go unreported. People are frustrated that over the years little or nothing has been done about crimes they have reported. They are now saying there is no point in reporting crimes to the Garda. That is unfortunate and sad but it is the reality. The Government amendment also refers to a high level of support for the Garda, which is true, but it fails to acknowledge the significant and growing minority of people who have little or no respect for the Garda. That is in evidence on a regular basis in our estates, towns and cities. Sadly, a Garda patrol car was stoned and damaged in an estate in my own town in the past week by children aged between 12 and 14 years. Unfortunately, the Government seems to have little or no understanding of these developments.</P>
      <P>There are serious levels of anti-social behaviour in our communities in the form of harassment, stone throwing, window breaking and abuse of alcohol and drugs. Elderly people are terrified and people generally are demoralised. Young people are being destroyed. Additional specifically dedicated community gardaí are needed on the beat in estates, towns and cities where they can be seen and can build a relationship and a partnership with local communities, not in Garda patrol cars and vanettes.</P>
      <P>Clonmel is the biggest town in south Tipperary. On a shift basis, six gardaí are on duty in a town with a population of 20,000 and with another 5,000 and 10,000 people living in its hinterland. That is totally inadequate policing in the current context.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of local liaison committees. Clonmel Corporation informally requested in the past month that the local Garda superintendent, community workers and health board officials would come together with members of the local authority to ensure liaison between all the services to address the difficult anti-social behaviour that is witnessed on a regular basis in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to street violence which is in evidence on a weekly basis in most towns. Closed circuit <Col N="970" /> television systems should be provided in all large towns and not just in the cities because there is gratuitous violence regularly following discos throughout the country. Unfortunately, south Tipperary is no exception. I receive complaints daily from constituents in Clonmel, Tipperary town, Dundrum and Carrick-on-Suir about it. There is a need for additional resources and community gardaí on the beat. I ask the Minister to respond to this point because it has been raised by various Members during the debate. The link between local communities and local gardaí must be established on a partnership basis through local liaison committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;has fallen each year the Government has held office. The provisional figures for last year show that recorded crime fell by almost 5% on the 1999 figure. The Labour Party will be interested to know that the cumulative fall on the all time high 1995 levels is approximately 25%. The Minister has, on many occasions, encouraged members of the public to report crime. There is no evidence that under-reporting of crime is higher now than it has been at any other time. The detection rate for recorded crime has also improved in recent years. Signifi<Col N="971" /> cant initiatives have been introduced by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to strengthen the fight against crime. These include the establishment of the National Crime Council, the first in the history of the State, which will address issues linked to crime as well as advising the Minister on crime prevention measures.</P>

      <P>The motion is misdirected in so far as it concerns resources for the Garda Síochána. The reality is that the Garda has never been as well resourced and financed as under this Government. In that context, it should be noted that the Estimates for the Garda Vote have increased from £472 million in 1997, when this Government came into office, to £698 million for the current year, an increase of 48%.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came into office, the strength of the Garda Síochána has increased from a base line of 10,800 and it is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by 2002. Current recruitment will bring Garda strength to 11,800 by the end of 2001 and the current competition will take Garda numbers up to 12,000 next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that, during the term of the Government, the force has already achieved the highest strength levels ever and that process is being further reinforced.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken steps to ensure that the Garda has the best, most modern and most effective equipment to carry out its tasks. In that regard, a new helicopter is being purchased and will enter into service later this year. Moreover, £12 million has been allocated towards the installation of Garda CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years, with £4 million being made available in 2001. Plans have also been made to introduce a grant system this year to cater for communities who wish to go ahead with their own local CCTV system.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been responsible for a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform. This legislation has tackled a broad range of topics and is a vital element in ensuring that the Garda can respond effectively to the challenges society faces from modern crime, particularly organised and drug related crime. A new Criminal Justice Bill is being prepared by the Minister in response to recommendations made in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also been extremely active in promoting and developing change within the Garda Síochána to enable it to meet the demands of our modern society and to perform its tasks as efficiently and effectively as possible. This has <Col N="972" /> largely been done through the Garda SMI process under which a report has recently been provided recommending the civilianisation of posts currently held by gardaí. The report envisages the release of 556 Garda members to operational policing. A Garda national quality service bureau has also been established to drive implementation of the Garda quality service action plan.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, on the basis of the impressive record of the Minister and the Government, the Minister should be congratulated on all that has been achieved in this area. In seeking to attack and condemn the Minister, the Labour Party motion deliberately ignores all the good work he has carried out to address crime effectively and to make sure that the Garda Síochána is properly resourced and equipped. These are areas that were openly and shamefully neglected by the last Government and the motion can only be seen as completely cynical and politically motivated.</P>

I listened to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform moving the litany amendment last night and for a person who has achieved much, I was amazed at his total defensiveness and failure to understand the constructive nature of the motion. I am appalled at the siege mentality expressed by the Minister. He has done much and he had plenty of money to do it, but the last Government also put more money into areas than had previously been provided because more money was available. If that is the path the Minister wishes to take, that is fine because we know what is at the end of it. I wish him well, but the reality is that more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>We have made no secret of the fact, as Deputy Howlin said, that the proposal for the authority and a new complaints procedure is unashamedly modelled on the Patten report. That report is the best consultancy advice one could get anywhere in the western world on a modern policing force. It contains 175 recommendations, of which only 15 address the unique issues of the divided community that is the reality in Northern Ireland. The remaining 160 recommendations come from the best possible combination of advice one could get. I met the Patten Commission on two separate occasions and we discussed issues in great detail. I sat at a table with three former Ministers for Justice &ndash; the post is not permanent in case the Minister thinks otherwise.</P>

      <P>As other speakers said, there was a time when the combination in urban and rural areas, but particularly rural areas, of the priest, <Col N="973" /> the teacher and the garda had their fingers on the pulse with regard to the needs of the community and the reality of life there. However, that is no longer the case. Anybody who suggests that the Garda Commissioner, the district inspector, the superintendent or the local sergeant knows the pulse of the community is not living in reality. The Minister knows the number of people he has promoted who commute from one end of the country to another to serve in their operational district while their families and friends live elsewhere. This is 2001, not 1923 or 1924 when the Garda Síochána was set up.</P>
      <P>There are enough tributes to the Garda on the record from my party colleagues for me not to use up valuable time reiterating them. We salute the work of the Garda and we are trying to enable them to do a difficult job in hard times more effectively and efficiently. Nobody can be a judge in their own case and the Garda does not want to be the judge in its case in terms of investigating complaints against it. Notwithstanding that difficulty, it has been relentless in many cases in operating a difficult system. This is why we want to change it and why Deputy Howlin has argued so passionately for an independent system.</P>
      <P>It may be a surprise to the Minister of State, but senior gardaí have indicated in private &ndash; it must be in private and I will address this point later &ndash; their willingness to accept such a change. They do not consider the idea of an independent complaints procedure or an ombudsman as an attack on them. They consider it a liberation which will enable them to get on with the job without being open to the accusation that they are attempting to cover something up. We need structures and an authority as set out in our Bill and motion which bring together community interests which can communicate the reality in that area to gardaí who no longer live in the area and probably cannot afford to. That connection is necessary at local level. What we suggest is not an attack on the Garda. Its members would have the right for the first time to nominate gardaí to the new authority. Neither is it an attack on the actions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. People do not want to see gardaí in helicopters but on the streets. For the Minister to tell us that part of his serious response to this proposal is putting gardaí in helicopters is an indication of how high in the sky he is when considering our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gardaí are workers who sell their labour in a professional way and who, at the turn of the century, are entitled to the rights civil servants have in respect of trade unions and which many personnel in the Army and elsewhere have. They need to have the same freedoms and ability to exercise their rights as those in police forces in other European countries. That is why we want to grant them trade union status. We must not ever again see the nonsense of the blue 'flu being visited upon the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Commissioner, or <Col N="974" /> the Minister, whoever he or she might be. For that reason we have brought forward this set of additional proposals which should be examined, taken into account and given a reasonable response. Sadly, we have had nonsense and a defensive response to what we have proposed and no engagement. The Minister gave a litany of what he has achieved and of which we are aware. We are critical of some achievements and applaud others.</P>
    <P>However, it is not good enough. If the Minister believes everyone who is the victim of crime reports it or that the level of reporting is the same as it was ten or 15 years ago, something is seriously wrong in his Department. For that reason, there is a need to introduce the changes we have proposed. They are based on sound principles and reflect the modern Ireland of this century. I am appalled by the defensive response of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the two Ministers who represent it.</P>

      <P>During the course of the debate, I and other Deputies in the Labour Party and across the House laid out an analysis of policing in Ireland, including its strengths and deficiencies. We did so deliberately devoid of rhetoric and invective. We spelled out our view of the unacceptable crime levels which pertain in communities throughout the country. We deliberately took that approach which was in stark contrast to the bombastic, vicious and personalised style of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he was in Opposition. He saw criminality behind every furze bush and demanded that his immediate predecessor take responsibility for every criminal act perpetrated in the State. We laid out a reasonable, thought out and validated programme of reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was nothing short of disgraceful. He largely ignored the detail of the proposals we put forward and reverted to normal form. His usual contortion of history was spewed out. His performance was more appropriate to an address from the back of an election lorry in the 1950s than to a reasoned response of a Minister charged under the Constitution and the law with responsibility for the administration of justice and policing matters in Ireland. The House deserves better. The Minister has yet again disgraced himself in response to a reasoned debate. We are not surprised. The Minister believes our crime levels are similar to those in the 1950s. He is either deluded or deliberately sets out to delude. He is ignorant of the reality in many communities which has been spelled out in detail by Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know about the Minister's desk, but as Opposition spokesman, mine is festooned daily with anecdotal evidence from communities throughout the land about criminality. Yesterday a distraught woman told me how, last weekend in her housing estate in Dublin, a group shot live rounds through a house with the result that the Garda sealed off the area. Apparently this is not the first time this has happened. We are aware of <Col N="975" /> vigilantes in operation. For many young people the streets have become places of fear. Youth violence has reached unprecedented levels of viciousness. What we heard from the Minister was a self-satisfied and smug dismissal of reality. What we required was an engagement with what are, by any rational analysis, well thought out proposals placed before the House for rational debate and discussion.</P>
    <P>There are three core issues in the Labour Party set of proposals which are elaborate and are simply referred to in the motion under discussion. The proposal for a Garda authority did not receive a response from the Minister. It has the objectives of setting out in a democratic way priorities for fighting crime at national level, making senior appointments in the Garda at one remove from the political system, working out the resources required to reach its objective of defeating crime, and engaging with the Government to ensure those resources are provided. That is not a grandiose proposal but it did not even merit the decency of a response in the Minister's long speech, the only objective of which was for the Minister to clap himself on the back and ignore proposals from this side of the House, no matter how meritorious they may be.</P>
    <P>We proposed the establishment of county policing liaison committees, which were welcomed by many in the House as a proper chance for local communities to be allied with An Garda Síochána in defeating crime. They are working on a pilot <Col N="976" /> basis in many areas. Deputy Broughan cited the fact that they used be a feature in Dublin city. The Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is doing this with strategic policy committees in other areas of local administration. There is nothing unique or invalid about policing liaison committees, but yet again they did not merit a reasoned response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The third element of our proposals was the establishment of a Garda ombudsman. The concept received wide support across the House, including, I am glad to say, from the Government benches in the form of Deputy Power who indicated his support. We cannot all be wrong. There must be some merit in these proposals. The Minister is so caught up in his own self-worth and importance that he will not allow proposals from this side of the House to be even subject to critical analysis.</P>
    <P>Policing is a critical issue in any society. No system of policing or of any administration is so set in stone for all time that it is unable to change for the better to meet the needs of an evolving and changing world. The responsibility for overseeing reform falls to the House. That responsibility will be exercised by us, notwithstanding the smug indifference of the Minister. The debate we have begun will continue outside the House. Reform will happen, if not on the watch of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, then when someone more in touch with modern Ireland holds his portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I tried to place the Bill on the proposed international criminal court in the context of our commitment to the United Nations. I recognised some of the weaknesses in that, as the victors write history, they usually escape punishment in these circumstances also. I drew attention to the fact that in the last war the Allies were also guilty of some terrible atrocities that amounted to war crimes which, in current circumstances, would have gone before the proposed international court. I also pointed out that those who were responsible for atrocities, such as Saddam Hussein, may not be amenable to justice and that the presence of the court might, in certain circumstances, be an incentive to commit war crimes in so far as the perpetrators might believe that victory must be achieved at all costs and that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring us a little closer to home and to make some remarks that some people might describe as parochial but we have to learn the lessons wherever and whenever they can be learned. In his contribution the Minister detailed some of the barbarities the proposed court will try, some of which have been part of international conventions since 1948 and 1949. The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of genocide is identical to that contained in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It involves the following acts when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethical, racial or religious group: killing or causing serious bodily harm or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures to <Col N="979" /> prevent birth within the group or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</P>
    <P>The concept of crimes against humanity also embraces particularly serious violations of human rights &ndash; violations such as murder, extermination, slavery, forcible transfer of population, unlawful imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution of a group, enforced disappearance and apartheid &ndash; when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population.</P>
    <P>This is the point where I tend to get a little parochial. Let us examine the situation closer to home and, to be precise, on this island of ours over the past 30 years. Let us think of Enniskillen, where people who were gathered around the cenotaph commemorating their dead were blown to bits. Let us think of the Gospel Hall in South Armagh, where a congregation gathered together to worship their God were massacred as they sat in their pews. Let us think of Bessbrook, where people were lined up on the side of the road and asked their religion. One who answered correctly was allowed to leave and the rest shot down like dogs. Let us think of the innocents having a drink, doing their shopping or attending a wedding in a hotel who were blown into eternity. Let us think of the Omagh atrocity, which happened so recently, and the barbarity of that event.</P>
    <P>Let us think also of the barbarities carried out by those on the other side in uniform and out of uniform. Let us think of the atrocities perpetrated in this State, in this city and in Monaghan, and the number of innocent people sent without warning to meet their maker. Let us think of the members of the Miami show band who were lined up on the side of the road and shot and bombed not because of any perceived terrorist involvement but because of their perceived religious adherence. Let us think of the totally innocent neighbours of mine, like Jim and Gertie Devlin, who committed no crime except that they were Catholics, who were murdered in cold blood at the entrance to their home. Let us think of the innocent Catholics of north Belfast or the murder triangle who were murdered by a policy not yet given a name but later, in another part of the world, to become known as ethnic cleansing. Let us think of Bloody Sunday, that example of a so-called civilised nation shooting unarmed and innocent people.</P>
    <P>Let us think again about the Minister's definition of crimes under the heading of &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;&ndash; war crimes and crimes against humanity &ndash; and ask ourselves how many of those crimes, to a greater or lesser degree, have not been committed in this little island of ours, this so-called island of saints and scholars, in the past 30 years? How many of the perpetrators have been brought to justice? Though the distinction between winners and losers is not as clear as in national wars, have not many of the perpetrators been rewarded rather than been punished? Do we not see that <Col N="980" /> some of the perpetrators, certainly some of those who organised atrocities and who supported and condoned them, have been given honoured positions and their involvement apparently condoned? </P>
    <P>This is not a simple matter we are discussing here this evening. I am not saying that the Bill before us is perfect or that when, as I confidently believe, the people of this State vote in a referendum in favour of this Bill and the international court is set up that everything will be perfect but I support the legislation. I hope it will be supported overwhelmingly in a referendum by the people. I hope it will become part of international law and the necessary action to implement it will be taken under the aegis of the United Nations, if that, unfortunately, ever again becomes necessary. I am too well aware of the inhumanity of man to man and how difficult it is to prevent it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly welcome the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, which will allow this State to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This is a court which is urgently needed, a permanent international tribunal which will address and try some of the most heinous crimes committed against the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. For a very long time these crimes have been recognised, condemned and legislated against by the international community. Unfortunately, these crimes have also, for a very long time, continued to be committed, with apparently no one answerable for them, no one brought to trial or brought to account for criminal behaviour.</P>
      <P>I am sure none of us is under any illusions that the establishment of this court will solve the problem of criminal accountability once and for all. It will not, but the international criminal court is a start and one which is a long time coming. Such a court was first mooted more than 50 years ago. World War II provided us with an abundance of atrocities, deliberate genocide, cruel and inhuman punishments and war crimes. Nuremberg was an attempt to address those atrocities. The trials at Nuremberg provided some powerful benchmarks on human rights. The word &ldquo;Nuremberg&rdquo; still today evokes an image, a potent symbol of humanity's attempt to cope with and redress some of the worst crimes human beings have ever committed against other human beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In the same Resolution, Resolution 260, December 9, 1948, the General Assembly asked the International Law Commission to consider establishing an international court &ldquo;for the trial of persons charged with genocide . . .&rdquo;. This, however, <Col N="981" /> all foundered and here we are, in 2001, still trying to remedy the <i>ad hoc</i> system of war crime tribunals, for instance, in Rwanda and the Balkans, and to establish a permanent court.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why it has taken the Government so long to ratify the Rome Statute. We signed it over two years ago, in 1998, and I understand about half of the 60 countries required to ratify the treaty before the court can be established have now done so. It is time Ireland added its name to the list and helped to ensure that the international criminal court can be established as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This tendency to long finger human rights legislation has unfortunately become a trait of the current Government. Ireland is apparently the last state in the Council of Europe to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law. A Bill to that effect is being published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform only this week. There are over 40 states in the Council of Europe and Ireland is the last to incorporate this important legislation, despite having signed and ratified the convention almost 50 years ago. Human rights groups have long taken this and previous Governments to task over their tardiness and their lackadaisical attitude to human rights, with long delays in establishing the Human Rights Commission and in ratifying such basics as the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination &ndash; finally ratified just before Christmas &ndash; and the UN Convention on Torture, which is still waiting to be approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government has been heavily criticised over the delay in ratifying the Rome statute. Professor William Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway, last year referred to the delay as an embarrassment and stated that the EU had promised that all EU member states would have approved the statute by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>An international criminal court has been described by the United Nations as the missing link in the international legal system. The International Court at The Hague only deals with cases between states, not cases involving individuals. Individual responsibility and accountability must be dealt with. This issue could no longer be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and, with the establishment of the court, it no longer will be. <i>Ad hoc</i> tribunals involve long delays, crucial evidence can be destroyed, the accused can escape and witnesses can disappear or be intimidated. Such tribunals can also be limited in terms of time or place. For example, the Rwanda war crimes tribunal was limited to dealing with the events of 1994, even though thousands of Rwandan refugees were murdered outside that timeframe. A permanent court will help to rectify these deficiencies and ensure that perpetrators of crimes are brought to justice, even when national criminal justice institutions either fail or are unwilling to act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> There will be deficiencies with the new court. First, it is felt that it will never be able to operate to full effect if the United States is not on board. In the closing days of his Administration, President Clinton finally signed the treaty, after fighting it tooth and nail since its 1998 inception. Indeed, at one point during the negotiations in Rome, the US Defence Secretary, Mr. William Cohen, made it known that his country would reconsider its troop commitment to Europe if its concerns were not taken on board. However, the Bush Administration will never ratify the treaty. Mr. Jesse Helms, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told <i>The Washington Post</i> that he would ensure &ldquo;America's fighting men and women would be protected from the jurisdiction of what he has called &lsquo;this international kangaroo court'&rdquo;. Similar views, although not quite so colourful, have been expressed by the British military as the British Government prepares to steer the international criminal court through Westminster.</P>
    <P>The international criminal court will have jurisdiction over crimes committed by the nationals of governments that ratify the treaty or over crimes committed in their territories. It will be able to put on trial any individual responsible for such crimes, whether that person is a civilian or a president, a foot soldier or a five star general. It is understandable that many states might be uneasy about this. War crimes are broadly defined as including &ldquo;intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life, or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects, or widespread long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated&rdquo;. It also states that &ldquo;a military commander . is responsible for offences committed by forces under his effective command and control . as a result of his failure to exercise control properly over such forces&rdquo;. The treaty is not retrospective.</P>
    <P>Most of history's atrocities have never been atoned for. The majority of the villains go scot free because many of them hold positions of authority. Everyone can recall incidents or events which could be viewed as war crimes or genocide, but which have never been properly accounted for in a court of law. The names of Pol Pot, Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, Suharto and Pinochet spring to mind; but so also do those of Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, the perpetrators of Bloody Sunday and of other crimes committed in this jurisdiction. In the case of the Kosovo war, one would have thought that purposely targeting chemical plants and causing enormous pollution to rivers or purposely targeting television stations would qualify for some sort of legal accountability.</P>
    <P>Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction raise similar issues. The International Court of Justice at The Hague found that the use of nuclear weapons would undoubtedly be illegal <Col N="983" /> under international humanitarian law. What then are the implications for the Western European Union which supports the use of nuclear weapons and which is being incorporated into the European Union? How does this impact on Ireland's position? The Ploughshares Project women who damaged nuclear armed submarines in Faslane in Scotland were acquitted by a Scottish court because they were deemed to be attempting to prevent a far greater crime &ndash; a crime against humanity &ndash; from being committed.</P>
    <P>I am interested in discovering how this new international criminal court might deal with such questions. However, considering the safeguards in the treaty, I can see this would be difficult. In Kosovo, for example, the current Yugoslav tribunal, which apparently has stronger powers of investigation and prosecution than those provided for the ICC, has said no action needs to be taken. Safeguards in the ICC include article 8 which states that war crimes would generally not be prosecuted unless &ldquo;committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes&rdquo;. Article 16 allows the UN Security Council &ndash; of which Ireland is now a member &ndash; to defer an ICC investigation of prosecution.</P>
    <P>Adam Roberts, Montague Burton Professor of international relations at Oxford University, recently reviewed the possible workings of the ICC and reached to the following conclusions: in relation to the My Lai massacre in 1968, the ICC could investigate only if killings were planned; the 1982 sinking of the <i>General Belgrano</i> could not be investigated because the target was legitimate; the 1991 US bombing of the Amariya bunker in Baghdad &ndash; which I visited &ndash; could not be investigated because the civilian deaths were not intended &ndash; I am not sure about that &ndash; the 1991 rebel killings in Sierra Leone could be investigated; the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, which took place between 1992 and 1999, could be investigated; the 1994 genocide in Rwanda could be investigated; and the killing of Kosovars in 1999 by NATO bombs could not be investigated because civilian deaths were not intended. The ICC's powers will, therefore, be limited. However, its establishment will be most welcome.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International regards the Rome statute as &ldquo;one of the greatest ever advancements in international law&rdquo;. It is good that Ireland will at last ratify the statute <i>via</i> a resounding yes vote in the forthcoming referendum. I hope there will be a resounding no vote in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for sharing time. Establishing a permanent international court will be a major contribution towards deterring crimes against humanity. At present, there is no permanent international body to which Saddam Hussein or those like him are answerable. International tribunals such as those established to investigate events in Rwanda and Yugoslavia <Col N="984" /> are limited in scope. It is right that we should move away from an <i>ad hoc</i> system to one of permanent deterrence. <i>Ad hoc</i> cannot in any way be a substitute for a stable international judicial mechanism.</P>
      <P>This is also clear from the fact that it is half a century since the Nuremberg trials. Humanitarian abuses have been and continue to be committed world wide. People are astonished at what is happening now, given the information and technology available. It is unjust that many people suffer at the whim of corrupt countries. It is time for the international community to demand official accountability for such acts. The international criminal court will always be there to call the world's tyrants to account. A permanent international criminal court is necessary and we have an obligation to put it in place. Ireland is a member of the United Nations. It is past time to ratify the establishment of a new international criminal court. We are behind other European countries, several of which have ratified the Rome Statute which underpins the new court. The EU has promised that all member states will approve it by the end of this year. It is important to prepare the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>The international criminal court will resemble the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals set up to try crimes against humanity and war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It will be empowered to prosecute people responsible for serious human rights violations, such as the deposed leader Milosevic, in cases where national courts fail to assume their responsibilities. It is important to establish such a body. It will have jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of states that ratify the statute and over crimes committed outside their territory by nationals of those states. The enabling law will come into effect when 60 Governments ratify it and 29 have done so to date. Ratification will permit Ireland to participate in the election of judges, prosecutors and other court personnel. However, if the Government fails to give approval by the time the court is created, which will probably be in late 2001, it will not be able to propose candidates for these important positions. That would be a mistake. It is important to be able to appoint a judge to this important court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislative changes will be required to allow for judicial co-operation in areas such as the surrender of suspects and on-site investigations. Irish legislators can draw on successful models in other countries with similar legal systems, such as Canada and New Zealand. There could be some minor constitutional issues. The President, for example, would lose his or her immunity. The Rome Statute excludes immunity based on official status, a principle already recognised by most national courts and reaffirmed in the recent Pinochet case. Several months ago the Attorney General indicated a constitutional amendment might be required to address the fact that the Constitution provides for trial by jury, whereas those accused by the international criminal court <Col N="985" /> would be tried by a panel of judges. Perhaps this area could be clarified.</P>
    <P>Once the treaty is universally ratified, it will have universal jurisdiction. Regrettably, many of the nations on whose territory the crimes subject to the court's jurisdiction are likely to be committed or whose nationals are likely to be responsible for such crimes will not be among the early parties to the Rome Treaty. The vote in Rome brought together strange bedfellows including the United States. It is disappointing that America will not ratify it. It had agreed under President Clinton to ratify it, but some questions are now being asked.</P>
    <P>An international court is an important response to genocide. It is important for countries which need reconstruction, such as East Timor, which underlines the need for an international justice system. All peoples are united by common bonds. This court will help in that regard. Part of East Timor's reconstruction will be the judicial pursuit of those responsible for the deaths of an estimated 7,000 people. Moves towards establishing a war crimes tribunal for East Timor have already been made. UN investigators are reported to have started amassing evidence on and planning interviews with soldiers suspected of having organised the militia death squads.</P>
    <P>It is important for people to have access to an independent international court which is underpinned by the Governments of 60 countries. Ireland has an important voice on the UN Security Council. I am sure this referendum will be endorsed. We must speak with justice and fairness. It is disappointing that only 29 countries have ratified this when 60 countries are required to do so. The independence of the court must be clearly established. <i>Ad hoc</i> bodies will be set up in different areas. I am delighted Milosevic has been placed under house arrest for the torture he perpetrated in Yugoslavia. That he and all the people associated with his regime will be brought to justice shows he will not get away with the atrocities committed over many years.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. I look forward to it being fully ratified and to the introduction of amending legislation so that we will be in a position to appoint a judge to this important body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is one of four amendments to the Constitution which will be put to the people shortly, it is worthy of our careful consideration. This amendment will probably command the highest majority of votes because everyone would be happy to see brought to justice, people who are guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only necessary but important to make this amendment to our Constitution because it is in keeping with the principles of our Constitution when it was first written. I am a great fan of the Constitution which has served us well and continues to serve the people well in the rights and <Col N="986" /> principles it establishes for us as a nation. It was far seeing at the time it was written, which was close to World War Two, in that it affirms Ireland's devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation. It establishes that we are committed to international justice and morality. It sets out that we adhere to the principles of peaceful settlement, that we agree with international arbitration and judicial determination and that the rule we adopt in our relations with other states is that of international law. Various treaties have been signed by us and by other countries in the past 50 years. Our commitment to the United Nations has been evident since it was set up. That we will now be party to an international criminal court, which is part of the United Nations, shows our commitment to peace and upholding human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>In that 50 years all of us abhor the inhuman treatment of vulnerable people throughout the world. Following the Second World War we would have hoped never again to have witnessed horrific crimes against humanity. Yet, we have had to resort to tribunals in Rwanda and Yugoslavia to investigate and to apportion blame. Those tribunals fulfilled a function but they are not sufficient in dealing with the type of problems we are still witnessing. Some of the perpetrators of such crimes will never face trial.</P>
    <P>This court will attempt to ensure that guilty people do not escape. Modern day criminals are well known to us all. There are warrants for the extradition of people like Slobodan Milosevic waiting to be employed should he ever set foot in this country. People like him cannot be safe, wherever they go. The court will ensure that these people have no escape and ordinary people will be able to see that justice is done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the court will be in Europe, in the Hague, with 18 judges and an independent prosecutor. Prosecutions may be brought in three ways: by the state party, by the Security Council or the prosecutor can initiate a prosecution. This covers any loopholes that might exist in any legislation or international treaties to ensure that cases can be taken.</P>
    <P>This court will not take the prime responsibility for investigating crimes and bringing people to justice. That responsibility rests with the member states. Whereas this international criminal court will have very broad jurisdiction, it will not interfere with national systems of justice but will complement them.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the way it will be established, it is far more important to know what it will investigate. We know that it will deal with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is frightening to think that we have to employ the definition of genocide today as applied in 1948 when the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide was defined because genocide is still continuing.</P>
    <P>Recently, in Stockholm I attended a European conference on intolerance. A horrifying video <Col N="987" /> was shown, which depicted racist activity among young people throughout Sweden today. Other countries could empathise with this. Visions of nazi and fascist activities of the 1930s were to be seen today in modern day Sweden, a country which many would regard as far seeing and liberal. It makes us realise that in our own backyards, strong racism still exists and fascist movements are still there. It is just one step removed from the type of activity seen in the Second World War, which we all abhor.</P>
    <P>The definition talks of &ldquo;acts with the intent to destroy an national ethnic, racial or religious group&rdquo;. That is precisely what those vicious young thugs are trying to do today. They are killing or causing serious bodily harm to members of the group, leaving people in terror. This is happening in a European country where we know what is happening. There are plenty of places in the world where we have no evidence and no up to date information. The definition goes on to talk about &ldquo;deliberately inflicting on the group, conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or part&rdquo;. We recently witnessed that in the former Yugoslavia. It also mentions &ldquo;imposing measures to prevent birth within the group or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.&rdquo; Some 50 years after that definition was written, these things are still happening. It is incumbent on us as a modern democratic nation to ensure that we can bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>The second type of crime covers crimes against humanity. These are crimes that can be committed both in times of war and peace. In looking at that list, I am particularly concerned about sexual violence and slavery. This month the Trocaire Lenten campaign focused on the abolition of slavery. Young women and girls are victims of slavery in the 21st century. People might try to justify this on the basis of economics or culture but it should be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>The third type of crime is war crimes. These are crimes against humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. We think of Irish forces, who are always at risk when on peacekeeping missions. Just this week, the Taoiseach saw off an Army group leaving from Templemore. They are risking their lives in the interest of the greater good. Listed under war crimes are attacks directed against religious, educational or cultural buildings. Whereas buildings are in no way as precious or valuable as people, it saddened all of us to see the great 1,500 year old Buddhas being destroyed simply because they were monuments to a religion. They cannot be replaced. Also listed are rape and sexual slavery. The treatment of women as slaves or commodities is something that is going on in many countries. Enforced prostitution continues and I hope this court will help to ensure that it stops.</P>
    <P>As Minister for State with responsibility for children, it particularly saddens me to read of <Col N="988" /> other countries where child soldiers are being used. We see pictures of countries where children as young as seven or eight years of age have become part of a very vicious system and are not allowed to enjoy their childhood and are not given the opportunity to grow into adulthood. There are people who are willing to abuse those children for their own selfish ends. These type of crimes will now come within the jurisdiction of an international criminal court. I hope it will mean that there is no escape for the perpetrators of such crimes. Establishment of this court is a significant step in the right direction, but I am sure there will always be people who will get away. Each country has to be vigilant. Ireland can continue to play a very important role as a member of the Security Council. We can draw attention to the way in which women and children are being treated throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In future there may be other crimes that this court can investigate. It is to be hoped that drug trafficking, international terrorism and anything that crosses borders can be investigated there. While there are various courts and various European methods of co-operation and co-ordination on drug trafficking, anything that can be done on an international level is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The signatories to this statute and the countries that are willing to become a part of it are taking a very significant step towards strengthening the organs of justice in our member states and on an international level. By doing it as part of the United Nations we are further showing our commitment to that body. In doing it by referendum, we are ensuring that the Irish people are lending their support to this court. Táim lán cinnte go mbeidh muintir na hÉireann lán tsásta vótáil ar son na cúirte seo agus go mbeidh siad sásta tacaíocht iomlán a thabhairt dí. Mar a dúirt mé, beidh ceithre cheist os a gcomhair. Sé an ceann seo agus an ceann chun deireadh a chur leis an bpíonóis báis an dá cheann is mó a bheidh muintir na hÉireann ag tabhairt tacaíochta dó, is dócha. It is important that people understand exactly what can happen. It is our responsibility to ensure they understand the importance of this court.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution. I am delighted to hear the Minister of State speak so strongly about women. I have spoken in this House about the abuse of women in Ireland and throughout the world. We may have entered a new century but the way women are treated here and abroad one would think we were in an earlier century. The rights of women here and abroad have been and continue to be abused. Many people have not moved into the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> It is a disgrace that people will be faced with four ballot papers in the referendum. We should introduce measures in this House to ensure no more than two ballot papers are put before people during referenda or elections. There will be great confusion, people will not know what to vote for and will simply walk out. We never learn; we simply want to get this through whether by confusion or something else. The Minister and Government should take another look at this and ensure that no more than two ballots are held on any one day. People do not turn up to vote because they are confused and embarrassed by the number of ballot papers.</P>
    <P>The whole point of the referendum on the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution is to establish an international criminal court which is to be welcomed. I hope this convention will be ratified all over the world. We witnessed many terrible crimes in Israel recently about which nobody appears to be doing anything; we see photographs of dead children in newspapers every day of the week. It is time we dealt with those who commit such serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a softly, softly approach to those who committed terrible crimes, such as Omagh, Bloody Sunday and many others. Some of these people, identified by the media, cannot be identified by the Garda or brought to justice but they can meet with Government Ministers and sometimes they are invited to Government Buildings. That is outrageous. The innocent people murdered in Monaghan, Dublin and throughout the country may get their justice in another jurisdiction. This Government has failed to bring the generals of crime in this country to justice. Some of the people involved in the bombing at Enniskillen remain free today. They are even invited to Government Buildings which is outrageous. We must do something about this.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should establish an international court to deal with those criminals who cannot be brought to justice in their own country. There should be no safe havens for them. We witnessed the serious crime committed against a journalist &ndash; an innocent woman was murdered on the streets of our city &ndash; and the dispersal of criminals all over Europe. The Government met with great difficulty in convicting these people. It is difficult to watch these people remain free, running businesses, importing drugs and committing serious crimes here and abroad. We should also ensure Ireland is not a safe haven for other criminals. I welcome anything that can be put in place to bring these people to justice. They should not be protected; all countries should sign up to this convention.</P>
    <P>We all remember the tragedy of those travelling by plane from America when a bomb went off over Scotland. It took years and years for those involved to be brought to justice which caused great distress to the families. Negotiations were held on the location of the trial and some of those involved were eventually convicted and the families felt they had received justice. I met a <Col N="990" /> relative of a person involved in the bombing in Monaghan at my clinic recently. The family still suffers as a result of that tragedy. What hurts them most is that those who committed the crime remain free. The media are constantly identifying criminals who live abroad and have massive powers here. They have not been brought to justice for the serious crimes they committed.</P>
    <P>I hope people will vote in favour of this court in this referendum. As I said earlier, it is outrageous that people are to be faced with four ballot papers on the one day. This problem arose before, it created great confusion and when people were unable to make a decision they simply walked out. We should ensure that no more than two ballot papers are put before the people in any given election.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of this court will ensure those guilty of committing serious crimes &ndash; the thugs who murdered innocent people in this State &ndash; will be brought to justice in another jurisdiction if they cannot be dealt with here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is timely that we are discussing this very important matter. I am absolutely confident that the Irish people will ensure this is unanimously passed in the referendum. We have all been very conscious, through the media in particular, of what has been happening in other countries. We all remember the tragedy in Rwanda. The judicial system there is unable to cope with the number of prisoners imprisoned in cramped conditions. Justice is being meted out there in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>Many of us remember very vividly &ndash;  we never thought we would witness it in a European context &ndash; the tragedy in Yugoslavia. We witnessed terrible scenes in Bosnia and Kosovo. The international criminal court brought many criminals there to justice. This is important but then we look at what is happening in Iraq where Saddam Hussein continues in power and the atrocities continue, particularly against the Kurdish population. Saddam reigns with impunity amidst much poverty. We have a situation where ordinary people are penalised by international sanctions which prevent medication entering countries. This particularly affects young people and babies. It is unfortunate when the innocent suffer as the price of conflict, as has happened in the case of Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent review of the United Nations peacekeeping force was referred to by the Minister. Ireland has a proud record of service with peacekeeping forces over many years in many countries. The most significant contribution has been in Lebanon. Our soldiers are very proud of being Irish when abroad and they are well respected. They earned great recognition in Lebanon. We have seen peace restored to Lebanon recently, and I hope that continues. Our peacekeeping duties will be replaced soon with Partnership for Peace duties as part of a rapid reaction force. This is a significant development in a European con<Col N="991" /> text and will bolster peace and stability throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Members have expressed concerns in the House about the rapid reaction force. They see a link with NATO and perhaps there is an element of scaremongering on this issue which I do not see as valid. It will be a decision for this House whether we operate as part of any rapid reaction force. It is important for the morale of the Army to have the benefit of overseas service. If that was ever lost there would be a drop in Army morale. I welcome the recent upgrading of military equipment, particularly the contract for armoured carriers. This is significant and there should be upgrading across the Defence Forces. The Air Corps should be looked at. There has been a significant erosion of morale in the Air Corps over time on the basis of certain events.</P>
    <P>It is sad when we see instability in much of the African continent and television shots of child soldiers in Sierra Leone, some as young as eight years old. We have many despotic regimes in African countries where Irish development aid goes. There should be effective monitoring to ensure that overseas aid is used well and not for armaments or the benefit of a despotic ruler. International slavery was referred to by the Minister. There are young people in countries where there has been progress at some levels, such as India, working at the age of eight or ten for buttons, doing adult's work and finding their existence warped due to a system that should not prevail.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done internationally in the area of human rights. The international criminal court will focus closely on acts of genocide and similar issues. There are many other instances of oppression and they must be looked at also. The international criminal court will have a lot of work to do. I want to praise US President Clinton for accepting the court. I am disappointed with the attitude of the Republican head of the Foreign Relation Commission of the US Senate, Mr. Jesse Helms, who has said that he will not accept it and that he hopes to overturn this &ldquo;kangaroo court&rdquo;. That is a deplorable description for a significant court which has vast international standing and will have strong United Nations backing.</P>
    <P>Although I admire the United States and what it has done in international conflict, I wonder why it is worried about this issue as there is obvious merit to the international criminal court. The US should think again about its reservations. This court has been long needed and it is important that we in Ireland ratify it. I hope the referendum will do that. The people have always been fair and tolerant when it came to the rights of people. They will gladly address this matter and support it in the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate. The debate has demonstrated the significance of the Rome statute, of the international <Col N="992" /> criminal court as a development of international law and its importance for the protection of human rights throughout the world. It now falls on us to provide an amendment of the Constitution which will be put to the people in early summer and, if passed &ndash; as I hope it will be &ndash; will enable Ireland to ratify the statute.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed during the debate that the people be well informed on the international criminal court prior to the holding of a referendum. The Government has approved the setting up of a referendum and for each of the other referenda to be held on the same date. The function of the Referendum Commission will be those provided for in the Referendum Act, 1998. The Referendum Commission will provide information to the people on the implications of ratification of the Rome statute. I am certain that the Referendum Commission will perform its task well. The ballot papers will be clearly distinguishable from one another. I am confident that confusion will not ensue as a result of the holding of the four referenda on the same day.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised concerning the implementing legislation which will also be required before the State may ratify the Rome statute. That is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am informed that a preliminary examination of the statute with a view to preparing the necessary legislation is already taking place within his Department. My Department will offer whatever assistance it can. It is not possible to state definitively when Ireland will be in a position to ratify the statute. However, I will use my best endeavours in seeking to ensure that Ireland can ratify the statute within a reasonable timeframe. There are current legislative priorities within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Rome statute is a long and complex document and, as a result, all steps towards the ratification of the statute require adequate time and consideration.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to Article 124 of the Rome statute. It should be noted that Article 124 is headed &ldquo;Transitional Provision&rdquo;. Article 124 permits states to declare that for a period of seven years after the entry into force of the statute for the state concerned, it does not accept the jurisdiction of the court with respect to war crimes when it is alleged that they are committed by its nationals or on its territory. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe rightly acknowledged, this provision was included to permit France to bring its domestic law with respect to war crimes into line with the statute after ratification. Ireland does not propose to make a declaration under Article 124.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to how matters will be referred to the court, it will be possible for the United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, to refer a situation in which a crime appears to have been committed to the prosecutor of the court. It will also be possible for states/parties to refer such a situation to the prosecutor and the prosecutor will have the power to initiate an <Col N="993" /> investigation of his or her own accord. At the diplomatic conference in Rome, Ireland strongly supported the view that the prosecutor be given this independent power of investigation. Where war crimes have been committed the court will have jurisdiction both when they have occurred in the course of international and non-international armed conflict.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised questions about the relationship between the court and the UN and the manner in which the court will be funded. Both of these topics were the subject of extensive negotiation at the preparatory commission for the international criminal court in which Ireland participated and will continue to participate. The Government and its EU partners have sought to ensure that the financial rules and regulations and the relationship agreement which will ultimately emerge from the preparatory commission's work will respect the statute's integrity and the court's independence.</P>
    <P>On the adequacy of funding, the court will be funded by contributions from states' parties and the UN. Voluntary contributions may also be accepted. Deputies can rest assured that it is of concern to Ireland that this funding proves adequate.</P>
    <P>On the court's powers to bring persons before it, the court may request the co-operation of a state party in this regard. States' parties are under an obligation to fully co-operate with the court in its investigation and prosecution of crimes within its jurisdiction. This means, for example, that when the court requests the arrest and surrender of a person or the production of evidence, states' parties are under an international obligation to comply with the request. As Deputies are undoubtedly aware, Part 9 of the statute concerns international co-operation and judicial assistance. States' parties will also have a role in the enforcement of the court's judgments; the issue of enforcement is dealt with in Part 10 of the statute.</P>
    <P>The European Union strongly supports the early establishment of the court and has undertaken to assist countries associated with the Union to ratify or accede to the statute. The EU is also urging the USA to ratify the statute and Ireland continues to support its efforts.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of the Constitution constitutes a major step in Ireland's ratification process. By amending our Constitution to allow for ratification of the Rome Statute of the international criminal court, we will demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the statute and, by doing so, will reaffirm the principles outlined at the beginning of Article 29 of the Constitution. These principles include co-operation on the basis of international justice and morality and adherence to pacific settlement of international disputes and the generally recognised principles of international law, according to which the international relations of this State are to be conducted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond to this matter. I found the evidence produced in last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme very disturbing. It raised fundamental questions about the handling of the prosecution case in the Arms Trial which obviously caused immense hardship to many of those involved. A full inquiry should be undertaken into all the circumstances surrounding the altering of statements used in the 1970 Arms Trial.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the evidence of the then head of military intelligence, Colonel Michael Hefforon, was tampered with and altered. The charges eventually came to nought but the question now is whether they would have been brought at all if all the evidence had been available in the first instance. Was this a deliberate attempt to load the evidence in favour of the Government and what is the explanation for this shocking breach of procedure and rules of justice? </P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that the then Attorney General, Mr. Colm Condon, did not see the original documents and was only provided with the altered ones when preparing the Book of Evidence. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; team and the families which produced the new evidence must be congratulated. Even though it is 30 years on, it is vital that the record be corrected as a result of the production of this evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case appears to be a clear example of people altering documents to achieve a particular result. The attempt failed but many people suf<Col N="995" /> fered unfair consequences. Given the extraordinary information which has emerged from the television programme and the released documents, it is essential that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform initiate an immediate inquiry, which should be run in an efficient manner and within a reasonable time frame, to ascertain the facts about this episode. The people whose reputations were sullied are entitled to be vindicated.</P>
    <P>Last night's programme raised numerous questions and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>The matters raised in last night's broadcast occurred more than 30 years ago. Neither I nor any of the officials who deal with security matters were dealing with such matters in the Department at that time and, therefore, the primary information on which I can base my reply in that contained in the small number of files held in the Department on this matter.</P>
      <P>These records do not cast any further light on the substance of the allegations made in last night's programme. I cannot substantiate or dismiss these allegations. In so far as my Department is concerned, the evidence on which any judgment would have to be based is already in the public domain. That documentation does not permit us to draw any definitive conclusions as to what happened more than 30 years ago and last night's programme reflected this fact.</P>
      <P>The documents referred to in the programme fell, for the first time, for consideration for release to the National Archives under the 30 year rule at the end of last year. These records were examined by officials of my Department with a view to releasing as much material as possible, given the degree of interest expressed over the years in regard to these events.</P>
      <P>In December last year, my Department delivered to the National Archives all material on the Arms Trial which was due for release under the 30 year rule. The National Archives Act, 1986, provides that all records over 30 years old should be transferred to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection unless they fall within very specific criteria for retention.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that if a Department considers that making particular records available for inspection by the public would be contrary to the public interest; would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence; or would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals or would or might be likely to lead to an action for defamation, such records may be withheld from public view with the consent of the consenting officer, an official of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> My Department took the view that it was in the public interest to ensure that as much material as possible entered the public domain. There was, however, a small amount of material which the Department felt fell within these grounds and was, therefore, not appropriate for release at this time. On these grounds a very small amount of material was obscured from the documents released to the archives and a small number of documents were withheld in their entirety. This material was withheld after careful examination and consideration as the intention was to release as much material as possible. When examining material with a view to releasing it, reference may only be had to the criteria I have outlined. No consideration can be given to the wider implications of releasing records. It is not within the competence of the Department to withhold records on the basis that it may raise questions about the events they concern. That would defeat the purpose of the National Archives Act.</P>
    <P>None of the material withheld related to the allegations made in last night's broadcast. It dealt in the main with matters that were and are concerned with operational procedures of the Garda Síochána dealing with sensitive intelligence information.</P>
    <P>While my Department still has to assess fully files which may fall to be released at the beginning of next year, my understanding is that my Department holds no further records that would shed any light on the substance of the allegations made in last night's programme. Having said that, I accept there are aspects of this case which, of their very nature, give rise for concern. I know the House will appreciate that it has not been possible in the limited time since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast last night to inquire fully into the matter. However, such limited inquiries as have been possible in that short time leads me to believe that more detailed inquiries are necessary.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I would be grateful if the House would give me an opportunity to pursue further this matter on the understanding that I will make a further report to the House when I am in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Stanton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of the foot and mouth outbreak on the tourism industry is now reaching crisis point. During the initial weeks of the foot and mouth restrictions the main loss of business to the industry arose because of the cancellation of conferences and events. Domestic tourism also took a hit. However, there are still some people coming here from abroad who had advance bookings prior to March. The problem now facing the tourism industry is that people are simply not booking holidays in Ireland. In fact, they are cancelling their trips. There is now a real fear that bookings will completely dry up leaving an enormous void <Col N="997" /> in the tourism industry during the summer months.</P>
    <P>The reality is that unless there is the same concerted national effort displayed to protect the agricultural sector from foot and mouth disease, some operators will be put out of business. I strongly believe this crisis needs to be dealt with in a co-ordinated and structured way. That is why I am suggesting a working group headed by the Taoiseach is established immediately to ensure the right message is sent out at home and abroad about our openness to tourists. All those involved in the tourism industry, from workers to business owners, are dismayed that no specific group has been established to deal with the crisis in this sector. While I accept the expert group on foot and mouth, which is attached to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has the primary objective of containing and preventing the disease, I do not see this as an excuse for not having a specific group to deal with the problems in the tourism sector. The pace with which we are dealing with the crisis in tourism is too slow. For example, attempts to fence off major tourist attractions from lands where animals are kept are still under way, despite the fact that the restrictions have been in place since March. As a result, these sites will be closed over the Easter period, which is generally accepted as the beginning of the busy season.</P>
    <P>Another instance of the slow pace in dealing with the crisis in tourism was highlighted in correspondence to me from a tour operator. This operator contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on 2 April for advice on an activity. He was informed that his query would be dealt with by the expert group for consideration on 10 April. Effectively, he was left on hold for eight days and, consequently, he lost a big tour from America. These people were not prepared to wait eight days for an answer.</P>
    <P>It bothers me that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is so opposed to making marketing funds directly available to the tourism industry which is prepared to do the work and provide matching funding. It is time the Taoiseach played a part in assisting our ailing tourism industry. He has managed to front some of the key developments in relation to sport, which come under the remit of the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and his Department. His involvement in the GAA grant and with Stadium Ireland compare starkly with the Taoiseach's entire lack of interest in the crisis facing the tourism industry which, I would like to remind him, is our largest growth industry.</P>
    <P>I now call for a working group, headed by the Taoiseach, to help rebuild the ailing tourism industry. This group should be responsible for ensuring an accurate and up to date message about the fact that this country is open for tourists goes out abroad. This group should also work closely with Bord Fáilte and the industry to market this country. It should have a duty to compile a profile of the losses in the industry so that <Col N="998" /> measures can immediately be put in place to minimise damage and save thousands of jobs. The Taoiseach and his Cabinet should have a role in direct marketing by visiting and promoting Ireland in the countries from much of our tourism trade emanates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for sharing her time with me.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not present tonight. I agree with Deputy Moynihan &ndash; Cronin that the Taoiseach must take control in regard to this issue. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation said in committee last week that it was not possible under the law for local authorities to waive rates in order to assist badly pressed tourism operators. I understand from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that that is not the case. Under the Local Government (Rates) Act, 1970, rates can be waived. This proves the Government and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation do not know what they are doing. The sooner the Taoiseach takes control of the matter the better before hundreds of people are out of work and very valuable industries go to the wall.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for State to go to the Taoiseach and the Minister to get action on this matter. As Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, this is our biggest growth industry. These people are entrepreneurs who have taken risks. They have invested money and have not asked the State for very much up to now. However, these people are now in trouble and need help. The incompetence of the Minister telling us this in committee is unbelievable. I want the Minister of State to sort out this mess, go to her Cabinet colleagues and the Taoiseach and get action before it is too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this issue. I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, who unfortunately is not in a position to be here this evening.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, during the course of the current foot and mouth emergency, the primary preoccupation of the Government has been to ensure every conceivable step is taken to contain the one outbreak that has already occurred in this country. The Minister has already indicated in two recent Dáil Adjournment debates and in two full day sessions of the joint committee, of which the Deputy is chairperson, held on 22 March and 5 April, and separately in statements in the Seanad and in this House during Private Members' time on 3 April, that the possibility of a widespread outbreak of foot and mouth disease threatens our economic security and livelihood not just those of farmers and the agriculture and food industry, but potentially of every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, has said that the recent heartbreaking and stark images from County Louth and Britain give some indication <Col N="999" /> of what a full scale outbreak would mean and puts into perspective the sacrifices we have all had to make to date. It is important to appreciate that for tourism, a full outbreak would result in sustained negative international publicity, the possibility of even more intense internal and external travel restrictions and prolonged closure of many key tourism attractions and facilities. It is hoped that we do not have to face such an appalling scenario.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I want to again thank the tourism and hospitality industry, who are at the economic front line in the battle against FMD, for their support and patience in recent weeks in accepting the control measures which have had to be put in place. There is no doubt but that the industry has taken a substantial hit in terms of lost business but has been mature enough to see it as part of an essential contribution to the bigger objective of fighting the disease.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies know through the work of the committee, the tourism and hospitality industry is now hurting as a direct result of the FMD emergency. The most up to date assessment of losses is put at £200 million, excluding the impact on air and sea carrier receipts which are also substantial. If the current situation continues until August, it is estimated that the potential loss of overseas tourism revenue could rise to at least £500 million. This does not take into account the separate and very significant losses in domestic tourism and hospitality business due to cancelled events and conferences and some continuing reluctance on the part of the general public to take short breaks in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since the onset of the current emergency, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, his Department and Bord Fáilte have been working very energetically to support the industry and we have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation. The Minister has already outlined on a number of occasions in this House the ten specific actions he is taking. As details of these are on the record of the House, I do not propose to repeat them here this evening. One of these measures is that the Minister set up structured arrangements to ensure that the views of the tourism industry are taken on board during the present emergency and that its concerns are made known, in particular as key decisions are taken about the control measures in place. On 8 March, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, met a delegation from ITIC to discuss the situation and has kept in close contact with the industry since then. He is a member of the key Government task force which at present convenes daily, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Taoiseach, subject to his availability, to monitor and review measures to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>In addition, a separate high level action group, chaired by the chief executive of Bord Fáilte and including key ITIC representatives and the <Col N="1000" /> Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, has been established to monitor the situation on a continuous basis. This group has been meeting twice weekly in recent weeks with the active participation and support of the industry. The objective is to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business already booked and limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting the Minister had with the chairman and the chief executive, Bord Fáilte launched a special tourism marketing and promotion reassurance programme which commenced last weekend. This programme, which will have an initial component costing £3 million, will consist of tailor-made trade and consumer campaigns, joint activity with trade partners and special consumer events in key European and US cities. The Minister intends to lead some of these campaigns in the marketplace beginning later this month. Bord Fáilte has already identified savings from within its budget to help meet the costs involved in mounting the campaign and the Minister has sought supplementary funding from the Minister for Finance for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that before Christmas, the Minister launched the largest ever annual tourism marketing programme for 2001, involving the joint expenditure by the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte of almost £100 million, of which approximately £35 million is Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister also appealed to the industry to put together a programme and range of attractively priced short break packages to encourage a greater level of domestic holiday taking this year. Further initiatives have already been launched to give home holidays a particular boost and the Minister has already publicly appealed to people to holiday at home this year.</P>
    <P>The Department and Bord Fáilte are keeping the situation under close review with a view to making appropriate further adjustments, in consultation with the industry, to marketing and promotion activities planned for this year. While we are all conscious of the threat to agriculture, we must not lose sight of the extent of the economic impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. Our shared objective must be to ensure that unnecessary medium to long-term damage is not done to the tourism industry, which is now so important in economic terms.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has dealt successfully with crises in the past, including the fallout from the Gulf War and the Northern Ireland troubles. It is a resilient and strong industry. While the Government is aware that the industry is suffering at present, if we work together, we can successfully overcome this crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warn the Minister of impending loss of life at sea, if he does not consider the request I make tonight and the request that has <Col N="1001" /> been communicated to him by the Commercial Salmon Fishermen's Association and the Irish Salmon Fishermen's Association for the introduction of safety days during the salmon fishing season of June and July. Safety days for salmon fishermen is practised in other restricted fisheries along the American and Canadian coastline and is working well to the benefit of salmon fishermen in that part of the Atlantic Ocean. Safety days are allowed at the end of the season to compensate for the days lost as a result of weather conditions which prohibit fishing vessels going to sea. They are of vital importance in protecting the lives of fishermen in small craft.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the Department of the Marine reduced the length of the salmon fishing season from 85 days to 32 days. The wild salmon fishing season is now confined to the months of June and July compared to March to July, inclusive, under the old regulations that pertained prior to 1990. In terms of workable hours, the reduction is from 1,920 hours in 1990 to 384 in 2001 &ndash; a reduction of 80% in the fishing period for wild salmon along the Irish seaboard.</P>
      <P>The Cork Commercial Salmon Fishermen's Organisation has warned of the possible consequences of the current policy. It is becoming extremely difficult for the commercial salmon fishermen to survive on 20% of the season they originally had when one allows for engine breakdowns, bad weather, etc. Unfortunately, this shortfall in the salmon season is forcing fishermen to go to sea in dangerous weather conditions which will, undoubtedly, result in a fatal tragedy sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the majority of craft engaged in salmon fishing range from 16 foot open punt boats to 30 foot half deck fishing boats. Salmon fishermen, due to the short season, have no option but to go to sea to make a living even when they realise there is a real danger to themselves, their crews and their craft.</P>
      <P>With the incoming introduction of the new log book and tagging scheme for salmon boats, it would be quite feasible for the Minister to introduce the concept of safety days as this could be noted in the log book of each salmon fishing craft. If steps are not taken by the Minister's Department to immediately introduce safety days at the end of each salmon fishing season, disaster could occur to the people operating same. In the event of a tragedy, God forbid, the blame will lie fairly and squarely at the feet of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and his Department who now have the power to rectify this problem. I urge the Minister to act on my request before it is too late. I hope he will treat my request on behalf of the Irish salmon fishermen operating around our coastline favourably and introduce the safety days policy into the salmon fishing period forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resource or the junior Minister is not here tonight. However, I know the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, is a very good represen<Col N="1002" /> tative for them. She comes from a good fishing constituency and county, Donegal, which is similar to my constituency of South West Cork and Counties Cork and Kerry. I know only too well that she realises the potential danger facing those salmon fishermen in their small crafts being tossed about in the wild Atlantic Ocean when trying to make a living out of salmon fishing which is seriously restricted at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy raising this important issue. It gives me the opportunity to deal with the issue of safety days for commercial salmon fishermen and to update the House on salmon management policies generally. The Salmon Management Task Force, which reported in 1996, identified as a major and critical element of salmon management strategy sharing the resource in a manner which is fair and balanced between all legitimate interests. The task force identified the following legitimate interests: the spawning escapement; the legal commercial fisheries; the recreational rod fishery; and the wider community, including tourism interests.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed with the analysis of the task force which informed him of the principal policy objective of increasing returns of salmon, thus enhancing the availability of stocks for tourism and domestic sport angling to the national benefit.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the task force report the following salmon conservation measures were introduced to reduce the commercial fishing effort on salmon and improve the spawning escapement: a reduction from five days per week to four days per week for commercial salmon fishing; a ban on night time fishing; a restriction of fishing to within six nautical miles from the coast; a restriction of the drift net fishery to the months of June and July, and a deferral of the commencement of draft netting until 12 May.</P>
      <P>As part of this package of measures, the prohibition on the use of monofilament drift nets was lifted.</P>
      <P>The task force noted that each year requests are made for extensions to the fishing season and it expressed the view that an extension could only be considered in the overall context of the introduction of quotas. The request for the granting of safety days has been made by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation. The rationale is to maintain the 32 day season by allowing extra days at the end of the season to compensate for days lost through bad weather and other factors. This would reduce the pressure on fishermen to go out in adverse conditions in the industry's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware others would take the view that the granting of safety days would in effect amount to a back door extension of the commercial fishing season and an increase in the level of commercial fishing effort. He has asked his Department to examine the case made by the commercial fishermen taking all perspectives into account and will also invite the salmon commission to consider and advise on the IFO <Col N="1003" /> request. I will also bring to the Minister's attention the Deputy's proposals regarding his concerns in the south.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, shortly after coming into office, the Minister established the National Salmon Commission. The commission has the function of assisting and advising in relation to salmon conservation and management. The commission consists of a chairman and 20 other members. These members are representative of all the stakeholders in salmon, that is, the commercial sector, the recreational angling sector, the aquaculture sector and processors. It also includes the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and the ESB.</P>
    <P>The commission gave positive advice regarding the introduction of a wild salmon carcass tagging scheme and settled the regulations for the scheme in its first months of operation. The scheme commenced in January of this year and it will provide information on the catch of fish by the commercial and recreational fishing sectors. The management information provided by the tagging programme will help to quantify salmon in a new way and together with the national fish counter programme will inform future salmon conservation and management strategies. The immediate priority has been to secure the co-operation of all players in the tagging and counting of wild salmon and the Minister has moved to clarify the operation of the tagging scheme to keep the focus on the counting of fish caught by all sectors.</P>
    <P>As stated previously in this House, tagging is not an end in itself &ndash; it is a means to an end &ndash; which is decision making based on real and comprehensive information. There are a range of complex challenges facing the salmon resource and the Minister has asked the salmon commission to give analysis and advice on the following key priorities &ndash; expanding and upgrading the national fish counter programme, enhanced spring salmon conservation strategies, catchment management strategies, the water quality chal<Col N="1004" /> lenge, incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort and predation. At its most recent meeting the commission agreed to recommend a range of measures for the conservation of spring salmon which will be forwarded to the Minister shortly.</P>
    <P>It is important that all sectors play their part where catch and escapement data show that stocks are under threat. No sector can be relieved of the obligation to reduce their share of mortality on salmon in catchments at risk. In this regard the process of catchment management has an important role to play in bringing together all the local fisheries and other interests which have a stake in a particular river catchment. Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, the fisheries boards have been given the function of organising together with local interests the voluntary development of inland fisheries catchment management plans.</P>
    <P>A number of these plans have been developed in the regions and significant additional funding has been made available to support them. The Minister has encouraged the fisheries boards to work together with local angling clubs and associations which have a particular role to play in the sustainable management and development to the public benefit of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>Within the catchment management process there are already in operation voluntary pilot schemes for the reduction of commercial fishing effort. The Department has also received a proposal for a salmon nets set-aside on the River Blackwater for 2001-05. The proposal has been prepared by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board with the co-operation of local stakeholders. The proposal is for the set-aside of up to 81 drift nets and six snap nets. The Department is in ongoing discussions with the southern board regarding this catchment based proposal. I will bring the Deputy's concerns, with which I wholeheartedly empathise, to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 April 2001.</P>

      <P>Last November, I published details of my plans to allocate some £100 million under the national development plan for <Col N="1006" /> the continued conservation and protection, in the period up to 2006, of the built heritage. A total of £65 million of that allocation has been allocated over the next six years on major conservation, protection or presentation works at more than 100 of the sizeable portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties in the care of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and funded by my Department, operates a buildings at risk register for heritage buildings of architectural significance.</P>
      <P>In May 1998, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I jointly launched the package of proposals for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage.

      <P>The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 56 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 191 and 192 of 4 April 2001 and to my reply to parliamentary question No. 254 of 10 April 2001 in which I indicated that my Department has, in recent years, adopted a new approach in relation to the funding of the improvement of bog roads under Scéim na mBóithre Áise.</P>
      <P>I also outlined in those replies the maximum level of funding per mile that can be approved where the work is being carried out by way of FÁS community employment scheme and the maximum level of funding per mile which can be approved where the work is being carried out by a registered contractor. I also clearly stated in my replies that it is a matter for the local co-operative or committee in question to obtain tenders, if necessary, and to comply with all the other conditions of the scheme including the carrying out of the work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the road referred to by the Deputies, I have already indicated in my reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 191 and 192 that my Department was advised that only one registered contractor was available in the area to submit a tender. I should point out, however, although tenders are a matter for the local co-operative or committee in question and the Department has laid down the maximum level of funding per mile which can be approved when the work is being carried out by a registered contractor, that it is this level of funding rather than the tender/tenders received that dictates the level of grant which may be approved in any given case.</P>
      <P>I understand that work on this road has recently commenced in order to facilitate access to the bogs during the turf cutting and harvesting season. As already indicated in a previous reply, a decision on this application will be made in the near future.</P>

It is a matter in the first place for the Commission to decide on the merits or otherwise of the complaint. I understand that the Commission has received similar complaints in relation to the funding of public service broadcasters in a number of member states.

      <P>It had been my intention to facilitate a consultation seminar to debate the main themes arising in the submissions received on the discussion document, Towards a New Framework for the Arts. Arrangements for the seminar were in place on two separate occasions over the past month but, due to the foot and mouth disease situation, it had to be postponed. This decision was taken following consultation with the official expert group on foot and mouth disease in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>The review, and the development of new arts legislation, continues to be a priority and, in order not to lose valuable time, I have decided to proceed with the drafting of legislative proposals. I am, however, fully committed to undertaking further consultation with the arts sector and other interested parties and will reschedule the consultation seminar as soon as circumstances permit. I propose to bring new legislative proposals to Government for consideration before the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, my Department took the view that Ireland did not need to propose SACs for salmon under the EU Habitats Directive. This view was held because the species is widespread in Ireland and designation of SACs was not seen as adding usefully to existing conservation mechanisms. The EU's <Col N="1016" /> first Atlantic region biogeographic seminar in late 1999 did not accept this view. This forum provides the agreed process for evaluating proposals from member states. As a result, we accepted that we should identify and propose sites for salmon.</P>
      <P>During 2000 staff of my Department consulted widely, particularly with fisheries boards, which provided extensive information on salmon distribution and abundance. It is my Department's responsibility to assess this information, having regard to the criteria in the directive, to identify which sites merit formal proposal as SACs and to advise me accordingly. Based on this advice, I have approved the formal listing for salmon of rivers in 13 existing candidate SACs, where the salmon interest is wholly or largely within the existing SAC. I have also decided in principle that 11 of these SACs should be extended slightly to encompass the salmon interest more fully, that another five existing SACs should be more substantially extended and listed for salmon and that four new SACs should be proposed for salmon, namely the Rivers Feale, Finn, Mulcair and Moy.</P>
      <P>Before these sites or extensions can be officially notified, detailed survey work is required to define their boundaries. This work was estimated to take until late this year at least, even before it was delayed by current foot and mouth disease precautions. It is not possible, therefore, for these new proposals to be formally transmitted to the EU Commission in time for them to be officially taken into account at the next Atlantic region seminar scheduled for September of this year. I am arranging for details of all areas proposed as candidate SACs to be supplied to the Deputy, together with information on the existing candidate SACs to be listed and extended for salmon.</P>

      <Quest>the number of islands for which her Department has a responsibility; the number of these which are permanently inhabited; the total population involved; and the plans she has to encourage an increase in the population on these islands.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While there have been exceptions, in general only islands satisfying the following criteria can normally be considered for the purposes of assistance from the islands division of my Department: islands lacking a bridge connecting them to the mainland; islands cut off from the mainland daily by the tide; islands which are currently permanently inhabited; and islands which are not in private ownership. Since responsibility for the islands was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach in 1997, the islands listed in Appendix 1 have received assistance from my Department. The latest population figures for <Col N="1017" /> most of these islands are available in Census 1996, Table 11 &ndash; Population of Inhabited Islands off the Coast, 1991 and 1996.</P>
      <P>In order to stabilise and increase the population on these islands, my Department has since 1997 made considerable progress in the development of the islands through financing island infrastructural projects and transport services. In 2000 alone, a sum of £3.269 million was spent to aid the provision and improvement of island infrastructure, such as marine works, roads, coastal protection, etc. Works financed during 2000 included: grants of £0.71 million paid to provide/improve electricity supply on seven offshore islands; approximately £0.21 million spent on a study of piers serving Clare Island and Inishturk off the Mayo coast; over £0.2 million spent on works on piers serving two islands off the Cork coast; £0.402 million paid to commence building a new bridge to Inishnee in County Galway; £0.221 million paid to set up a waste recycling scheme on the Aran Islands; a substantial amount of funding provided to the local authorities in respect of coastal protection works and improvements to roads and water supply on islands; a grant of £1.45 million approved for Mayo County Council to provide a cable car between the mainland and Inishbiggle at Bullsmouth; £0.054 million paid to Údarás na Gaeltachta for preliminary work on the development of an airstrip at Clifden, County Galway, to serve Inishbofin; and £0.165 million paid to Donegal County Council to carry out major improvement works on the harbour facilities at Léab Gharbh, Arranmore Island, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>My Department has also requested the local authorities to engage consultants to carry out feasibility studies on the development of improved pier infrastructure on a number of islands. The results of these studies are expected before the end of the year. One of the priorities for islanders is the improvement of island access and, with this in mind, a sum of £1.346 million was also spent in 2000 to assist current projects, especially to provide or improve ferry and air services to the islands. The services assisted include a passenger and freight service from Galway to the Aran Islands; a daily ferry service for passengers between Inis Mór, Árainn and Ros a'Mhíl, and Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr and Ros a'Mhíl; ferry services between Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island and the mainland; a ferry service between Cape Clear Island and the mainland; ferry services between Sherkin, Whiddy and Bere Islands and the mainland; a ferry service between Tory Island and the mainland; and an air service between the Aran Islands and the mainland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned services, I recently appointed consultants to carry out a comprehensive study on the proposed development and day to day management of airstrips and associated air services on a number of offshore islands. It is my intention to continue with this level of investment in both the physical and trans<Col N="1018" /> port infrastructure of the islands in order to stabilise and hopefully increase island populations in the future.</P>

These executives have potentially pivotal roles regarding decisions affecting film making in Ireland and I used my visit to emphasise the advantages of Ireland as a location for film-makers, including the section 481 tax incentive, which has been extended for five years up to April 2005. I received positive reaction and I am confident my visit has created opportunities which will be pursued by the Screen Commission of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The expert group established by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to consider the range of foot and mouth disease controls which are in place made a number of recommendations in relation to the holding of events. Events have been classified into categories according to the perceived risk of the spread of foot and mouth disease. The opening of visitor centres managed by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, is being determined by reference to the recommendations which have been made by the expert group. Events which are considered to have a low risk of the spread of the disease fall within category 1 and include gatherings of people in defined locations with no access to agricultural land or susceptible livestock. The visitor centres which fall within this category and which were due to open have opened to the public and those centres in this category which are due to open in the next two months will also do so. Events which are considered to present a greater risk of the spread of the disease fall within categories 2 and 3 and include events which take place on land and involve people only and events which involve animals, respectively. Some visitor centres fall within category 2 and in cases where susceptible animals have not accessed the land since 1 February 2001, the centres have re-opened or will open at the normal time. The expert group is being consulted in relation to those centres where susceptible animals may have had access since 1 February and measures are being taken to prevent further access. No visitor centres fall within category 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> While the prevention of foot and mouth disease is of paramount importance, I am confident that, provided the measures recommended by the expert group are implemented and that there is no change in the circumstances, it will be possible this year to open practically all the visitor centres managed by the heritage service of my Department. As of Easter Sunday, 30 of the 39 sites which would normally be open at this time will be open.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have now received a formal letter of complaint from the European Commission regarding Ireland's failure to provide a three year report on the implementation of the Council Directive of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds &ndash; the Birds Directive. Article 12 of the directive provides that member states shall forward to the Commission a report on the implementation of the national provisions for the implementation of the directive in each member state.</P>
      <P>The Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) has been implemented in Ireland through the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, and the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. The directive provides for an extensive regulatory protection and conservation system for wild birds in member states. It also provides for the designation and protection of important wild bird habitats, special protection areas or SPAs. To date, 110 SPAs covering an area in excess of 200,000 hectares have been designated and notified to the Commission by Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report required under Article 12 of the Birds Directive is currently in the course of preparation. The submission of the report has been delayed due to the concentration of staff resources in recent years on designation of sites under both the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive. However, I have directed that priority should be given to the completion of the report and it will be submitted to the European Commission by the end of May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the expenditure Estimates for nature conservation in recent years does not lend itself to the single incremental comparison made by the Deputy between annual allocations for 2000 and 2001 in respect of nature conservation, subhead S, in the Vote of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The allocation in 2001 is £19.325 million as against actual expenditure in 2000 of £14.87 million and this represents an increase of 30%. While the increase in the allocation between 1997 and 2000 is of the order of 38%, the increase in actual expenditure during the same period represents an increase of 74%, with significant variations in both allocation and expenditure figures during the same period. The significant variation between the allocations made during this period and the actual expenditure incurred is largely related to the rate of take up of compensatory schemes arising from the designation of special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. Compensation is payable to landowners where restrictions arising from the designation of special areas of conservation result in an actual loss of income to the landowner. Compensation costs are particularly difficult to estimate, as restrictions on lands and actual losses can vary from landholding to landholding and there can be a significant time lag between agreement on compensation schemes and maximum take up under those schemes. Also, there will be variations from year to year on the expenditure arising from compensation costs, which contributes significantly to the variation in actual expenditure incurred in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of Dúchas established staff is included in the overall provision for departmental pay and pensions. As Minister with responsibility for nat<Col N="1024" /> ure conservation, I am acutely aware of the significant increase in the workload arising in this area in recent years. To meet our national and international obligations for nature conservation, I secured 24 additional administrative and professional staff for the nature conservation area in 1998 and an extra 30 conservation rangers were recruited in 1999-2000 to assist in meeting our obligations under the EU Habitats Directive and EU Birds Directive. Under the circumstances, I would suggest that the increase in actual expenditure on both pay and on nature conservation directly in the period between 1997 and 2000 represents a significant and continuing commitment on my part to nature conservation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Community Employment is an active labour market programme the primary role of which is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. The general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the light of both the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure this programme, and the recommendations contained in the subsequent P2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. I have no plans in the short-term to further amend the criteria pertaining to participation on the CE scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As identified in the PPF and in the review of the operation of the Job Initiative programme carried out on behalf of my Department in 1999, some people may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market due to <Col N="1028" /> age and other personal barriers such as health, literacy and numeracy factors. Appropriate high supports are needed for people experiencing employment barriers of this nature.</P>
    <P>Proposals for this purpose are the basis for consultation with the social partners on this matter.</P>

    <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of high quality industry in the regions. IDA Ireland's regional policy is to secure 50% of all greenfield projects for the Border, midlands and western region. The agency also has a policy of focusing on projects with jobs of higher salary and of enhancing the quality of existing jobs. On 5 February this year, I launched Enterprise Ireland's new regional development strategy, which is Enterprise Ireland's approach to achieving balanced regional economic development by developing and sustaining existing businesses, enhancing the business environment, identifying and encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential and identifying new opportunities for economic development.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the combined efforts of the industrial development agencies will succeed in <Col N="1031" /> bringing about increased prosperity in the Border, midlands and western region, of which Galway is an integral part.</P>

    <P>The group reviews progress of the agencies and liaises closely with relevant local groups, for example, Ballinasloe Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>Work is almost complete on the production of a new industrial promotion brochure which will be financed by AT Cross. A skills profile and training requirement study in relation to the AT Cross workforce, is under way by FÁS and SIPTU.</P>
    <P>Securing alternative job creating enterprises is one of the group's priorities and considerable progress has been made in this regard. A French company has commenced operations in Ballinasloe, initially at temporary facilities at the Poolboy Industrial Estate. This company is also work<Col N="1032" /> ing with its advisors on the design of a new customised facility at the IDA's new Business Park, at Creagh. It is hoped that work will be under way on this new facility in the third quarter of this year. The company will employ 60 people at full production.</P>

      <P>The case under reference was the subject of a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal last year in which the tribunal granted an award to the employee in question under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations were made to my Department by the employee's trade union in July 2000 advising of non-payment by the employee's employer of the EAT award. Following examination of the determination it became clear that an error appeared on the original determination relating to the title of the respondent company. A correcting order was obtained by the employee concerned citing the correct title of the company. At that stage my Department followed up on the <Col N="1033" /> representations received by writing to the employer to request that payment to the employee be effected within a 14 day timeframe. On subsequently hearing that payment had not been made to the employee concerned within this timeframe, my Department, in January 2001, referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for the institution of legal proceedings against the employer.</P>
    <P>Legal advice on the enforcement of the award is expected shortly from the Chief State Solicitor's office and at that stage my officials will be in direct contact with the employee concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provides that an employee shall be entitled to a daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours and for a weekly rest period of 35 consecutive hours. If the employer cannot provide weekly rest he must provide the employee with 59 consecutive hours rest within two weeks, under the Act. The Act also provides that if an employee's contract of employment does not provide otherwise, the weekly or two weekly rest period should include Sunday.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provides that if an employee is required to work on a Sunday and if this is not taken account of in the determination of his or her pay then he or she must be compensated, <i>inter alia</i>, by the granting of such paid time off from work as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. The paid time off, while not specified in quantitative terms in the Act, must be reasonable relative to the employment circumstances of the individual employee. What is reasonable in this sense is ordinarily determined by reference to the compensation for Sunday working given to a comparable employee as specified in a collective agreement in force in respect of a similar industry-business sector. This is the principle followed in cases relating to Sunday work compensation coming before Rights Commissioners. If employees are not in receipt of paid time off for Sunday working and if their employer refuses to grant them such a premium it is open to them to take a case to a Rights Commissioner for redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of workplace bullying is the subject of a Task Force report, which I launched yesterday, Tuesday 10th April. The report, which represents a comprehensive examination of the issue, makes a number of recommendations relating to actions which should be undertaken at both State <Col N="1034" /> and at enterprise level, in order to address workplace bullying.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In relation to harassment, the Employment Equality Act 1998, for which my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility, prohibits both sexual harassment and harassment on nine specific grounds in the workplace, or in the course of employment, whether by an employer, by another employee or by clients, customers or business contacts of the employer. The nine grounds are: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community.</P>

The handling of rights issues is a matter for the various parties involved.

      <P>The underwriting criteria used by insurers are <Col N="1035" /> normally based on their experience of underwriting particular risks. This includes trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular segments of risks of the insurance market and classes of risk and are a matter for judgment by individual private insurance companies. It should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law prevents us from intervening directly with insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>The recent release of the interim report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board under the Freedom of Information Act has provoked much debate on the statistical basis for the insurance industry's argument that young drivers are a very high risk category. However, it is important to note that at the time the report was prepared, the board recognised that the raw data available to it was incomplete.</P>
      <P>The board emphasised at this point, that the indicators in the report could not be regarded as conclusions. The issue of the high cost of insurance for younger drivers is especially being examined by the board. The final report of the board is expected by the end of this year and its recommendations are awaited with great interest. In the light of those recommendations, I will consider what further action is appropriate towards the goal of the reduction of the cost of motor insurance.</P>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Non-Life Insurance Directive, authorised insurance companies may provide motor insurance throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. Currently there are 27 authorised motor insurers &ndash; 15 companies with their headquarters in Ireland, 11 based in other EU member states and one non-EU insurer who are all authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland. The list of all these authorised motor insurers is available in the 1999 annual report of the insurance division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The underwriting criteria used by insurers are normally based on their experience of underwriting particular risks. This includes trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular segments of risks of the insurance market and classes of risk and are a matter for judgment by <Col N="1036" /> individual private insurance companies. It should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law prevents us from intervening directly with insurance companies in the pricing and underwriting of insurance. I cannot therefore intervene in the particular case outlined.</P>
      <P>I note that the person whose details were supplied by the Deputy availed of the services of the declined cases agreement, a scheme for those motorists, including individual taxi drivers, who are having difficulty getting a quote for motor insurance. In recognition of the compulsory nature of third party motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the member companies of the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria, including evidence of five refusals from authorised insurers.</P>
      <P>I understand from inquiries made with the insurance industry that there are a number of schemes available to taxi drivers, mainly through the taxi unions, regarding insurance. Each scheme would have its own criteria for insurance cover but taxis are insured through the taxi plate owner's name. If a cosy is the only driver then his-her details would be the basis of the rating of the risk involved. The application of loadings to quotations would likewise reflect an insurer's interpretation of the risk involved.</P>

      <P>The sea-fishing boat licence issued to the company concerned precludes the vessel from fishing for herring and mackerel because the vessels offered as tonnage replacement capacity are not recorded as having an active history of fishing for pelagic species, which is a licensing policy requirement. In this context an active pelagic history is defined as a vessel with a minimum of four months fishing record for these species in each of the last four years. The company concerned accepted the terms of the licence prior to issue. In order for the vessel concerned to be permitted to fish for herring and mackerel it would be necessary to remove equivalent tonnage capacity with the requisite active pelagic history.</P>

      <P>The Rivers Lerr, Greese and the Grand Canal, Barrow line, are located in the River Barrow catchment and statutory responsibility for development of these fisheries lies with the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. In 1998 the southern board established a Barrow catchment management group consisting of representatives of a wide range of organisations including local authorities, Waterways Ireland, the <Col N="1038" /> Environmental Protection Agency, farming, tourism and angling groups.</P>
      <P>In 2000, I made £200,000 additional funding available through the southern board to develop the Barrow catchment management process. With this funding the board informs me that a considerable amount of fisheries habitat improvement works were undertaken including instream works, remedial works on eroding river banks and improvement of spawning areas and juvenile fish habitat. I am making further funding available for catchment management projects in the regions this year.</P>
      <P>Under the Tourism Angling Measure, 1994 to 1999, a total of £25,000 was approved for fisheries developments by the southern board on the River Barrow and a further £432,000 was approved for fisheries developments by the Office of Public Works on the Royal and Grand Canals. Under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006, a total of £24 million is available for tourism and recreational angling in the regions. When this measure is operational, applications for funding will be invited from fisheries boards and other public and private interests.</P>

      <P>The International Committee of the Red Cross &ndash; ICRC &ndash; and its affiliated organisations of the Red Cross family, function as a neutral intermediary in the event of armed conflict or unrest. The Red Cross endeavours, on its own initiative or on the basis of the Geneva conventions, to bring protection and assistance to the victims of armed conflict and internal disturbances and tension. The ICRC is one of the partner organisations with which the Government works in responding to emergencies and humanitarian disasters.</P>
      <P>Ireland contributed a total of £1,540,000 to the ICRC in 2000 for humanitarian relief and rehabilitation assistance programmes in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Lebanon, Rwanda, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan. During the same period, the Department of Defence made a separate, multilateral contribution of £100,000 to the ICRC, by way of its annual contribution towards its organisational costs. So far this year, the Government has contributed £750,000 to the ICRC for their appeals in Burundi, Iraq and Sudan. Further disbursal through the ICRC is anticipated during 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Societies which is also a member of the Red Cross family, received £444,613 during 2000 for humanitarian emergencies in Belize, Madagascar, Mongolia <Col N="1039" /> and Venezuela.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my written replies of 20 and 22 March to the questions tabled by Deputies Spring, Durkan, Gregory and O'Sullivan on this issue. In those replies I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite recent positive signals and statements on the part of the Algerian authorities and of a number of opposition forces for the ending of the seven years of civil conflict, there is continued opposition by some groups in Algeria to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. The security situation has seriously deteriorated in recent months after an improvement following <Col N="1040" /> the implementation of the general amnesty announced by President Bouteflika last year.</P>
    <P>Progress in the area of human rights is a major objective in Ireland's bilateral relations with Algeria. The Government has expressed its deep concern at the horrendous loss of life and the human suffering caused by the civil conflict. We continue to take every appropriate opportunity in our bilateral contacts, through the process of dialogue between Algeria and the EU, and at the United Nations, to urge the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will lead to an ending of the conflict, and for the establishment of independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and for bringing those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>In our continuing discussions with our EU partners Ireland has sought to maintain a strong emphasis on effective action by the EU to advance full respect for human rights in Algeria. The EU has called for the establishment of a dialogue between the Government, opposition groups, and civil society, as a means to bring about the peaceful climate and the process of national reconciliation as called for by the people of Algeria in the national referendum held in September 1999.</P>
    <P>At the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland and our EU partners will again raise the situation in Algeria under Agenda Item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, as on previous occasions, it appears that there would be insufficient support within the Commission for the adoption of a country-specific resolution. In such circumstances, it would be counterproductive were a resolution to be proposed only to be defeated. Such a defeat would only be of benefit to the hardliners and would send an entirely wrong signal as to the progress which the international community wishes to see in Algeria.</P>
    <P>The Government of Algeria continues to oppose the appointment of a UN Special Rapporteur, however, it has indicated that it is willing to co-operate with the UN Human Rights Committee on the question of human rights violations. Both the UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have on-going mandates from the Human Rights Commission to report on situations of concern. Reports by both Rapporteurs are due to be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Commission. It is expected that these would, inter alia, comment on developments in Algeria. The question of access for Special Rapporteurs to report at first hand on human rights situations of concern in a number of countries, not only Algeria, is also likely to be an issue in Geneva.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> In our contacts with the Algerian authorities the Government will continue to present its view that a more co-operative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current, tragic situation.</P>
    <P>There have been no further developments since my earlier replies</P>

      <P>The EU energy labelling scheme, which is now in operation in Ireland, stems from an initiative launched in 1990 to improve electrical end use efficiency and to help member states achieve CO2 abatement targets. The labels are designed to give the consumer key information about the energy efficiency of an appliance before they make their purchase decision. At European level a framework directive &ndash; 92/75/EEC &ndash; for energy labelling has been developed and the corresponding implementation directives for specific appliances have been transposed into Irish law.</P>
      <P>So far the regulations in force relate to the following household appliances: electrical refrigerators and freezers, electrical washing machines, electrical tumble driers, electrical combined washers-driers, dishwashers and lamps. In Ireland, labelling inspections are carried out by inspectors attached to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs at a rate of about 600 per year. Inspection results are forwarded to the Irish Energy Centre which monitors the performance of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Studies carried out in 1997 showed that the level of compliance in Ireland was 56%, which was the European average. Since then a concerted effort has been made to get compliance levels up to more acceptable levels.</P>

The group's report concentrating on wind energy technology was presented to me in July, 2000. The report contains a number of recommendations and a suggested strategy into the future. My Department is currently concluding an assessment of the report's recommendations and responses from interested parties with a view to concluding a revised policy.

      <P>The community application of information technology or CAIT initiative seeks to fund demonstration projects, which encourage and assist those in our society who are unfamiliar with, and who do not use, the new information and communications technologies in their everyday lives. It is intended that the community and voluntary sector would undertake these projects. More than £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the information society fund over the period June 2001 to December 2002. In excess of 450 proposals were received before the deadline, which expired on 15 February last.</P>
      <P>An independent steering group comprised of representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, other Government Departments and the private sector are currently considering all of these proposals. The criteria for consideration of proposals received include the extent to which the project promotes and encourages those in our society who are unfamiliar with the new information and communications technologies to use such technologies in a manner which is relevant, and which assists in overcoming barriers to development which may exist for them. Other criteria include financial, technical and organisational feasibility of the proposal, and overall value for money. The CAIT initiative is just one of many initiatives being undertaken as part of wider Government programme to ensure a fully inclusive information society in Ireland.</P>

      <P>One of the key safety recommendations of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the Tramore accident was that an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps would be carried out. Intercontinental aviation safety consultants were awarded the contract for this audit on 21 February 2001 and the audit was subsequently carried out between 21 March and 29 March 2001. The auditors gave a preliminary oral briefing at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, on 29 March during which a number of safety issues relating to the defender aircraft were raised. While the auditors indicated that these were preliminary findings which would be subject to change receipt of additional material, the safety issues raised were such that the general officer <Col N="1045" /> commanding the Air Corps decided that operations on the aircraft be suspended immediately. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities were informed regarding the safety issues arising.</P>
      <P>Contact has since taken place between all relevant parties including the aircraft manufacturers, the relevant regulatory authority, and the auditors on points of clarification and information. Once all technical issues which may have implications for safety have been satisfactorily resolved the aircraft will resume operations at the earliest possible date.</P>

Under this legislation, the council may enter on the register only persons who are citizens of, and hold an appropriate qualification from, an EU member state or from certain countries within the European Economic Area. I can also inform the Deputy that it is my intention to seek Government approval in the very near future to bring forward draft legislation to provide for regulation generally of the veterinary profession and ancillary diciplines.</P>

      <P>I am aware that livestock can be delivered to meat plants at times when Department officers are not in attendance, during night hours. Slaughter plants are legally required to ensure that the animals which they accept at their plants are identified in such a manner that allows the veterinary inspector at the meat plant, who undertakes the ante mortem inspection to determine their origin. This legal requirement applies irrespective of the time of delivery of the livestock.</P>
      <P>The delivery of animals to plants outside normal hours reflects the tight commercial and shipping deadlines which operate within the sector. This is particularly relevant to the sheep sector where 75% of exports are to France and where the length of time between slaughter, shipment and delivery must be kept to a minimum. Official attendance by Department inspection officers is required before slaughter commences to allow for examination of the required documentation and for ante and post mortem examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Under the existing FMD permit requirements, all livestock must be accompanied by permit documentation at time of arrival at the slaughter plant. As regards animal welfare, there are legal obligations on slaughter plants to ensure animals are handled and managed in an acceptable manner while they are being held prior to slaughter. These requirements relate to supervision, feeding and watering of the animals in question.</P>

    <P>The Civil Service Commission, as the primary recruitment agency for the Civil Service, has had a major part to play in addressing the recruitment challenges faced by the Civil Service in recent times. The commission has adopted a flexible approach to meet these challenges, with competitions being held more often, where necessary, and with selection methodologies being streamlined so as to produce a faster and more efficient throughput of suitable candidates. This strategy has been particularly successful in relation to the clerical officer grade, where a combination of more frequent competitions and a single-stage assessment methodology has helped the commission to substantially remove previous shortfalls in the supply of personnel to departments.</P>

      <P>The position is that the low income threshold for the health contribution, below which the levy is not payable, is currently £14,560 per annum or £280 per week, as amended by the Social Welfare Act, 2000. The weekly income threshold will remain unchanged at £280. Arising from the change in the tax year to a calendar year basis, the annual threshold will be £10,775 for the 2001 short tax year, i.e. 74% of the current threshold of £14,560. I have no plans to adjust either of the thresholds involved at this point.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the reductions in personal taxation made in budget 2001 provided substantial increases in net incomes, including for those on occupational pensions.

      <P>There were 20,000 copies of the <i>Budget 2001</i> newspaper printed. The total cost of the publication is £6,412.50. The articles in <i>Budget 2001</i> were produced by the press office in the Department of Finance and also included articles from other Ministers and Departments. There were no out<Col N="1052" /> side consultants involved in sourcing or producing copy or content for the newspaper. The printing of the newspaper was put out to tender by my Department last December, and the contract was awarded to New Century Limited.</P>
      <P>The <i>Budget 2001</i> newspaper was distributed by the press office in line with the manner in which all other information leaflets pertaining to the budget are distributed. The newspaper was sent to the principals of the 751 second level schools in Ireland for circulation to their students; the distribution list for this purpose is supplied by the Department of Education and Science. The postage costs are £863 approximately.</P>
      <P>In addition, copies were also sent to all Departments, departmental press offices &ndash; 1,500 copies, Fianna Fáil press office &ndash; 2,000 copies and the Progressive Democrats press office &ndash; 1,000 copies. Copies were also sent to all national and local media organisations &ndash; approximately 500. Some 600 copies were circulated to all officers of my Department. Copies are available on request from the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The cost of publishing the <i>Budget 2001</i> Newspaper compares very favourably with similar publications in recent years. As the Deputy will note from the following table, the costs this year were considerably lower than previous years. I am very happy with the very positive response to the <i>Budget 2001 </i>newspaper. I consider the publication to be an effective budget information document, both in terms of the presentation of the volume of financial data and also in terms of production costs efficiency.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I introduced a three tiered stamp duty structure for first time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first time buyers and investors of second hand houses. I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first <Col N="1053" /> time buyers and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000. Rates of duty for first time buyers at values up to £300,000 are 25% less than for other owner-occupiers. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with par<Col N="1054" /> ticular difficulties in the market at the present time.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty rates now applying for first time buyers and other owner-occupiers compared to the previous rates applying prior to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, are as follows:</P>

    <P>The purpose behind the first time buyer relief for the purchase of a second-hand house is to help individuals make the first entry into an already difficult housing market. In general, where a person has previously been able to purchase a house, either jointly or individually, he or she is not entitled to this relief. Similarly, where such a person purchases a house jointly with a first time buyer, the relief, generally, cannot be claimed as the house is not being bought entirely by first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>However, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, contains a provision whereby an individual whose marriage is the subject of a decree of divorce or a decree of judicial separation and who buys a new house to live in, will be entitled to claim the stamp duty first time purchaser relief on the first such occasion provided that, at the time of the purchase, he or she does not retain an interest in the former marital home and that, at the time of the new purchase, the other spouse still occupies the former marital home which was occupied by both of them prior to the dissolution. The Finance Act, 2001, extended this provision to circumstances where there is a decree of nullity or a deed of separation. I have no plans, at present, to make any further changes to the stamp duty rates applying on purchases of residential property.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table. The figures are derived from HIPE &ndash; hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; data which gives details of activity in publicly funded acute general hospitals in the State. HIPE data is only able to record re-admissions to the same hospital as it is not possible to trace patients from hospital to hospital. The figures includes all in-patient readmissions, re-admissions for the same condition, for an unrelated condition and planned readmissions, and excludes day cases. Figures are provided for each of the years 1997 to 2000 inclusive. Please note that updated figures for 1998 and 2000 are being used and data for 2000 is not yet complete.</P>
      <P>Health board refers to the patient's place of residence. Non-residents are not included in the table. Data on health insurance are not available.</P>

The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority.

Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board, with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Cigarettes are by far the most common form of tobacco product in use. About seven thousand deaths each year can be directly attributed to smoking related diseases. Tobacco smoke causes lung disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Life expectancy in Ireland is lower than the EU average and the diseases which contribute to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 80% of all smokers become addicted before reaching 16 years of age. On average smokers who begin smoking in adolescence and continue to smoke regularly have a 50% chance of dying from tobacco related illnesses. About 15% of cigarette sales are made from vending machines. I am concerned over the unrestricted access to cigarettes from vending machines, particularly by underage persons. Many cigarette <Col N="1063" /> vending machines are located in areas in premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision. This is unacceptable from a public health perspective. There is a need to control access to cigarette vending machines. I will be addressing this problem in the new Public Health and Tobacco Bill currently being drafted.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The second schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid, such sum to be retained for the patient's personal use.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Following an assessment of dependency and means, as provided for in the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the regulations permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>
      <P>I understand that, for administrative purposes, a patient may opt to appoint the health board as an agent to collect their pension. Nevertheless, there is no provision in the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations governing this issue and such an arrangement may only be entered into at the discretion of the patient.</P>
      <P>In relation to the individual case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine this issue as a matter of urgency and respond directly to the Deputy.</P>

In 1985, my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the criteria applicable in assessing priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment; the guidelines are based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion which prioritises need for treatment.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on orthodontic services, the Moran report, recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need and that provision of orthodontic treatment should continue on the basis of priority need. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the health board chief executive officers on the report and its implications. Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the health board chief executive officers and the review group on orthodontic services. I have asked the chief executive officer of that authority to investigate the position in relation to this case and to reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's immunisation policy is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. A supply of egg free MMR vaccine is <Col N="1066" /> available free of charge from health boards for administration to those with an allergy to egg. The advice of the national immunisation committee with regard to MMR vaccine is that allergy to egg is only a contraindication if the child has had an anaphylactic reaction following food containing egg. The MMR vaccine can be administered to children with non-anaphylactic allergy to eggs, even to those with severe hypersensitivity. I am advised by the Irish Medicines Board, the regulatory body for human medicines in Ireland, that there is no peanut content in MMR vaccine.</P>
      <P>MMR vaccine is available free of charge from family doctors under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this scheme. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time.</P>
      <P>The information currently available to my Department is that separate measles or mumps vaccines are not available in this country. The international consensus, including the World Health Organisation, is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and this is supported by a number of well validated studies on this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge parents to have their children immunised with the MMR vaccine in accordance with current recommendations. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioners before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever <Col N="1067" /> additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the Regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

The fund is primarily distributed to local authorities as general purpose grants, non-national road grants, and grants for miscellaneous purposes.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total local government fund for 2001 will be in excess of £720 million of which net income from motor tax and miscellaneous fees is currently estimated to be in the region of £400 million. I assume that the Deputy is seeking details of general purpose allocations from the fund. Details of general purpose allocations to each local authority are set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 107 of 9 November 2000. The Deputy may also be interested in details of non-national road grant allocations to each authority for 2001 which are set out in the Allocations 2001 Non-National Roads Booklet, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</P>

      <P>Ireland has a modern and extensive legislative framework for environmental protection. While I am, in general, satisfied with its adequacy and efficacy, there is a continuing need to keep the legislation under review and to bring forward new proposals as appropriate. At present, a Bill to amend the Waste Management Act, 1996, to ensure the completion of waste management planning in compliance with EU obligations, and for other purposes, is before the Oireachtas. I have also signalled my intention to bring forward an Environmental Protection Agency (Amendment) Bill to amend the licensing provisions of both the EPA Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996, for the purpose of giving full effect to an EU directive on integrated pollution prevention and control; there is also an extensive programme <Col N="1069" /> of secondary legislation to give effect to EU Directives in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is required by law to keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of public authorities whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on matters with which the agency is concerned. I am not aware that the existing body of environmental protection legislation has given rise to operational difficulties for the EPA, local authorities or the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, I announced a comprehensive package of measures for the improvement of rural water supplies, including significantly increased capital funding with grants of up to 85% of cost subject to a cost limit of £6,000 per house for the provision of new group water schemes and upgrading of existing deficient supplies. I also introduced a new 100% capital grant for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment on group schemes dependant on quality deficient private sources.</P>
      <P>The national rural water monitoring committee has furnished me with proposals for meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of small rural communities. This report recommends a pilot programme to test a range of new, small scale collection and treatment systems based on design, build, operate, DBO, procurement by local authorities. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic waste water from households outside the immediate catchment of new treatment systems. Consequently, any such developments in relation to group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot study.</P>

      <P>The Rathangan sewerage scheme was included, as a 2005 objective, on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02, announced last July. Because of the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it was not possible to include the scheme in the programme at that time.</P>

These standards have been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle and lighting manufacturing interests and with member states. All new cars sold in Ireland are required to meet the standards which are also deemed to <Col N="1075" /> comply with national vehicle lighting law. Within this framework, gas discharge headlamps have been type approved in accordance with European Union law and are consequently in compliance with Irish lighting law.</P>
      <P>Over and above the technical specification for headlamps, Irish regulations require that headlamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for direction indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of 7 watts. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. The Garda has responsibility for enforcing the regulations.</P>

      <P>To assist local authority tenants purchase their homes a discount of 3% of the value of the house is allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of 30%. In addition to this, a further discount of £3,000 is provided. Thus, a local authority house with a market value of £100,000, would be available for purchase at £67,000 by a tenant of ten or more years' standing. By any account, this is a generous discount.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part fund the local authority housing programme.

Such a change will, however, have to be managed so as not to compromise road safety or the important targets in this regard set by the Government Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002.

It is not likely to be practicable to complete the implementation process by the current target date of mid-2001 and a revised target will be established based on the assessment of the above working group. It is envisaged that a publicity and information campaign will be organised in the lead up to the implementation date for metrication to ensure that the public and all concerned are well prepared for the changes.</P>

      <P>In assessing the means deriving from social security payments made in other EU currencies, the Department employs the exchange rate at which the currencies of participating EMU states were fixed against the euro on 1 January 1999. In the case of non-EMU states of the European Union, the Department uses an exchange rate mechanism which was used throughout the EU prior to 1999 and is now used for non-EMU member states. Under this mechanism, exchange rate factors for each non-EMU currency are determined quarterly by the EU Commission under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on social security for migrant workers. The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non-EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.</P>
      <P>In assessing means derived from social security payments made in non-EU currencies, the exchange rate for each currency is obtained by averaging the exchange rates for the last day of each month in the preceding quarter. The resulting average is converted to IR£ using the standard euro/IR£ conversion factor. In assessing means deriving from foreign pensions, account is taken of the rate of exchange applicable at the date of the last increase in foreign pensions or the rate for subsequent quarters if that is more beneficial to the pensioner. In this way, applicants are assured of the most beneficial treatment when their entitlement is being reviewed.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>As a result of changes made by the Government in the budget, from this month the maximum rate of the old age contributory and retirement pension is £106 per week. The equivalent rate for the old age non-contributory pension is £95.50 per week.</P>
      <P>The difference in the rates is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which suggested a differential of 10%. The Pensions Board in its report, Securing Retirement Income, concurred with the Commission on Social Welfare's view. One of the main advantages of the contributory pension is that it is an entitlement which is not subject to a means test and which, therefore, is paid regardless of any other income, property, savings or investments a person might have.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people receiving non-contributory old age pensions remains large but there has been a drop of nearly 23% in recipients since 1989. The contributory pension is growing in importance and now accounts for almost 63% of new pensions awarded against 50% ten years ago. This increase reflects the fact that almost all workers are now covered by social insurance, the extension of which has been a deliberate policy of successive Governments. It is also an indication of the Government's commitment to extending contributory based pensions to as many people as possible through easing the qualifying conditions and catering for special groups who marginally failed to qualify for a pension.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 66 years or over may qualify for old age contributory pension, subject to meeting certain qualifying contribution conditions. This payment is not subject to a means test and the recipient can continue to work or have other income such as an occupational pension.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons aged 66 years or over who are laid off as a result of foot and mouth disease restrictions and who are not eligible for old age contributory pension, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the most appropriate of income support scheme. During periods where a person's means may be temporarily insufficient to meet his or her needs, a person can apply for SWA at the local health centre. His or her application will be determined on the basis of his or her current circumstances and immediate needs. A weekly addition may also be paid to a person who is receiving a basic allowance or some other social welfare or health board payment if his or her means are insufficient to meet his or her needs and he or she has specific weekly expenses, for example, rent or mortgage interest, special heating needs or dietary or other expenses.</P>
      <P>The existing range of social welfare income support measures is designed to provide income support to low income families in a wide range of circumstances, including those resulting from the current foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>

      <P>The Grand Canal corridor study published in 1995 provides a strategy and proposals for canal regeneration from Grand Canal Dock, Ringsend, to Lucan Road Bridge and I am arranging to provide the Deputy with a copy of the report.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the study a Grand Canal task force was set up to co-ordinate and monitor the activities of the various agencies responsible for developments within the canal corridor. A regeneration officer was also employed to engage directly with community groups with a view to encouraging local participation in the development of the canal. A number of community employment schemes were organised in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas to carry out landscaping improvement works along the canal. A community barge reconstruction project was also set up in Clondalkin with the assistance of the waterways service of my Department.</P>
      <P>The waterways service also carried out works in this area including the construction of a jetty at the ninth lock. An intensive fish stocking of the area was also undertaken with the assistance of the Central Fisheries Board and the area has been developed as a match stretch with the installation of fish stands and markers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and was assigned the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. Accordingly, any future developments on the canal system will be a matter for Waterways Ireland under the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

      <P>This Government is keenly aware of the value of the music industry. I am pleased to advise that agreement has been reached with the music industry representatives, under the auspices of IBEC, to establish the Music Board of Ireland and I hope to be able to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
      <P>The main function of the Music Board of Ireland will be to devise and actively promote strategic policies for the development of the music industry and the maximisation of its contribution to the national economy. It will be established initially for three years as a non-statutory body. Its terms of reference will include the drawing up of proposals for legislation to establish the board on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>The industry is also supported by the business expansion scheme which was extended to the music industry in 1997. In the period 1997 to 2000, the total level of investment certified by my Department under the scheme was £2.75 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply, as referred to by him, in which the reasons for giving priority to matters other than the Shannon callows were fully explained. I regret that co-operation was not forthcoming last year for the study of financial implications of habitat prescriptions on farms in the callows. I would be pleased to see such a study successfully completed. This should now be possible if the farming organisations are ready to join with my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in overseeing a study along the lines previously agreed, but based, if necessary, on different sample farms.</P>
      <P>I envisage such a study as leading to speedy agreement on habitat prescriptions for the callows and similar lands to be implemented through the REP scheme, or, for farmers not in REPS, through farm plans leading to appropriate levels of compensation from my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the work of the task force on the callows cannot proceed without the agreement of the landowner participants to allow access to their lands. I look forward to such agreement by the landowners, who are themselves party to this task force, so that the agreed necessary work can proceed.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response of 21 February 2001, to Parliamentary Question No. 143. The position remains unchanged from that outlined in my reply. The architectural advice available to my Department is that the folly is not under immediate threat, while the priority for Castletown House continues to be the restoration of the house itself together with the provision of visitor facilities and works to the grounds and auxiliary buildings surrounding the house.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the first phase of the restoration of Maynooth Castle comprises the adaptation and conservation of the ground floor and the provision of access to the first floor. This work is at an advanced stage and I expect this element of the project to be complete in the near future. Once the interior of the Castle is complete, work will commence on site reinstatement. Preparation of the exhibition is also under way. The total spend to date on the restoration of Maynooth Castle is £839,036. I am satisfied that the project being undertaken can be completed within the available budget of £1.5 million. I am also satisfied that the project remains on target for completion in the second half of this year.</P>

      <P>My Department cannot say how many films are likely to be produced in the State over the next 12 months. My Department's area of responsibility relates to the certification of films under the section 481 tax relief scheme. While a total of nine such certificates have issued so far in 2001, this may not be taken as indicative of projects which will actually be undertaken in this period. Based on the trends of previous years, it is likely that between 28 and 35 films will be made here in 2001, under the section 481 scheme, but this assessment does not take account of the impact of the foot and mouth pre<Col N="1089" /> cautions in restricting access to locations selected for film making. I should add that I recently visited Los Angeles in order to further develop and strengthen the links between the US film industry and the Irish film industry. Meetings and contacts took place with key executives at major studios including MGM Pictures, Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. These executives have potentially pivotal roles regarding decisions affecting film making in Ireland and I used my visit to emphasise the advantages of Ireland as a location for film makers, including the section 481 tax incentive, which has been extended for five years up to April 2005. I received a very positive reaction and I am confident that my visit has created opportunities which will be pursued by the Screen Commission of Ireland.</P>

      <P>All known archaeological sites in the State enjoy the protection of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994. In addition, all applications for grant aid made through the Forestry Service of the Department of Marine and Natural Resources that may have archaeological implications are referred to my Department for consideration and recommendations. The Forest Service has produced a set of guidelines entitled <i>Forestry and Archaeology </i>and this outlines best practice in relation to the conservation of the built heritage. Officials from my Department work closely with their counterparts from the Forest Service as well as with Coillte and private forestry interests. Finally, my Depart<Col N="1090" /> ment has recently carried out a consultant's review of afforestation impact on archaeological sites and my officials will be taking into account the findings of this review in conjunction with the Forest Service to further strengthen the protection of our archaeological heritage. Taking account of all these measures, I am satisfied that the archaeological heritage is sufficiently protected from the threats posed by all afforestation activity.</P>

      <P>Archaeological sites and monuments known at the time of the compilation of the Record of Monuments and Places established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, have been included in the RMP and are protected by the provisions of section 12, which require that two months advance written notice of proposed works at or in relation to site or monument be given. Newly discovered archaeological sites or monuments will be included in future updates of the RMP but, if necessary, they can be afforded protection in the interim by entry in the Register of Historic Monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, which imposes similar obligations of notification. If necessary, and where there is a perceived to be an immediate threat to a site, a temporary preservation order or full preservation order can be made under the National Monuments Acts. In addition, there are a number of other measures in place which are aimed at safeguarding the archaeological heritage from the threats posed by land use changes. Among these are referral by planning authorities of development applications to my Department for comments and recommendations where the proposed development may impact on archaeological sites and monuments; similar referral process by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to forestry and marine development applications; a code of practice is in place with the National Roads Authority dealing with the archaeological implications of major road projects and other similar codes are being discussed with other development sectors and the REPS scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which requires that impacts on archaeological sites and monuments be avoided has over 40,000 participating farmers.</P>

      <P>While my Department does not undertake projects with the specific objective of encouraging interest in local history, all archaeological excavation and all interpretation at visitor facilities incorporates aspects of local history so that the heritage site is placed within its proper historical framework. The national heritage plan, which will be published later this year, will address the importance of community involvement in the protection of heritage and will provide for the development of local heritage plans. Local heritage plans will be directly relevant to people living in that area and will encompass all aspects of the heritage of a particular region, including local history. In addition, each year my Department co-ordinates and promotes national heritage week. The principal aim of this week is to make people aware of built and natural heritage, particularly local heritage, thereby encouraging its conservation and preservation. The Deputy should also be aware that the majority of the events during national heritage week are organised by volunteers or other interested groups. In 2000, many events focused on the history of local villages, on the impact of a great house on a locality, on local crafts, on industrial heritage and on the wealth of local interest in music and art. The estimated number of participants in national heritage week events in 2000 was over 200,000. My Department will continue to support national heritage week.</P>

      <P>I have always believed that the effective communication of the conservation message to children of school going age is a key element in our efforts to effectively protect our heritage in the long-term. To that end, I have instructed the education and visitor services division of my Department to examine how this message might be better delivered to schools, and in that context a number of avenues are being actively considered. In January 2000, I announced a scheme of free educational visits for schools, under which primary and secondary school pupils have free access to Dúchas sites on a pre-booked basis. Since then, over 68,000 pupils have visited heritage sites under this scheme. As the scheme develops it will give many more schoolchildren a real experience of their heritage which they will learn from and enjoy.</P>
      <P>A schools outreach programme would involve a more effective system for liaison by my Department's heritage sites and properties with local schools while the preparation of an appropriate heritage module, for use by transition years, and a video would present the essentials of the heritage message in clear and easily understood terms. The Heritage Council's heritage in schools initiative is considered to be a very good model. Discussions have commenced between Dúchas and the Heritage Council with a view to developing a strategic alliance between the two services on this it. In 1999 and 2000 performances were given at heritage sites by theatrical companies, the main focus of which was interaction with children on the history of the sites. During national heritage week many child orientated events take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000 my Department was a partner to the Historic Buildings Council of Northern Ireland in the initiative named Time Quest: A Time Trail to the Millennium. This was specifically aimed at school children who were encouraged to visit heritage sites, north and south, and to record their impressions on the time quest website. A magazine edited by my Department is distributed annually to all fifth classes in primary schools and in 2000, 87,000 copies were distributed. The Deputy will appreciate that some of these proposals will take longer to pursue than others and there may be staffing, and other, resource impli<Col N="1093" /> cations to be evaluated. Relevant issues will also have to be fully discussed with the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <Col N="1097" /> Since 1 January 2001 a further 11 Garda personnel have been allocated to the Limerick division, bringing the total strength to 446 as of 9 April 2001.</P>
    <P>These figures represent an increase in the strength at Limerick division of 5.2% between 1 January 1998 and 9 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The manpower strength of all ranks at Limerick division as at 1 January 1985 was 541. In this regard, it should be noted that protection duty, which was performed at Limerick Prison until February 1995, required an allocation of 42 Garda personnel. Furthermore, protection duty was also carried out in the Newcastlewest district in relation to the then Minister for Justice and this required an allocation of 6 Garda personnel. This duty ceased in June 1992.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of Limerick will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Last November I announced that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems will be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that tenders will soon issue, in line with EU and public procurement guidelines, for the provision of town centre CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Tenders received must then be evaluated before any contracts can be placed. While this process will inevitably take time, it is expected that the CCTV system in Limerick will be operational during the final quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme administered by my Department, it is a condition for grantees to execute a deed of trust in respect of facilities in receipt of grant-aid above a certain threshold which stood at £39,000 up to and including the 2000 programme. In the light of rising building costs, I reviewed that threshold and decided to revise it upwards to £60,000 for the purposes of grants under the 2001 and future programme.</P>
      <P>The deed of trust provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. To enable a deed of trust to be executed the grantees must either own the property or have a long-term lease of 35 years. The deeds of trust are prepared by the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO.</P>

    <P>There has been no disagreement between my Department and the local authorities over the <Col N="1100" /> status of land and I am not aware of any projects which have been delayed for that reason.

The curriculum envisages that all children will have access to a range of experiences in arts education which will enable them to communicate their ideas, feelings, insights and experiences through image, music, language, gesture and movement. It also envisages that children will have opportunities to respond as viewers, listeners or readers to their own work and to the expressive creativity of artists, composers, writers and performers. When planning for the implementation of arts education, schools are encouraged to develop relationships with local and national artists and arts institutions such as concert halls, art galleries and museums so that children are enabled to experience visual arts, music and drama in such settings.</P>
    <P>By June 2001 all 21,000 primary teachers will have had access to comprehensive in-career development in visual arts as part of a phased programme for all primary teachers organised <Col N="1101" /> through the primary curriculum support programme, PCSP. From September 2001, a regional curriculum advisory service, operated by the PCSP and the Education Centre network, will assist schools with the implementation of the visual arts curriculum. Similar programmes in music and drama will be organised in future phases of the national support programme.</P>
    <P>To assist schools in buying the materials and resources necessary for the implementation of the visual arts curriculum, I arranged for the issue of a visual arts grant to all primary schools in autumn 2000, at a rate of £5.50 per pupil or, for schools with 60 pupils or less, a minimum of £330. In addition, in December 2000, I disbursed a further £6.1 million pounds to support primary schools in their implementation of all aspects of arts education. This capitation grant amounts to £13 per pupil, or a minimum of £780 for schools with 60 pupils or less. This funding for the arts is part of the Government's continued commitment to investment in primary education.</P>
    <P>At second level, the new leaving certificate music syllabus is now very well established and preparations for the introduction of a revised syllabus for leaving certificate art are well under way. The implementation of this syllabus will be accompanied by a comprehensive programme of in-career development for teachers. The introduction of this syllabus will result in a significant increase in interest in art as a subject at senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In the transition year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils' interest in the arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to conduct a survey of radon levels in primary and second level schools in 1998.</P>
      <P>The survey is being carried out in three phases. The results of phase 1 issued to the 685 participant schools in January 2000. The results of phase 2 of the survey issued to the 1,056 participant schools in November 2000. Phase 3 is under way at present and the results are expected late this year. When phase 3 is complete my Department will review the position with a view to re-issuing invitations to schools who have not participated in the survey. This will be a very small number of schools.</P>
      <P>The RPII indicated to my Department that 59 schools with very high radon levels should be given priority when installing mitigation systems. Systems have been installed in 33 of these schools and arrangements are under way to install systems in a further 24 schools. In one other school a detailed investigation showed that the only area with a high radon level was a non-habitable store. Re-testing will take place at that school but it appears that mitigation action may not be necessary. In one case the affected building has been sold and is no longer a school premises. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in 13 of the mitigated schools where preliminary post mitigation testing is complete the results show that radon levels have been mitigated to below 200bqMf7&gt;3.</P>
      <P>Active mitigation systems are required in another 54 schools. My Department has retained consultants to specify systems and arrange for their installation in 28 of these schools. At present my Department is identifying consultants for the remaining 26 schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the schools I have already discussed another 291 schools are below the level of 400bq Mf7&gt;3 set for the workplace under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000). Last month my Department received the results of a ventilation study it had commissioned from the Building Research Establishment, BRE, in Watford. These results indicate that increasing the background ventilation in schools with radon levels between 200bqMf7&gt;3 and 400bqMf7&gt;3 should be effective in mitigating the levels to below 200bqMf7&gt;3. One of these buildings is no longer functioning as a school and in four other cases radon mitigation measures will be incorporated into works to take place at the schools in the near future. At present my Department is preparing a circular to inform the remaining 288 schools of the results of the study, to set out the remedial action to be taken by schools and to set out a <Col N="1105" /> scheme of grants to enable these schools to undertake the necessary remedial action. I expect this circular to issue shortly after Easter.</P>

      <P>The Department of Environment and Local Government has established a working group on the schools' library service. My Department, the Library Council and local authority librarians are also represented on the group. One of the terms of reference of the group is to consider the role of the public library service in the operation of the school libraries.</P>
      <P>The group has held a number of meetings and will continue to meet over the period of the next six months. If the Deputy wishes to provide further details regarding the matter raised in his question, I will ensure that it is brought to the attention of the working group.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in recent years my Department has issued two grants to primary and post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued in December 1998 and all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>
      <P>My Department issued a second grant to all primary and post primary schools in December 1999, as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Post primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level, the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £2,614 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and the circumstances of these schools would then be further considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question have now been forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. As soon as the ERC has examined the representations and reported to my Department, the school will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution. Decisions on applications are taken by an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which, in 2000, consisted of representatives of my Department, administration and inspectorate, a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability &ndash; AHEAD &ndash; and a representative of the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA.</P>
      <P>The criteria for assessing the applications were drawn up by the <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group.

      <P>This grant is one of a large number of grants now being paid directly to school bank accounts by electronic fund transfer. As the grant is calculated on the basis of the total enrolment in the schools on 30 September last, it was necessary for my officials to ensure that all the necessary data was verified before the transfer of funds could take place. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that the grant is paid at the earliest opportunity in future years.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund. The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as community employment schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Depart<Col N="1110" /> ment, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question of 262 pupils will warrant the staffing of a principal and nine mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>The board of management made representations last year regarding an increase in enrolment at the school for the current school year. The increase in enrolment did not materialise and in fact the enrolment dropped by one pupil between 30 September 1999 and 30 September 2000.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, under the guidelines agreed with the INTO the post of tenth mainstream class teacher will be due to be discontinued for the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>I have received no complaints concerning the treatment of residents at the location referred to by the Deputy. However, I am aware that the Deputy has raised concerns with the director of the centre about the programme being provided for a boy who is resident there. The centre is currently considering these concerns and I expect to receive a report shortly. Any further action required in the matter will be considered at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boy in question has had a long history of being in residential care, involving a number of residential establishments. Occasionally, he exhibits extreme behaviour patterns and also suffers <Col N="1112" /> from a severe medical problem, which presents challenges for those caring for him. I am aware that an incident took place at the centre some weeks involving the boy and a special programme was subsequently developed to meet his needs. The staff of the centre in question are working collaboratively with the boy's family and other relevant agencies in supporting the implementation of the programme which is kept under review.</P>
    <P>Centres for young offenders are subject to inspection by a Department inspector appointed under the 1908 Children Act for this purpose. The inspector is supported in his role by a specialist child care adviser, who regularly visits the centres to observe practice and to advise management and staff in relation to particular cases. On average, these personnel visit these centres more often than once a month. The centre in question was also subject to a comprehensive external inspection in 2000 and its recommendations are currently being implemented. In addition, the inspection process is supported by regular visits to the centre by members of the board of management and other external agencies with responsibilities for the welfare of the young people being cared for. The social services inspectorate, that was established by my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, does not have any role in relation to these centres.</P>
