      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the allocation by 1 April 2001 &ndash; next Sunday &ndash; of milk quota from the national reserve to members of the National Milk Quota Rights Group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today shall be as follows: No. 20, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed <Col N="790" /> Bodies) Regulations, 2001; No. 21, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 2) Regulations, 2001; No. 22, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 3) Regulations, 2001; No. 6, ACC Bank Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 46, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages and No. 47, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and that business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; Nos. 20, 21 and 22 shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and the Second Stage of No. 6 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 110, motion re Electricity Supply (Resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Order of Business. Fine Gael is seriously concerned about the handling of the Sinnott case in the Supreme Court. Another issue also arises in that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, inadvertently misled the House by stating that all damages would be paid to Jamie and Mrs. Sinnott. This subsequently transpired to be incorrect. There is provision for the Minister, and there are precedents for Ministers who inadvertently mislead the House, to come into the House to set the record straight.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to correct the record in accordance with precedent. Even at this late stage there is merit in the State dropping the case and paying the full damages agreed in the High Court to Jamie and Mrs. Sinnott.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputies that the proposal before the House concerns the late sitting and has nothing to do with the matter referred to by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, the proposal before the House is that we agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The proposal before the House is to agree to the late sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The late sitting is one item on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal concerns the late sitting and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to the late sitting if the Taoiseach will allow time for debate on <Col N="791" /> motion 128 or 129 on the Order Paper for which there is majority support in the House, including Deputy McGennis in the Taoiseach's party, and which would direct the Executive not to proceed with the oppressive appeal to the Supreme Court against Jamie Sinnott and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true. Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why he has allowed the Minister for Education and Science to mislead the House and why that misleading statement remains on the record of the House uncorrected? What is the Taoiseach going to do about this oppressive action against the Sinnott family which is appalling the entire nation?</P>
      <P>We have had one day of reports of the court's proceedings. Will the Taoiseach do us the courtesy of outlining the Government's attitude to the House? When will the Minister for Education and Science correct the misleading statements which stand on the record of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Labour Party and Fine Gael in seeking to ensure that the Jamie Sinnott case is dropped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The late sitting is not late enough given the Sinnott case and the fact that the Local Government Bill seems to have gone to ground even though the Minister for the Environment and Local Government seems to think it is fundamental in principle to enact the Bill. Will the Taoiseach reassure the House that the Local Government Bill is still alive and kicking and capable of seeing the light of day and that the phantom government of the four Independents will not hold sway when the Government claims this is important legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I referred to the fact that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, gave a detailed account on 20 March of what he previously said and the reasons <Col N="792" /> for it. The Supreme Court is sitting today to consider the Sinnott case. The Cheann Comhairle and the House will know it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment which would appear to attempt to influence the outcome of a hearing of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could correct the record of the House. That is not trial by jury.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not trial by Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister addressed that issue on 20 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent for the Minister to correct the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time seven Supreme Court judges are on the Bench to hear the case. The matter is of considerable constitutional importance so it will not be decided here today. The legal system does not permit points of law to be decided in the abstract. The important issues raised in the Sinnott case cannot be appealed without appealing the outcome of the case. Everyone in this House who knows anything about the law, and there are quite a few, knows that to be the case.</P>
      <P>The payment of £157,000 has been made, bringing the total payments, to date, to Jamie Sinnott and his mother, Kathryn Sinnott, to £215,000. Whatever happens in the Supreme Court, none of these awards will be recovered by the State. Legal costs in the High Court and the Supreme Court will be paid by the State. The case, which is the subject matter of much publicity, is by no means the only such claim being brought, or likely to be brought, against the State. It is important, therefore, that the State deals even-handedly and properly with all such claims on the basis of their proper constitutional and legal foundations. I have no doubt that after the Supreme Court's judgment we will know how we are to follow these cases that were not clear following the High Court's ruling. However, we must await the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I believe a majority of Members of the House are not satisfied with the explanation given by the Taoiseach in respect of the Sinnott family. He should reconsider the position. It is not true to say that the Government is powerless because a court case has commenced. The Government initiated that court case and is at liberty, at any stage, to cancel further proceedings. In light of the fact that a clear majority of Members, including many of his party's backbenchers, are decidedly unhappy with the action being taken by the Government, the Taoiseach should indicate that he is prepared to give instructions to withdraw the proceedings in this case and, as a matter of courtesy to the House, that he will direct the <Col N="795" /> Minister for Education and Science to come before us to correct the record. As it stands, that record is clearly misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this motion because the Minister for Education and Science misled the House and he should come before us to correct the record. There are several precedents for his doing so. In addition, I believe the Government is wrong in continuing to pursue the Sinnott family. The Taoiseach informed the House that it is already Government policy to ensure that people of all ages can avail of life-long education. In that context, there is no policy issue to be adjudicated. The Taoiseach should drop the case, mend his fences and direct the Minister to come before the House to make a personal statement correcting the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is totally incorrect. There are clear policy issues involved in the Jamie Sinnott case.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that following his conversation with Mr. Blair in Stock<Col N="796" /> holm on the foot and mouth disease outbreak, there is a view that he unfairly reprimanded the Northern Ireland authorities and gave offence to both officials and politicians, including the Minister for Agriculture, Ms Rodgers MLA, who is dealing with the crisis in the North? Does he realise that agriculture in Northern Ireland is a devolved function and is not within the competence of the British Prime Minister?</P>
      <P>Critical remarks about practices in Northern Ireland are not critical of Mr. Blair, they are critical of Ms Rodgers MLA. Will the Taoiseach arrange a ministerial conference of agriculture Ministers, north and south, so that the problem can be dealt with on an all-Ireland basis? Any damage that has been done to the relationship between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Ms Rodgers MLA can then be repaired at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming the statement issued by the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Trimble MLA, when he welcomed the fact that the European Commission had given regional status to Northern Ireland? Does he also agree that this was a practical manifestation from the Unionist community of the benefits of co-operating on an all-Ireland basis on matters of mutual concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are separate issues involved. One issue related to information received from truckers travelling through ports in Northern Ireland. The issue of mats was central. Some mats were useful in dealing with cars but not with trucks and the truckers made this point clear for several days. We did not raise this with the Northern Ireland authorities until the point was strongly made by trucking groups. We then relayed their concerns to the authorities there. Ms Rodgers MLA is doing an excellent job in Northern Ireland and is being seen to do so, but we did raise those concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has had several meetings and conversations with Ms Rodgers MLA to clarify matters.</P>
      <P>The ports in Britain are a separate concern. Our position is that not all of these ports had visible foot and mouth disease security measures in place. Mats were sometimes deficient and there were requests for sprays in some cases. A list of ports, provided to me by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, was passed over to the British authorities last week detailing areas of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are pleased that the Northern Ireland authorities followed the same procedure as Ireland with European Commission officials and with the EU veterinary committee. We are pleased that Northern Ireland has now also got free status. We are also pleased with the arrangements that the <Col N="797" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and Ms Rodgers MLA have made to extend the exclusion area south and north of the Border. The expert group believes that is an essential matter and we are pleased with the co-operation on all sides.</P>
    <P>We all have a major job to do in dealing with problems arising from past practices. We need excellent co-operation to deal with the practices of smuggling and other issues. Almost the entire criminal investigation section of the Garda is dealing with this issue in the Border region.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate that by raising the issue of the Northern Ireland ports with Mr. Blair he gave the impression that he did not know that agriculture was a fully devolved function in Northern Ireland? Does he understand that raising this issue was taken as criticism of Ms Rodgers MLA in particular, because the Taoiseach went to the British Prime Minister to complain of her? Does the Taoiseach realise that by doing this he cut a stick that could be used by Ms Rodgers' political opponents to beat her in debate in Northern Ireland? Does the Taoiseach realise that he jeopardised the Northern Ireland initiative to get regional status from the EU? Will the Taoiseach apologise for the difficulties created?</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach explain why there was not a Garda investigation following the revelations of sheep smuggling on RTE two years ago? Can he further explain why on two occasions the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, told the House that smuggling was not occurring? He told the House that the problem had been resolved through the Revenue Commissioners. Now we <Col N="798" /> find that a Garda investigation was undertaken last week. The Minister now explains sheep smuggling on the basis that bandit activity continues as part of the culture and tradition of the Border counties. We need a statement on this as the matter is not clear. Are the gardaí continuing to investigate?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to Deputy Quinn's question, to the best of our knowledge, and the ability of the authorities to visit the various farms related to that delivery, it took some weeks to find the information on the whereabouts of animals, as Members will know from the Minister's information to the House. Intelligence was obtained by the Garda from members of the public and Garda efforts centred on tracking that consignment. I am not certain that all animals have been traced. I am not prepared to trust the information of those involved in such smuggling. It shows just what can happen as a result of one truckload of sheep. At least ten locations, perhaps more, were involved in that but all the information that the gardaí discovered has been dealt with and all the surveillance and the necessary slaughtering and testing in the surrounding locations have been done. I hope the full information was given but I am not certain.</P>
      <P>On the other matters, I cannot say off the top of my head what a Minister did or did not say about any particular case but what I know is that for as long as he has been a Minister Deputy Walsh has been adamant that we will get to a position where we will have full tagging and traceability. He worked diligently to achieve that and has finally succeeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that was not done over the years but he has now got to that position. I do not know if anyone in this House ever believed that smuggling was not taking place. Everyone always knew there was a level of smuggling going on but what people have learned in recent times is the extent of that, which is now a problem that has to be dealt with for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat alarmed that after so many days following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease here, the Taoiseach is hanging on hope &ndash; I trust I quote his words accurately &ndash; that all of the potentially infected and infectious animals have been traced, counted and destroyed. That is an extraordinary admission when one thinks of the terrible damage foot and mouth disease is doing to the rest of the Irish economy. <Col N="799" /> All of the Members of this House will have been circulated, on behalf of the tourism sector, with the information that up to £33 million and 1,315 jobs have been lost, with a further 20,000 jobs expected to be lost. Can the Taoiseach give the House a categorical assurance that the Government will vigorously pursue systems to ensure that every sheep is properly tagged and anybody suspected of engaging in smuggling will have the full rigours of the law brought to bear upon them, including the application of the Criminal Assets Bureau which has been so successful in other areas of criminal activity in this Republic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all of what the Deputy said. I assure Deputy Quinn and the House that in recent weeks every effort has been made by every senior person involved in the Garda investigations, and the gardaí were involved in the working team every day, to trace what are believed to be 60 missing sheep. They have not given up on that from the time they first received information. They believe they were possible imports from the UK and the precautionary slaughterings followed from the information which the gardaí had discovered. There have been slaughterings in Laois, Meath, Carlow and Wexford over the weekend because of the possible connections with Meigh and evidence suggests that the sheep in those premises may have been smuggled south <i>via</i> the Collins premises in Meigh, although it is not clear how many of the slaughtered animals were on the Collins premises. There were also other areas to where they moved as well. I am satisfied that every bit of information detected has been dealt with. The Garda investigation team believes it has tracked them down, in so far as it can, but in terms of following up any information with regard to the Garda action and looking at some of the factories, all of those investigations are ongoing by the Garda.</P>
      <P>On the tagging issue, I understand the Minister has finalised the arrangements in that regard and is now proceeding with the tagging.</P>

    <P>Bill entitled an Act to make provision in relation to ACC Bank public limited company including, increasing the authorised share capital of the bank, the issue of shares in the bank in connection with an employee share ownership trust for the benefit of its employees, the disposal by the Minister for Finance of shares in the bank and provision in relation to certain guarantees of the bank's borrowing, to provide for the repeal to the extent provided for of the ACC Bank Acts, 1978 to 1999, and the provisions of certain other enactments and the revocation of certain statutory instruments and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of ACC Bank and to put in place the enabling provisions required to facilitate the establishment of an employee share ownership trust in the bank. It also provides for the future sale of ACC Bank, subject to the approval of the House at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, ACC and TSB Banks had agreed to merge and float in 1999. This proposal had originated from the ACC group of unions in 1998 and had been signed up to by all parties. However, in the light of market developments, the boards jointly recommended in January 2000 that the merger should not proceed and the Minister reluctantly accepted this recommendation. At that time, the Minister asked the boards of ACC and TSB, along with the ICC board, to review all the options for the future and reiterated his view that the<i> status quo</i> was not an option. Since then, both ICC and TSB banks have undertaken successful sale processes.</P>
      <P>ACC Bank on the other hand, had a difficult year for reasons we are all aware of, and it is now time to benefit from the lessons which have been learned and move forward in a positive manner. ACC has not yet reported its figures for the year ending 31 December 2000 but a loss for the year is anticipated. However, the management of the bank reports that the core business has been strengthened and that the bank is performing very well.</P>
      <P>In relation to the DIRT settlement which is the main reason for the anticipated loss in 2000, the board has expressed its deep disappointment to the Minister at the evidence of widespread deficiencies in ACC revealed by the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry and the Revenue audit. The board and management have assured the Minister of their absolute commitment to ensuring full compliance in the future and their determination that the mistakes of the past will never be repeated.</P>
      <P>The board and management have reviewed the bank's operations and recommended that the bank adopt a new strategy which involves moving away from general retail banking in order to concentrate on business banking and to provide a more focused personal banking service, which includes continuing to serve its original market, the agricultural sector. ACC has already rationalised its branch structure in Dublin. It regards its rural branch distribution network as one of its strengths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new strategy will involve a restructuring of the bank's operations. The Minister has mandated the bank to continue its course of negotiations with staff representatives on all aspects of this restructuring, including a new employee share ownership plan. The ESOP will be in line <Col N="807" /> with previous ESOP schemes, with a 14.9% stake in ACC being available to staff, 5% in return for change in the bank and 9.9% for purchase.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also mandated the board to explore all options in relation to a change in the ownership structure over the course of the next 12 months. The bank has appointed corporate financial advisers to help in this process. The Minister has recently appointed A &amp; L Goodbody to be his legal advisers in relation to the sale of the bank.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank. The current authorised share capital of £50 million has been nearly subscribed in full. As things stand, the Minister is unable to subscribe for further shares in ACC Bank. This is not a prudent position to be in even though the company currently has no requirement for additional capital. If the company requires additional capital, the board's proposals will be assessed at the appropriate time. It is the Minister's intention to ensure that the company remains adequately capitalised as long as it remains in State ownership.</P>
    <P>The other objectives of the Bill are to put in place the enabling provisions to facilitate the establishment of an ESOP and a change in ownership in line with the provisions put in place in relation to ICC Bank in the ICC Bank Act, 1999, and the ICC Bank Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the definitions section and is self-explanatory. Section 2 is a standard provision in relation to the expenses of the Minister. Section 3 provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank from its current limit of £50 million to £100 million. It is the Minister's intention to ensure that the bank remains adequately capitalised as long as it remains in State ownership; £49.95 million of the current limit has been subscribed. ACC Bank is adequately capitalised at present and no request for further capital has been made by the board. The effect of this section is to allow the subscription of further capital. Any request for further capital will be considered at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the establishment of an employee share ownership plan. This section is identical to the provisions made for the ESOP in ICC Bank in the ICC Bank Act, 1999. Section 5 provides for the disposal of shares by the Minister for Finance. It is identical to the provisions made for ICC Bank in the ICC Bank Act, 2000. Any disposal of shares, other than to a director of the company as nominee of the Minister or to the ESOP, requires a motion of approval from the Dáil. Section 6 provides for the continuation of existing guarantees given by the Minister. No guarantees will be given in the future and the amount which is subject to guarantee will continue to be reduced as existing facilities expire. Section 7 is a standard provision requiring ACC Bank plc to take relevant action to alter its mem<Col N="808" /> orandum and articles of association, in the context of the Companies Acts, to make them consistent with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that ACC shall no longer be subject to the requirement applying to statutory authorities under the Registration of Title Act, 1964. This section will only be commenced following a change of ownership. Section 9 provides for the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;recognised lender&rdquo; in section 23 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, which regulates chattel mortgages. This is being done to eliminate the requirement for banks to be recognised separately by the Minister, in addition to their normal licensing requirements, in order to register a chattel mortgage. Section 10 provides for the deletion of ACC from section 2 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978. It will only be commenced following the sale of the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the deletion of ACC from section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which provides that only the Central Bank may present a petition to have an examiner appointed to a bank. Once sold, ACC will come under the provision as the holder of a licence under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government has recommended that the relevant section of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, should be consolidated as it currently stands which is the effect of section 11(1) of the Bill. Section 11(2) is a further consolidation which reflects the deletion of ACC and it will only be commenced following the sale of ACC.</P>
    <P>Section 12, and the accompanying Schedule to the Bill, will only come into play if and when the bank is sold. This section provides for the repeal of most of the ACC Bank Acts, 1978 to 1999, and the deletion of references to ACC in other legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these repeals and deletions is to ensure that ACC Bank, once sold, will operate on the same basis as any other private commercial bank. They will be given effect by ministerial order under section 12(2) of the Bill. The relevant order will not be made until ACC Bank plc is formally granted a licence by the Central Bank. Section 13 gives the short title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Given the experience of the ICC and the TSB, it is only right that the Agricultural Credit Bank or ACC Bank should also be outside of public ownership. Many years ago there was a strong case, a compelling case, for its establishment. Times have changed and now there is no case for the State ownership of banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in my position as Chairman of the  Committee of Public Accounts and chairman of the DIRT inquiry, I should comment on the situation the bank is facing arising from that inquiry. The bank's situation is directly connected with <Col N="809" /> this Bill and the forthcoming announcement of its results for the last financial year. It is true that the ACC Bank did not emerge well from the inquiry, and that is an understatement. It is also true that few if any banks or financial institutions emerged well from the inquiry. The important question is whether the ACC Bank has learned from the inquiry and whether it has put its house in order. The onus is on the bank to reassure the House and public opinion.</P>
    <P>From my own research, I believe there is a determination on behalf of the board and senior executives of ACC Bank to take on board the lessons of the DIRT inquiry and cleanse the bank of the sort of culture that was exposed. If there is not a comprehensive clearing out of that culture, it will jeopardise the sell-on of the bank. If my perception is correct, they are addressing the issue seriously. It would be important that the bank would make full provision for all matters to be addressed prior to privatisation in its forthcoming annual report. If it fails to address those matters, privatisation will be jeopardised. There will be a once-off provision for payment to the Revenue Commissioners arising from a settlement from the DIRT inquiry. Further provisions must be made for the investment in the Four Seasons Hotel and a number of other lesser issues. The bank must address these matters comprehensively and must err on the side of making provision in regard to any grey areas. This is a once-off opportunity for the bank to get its accounts in order in a transparent and comprehensive way. Any examination of due diligence which will inevitably precede a take-over will then be satisfied that the bank's accounts are in order.</P>
    <P>The bank intends to close its Dublin branches as part of its proposed economies. That may appear sensible on the face of it in that one might ask why an agricultural credit corporation would have branches in Dublin. However, the reality is that the bank's business has expanded far beyond an agricultural remit which currently represents a far smaller proportion of its business than heretofore. I query the wisdom of closing the Dublin branches. Is there a danger that the bank may sell off an aspect of its business which may prove very attractive to prospective purchasers? The bank has also made economies in its credit card business and has arrived at far more cost effective arrangements in this area which do not jeopardise or reduce services to its customers.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the DIRT inquiry which should not escape us is that the Department of Finance &ndash; the bank's owner &ndash; seriously lapsed in its supervision responsibilities. Proper reporting procedures were not in place either between the chairman and the Minister or between the chief executive and the secretary general. The Department is still represented on the board of directors and while this is not unique, it raises some important questions. It is a normal feature of State companies operating under the aegis of Government Departments that the relevant Minister appoints civil servants as <Col N="810" /> members of the board of directors. However, this can give rise to absurd situations in which a Department can deny knowledge of an issue because the civil servant representing the Department was wearing two hats, that of a Department employee and a director. In the past &ndash; I am aware of this from my ministerial experience &ndash; civil servants have claimed to have had knowledge as directors which they did not have as civil servants and pleaded ignorance on that basis. Why should civil servants be appointed to the boards of companies if their job is not to act as watchdogs for the Department?</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance deserves to be roundly criticised for the manner in which it handled the ACC Bank in the past. It is all the more galling that banks owned by the Department of Finance, which sets down policy and law in regard to the regulation of all financial institutions, exhibited some of the worst examples of bad banking practice. Will the Minister assure the House that a proper reporting relationship is currently in place between the chairman of ACC Bank and the Minister and the chief executive and the secretary general and will he ensure such relationships continue for as long as the bank is in State ownership? Will he elaborate on the channels of communication which are in place and the frequency of such communications? Can the Minister assure the House that all is well in regard to the running of ACC Bank? It is important that we receive answers to these questions, not in an effort to dwell too much on the past but to be assured for the future. This House must have confidence in the running of the bank. The lack of such confidence and assurance will affect the bank's sale price.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows on the legislation on the ICC and TSB, both of which were successfully sold and I hope it will result in a similar success for ACC Bank. I particularly welcome the provision in regard to ESOPs. It is very important that employees have the right to be shareholders in the enterprise for which they work. A precedent set in this regard in the case of Telecom Éireann was subsequently followed in ICC and TSB. Will the Minister assure the House that the net proceeds of the sale of ICC and TSB and those of ACC Bank, if and when it is sold, will go into a fund to provide for future pension costs rather than being remitted to the Exchequer?</P>
    <P>I am informed that ICC was sold to the Bank of Scotland for £275 million, having been valued previously at a lesser figure. The sale price exceeded expectations. Of that £275 million, 85.1% or £234 million went to the Exchequer. Did that money go into a fund for future pension needs? The difference between £234 million and £275 million is £41 million, representing 14.9% of ICC's value of which 5% was given without cash payment to the bank's employees. Obviously employees paid a price in terms of accepting major changes, including redundancies. However, 5% went to the bank and I support the idea that a percentage should go to employees. The other <Col N="811" /> 9.9% was purchased by the employee share ownership plan on behalf of employees. It has been very profitable for employees of ICC Bank and it is important to say that. Employees of ACC will be encouraged by the experience in ICC. Having invested in the company, the investment of ICC employees is worth a great deal more in terms of current stock prices. Some 320 employees are involved and the gain so far is £20.25 million, which is £66,000 per employee. That said, the price can fall as well as rise. The experience with ICC has been a happy one and is a good precedent for employees of ACC Bank and should encourage them to embrace the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The sale of TSB has also been a success for the bank and its employees. The TSB has been taken over by Irish Life and Permanent. Its value for the purposes of the ESOP purchase was £200 million, but the sale price was £339 million, which is a very good price and exceeded expectations. The TSB has 1,200 employees and, taking current share values, they have done very well from their free shares and from their investment. They appear to be ahead by about £31,000 at present. It must be emphasised that these are ballpark figures rather than precise ones, but they show that workers who co-operate with change can benefit. Those of us who invested in Eircom, like the employees of the company, will know that share prices can fall as well as rise. We should not be too sanguine. That said, in the case of TSB and ICC, it has been a very worthwhile investment. The Minister of State may be in a better position to give more precise figures but, on the face of it, ICC and TSB are happy precedents for ACC.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the timetable for privatisation? Obviously the first step is for the Bill to be enacted in both Houses and signed by the President. When is it proposed to take steps under the Bill? What timetable does the Minister of State envisage for putting the bank on the market? Will it be before the end of this year or is it likely to take longer? Will he outline the steps he will have to take to get the bank into shape for sale? The bank will have to change its articles of association. When will that be done? Would it be too much to ask if there have been any expressions of interest?</P>
    <P>The law has limited the amount of share capital the Minister may take in ACC to £50 million and he has already subscribed £49.8 million. Therefore, it is prudent to make further provision. The £200,000 still available to the Minister will not be much good if there has to be a cash injection to ready the bank for sale. I am aware there is not any certainty that money will be needed, but perhaps the Minister of State will comment on whether he envisages having to pump further money into ACC before privatisation.</P>
    <P>The bank began as a service principally and overwhelmingly to the agricultural industry, especially farmers. It has gone far beyond that and a great majority of its business is now outside <Col N="812" /> farming. The Four Seasons hotel experience indicates how far beyond agriculture it has gone. The Bill is being debated at a time when agriculture is in crisis because of foot and mouth disease and many farmers will have major credit problems arising directly from that. Will the Minister of State say whether the Department of Finance will make available some guarantees or credits for farmers in the current climate or will make any approaches to or arrangements with ACC Bank and other banks to ease the desperate plight of some farmers arising from foot and mouth disease? Given the heartbreak for farmers in losing their entire stock or the danger of same and all the other matters which flow from that, such as restrictions on animal movements, the fact stock cannot be sold and cash flow and other financial problems created by that, I appeal to the Minister of State to make a statement urging the banks to take a generous and lenient attitude towards farmers who are not able to meet their commitments in the current crisis, and to say if it is his intention to make some financial provision to assist with these debts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope and believe ACC Bank is getting its act together and I wish it well. I hope the Bill will be a harbinger of success for the future and that the bank's flotation will be every bit as successful as its predecessors, the ICC and the TSB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this debate from a different ideological prejudice to other colleagues who have already spoken. I have said on a number of occasions that the Minister's stance on banking is a curious one. He has stated unremittingly and repeatedly since he came to power that he does not see any role for State banks, but he has not said why. There has been and can be a significant and strategic role for the ICC and the ACC. Whether that role still exists is an open question and one with which I will deal in some detail later. It is important to state that there can be a strategic role for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that my party in the early 1990s favoured the formation of a third banking force within the State sector. We wanted to combine the three State banks with An Post to compete effectively with the privately owned commercial banks. That was a good strategy. There was and still is an urgent need for competition within the banking sector, but what has happened in the meantime, especially the sale of ICC and the prospective sale of TSB, renders that strategy redundant. We must now examine the ACC in isolation to see if it is has a strategic role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC has existed in one form or another for about 75 to 80 years having been set up in 1927. For most of the first 40 to 50 years it was obliged by statute to concentrate exclusively on agricultural lending. It did so effectively, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a driving force in assisting the rural community to capitalise itself, improve its efficiency, buy the combine <Col N="813" /> harvesters and increase capital use on farms. This made agriculture more efficient and opened it up to European competition in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to discover that the bank was only allowed to diversify outside the agricultural sector in 1987 because it did so very quickly, to the extent that most of its lending at this stage is outside that sector. We must question whether the diversification over the past 13 years has been good for the bank. It is the case that virtually all the various indicators have increased, including the bank's costs, with the singular exception of the p/e ratio. The bank has not become more profitable and there is no evidence, in terms of looking at it as a purely commercial exercise, that the diversification over the past 13 years has been good for it. This aspect is relevant in terms of its future. If the ACC Bank is to have a future inside or outside the public sector, it needs a focus. It is difficult to see its purpose because it is a long way from the agricultural lending of the 1960s and 1970s to the type of Four Seasons expedition in which the bank has engaged in the past year or two. It is difficult to foresee a serious strategic role for the bank.</P>
    <P>The bank's board and the trade unions have on a number of occasions in the past three or four years considered developing a strategic plan. In 1992, it considered developing such a plan in the context of the third banking force. It produced a corporate strategy for the period 1997 to 2000 and the board has been asked to produce another strategy for the next few years. I was interested in the Minister of State's comment that the board and management of the bank have decided to adopt a new strategy which involves moving away from general retail banking and concentrating on business banking and providing a more focused personal banking service. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on this in his reply by outlining what business banking and particularly what a focused personal banking service means.</P>
    <P>I hope it means the bank will try to develop the type of business which is done by the Sparkassen in Germany. It concentrates largely on relations with individual customers. We are all aware of what has happened in the major commercial banks in the past year. They have become depersonalised and are increasingly concentrating on technology. The average customer is receiving less service to the extent that one cannot cash a cheque. There is a role for a small regional bank that would provide personalised services to individual customers. The ACC is in a position to provide that type of service in the future, albeit on a relatively limited scale.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of my argument is that, in terms of the diversification that has taken place and the fact that a third banking force is no longer a viable proposition, there is no reason to retain the ACC within the State banking sector. To that extent, I am not opposed to the central tenet of the Bill. However, I do not like the way it is being done. It is not the first time it has been done in <Col N="814" /> this way, but I do not like it because we are, in effect, signing a blank cheque. I appreciate the Minister must introduce a motion in the House in the future, outlining the rest of the important details. However, it unreasonable to present a Bill which effectively provides a blank cheque and I would not be inclined to sign it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked the Minister about the timetable for the sale. I assume there is no timetable for a sale because it is an open secret that there is not a posse of potential purchasers knocking on the door, wanting to buy the ACC Bank, and there is unlikely to be such a posse in the near future. The Minister will not give the House a timetable today, but the ACC Bank should not be sold yet. It needs to get its act together before it is sold. If the bank is sold now, the State will not get good value for it because it does not have a developed strategic plan and it has not sorted out what exactly is its core business. It has poor industrial relations and it needs to sort itself out. Until that happens, the bank should not be sold. I hope the Minister will confirm this position when he responds to the debate.</P>
    <P>I suspect the principal purpose of the Bill is to kick the ACC's management and trade unions in the hope that they will get their acts together. There must be a better way of doing this than producing a Bill, although there is a need for a message to be sent to the management and work-force of the ACC that they must get their acts together and that the type of adventurism of the past two years must come to an end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the ESOP. The more such plans that arise, the more sceptical I become about their purpose. In principle, ESOPs are meant to encourage stakeholding and financial participation. They are meant to make workers feel that they are part of the company and to give them an incentive. They are supposed to give workers a share of profits and a sense of belonging to the company. They are supposed to create a sense of purpose on issues that are common to the management and workforce of an organisation. This is all wonderful in principle and I agree with it. ESOPs in the private and public sectors have a serious role to play in creating such a culture in companies and I support that idea.</P>
    <P>However, it is difficult to relate that argument to what happened in State companies where effectively, a random amount was given to individual employees and the company was privatised. It was little more than slipping people a few quid to keep them quiet during the sale process. It did not encourage any of the issues I mentioned earlier, such as any sense of identity between the workforce and the company. In some cases, operations were sold to different companies and they became part of bigger companies. As I said in the debate on the Bill relating to the TSB recently, this created an extraordinary anomaly where some employees in Permanent TSB have shares in the company, but the majority do not have shares. A similar situation is likely to arise <Col N="815" /> in the future with regard to ACC and this does not perform any of the important strategic roles ESOPs can perform in the State or private sector.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, one wonders why it is done in the first place. If it is to be done, it should be on a more rational basis. The likely capitalised value of ACC will be between approximately 160 million and 200 million. On that basis, the value of the ESOP will be approximately 30 million to be divvied up between the employees. Even within the banks, the range of value of ESOPs to individual employees has been huge, but the ESOP will be worth a great deal less within the ACC than it was in the ICC. There is no logical or good reason why that should be the case since it is only a payment to people to smooth privatisation. It might as well be a uniform figure for the various banks rather than having different amounts for different banks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned the DIRT business and he is much more qualified to speak about it than I am. However, it is crazy that the operating profits of a State bank for last year were wiped out because it must make payments for taxes, interest and penalties to the Revenue. It is extraordinary that this was allowed to happen. If nothing else, it points to serious deficiencies in management and in terms of accountability to the Department of Finance, the stakeholder and the owner, and also the House. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there are lessons to be learned. It is clear that when a State company, in this case a State bank, does not know what it is meant to be doing and when nobody in the House is paying particular attention to it, a capacity exists for matters to go seriously wrong. This happened in the case of ACC. We hope the DIRT debacle is over and that the ACC and all the other banks have learned a bitter lesson for which they paid dearly to the Revenue in monetary terms. We hope that, in the future, those lessons will be taken on board and the mistakes will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to industrial relations within the ACC but it is not my business to allocate blame to either management or the workforce. Usually in these circumstances, problems arise only when there is a problem on both sides, which is likely the case within the ACC. I would like the Minister to give us some assurance that the difficulties which arose during the attempt to set up Newbank have been surmounted. It is an open secret that things were not good at the time and that the capacity to manage within that company did not seem to be what it should have been. That being the case, the workforce presumed a licence which in many other companies it would not presume. I do not wish to say any more than that. There is a need to ensure that the lessons of that experience have been learnt and that in future things will be a good deal better.</P>
    <P>I am not comfortable with the main thrust of the Bill which is to provide the Minister with the cheque about which I have been talking. All of <Col N="816" /> us support the other significant provision, that is, the increase in the share capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill about which I have mixed feelings. I am pleased the Minister is dealing with the issue but I have mixed feelings at this time because of the difficulties ACC has been going through in recent years.</P>
      <P>The essential purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the future sale of ACC. There are other provisions in the Bill relating to employee share option schemes and the possible increase in share capital, if necessary. That may or may not arise because it depends on when the sale takes place. Deputy McDowell has often mentioned this aspect and we have different views on the sale of State assets. Following the policy announcement by the Minister last year in relation to the sale of ICC and Telecom, the funds went to the pension superannuation fund. The Minister of State said in his speech that the proceeds of the ACC bank sale will go to the Exchequer. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has said that at the end of the year, when the figures are known, it will be easy to arrange for that amount to be transferred to the superannuation fund. This does not have to take place on the day of the sale but it must happen in the year of the sale to ensure the money is not included in the overall Government surplus for the year.</P>
      <P>The TSB, ICC and ACC were originally looked at collectively but, for a variety of reasons, it was not possible to merge them into a third banking force. When these discussions were taking place, I was a bit miffed that An Post Savings Bank was not taken into consideration. An Post Savings Bank, through its national savings schemes and deposit accounts, traditionally got young people throughout the country to save money, whether First Communion money or Confirmation money. Many people began saving in the local post office. The post office does not have the facility to lend money as it is just a deposit taking institution. The facility to lend money would be encouraging for An Post given the difficulties it is experiencing in maintaining the sub-post offices network. The credit unions are well able to provide this facility at local level, therefore, it could be considered for An Post. I do not believe the local branches would make decisions in relation to loans, that would have to be done on a regional or area basis. However, providing loan application forms and making monthly repayments on any particular loan could be carried out through the local post office. I ask the Minister of State to consider the future role of An Post Savings Bank, even though it is not part of his brief today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year or two, we have dealt successfully with the ICC sale. It was discussed at committee and in the Dáil on several occasions and this sale has been very successful. We then moved on to deal with the sale of the TSB. Irish Life and the Irish Permanent Building Society merged and are now in the process of taking over the TSB. <Col N="817" /> When that matter was being dealt with, I pointed out that there is a TSB branch in my home town of Portlaoise and literally two doors up there is an Irish Permanent Building Society office. Unfortunately, it goes without saying that one of these institutions will close because it is not feasible for any bank, regardless of how profitable it is, to have two competing branches two doors from each other.</P>
    <P>The ACC bank, which is just a few hundred yards away, must also be taken into consideration. The structure of the ACC throughout the country has been one of its strengths and, therefore, I hope whoever buys it will continue to maintain all the branches in the main provincial towns. The Minister said that it is going back to its core business. It recently pulled out of the credit card business in which it was involved with the TSB and handed it back to the TSB. It has now notified its customers that it is no longer involved in credit card transactions, as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>As a result of ICC and TSB being successfully dealt with, it is now the turn of ACC. The climate for the sale of ACC is more difficult than for previous sales. While the Government has appointed A&amp;L Goodbody as its legal advisers and NCB Stockbrokers as financial advisers to try to identify a potential purchaser and, while it is correct to move ahead with this legislation and make provision to facilitate the future sale of ACC, I would be in no rush to sell ACC at present. We could not have picked a worse time in its history since 1928 to put the bank on the market given that it had reasonable profits in previous years but it is now reporting a loss in relation to its accounts for last year, which are expected to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I will refer in detail later to its financial accounts following the bank's recent financial statements. I accept the Minister is a shrewd businessman and that he will not necessarily accept the first offer. If the first offer is attractive, I would encourage him to take it but if the offers are not attractive, he should wait until the time is appropriate. I suggest this for two reasons. The principal reason is to ensure taxpayers get value for the assets they have built up over the years through Government support of the ACC. The second reason was referred to at length by Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    <P>On the employee share option scheme, I would be very concerned that the 5% employees will receive as of right for facilitating the change in the bank's structure, and the 9.9% which they have an option to buy themselves, will be called 15% in round figures. If the sale price is very low as current market values may dictate, the value of the shares would be very low and ACC employees might rightly believe they could get a raw deal. If the value is sufficiently low, there will be very little interest by employees in taking up the 9.9% available to them. That is why I encourage the Minister to wait until the price is right. I have no doubt the price will be right at some <Col N="818" /> future date. I am not sure when that will be but it is important to have the legislation in place to facilitate the sale. We must always ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.</P>
    <P>The ACC was traditionally known as the Agricultural Credit Corporation which suggests it was heavily involved in the agricultural sector. In 1988 legislation allowed for 25% of its activities to be outside the agricultural sector. As a result, it has diversified and moved into personal and commercial banking. The Four Seasons situation has been mentioned. I believe that level of borrowing for the bank was out of proportion. Regardless of the costs involved, this project was too big for a bank of this size. Given the scale of the project, the bank should have been one of a consortium of banks, not the lead bank.</P>
    <P>The network throughout the country is a major asset which should add to the value of ACC Bank's portfolio. While carrying out research during the past few days I was upset by an article in a recent edition of <i>Business and Finance</i> which suggested that today's market value of ACC Bank is £1. That may be correct today in that ACC Bank is experiencing difficulties, but it is not a true reflection of where it has come from or where it will be in the future.</P>
    <P>The most recent accounts available for ACC Bank relate to 1999. I wish to highlight a few points in the accounts which are of interest and concern to me. When talking about ACC Bank it is no harm to look at the specifics, and the place to find these is in the last set of published financial statements. The profits of ACC Bank in 1999 were 24.4 million. Members will forgive me if I refer to euros as this is the currency used in the financial statements. While this figure represents a slight decrease on the previous year, it is well up on preceding years. This is a good figure which one would have thought would put a value of £200 million or £300 million on the bank at that time. I hope it will return to this position in the future.</P>
    <P>One factor which weighed heavily against profits last year was the charge of 3.17 million for the ACC/TSB merger, which was ultimately cancelled. That was the financial cost, but much time was devoted by senior executives, the board of management and board of directors to dealing with the merger process. The reason they concentrated on the merger was that it looked like this was where ACC was headed in 1999. In addition to the charge of more than 3 million there was a non-financial charge in terms of morale within the ACC. The cancellation of the merger was a major disappointment to the people involved in the process.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the provision in the accounts of 5.8 million for dividends to the Exchequer. The figure for the previous year was 5.13 million. Given that it was in the throes of the DIRT investigation and agreeing the biggest settlement in its history, it was not prudent for the board of directors to make a provision of more than 5 million for dividends. As the bank is expected to <Col N="819" /> report a loss, the accounts for 2000, which will be published shortly, will unquestionably contain a figure for dividends. Given that the bank was in the middle of negotiations in 1999 and knew what was around the corner, it was not wise to include a figure for dividends.</P>
    <P>No provision was made in the last set of published accounts for the DIRT settlement. I query the reason for this. I understand that the bank subsequently came to a settlement after the year end. A note in the financial statements in relation to the contingent liability for deposit interest retention tax states:</P>
    <P>A Revenue audit of all DIRT at ACC Bank is currently taking place. Pending the outcome of that audit the Directors cannot reliably estimate the amount of outstanding DIRT. A contingent liability exists in relation to the outcome of the Revenue audit and also in respect of the statutory interest, penalties and fees which the Revenue may seek to apply.</P>
    <P>The determination of the aforementioned contingent liability depends on factors which are uncertain and without precedent and, therefore, it is not possible for the Directors to reliably estimate the financial effect of this contingency.</P>
    <P>The 1999 accounts were signed by the auditors in April 2000 and by the directors on 10 May 2000. Yet the half year accounts up to the end of June, which was only a few weeks later, contained a precise figure. At the time the accounts were signed the figures were well known to within a small margin. In its financial accounts for the half year up to the end of June 2000 the bank announced that it had made a final settlement. Given that it was a prior situation, the bank should have taken the hit, so to speak, in 1999 so that the accounts for 2000 would show a profit. Instead the bank will be hit for a big DIRT settlement of 227 million. I will not go into the detail of this matter as Deputy Mitchell dealt with it in detail. However, I echo the sentiments expressed. Given that the bank was on the verge of agreeing a figure last April-May which it knew would give rise to a loss, why did it make provision for dividends in the 1999 accounts of more than 5 million? I question the logic of the board of directors in going down that road. I am not criticising the Minister or the Department of Finance; it relates specifically to the institution we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I query the provision of 1.017 million for bad debts. The figure for the previous year was 1.1 million. Lo and behold, in the accounts for the first six months of last year, the provision was increased to 4.6 million. This puts a question mark over the bank's management of its bad debts provision in previous years. Having conducted the DIRT inquiry, it also carried out an inquiry into the level of bad debts provision. Increasing the figure from 0.9 million for the first six months of the previous year to 4.6 million the following year shows that something was <Col N="820" /> wrong the previous year. Everything did not go bad during the six months under review. I question the attention given to the management of the bad debts of this organisation.</P>
    <P>As a former auditor, I have to ask what the auditors were at when the bad debts provision was a token figure for many years and then, when the spotlight was turned on the bank, the figure was quadrupled. This begs questions about what everyone was at. The auditors note that it was not possible at the time to quantify the effects of the DIRT settlement. In any financial institution, limited company or plc where one knows there will be a massive settlement in a few weeks it is prudent to hold off signing the accounts. This would have been the appropriate thing to do.</P>
    <P>The bank contributes 16.7% of pensionable salaries to the pension fund. This seems generous and I am pleased for employees that it is so generous. I imagine many organisations would be envious of this scale of contributions. The bank operates a derived benefits scheme for employees rather than a defined contribution scheme. I hope that the pension fund will be left fully intact for the benefit of ACC members and will not be absorbed into the pension fund of the new owner. The Minister will have to come back to the House to get approval for the sale of ACC Bank. I hope at that stage there will be some clarification by the potential purchaser of its intention in regard to the ACC pension fund.</P>
    <P>The accounts for 2000 have not yet been published. As a chartered accountant I have a difficulty with this. The audited accounts for 1999 were signed on 16 April last year. The audited accounts for 2000 should be due to be signed within the next fortnight. Draft accounts are available and if there is a proper financial management system they should have been available to us for this debate. The Minister should ask the board to make the draft financial statements available to us before Committee or Report Stages. They would provide current and up to date information and I ask that they be fully available so that we can have a more meaningful discussion and possibly estimate, based on the financial strength of the organisation, what this employee share option scheme will be worth. We must consider the employees also. Our discussion is in a vacuum at the moment in terms of the value of the shares and we could be more specific if we had more up to date information. I look forward to discussing this Bill on Committee Stage. I was a little hard on the ACC. This is a bad year for it. I hope the Minister will not sell until he gets a decent offer and I know he will act in the interest of the taxpayer to get maximum value for the State investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the ACC Bank Bill, 2001 and the ideas contained in it. It prepares the bank for future sale and is welcomed by all. I will comment on the contribution made by Deputy Fleming. I commend him on the work he has done in relation to the accounts. Many of <Col N="821" /> the questions he raised are very worthwhile and the Minister as a shareholder should be in a position to respond to them or present a response document on Committee Stage. He has a responsibility to provide answers to the House.</P>
      <P>All the contributions to date have been overshadowed by the successful sale of the ICC Bank and the TSB Bank. They all point to the fact that the original estimates for the possible sales were handsomely surpassed. That creates the expectation that when ACC is on the market, and it has been unofficially on the market for some time, its estimates too will be surpassed. We do not know what ACC will realise for the State but I hope something good will happen. It is our job to be conscious that this is a State asset, owned by the taxpayers. We should play up the value of it for future sale so that the taxpayer will get the maximum benefit available. We must be quite cautious in what we say but should at the same time be prepared to raise questions.</P>
      <P>The two great assets of the ACC Bank are its staff and its branch structure. In Mullingar, my own area, the ACC Bank is across the road from my office and I know many of the staff well. The bank building is a fine, well situated structure and would be a tremendous asset for anybody. ACC will be seen in the wider spectrum as a branch structure right around the country. It is up and functioning and I hope it will be acquired in that light.</P>
      <P>The original intention of the ACC was to facilitate farmers. When it was set up by the State it was with the far sighted view that the farming community needed support. Farmers needed someone who knew and specialised in their business and who would be able to understand their cash flow difficulties. The bank also recognised the huge need there was for infrastructural development in the farming area. There were a myriad of banks in Ireland at the time and we did not have the major banks like the Bank of Ireland or the AIB. When the ACC was established it was seen as a support for the farming community and it filled a niche in the market and did a tremendous amount of good. Many of the staff have been with the bank from the early days. They were young qualified graduates when they joined. They understood the farming scene and were able to assess what was needed and take decisions. They were in touch with the people and knew their difficulties. They have come through a difficult time and generally did a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some problems in recent times and everybody has referred to the difficulties in relation to DIRT. I have discussed how this could have arisen with some ACC employees. We all feel that being a State bank the ACC would have felt a particular obligation to live within the rules and since the Minister was a stakeholder its obligation would be greater than that of the commercial banks. I understand that what was happening at the time was that people had money to invest and they began to drift away from the ACC. As a result there was pressure on the ordi<Col N="822" /> nary worker whose job it was to see that there were investments. They had to compete with the other banks and they felt they were in danger of losing their jobs if they did not compete for this money. Obviously, decisions were taken at management level that they would prepare the same packages and offer the same facilities as the major banks. The workers, in good faith, did what they did and what they felt should be done to keep the bank afloat.</P>
    <P>There have to be questions at management level and those questions have been there for some time. For a long period also there were major industrial problems between management and the workers. That dampened morale to a great extent within the ACC. They have come through that now and are at the edge of a new beginning. There was disappointment that they managed to be separated from the possibility of a merger with TSB. That opportunity is gone now and they must look to the bright prospects of the future.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty with any merger, and Deputy Fleming alluded to this, is that in many of the larger provincial towns all the major institutions are represented. In Mullingar we have ACC, TSB, the Irish Permanent and all the major players. Any merger will cause major difficulty for staff and it is difficult for many people to realise the difficulty of suddenly losing a job and having to start again. As politicians we may have a better understanding of that than others. It is very difficult for people in a permanent job with homes and families and children settled in schools to contemplate their work place closing down and having to move somewhere else and we should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy McDowell's comments and description of the share option plans as being a bribe to workers. I would not describe them as a bribe. I would perceive a bribe as being an offer to somebody to do something slightly illegal or on the fringes of legality. I do not see the share option plan in that light. It is a reward for work well done in the past, a guarantee of the future and the security of being involved in the running of the company. He raised the rightful difficulties. In any merger people with shares will be working alongside others and that is difficult to countenance. The whole concept of share options for employees is worthwhile. That ACC is maintaining its 14.9% stake is in line with other companies and should be maintained in future sales.</P>
    <P>It is interesting from Deputy McDowell's point of view because in the initial discussions about Telecom I remember some of his colleagues, who are still Members, said that if Telecom Éireann was sold off they would resign from this House and would not be part of the process that would facilitate its selling off.</P>

      <P>I recall it very well and I recall going to meetings with Telecom workers and being asked where my party stood in relation to it and getting the banter and so on that goes with it and losing votes following on from that. It is interesting to note when things moved on and the bribe, as described by Deputy McDowell, was put on the table that it worked. The workers accepted it and new Labour was able to change its mind and say it was all worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the future of ACC and the service it provides are important. When a suitor comes along with a deep purse and is prepared to buy ACC it is important to ensure that the type of service it provides particularly to the farming community will still be available. I do not know how those conditions can be stipulated for a new purchaser. The ACC has carved out an important niche in the market. I realise the farming business is only a small proportion of its total business. Nonetheless it is an important business for the agricultural community. At a time when the agricultural community has its back to the wall it is important to point out to the new purchaser the necessity of serving the agricultural community to the same extent.</P>
      <P>Another interesting point raised was that of State banks. Should we have State banks? In the context of selling off ACC as a State bank, what should be the role of the State? I strongly support the idea that An Post has a huge role to play. An Post which has a network of branches in every parish is grossly under-utilised. We have failed to invest adequately in An Post and we have failed to support the postmasters and the postmistresses in the small rural communities to ensure they have business by bringing them on line electronically, by enhancing the facilities they can offer to the public and by moving into the new era required in dealing with money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently my local bank told me that soon I would not be able to come in to the bank to take money out of my account, that I would have to go to an ATM machine, a hole in the wall. That is the way banking is moving. Banks want to give customers a plastic card so that they can move down the road. The State could have a role here in the State bank. Given what he has said, I think Deputy McDowell would have strong views on the need for a State bank. The State must support An Post in a major way. In regard to social welfare payments, there is a move towards the plastic card rather than the book payment. The plastic card is much more efficient from the point of view of costs. In the event of a complete move to plastic cards, a huge proportion of the population would be ruled out where post offices do not have the facility to use them. The State needs to invest in An Post to ensure that facility is available nationwide. The other ancillary facilities can follow on from the provision of that facility. That bills can be paid in one's local post office would <Col N="824" /> ensure a State connection in every part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Generally, I welcome the provisions of the Bill. I hope ACC will find a purchaser to take it over. I welcome also the employee share option scheme which will give employees a shareholding in any future company that takes over ACC . I welcome the fact that the 14.9% stake is in keeping with what has been happening within State companies to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years the ACC has been an important group so far as farmers are concerned and everything possible should be done to maintain it within the system. Many of us in farming welcomed the idea that the ACC and the TSB were to be linked last year but unfortunately it fell through. I hope this new legislation will provide the structures for any possible future amalgamation. This is more important now than ever given that other banks have amalgamated or have been taken over by outside interests which do not necessarily have the interests of this country at heart. Their main interest is their shareholders. I recall the National Irish Bank which was taken over by the Australian bank, the Ulster Bank has more or less been taken over by the Scottish group and in recent weeks there were rumours that that same group would try to amalgamate with AIB but thankfully that has been scotched. The ACC still has the ordinary grassroots touch in that it will meet and deal with them. Recently I had a case where a young Macra man got a presentation of a cheque drawn on one of the major banks, based in a branch in Dublin. He went to his local bank but it would not cash it unless he lodged it in his account. He went to a branch office of the major bank in Dublin which had issued the cheque but it would not cash it. He was told he would have to go to Dublin to have it cashed. Thankfully he had the ACC Bank around the corner where he also did some business and he was able to have it cashed there without any questions. This is the type of bureaucracy we are up against. It appears that banks do not want the ordinary customer. As Deputy McGrath said, they want to ensure all cash is handled directly through the ATM machine and to do away with personnel on the floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason I wanted to contribute to the debate was not because of the legalities of the Bill but because of the situation in which farmers find themselves. Farmers, the industry and the nation face a serious economic decline because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, prior to which farmers faced problems due to BSE. Hauliers and those in the tourism and other industries are also under pressure. However, ACC Bank's main business is with the farming sector. The Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and others should ensure that banks take a lenient attitude towards the coming repayment dates. ACC Bank's gale day is 1 May. However, many people cannot sell store cattle or calves or trade in the normal way <Col N="825" /> because animals are locked up due to the foot and mouth disease. Others face different problems.</P>
    <P>In the past ACC Bank has been very understanding and helpful but it needs Government support to ensure this continues. Other speakers, as is their right, criticised ACC Bank, however, the bank came through a difficult year last year and is facing a difficult year this year. There is still a need for the bank to go easy if possible and, if necessary, to restructure loans. The Government should play a part in this process if necessary.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill ACC Bank is being given the opportunity to attract a larger shareholder and is being encouraged to give shares to employees. This is an important issue because an amalgamation will almost inevitably result in branch closures. An amalgamation of TSB and ACC Bank would have resulted in the closure of one branch in Monaghan. If such closures take place due to a different amalgamation then workers who have given long service to ACC Bank and the community may find themselves in difficulty. I hope these issues will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope ACC Bank can be linked to a European agri-based bank. The history of, for example, FBD Insurance, which is linked with a European counterpart, has been very good for the insurance industry and has maintained a close link between the agricultural industry and the insurance company concerned. I hope a similar arrangement emerges in the case of ACC Bank and I welcome the opportunity which this Bill provides in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. ACC Bank, which is wholly owned by the Government, traces its history back to 1927 when it was originally established as the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purpose of providing much needed finance for the agricultural sector. The bank has been very effective in this regard.</P>
      <P>Over the subsequent 60 years the bank developed expertise as a specialist agricultural bank and became a major player in that market. Since 1988, ACC Bank has become a more broadly-based commercial bank with an emphasis on the provision of retail financial services. In that short space of time the bank has been transformed into a small bank which offers an important personal touch when dealing with customers. We should not lose sight of this important aspect of the bank's services. Banks are becoming larger and some prefer not to have to deal directly with customers. ATM machines give one the impression that banks prefer not to have queues at counters. The personal touch was the hallmark of the success of ACC Bank. This compatibility with its customers worked very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broadening its business focus the bank has successfully concentrated on its chosen niche markets and there has been substantial investment in staff development and marketing. It is <Col N="826" /> important that the staff's pension fund is protected and guaranteed under new ownership. In recent months there was disquiet concerning the pension fund of another major financial institution. ACC Bank's pension fund has been protected under State investment. However, there was a suggestion that another financial institution attempted to use its pension fund for a different purpose. I am not suggesting this will happen with ACC Bank but it is important that the staff's pension fund is secure in the future. The pensions of those who have given a lifetime of service since 1927 and those who have been with the bank for the past 35 to 40 years must be secure. In recent months questions were raised as to how the pension fund of another major financial institution would be used. It is important that ACC Bank's pension fund is secure.</P>
    <P>Given the economies of scale between ACC Bank and larger banks, it was inevitable that the bank would be sold. ACC Bank was seen as a farmers bank but it is still under State ownership. The farming sector is facing difficulties. ACC Bank occupied a niche market providing loans for leasing heavy farm machinery such as harvesters and other large investments financed by short-term loans over 36 months. Has the Minister directed the bank to be somewhat lenient towards farmers who are heavily exposed at present? This is a banking decision. However, ACC Bank's success has been built on the agricultural sector even though the bank has diversified since 1988. Farming is at a standstill in many areas. Contractors are not prevented from travelling between farms but have been advised not to do so. Farmers are also holding additional stock which cannot be sold. Businesses, including banks, are devoid of sentiment. Farmers are not asking for hand-outs but the Minister and all financial institutions must take on board the crisis in Louth and throughout the State which has led to cash flow problems.</P>
    <P>ACC Bank has been the main bank for farmers since 1927. Significant changes are taking place regarding financial regulation and the arrival of foreign banks. The amalgamation of ACC Bank into a new company will result in branch closures and a reduction in staff.</P>
    <P>Due to DIRT liabilities and its involvement with the new Four Seasons hotel, ACC Bank's bad debt provision rose from £700,000 to £3.5 million in 2000. Given these figures it is understandable that the State wishes to get rid of the bank so it will not incur further liabilities. How much does the State expect to earn from the sale of ACC Bank? Will it take a nominal figure as it stands on the books? The sale of the ICC Bank has been concluded and it was a successful institution, providing funds for small businesses at a time when the main banks in the State would not have advanced money to them. Enterprise should always be encouraged. It is easy for someone to borrow £1 million if he or she has £500,000 on deposit, but people who have nothing should also be encouraged. This country should never lose its <Col N="827" /> enterprise culture. We must ensure that banks do not always take safe bets and that a certain amount of risk capital is available. According to an old adage, the large oak grows from a small acorn. We must look after the acorns, not alone in the business sector but also in agriculture, so that those who have nothing today can be successful in future.</P>
    <P>From my own experience, I know that both the ICC Bank and the ACC Bank were very supportive of initiatives when other banks were not. I applaud them for that. When businesses are taken over by larger consortia, however, they may have a different emphasis. While we hear much about the Celtic tiger and the economic boom, imaginative banking practices are always required. At present, however, there are no bank managers and local bank branches are linked by computer to regional offices or headquarters. Years ago the town bank manager would approve a loan if one's bank balance was adequate, but that structure has now disappeared entirely. Local managers currently have discretion for granting loans of up to £5,000 but if a larger loan is sought the manger must refer the request to a regional manager in the next largest town.</P>
    <P>American financial institutions are obliged by law to invest money in the area where their money is collected. This should also apply to peripheral rural areas in Ireland where banks are reluctant to invest money. Banks should not send all their profits to head office or bigger consortia, or use them for offshore investments. Under American law, if a local bank attracts $100 million in deposits it is obliged to reinvest a proportion of those funds in the area it serves. While financial institutions may seek guaranteed returns in regions of high density, they should be obliged to invest in rural areas where, while the economy of scale is not as large and profitability is not assured, they would get their money back. Unfortunately, however, banks are devoid of sentiment.</P>
    <P>As we can now see, there is practically a cartel comprising four or five large insurance companies which have a monopoly. We are clearly approaching a situation where the banks will have a monopoly. It is all being done though prudent management, including cutting costs and levying additional charges. I know of someone whose small cheque was returned by the bank and the retailer was charged £3.50. A cheque for £15 can be worth £7 to the bank. One must ask questions about this. A half hour appointment with the bank manager can be charged to one's account at the rate of £20. Banks are charging £7 for lodging £1,000 to an account. A retail business can be required to pay up to £20 for £1,000 in coins.</P>
    <P>In the past, banks made money exclusively through interest but that is no longer the major factor. Banks are making money on every possible charge, including coins, cheques and drafts. It does not surprise me that banks are making profits of £1 million per day. I am surprised that they are not making more, given the charges <Col N="828" /> involved. Twenty five years ago we heard about massive profit taking by the banks, but the consumers are paying for all that in hotels, restaurants and other retail outlets. It is all about net profits, and the additional charges on the service sector are astronomical, yet few people are speaking out on the issue.</P>
    <P>Banks are currently vying with each other to make the highest profits, although one does not have to be big to be profitable; a small bank could still be very profitable. Small retailers are trying to provide a service to customers, yet banks are closing down branches in certain towns due to a lack of profitability. Certain banks have discovered that it is neither desirable nor profitable to be located in a given area, so they advise their customers to visit their branch in a larger centre of population. Should financial institutions be obliged by the State to provide a service in rural areas? That is a very important question.</P>
    <P>My business must pay the bank 35p to clear a client's cheque, yet we cannot add that charge to our customers because if we did they would not come back. Therefore, a customer's £15 cheque is worth only £14.65 to the retailer. Another charge that is being forced upon retailers is the 15p on check-out bags, which amounts to another tax on business. While it is a separate issue, such bags already cost £40 per thousand, so the new charge will raise the price to £190 per thousand bags. This will place an extra tax of up to £1,000 per week on small companies. In many cases, due to the competitive nature of business it is very hard to pass on such charges to customers.</P>
    <P>Retailers' profit margins are being constantly eroded by all these additional charges while the banks cannot lose because they are charging, literally, for everything. That is why I feel that the sale of the ACC Bank is so important. Niche marketing has disappeared and banks are now driven by profitability alone. Everything is being done to increase the bottom line, including the imposition of additional charges on consumers who pay the ultimate price.</P>
    <P>The role of the ACC Bank was an important one, but when this sale goes through that niche market will be further eroded. The bank served the agricultural community well but its business diversified due to changing patterns in farming. In future, there will no longer be a farmers' bank dealing solely with the agricultural sector. Such a system was not viable for the ACC Bank which had to adopt alternative measures. Unlike the ICC when it was sold, the ethos of the ACC Bank should involve a certain risk factor. People need such a banking service. It should not be driven by a foreign bank that could be totally obsessed with profitability. We must not end up with four or five banks operating a cartel. One of the main banks has decided to pull out of a very large town due to a lack of profitability. Banks can operate in such a manner because they are involved in so many markets, but it is frightening to see this happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> The most important person in a bank now is the one in the ledger department which, since computerisation, has made massive profits. The banking system has become almost totally automated and some banks have recorded annual turnovers of £1 billion, which begs a question.</P>
    <P>While the changes envisaged in the Bill are welcome, the staff who built up the bank should be protected. To that end, when the new owners acquire the ACC Bank they should make a clear statement on the staff pension fund, which up to now has been secured by the State. The staff have invested heavily in the bank and they would be concerned if that fund was diverted for any other use. The ACC Bank has been one of Ireland's most innovative deposit-taking institutions and it provides a wide range of facilities for small, medium and large investors and for non-residents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new personal savings scheme announced by the Minister because it will encourage people to save money. It is important that when the banks launch products relating to this scheme, they should indicate how those products will operate. The scheme will encourage people to save money, which is a welcome development because there is a high level of spending in the economy. I welcome the fact that the financial institutions will offer a different range of services for this personal savings scheme and that people will obtain up to £50 per month on every £200 saved. This will encourage people to save money for a rainy day. Until now, the rate of interest payable on deposit accounts was unbelievable and people were not encouraged to save money. I hope the new scheme will change that.</P>
    <P>To date, ACC Bank has been an important backer for small companies and members of the farming community. Are there prospective buyers for the bank? I imagine, due to the economy of scale, it will be most likely amalgamated with one of the larger State institutions. In light of the changes that have taken place <i>vis-à-vis </i>the TSB and Ulster Bank, I see no difficulty, from the point of view of the Monopolies Act, with the ACC being taken over. However, in the event of a take-over, problems will arise in areas where there are two branches. In such circumstances, the ACC will certainly lose its strong presence in many towns. Obviously a stipulation cannot be placed on the sale of the bank, but we must ensure that emphasis is placed on it retaining its role in assisting the farming community. Apart from the foot and mouth scare, that community is experiencing difficulties at present and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the agri-food industry, it is vital that a major investment, in the form of risk capital, be made by financial institutions. Most commercial loans are paid back over a period of ten or 12 years. However, it takes a considerably higher level of investment and a longer period to develop a business in the agri-sector. It is important that the financial institutions play a role in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> In the current crisis, contractors are being constrained in terms of the activities they can carry out. I appeal to the Minister for Finance to enter direct consultation with the ACC on this matter, particularly in view of the current climate. The farming sector has been completely shut down, marts are not operating and people are being obliged to retain additional stock. These people should be shown leniency, perhaps by means of writing off or reducing interest payments or placing a stay on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Boylan.</P>

    <P>Acting Chairman (Ms McManus): Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the ACC. I am old enough to recall the importance of the bank to the agricultural community and it retains that position to this day. As in the debate on the ICC Bill, I am obliged to state that there is a particular ethos which obtains in the ACC and this must be retained, in so far as is possible, in any future sale. We must except the economic realities that exist today and in the topsy turvy world of banking, the ACC is not a major player. It is, however, a strategic player and it is on that fact that my contribution will be based.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I was right or wrong but in the early 1990s I was never sure whether the famous so-called third banking option between the ICC, the TSB, ACC and An Post which was then proposed was realistic. At that time, I believed the proposed new institution would offer real competition to the two major banking operations. Irrespective of what we are told, however, I continue to believe that real competition does not exist. I will provide examples to support my argument later.</P>
      <P>We all know what has happened to the ICC and the TSB in the interim and I assume that in the fullness of time the ACC will attract a partner. I do not believe this will happen in the current year, particularly as the bank's balance sheet will be far from good. There are a number of reasons for this, but the one which stands out &ndash; I will mention it only in passing &ndash; is that the bank was obliged to make repayments in respect of DIRT. Like other banks, the ACC did not cover itself in glory in this area. I was never sure of the cause of this. However, I am familiar with a number of branch officials who, it appears, were pressurised into doing something they should not have done. Other Members of the House spent a great deal of time trying to discover whether those officials were acting on foot of a diktat issued by top level management. Suffice to say, however, that the matter to which I refer is behind us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period to which I refer was not good for the bank. Until ten or 15 years ago, the ACC was, for thousands of farming families, the only sym<Col N="831" /> pathetic and understanding institution in banking circles. Since then, everyone has got in on the act. As Deputy McDowell stated, there should be no rush in disposing of the bank. Given the ferociously competitive atmosphere abroad at present, the bank will do better if the sale is delayed somewhat because it will have time to refocus its efforts. In that context, it is obvious from its advertising campaigns that the bank is trying to encourage members of other sectors of the community to place their business with it.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier that I do not believe real competition exists in the banking sector. For many years, members of the banking fraternity have stated that their institution offers a real alternative to its competitors. It is significant that when one of the major banks &ndash; I refer here to AIB and Bank of Ireland and I am in possession of information supporting my argument &ndash; decides to close a branch in a small rural area, it is accommodated by its competitor. For example, if one of them has a long established and successful branch in an area and the other decides to close its operation there, they usually reach a <i>quid pro quo</i> agreement in respect of their branches in another area. This leads me to believe there is no real competition. The banks are aware that there is a certain limit to the business that can be attracted throughout the country. They are in a favoured position, but I accept they run their businesses extremely well.</P>
    <P>I am not sure, but I assume the ACC will be purchased by an outside interest. In that context, the credit unions offer the only real competition to the banks. The credit unions attract customers with whom banks would not previously deal. The ACC was the only organisation with a sympathetic ear for farmers, big or small, particularly in bad times.</P>
    <P>From a State point of view, it is best not to just get rid of the ACC as it has certain strengths as well as weaknesses. It has good staff who are tuned in to the world of agriculture and the future needs of farmers. It has bright young graduates and good branch managers. One hopes that reservoir of advice, knowledge and experience will be available to the thousands of customers who want to deal with ACC whatever link it forges or no matter what group takes the corporation over.</P>
    <P>The ACC is well located in towns and villages. We know that some branches are likely to close but it is important that the organisation remains a nationwide banking service, especially as negotiations are likely with potentials partners for the ACC. Some regions of ACC activity could be wiped out unless this is properly handled and we would be much worse off if that happened.</P>
    <P>I hope the management will refocus. It should be able to attract business from other walks of life &ndash; from small businesses and the industrial sector. This is like a ball that has to be jumped for by all involved. One hopes that the management has the expertise to do what is necessary, and that it has a desire to operate at new levels. <Col N="832" /> The corporation's future depends on how well it performs. If it were to be taken over now, it would have very poor bargaining power. If an organisation does not make money in this environment it is difficult to get potential investors excited about it. ACC has an opportunity to put its house in order and I hope it will do that. I find nothing wrong with the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that the ACC widens its focus over the next two years. However, last year's DIRT revelations had a huge impact on morale in the organisation. The corporation has another opportunity to ensure that it has some clout when the sale takes place. The Minister for Finance wants to see the State get a good return for the sale of any State asset. In view of that, there should be no hurry to sell. ACC management should be given the opportunity to help the corporation to shape up.</P>
    <P>ACC has performed poorly before for other reasons. I have been a customer of ACC, in common with most farmers, and always saw it as fair and reasonable. Its overriding characteristic was that the corporation had managers who understood what farming was about. Given the attention focused on farming due to the foot and mouth crisis, it is clear that the agriculture industry is still very important despite the number of people leaving the land. It is accepted as a core industry and will remain as such. Banking is vital to farming and the ACC can stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone due to the assistance it has given to the industry. However, we must accept that the corporation should widen its focus.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill goes well. I have a grá for the ACC and hope what is being undertaken in this Bill is correct. What the Minister is doing today has to be done. I wish the ACC well and hope that its employees are well looked after, whatever deal is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing time with me. I felt it was important that I make a contribution to this debate. The sale of the ACC will come as a shock to many farming and banking friends of the corporation, particularly in my own county where we had an excellent branch. I want to acknowledge the role of that branch in the development of farming in my county and in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation was established in 1927 and has played a major role in agricultural development nationwide. It was seen as the farmer's credit union. It was a friendly bank where farmers dealt with those who could understand and meet their needs. Many felt that this was an institution that would always be there and it is a shock to find that it is in serious financial trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously some at the top of the corporation got seriously out of their depth and went into businesses they had no knowledge of. The national press has reported on the example of the Four Seasons Hotel deal. That project, backed by <Col N="833" /> ACC, was budgeted for £41 million but is now in liquidation following a £71 million overrun. The company also paid £17.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to DIRT. It is not surprising that there are serious problems with the corporation and that it is anxious for the sale to go through in a hurry.</P>
    <P>This was not brought about by those who supported the ACC. The customers paid their dues, they borrowed from and repaid the corporation and had respect for it. The present situation opens up the entire vista of Irish banking. We needed to know what was going on and what decisions managers were taking. It is clear that eyes were taken off the ball. Ordinary customers had neither a say in, nor knowledge of, what was happening. A customer should have a return from a bank's operations over the previous 12 months. They should have information on the dealings of that bank &ndash; its loans, its borrowings and with whom it is dealing. If it is moving into new or risky areas, customers should know. It is clear that the ACC took serious risks.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that the ACC is for sale, and for sale in a hurry. Questions need to be answered and those who can answer them should appear before this House. The ordinary creditors are entitled to answers and it is sad that these matters should arise. The ACC provided a service in rural towns&mdash;</P>

The framework for the work programme is already set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am sure some Members are familiar with the evaluation report on partnership.

      <P>The work done by the old NCP under Partnership 2000 led to significant progress <Col N="835" /> on partnership in the public service. Since then every Department has established a partnership committee. The NCPP will move on from that, but it will not cross the work of the NESC. The NESC will be still the strategic developer of national policies. It will also carry out all its work programme and different projects, but it will not do that at enterprise partnership level or in the public or private sector. It will continue to do the strategic overview work it has always done. It will not be involved in the dissemination of information or best practices. We hope this report will move it on from its broad operations to the workplace. Mr. Peter Cassells, who knows this area inside out, has strong views on bringing the national scheme not just into loose structures but to an operational level. It will do the type of job the NESC would do. The NESF, the forum in which many Members participate, will continue to overview national policies, whether budgetary or social policies. Where the remits are related, they will not cross.</P>

    <P>Steady progress has been made on the action programme, Reducing Red Tape. As regards accessibility, the Statute Book has been made available in electronic format. As part of their e-public service strategies, Departments and offices will increasingly use web-based technologies to publish regulations, application forms and explanatory information. As regards quality <i>versus </i>quantity, Departments and offices are required under amended Cabinet procedures to use a quality regulation checklist for each new legislative proposal. As regards simplification, the new statute law revision unit in the Attorney <Col N="836" /> General's office is preparing for a comprehensive programme of restatement which it is expected will commence later this year subject to the enactment of the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill. As regards elimination of unnecessary regulation, Departments and offices have been asked to examine their primary and secondary legislation frameworks to identify scope for revision, repeal and consolidation. This will form the basis of a prioritised work programme which is being finalised by the statute law revision unit in the Attorney General's office. A dedicated regulatory reform unit has been set up in my Department to co-ordinate the delivery of the regulatory reform agenda.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the major project in the regulatory reform area has been Ireland's participation in an OECD review of regulatory reform in Ireland. I understand this review is at its final stages and the OECD will formally present the report to me, the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, on 24 April, 2001. The Government sought to have this review conducted in order to identify areas which might be addressed in an Irish context, with a view to empowering the citizen as consumer and removing regulatory barriers to increased competitiveness.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's question regarding progress made by the statute law revision unit, this unit was established in February, 1999. It is staffed by a director and a parliamentary counsel, with appropriate clerical support staff. The unit has been involved in a number of activities including: drafting legislation, notably the Stamp Duties (Consolidation) Act, 2000, the Industrial Design Act, 2000, and the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000. It has been involved in formulating a policy on statute law consolidation and revision.</P>
    <P>The unit recommended the enactment of the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, which when enacted, will enable the Attorney General, in consultation with Departments and offices, to publish administrative consolidations of Acts. Consideration by the unit is at an advanced stage on a policy in respect of the modernisation of the consolidation procedures used by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards the Acts and statutory instruments which could be most usefully revised and consolidated, the unit has worked closely with my Department to identify a prioritised programme for such work. The Acts and statutory instruments selected for consolidation and revision on the basis of objective criteria will have regard to political priorities and the need for greater coherence of the Statute Book. A number of restatement projects are at an advanced stage and will be published soon after the enactment of the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill. The unit is also actively involved in arrangements for updating the Statute Book on CD-ROM and on the web.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of supplementary questions for the Taoiseach. As regards question <Col N="837" /> No. 3, I welcome the proposal to bring forward legislation that will enable the process of consolidation to proceed, presuming that it is simply consolidation, without the necessity of having to come back through these Houses.</P>
      <P>In that context is the Taoiseach satisfied that the unit in question in the Attorney General's office has the resources it requires? If not, will he consider, as a means of providing legal research resources including fees to the various legal departments in our third level institutions, that different sections of consolidation could be contracted out to legal departments of the third level sector? They would come back to the Attorney General to be signed off on that basis, rather than as has been the case in the law departments of the State in the past, that they hold on to the work, the lawyers having a timeframe which is much longer than ours.</P>
      <P>I may have misheard the Taoiseach but I understood him to say that a regulatory reform unit had been established in his Department whereas the third progress report from the PPF refers to a regulatory management unit being established in the Department to deal with the regulatory reform agenda. I am not particularly fussy about what it is called but from the OECD reports published last Monday it seems the Department of the Taoiseach, through this unit, will have responsibility for moving the agenda in respect of abolishing restrictions on the location of pharmacies, removing licensing constraints on entry to the pub and taxi trades, eliminating special interest rules such as the groceries order and enforcing competition in self-regulatory professions. Since the Department of the Taoiseach has taken it upon itself to establish a regulatory management unit or a regulatory reform unit, will the Department be accountable to this House and have specific responsibility for giving updates as to where we are in relation to the removal of these restrictive licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first issue, Deputy Quinn will be pleased to hear that the unit will be staffed by a director at assistant secretary level and a parliamentary counsel at assistant principal level. A parliamentary counsel at principal level will be assigned to the unit within the next few months. The approach that will be adopted has been to research and develop policies and then to identify the means by which statutes can be revised. The aim is to have a nucleus of full-time staff and then to engage external resources, perhaps through the universities, or whatever is appropriate. We will remove all the work except for the core work and there will be only two or three professional staff supported by clerical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it works well and I think it will because it has been given a great deal of thought. We have looked at the range of statutes relating to defence and hope to consolidate them. There are an amount of statutes relating to the sale of goods, unfair dismissals, refugees and extradition. The Acts relating to the prevention of corruption go <Col N="838" /> back a long time. I have also been looking at the older pre-nineteenth century Acts. I hope my information is correct but it seems that many of them are not relevant now. Rather than bringing them to the House and making amendments here, Acts could be consolidated in the unit. The CD-ROM and the statutory instruments could be brought up to date from 1998 and be kept up to date. There is also a major task to be undertaken on the pre-1922 legislation.</P>
    <P>I have seen drafts of the OECD report on the web&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it is still in draft form. The final OECD meeting took place last Friday, so the proceedings on Thursday and Friday are not in that document. Since 1998, my Department has been ensuring compliance with the OECD review of regulatory reform. My Department co-ordinated the work of the entire report and will continue to co-ordinate on the delivery side of it. My Department cannot be responsible for each area because it does not have the staff to enable it to be responsible. Regulation in the areas of public utilities, pharmacies, the drinks industry and many other identified areas will be co-ordinated. It will affect a number of areas of Government, particularly the Tánaiste's Department and the Department of Public Enterprise. The Department of the Taoiseach does not have the specialist staff required for the various areas. Two or three years have been spent in a rigorous assessment of this work and what the OECD call the regulatory impact analysis will follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the purpose of the Department of the Taoiseach setting up a regulatory management unit if all it will do is co-ordinate what is being done in other Departments? The Taoiseach referred to the abolition of the restriction on the location of pharmacies. That was traditionally a function of the Department of Health. Will the Department of the Taoiseach now say to the Department of Health and Children that legislation should be enacted within a certain timeframe to give effect to this OECD recommendation? What will be the politically accountable relationship of the Department of the Taoiseach to this House as against the Department of Health and Children? Will this House be given the run-around? When questions are put down for the Department of Health and Children, we will be told it is a matter for the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of the Taoiseach will say it has nothing to do with its responsibilities. It seems to be an elaborate device to confuse and obscure, which is exactly the opposite to regulatory management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. We are following the best standards of the OECD which believes the effort must be co-ordinated. The specialists are based in the line Department which is answerable <Col N="839" /> for the legislation. Members seeking information, by way of parliamentary questions or other means, or members of the public &ndash; representatives of industry, etc. &ndash; must go to the line Department. There would not be any point in seeking information from a Department in which there are no specialists in this area. The implementation of the report and the political imperative to advance that implementation will come from my Department.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to publish the terms of reference of the group of specialists in his Department and does he intend to list, by way of schedule, those areas for which this new group will have responsibility, to which access is currently limited by regulation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various strands to the regulatory reform agenda and particular emphasis is placed on the work of the OECD. The OECD has worked on three main categories in recent years with my Department. These are regulatory impact and analysis which is a method of systematically and consistently examining selected potential impacts arising from Government action and of communicating information to decision makers; increasing competitiveness which involves the promotion and expansion of competition policy, liberalisation of markets and reducing restrictions on entry where possible in regard to licences for pubs, pharmacies, taxis etc. and the systematic review of regulations to ensure these are user friendly and of a sound legal base. This can involve practices such as consolidation, simplification and sunsetting. The priority here is to make regulations more simple for citizens and businesses.</P>
      <P>The Government requested the OECD to involve itself in these matters and it has spent considerable time dealing with them. The Departments concerned have carried out self-assessments and audit procedures in an effort to comply with the OECD model. When the OECD report is published, it will be used as a guideline by Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already within them. The unit comprises a dedicated group of a few people who work on the SMI process.

      <P>When statute law is revised, is any account taken of the type of language used or will we continue to see convoluted and somewhat <Col N="840" /> archaic English being used? Will any effort be made to simplify the language used in legislative texts in order that it can be followed by the ordinary person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has improved somewhat over the years but I do not think we will see any great changes in legal texts. Those involved in the SMI process to deliver better government have, in their modernisation programmes, sought to simplify the language used in customer service documents, etc. However, legislative texts will remain as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could a request be made to shorten sentences at least to make it easier for people to follow the legislation and understand its provisions? Surely the Taoiseach could request that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We could certainly ask that provisions would be expressed in as simple a legal text as possible. However, legislative provisions are open to challenges in the courts and, therefore, legal people will always ensure they are written in a manner suitable for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was examining some Canadian law recently and it is equally difficult for non-lawyers to understand. The SMI process has now been in train for seven years and literature from Departments and Government agencies setting out their functions and objectives is now being written in simple and understandable language. Legislative texts are a different matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next quarterly plenary meeting to monitor overall implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will take place on 26 <Col N="841" /> April. The agenda for the meeting will deal primarily with social inclusion and equality as well as a review of the implementation programme for the rest of the year. The meeting will, of course, also provide an opportunity for an overall review of issues of key concern to the social partners.</P>
    <P>The plenary meeting will be complemented over the next three months by the ongoing deliberations of a wide range of working groups involving the social partners. These cover the full spectrum of issues addressed by the PPF, including living standards and the workplace environment, infrastructural and sectoral development, social inclusion and equality and sustainable development in response to change.</P>
    <P>Regarding national progress indicators, the PPF contains a request for the National Economic and Social Council to consider the development of a framework to bring into operation such indicators. Work on this project is at an advanced stage and completion of a report is expected by the early summer. The council has agreed upon a framework for measuring sustainable development and is currently finalising the selection of national progress indicators. These indicators will cover the three broad themes of sustainable development &ndash; economic, social and environmental development. They will be linked to the council's vision for Ireland, as outlined in its strategy report of December 1999.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. What is his reaction to the statement from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation which threatens the 2% pay increase due to be paid to more than 500,000 workers from 1 April? In the context of the teachers' dispute, the Taoiseach has stuck doggedly to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on every occasion he has been asked to intervene. Is sauce for the goose also sauce for the gander and will the Taoiseach reject what many view as an attempt to swindle workers out of a negotiated agreement into which they entered in good faith? Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The December agreement provided that employers and trade unions would negotiate a further increase in rates of 2% of the basic pay with effect from 1 April 2001, subject to five or six provisions. Perhaps I should outline those provisions for the record. They include full and ongoing co-operation with change, flexibility and increasing productivity in employment &ndash; this element shall not be pursued through industrial action of any kind, and a national implementation body representing Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU to meet quarterly to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF &ndash; that body continues to meet and a meeting is likely to take place later this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 7 of the pay element of the PPF provides a mechanism to negotiate any difficulties employers may have in meeting the pay terms of the agreement and enables employers to claim an <Col N="842" /> inability to pay. In the context of these stability enhancing measures, particular regard must be had to a number of circumstances in which competitiveness and employment are at risk. These include employments in vulnerable sectors; employments where wage costs within the terms of the PPF have increased significantly; employments which are experiencing economic and commercial difficulties and those which may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and employments in which pay costs have increased significantly above those employed by the terms of the agreement. These are the core terms of the adjusted PPF as they relate to the 2% increase.</P>
    <P>I asked my officials to look into this issue following the statement made on Monday night and I understand the increase will come into effect this weekend in practically all cases, with the exception of a small number of organisations and one or two large ones who are putting forward cases under the terms outlined that they either have difficulties or that they have gone well beyond the increases. They must negotiate those terms with the representatives of their staff. However, the increase will be paid in all other cases. The Labour Court has a role to play where there is a difficulty with interpretation, although I am not aware that this has happened in any case and there are only a few days to go until the increase comes into force. If there are any difficulties, I urge the parties in such circumstances to utilise that facility. To the best of what I can check, other than a few organisations which have been mentioned in public and who will obviously put their cases forward on the terms I mentioned, all others appear to have agreed to pay the increase from 1 April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply did not address one of the central questions I asked him, namely, his reaction to the statement from IBEC. Given the importance the Taoiseach attaches to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is important we recognise the debilitating effect of this statement and how it undermines workers' confidence in such programmes. It is also important we recognise that, if employers renege in this instance, it will undermine the commitment of workers to enter into future agreements and this must be of concern to the Government. Rather than sectioning off those areas where concern remains, the Taoiseach should use his position to urge that all workers benefit from the 2% commitment as of this weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty with that. My understanding is that almost all employers will pay with the exception of a few who will plead their case under the conditions I mentioned, and they are entitled to do that. I hope they can reach agreement at a local level because it would be reasonably clear under the terms laid <Col N="843" /> down whether they had a case. No employer should try to go outside what was agreed as recently as 4 December last. They should pay unless they have a case under the terms of the agreement. If they do, they should follow the process. My understanding is that the largest trade union, SIPTU, has only four cases. Three of those are in negotiation and there is an understanding on the fourth.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure what the statement from IBEC on Monday was about. Perhaps it was just a reminder that conditions were attached to the agreement. If that is what was meant by it, then it was correct. If it was about something else, it was incorrect. The process appears to work well and I urge employers to adhere to it. If not, they should follow its terms and, if there is a dispute, the Labour Court should be involved. I hope that is clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the view that the statement of Monday night was an unfriendly act and unnecessary provocation which did not relate to a specific case and that, at a time when negotiations with the ASTI and the consolidation of social partnership are at a fragile point, the actions by IBEC have been inexplicable, bearing in mind that its members have benefited enormously from reductions in the rate of corporation, capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes and from the substantial and sustained rates of increase in profits over past years? Did the Taoiseach see fit to contact IBEC informally to ask it what it was about because the escape clause is a standard one relating to ability to pay which has been included in all national agreements since their beginning? What was IBEC trying to do? Why did it issue the statement at that time? What does it want? What did the Taoiseach or his Department do in response?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to wind up matters, but the answer is that I do not know why the statement was issued. The terms of the agreement are clear. There has been a significant number of contacts during the week with colleagues at different levels in my Department and I still do not know. I do not want to say any more about it other than that the terms of the agreement are clear. They were clearly negotiated and Deputy Quinn is correct to say that the provisions were used not only in the recent agreement but also in previous agreements. It is as clear a piece of drafting as one can get in industrial relations. Anything else I might say might be unhelpful.</P>

      <P>On Question No. 6 dealing with national indicators, does the Taoiseach not agree it is unacceptable that, while a progress report stated as far back as 21 July last that the council considered a paper on the conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of national progress and sustainable development, nine months later we still have not reached the point of publication <Col N="844" /> and of having some concrete measures which can be used to see how effective is the Celtic tiger in sharing and redistributing the prosperity which clearly has been created in terms of economic wealth but is not enjoyed as social wealth?</P>

      <P>The framework for national progress indicators hopes to achieve a measure of sustainable national progress in its broadest sense. We had a debate before the summer break last year on issues which would complement rather than replace the narrower concepts of GDP and GNP.

      <P>Returning to the 2% issue, do I take it that it will be paid throughout the public service, even to members of unions such as the ASTI which have long since opted out of the PPF before the 2% increase was negotiated? Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the Minister for Education and Science will report to the House, either later today or early tomorrow, on any outcome of the Labour Court discussions?</P>

      <P>On the second question, it appears it might be tomorrow morning before the recommendations of the discussions are put. It appears there will be a meeting of the full executive of the ASTI tomorrow at some stage. Subject to that, it may not be possible for the Minister to make a statement before the Dáil week is over.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his first question. Following the conciliation and arbitration process, the arbitrator stated that, while the ASTI had pulled out of the PPF and made its case regarding a down payment on its issues, as an act of good faith and goodwill, the Government could deal with that by paying the full amount due under the PPF to the ASTI.

      <P>The Deputy is correct because the arbitrator's report was available before 4 December. The 2% was negotiated in December as a result of the inflation rate during the year. It was effectively an amendment to which the employers, Government and unions agreed. In terms of consistency, if one received the other amounts, the Government should pay the 2%. However, I must be sure, so I will check the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the current misunderstandings or differences that have arisen between the social partners about the 2% payment, does the Taoiseach accept the situation has changed since last December in so far as inflation is now home grown? It is no longer possible for the Taoiseach and the Government to blame the falling euro or oil prices for inflation. The current 5.3% rate relates to home grown inflation.</P>
      <P>Given that the payment was agreed on the basis that it was compensation for inflation, does the Taoiseach agree the exemption or opt-out clause now being relied on by IBEC was to be the exception rather than the rule? The employers' organisation is saying now that the opt-out clause may have a general application. If that is the case, will the Taoiseach comment on the apparent misunderstanding and clarify the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The year-on-year inflation rate will not be the figure mentioned by the Deputy. The rate on which the agreement was based in December will be the factual position.</P>
      <P>I do not believe IBEC has made the position clear. I could have understood its statement if it had been issued a month or six weeks ago when it could have been interpreted as the organisation trying to avoid paying the 2% increase. However, the statement was issued on Monday when practically everybody had signed up to it. My only reasoned interpretation of it is that a few large and small companies have difficulties or believe they are covered by the opt-out terms which they are entitled to do. IBEC's statement may have related to the actions of those companies. If that is the case, it is fine. However, if it is not the case, the position is, as I said earlier to Deputy Ó Caoláin, that the 2% must be paid to the sectors which agreed to the statement on 4 December.</P>

      <P>Regarding national progress indicators, as the Oireachtas is not represented on the NESC, which is chaired by a person from the Department of the Taoiseach, will the Taoiseach express to the NESC the desire of the Oireachtas that the indicators should be formulated in such a way that ensures they are clearly under<Col N="846" /> standable and intelligible to ordinary people? The United Nations indicators take as a measure of health and well-being, as distinct from <i>per capita</i> income, the two criteria on an international scale of infant mortality and literacy combined with <i>per capita</i> income. It constructs an index around which the performance of countries can be ranked.</P>
      <P>If the exercise is to have any value, it must have the same degree of clarity and a much larger base of statistical data available to it. If the Taoiseach's earlier reply indicates that there will be a treatise from the NESC, describing national progress indicators, the whole exercise and the reason Deputy Sargent, among others, so strongly advocated it, will have been a waste of time.</P>

      <QRef>[9167/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 91 together.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that there has been no substantive discussion in the European Union on the creation of a new peacekeeping mission to facilitate the resolution of the current crisis affecting the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Therefore, the question of participation by the Defence Forces in such a mission has not arisen.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations Security Council, Ireland supported the draft resolution &ndash; Resolution 1345 &ndash; on the former Yugoslav republic of <Col N="847" /> Macedonia that was adopted on 21 March 2001. This resolution, which was introduced on the initiative of the UK, welcomes the steps taken by the Government of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to build a multi-ethnic society within its borders. The resolution also welcomes the contribution by the European Union monitoring mission and other international organisations to a peaceful solution in southern Serbia and the wider region and supports the Governments of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in their efforts to end the violence in a manner consistent with the rule of law. It underlines the need for all differences to be resolved by dialogue among all legitimate parties.</P>
    <P>Ireland as a member state of the European Union fully supports the call made by the EU last week for a cessation of violence by extremists and the encouragement of the democratically elected Government of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to continue to pursue domestic reforms, particularly the improvement of inter-ethnic relations. At its meeting in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March 2001, the European Council reiterated the European Union's strong and continued commitment to stability and peace in the western Balkans region, which remains a strategic priority for the Union. After meeting President Trajkovski, the European Council adopted a declaration on the situation in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia in which it welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1345, which fully reflects the EU's objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The European Union monitoring mission has made a positive contribution to restoring peace and stability in southern Serbia through substantially increasing the presence of monitors in the region. The EU is also actively reviewing what further assistance it can provide towards the restoration of normal conditions in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify what commitment Ireland has made to an EU rapid reaction force and when it may be effective? Ireland has some observers in Macedonia who are part of a preventative deployment force, but there were reports that they were withdrawn. Will the Minister outline the current position regarding those personnel? Is he satisfied regarding their security? Does he envisage that they will return to Macedonia in the short term? If not, what does he think will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The national support element comprises four personnel from the Irish contingent serving with the international security presence in Kosovo and they are based at Skopje airport, Macedonia. Three members of the Defence Forces serving with the United Nations mission in Kosovo are also based in Skopje. I am satisfied about the safety and security of all 108 members <Col N="848" /> of the Defence Forces serving in the region. There are no Irish troops on the Kosovan-Macedonian border. I hope to visit Kosovo tomorrow to see at first hand what is happening there and to review the position. However, all the indications are that the troops are fine from a safety and security point of view.</P>
      <P>The commitment to the European rapid reaction force will comprise 850 troops committed under the UNSAS agreement to the United Nations. The Deputy asked when this might arise. I cannot answer that at present but it is the intention to have the commitments and capabilities ready to be exercised in 2003. In the meantime, training, inter-operability and other programmes consistent with our military neutrality can be undertaken. It will be at least 2003 before there are any definite conclusions in that area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and wish him well during his visit to Kosovo. Will he agree that as part of this EU rapid reaction force members of the Irish Defence Forces will need to take part in training and other operations? To my knowledge, it is not possible under current legislation for members of the Irish Army to train with foreign armies. Will the Government introduce legislation to deal with this issue? Will the Minister agree there is a great deal of misunderstanding in regard to the difference between the EU rapid reaction force, the Partnership for Peace and the UN and it might be helpful if his Department issued a booklet to set out clearly the situation, particularly in advance of the Nice Treaty? Some people arouse suspicion as a result of lack of clarity. There is an obligation on Ireland to make contributions to the EU and world peace in general. Traditionally we have said it would be good to do something but the time has come when we must do something.</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to his announcement of 25 March 2000 that a Squirrel helicopter would be acquired to facilitate training of pilots for the Garda helicopter wing, he will outline the progress which has been made in this regard; if tenders were sought; if so, when; the number of tenders received; when the promised helicopter will be acquired, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 May 1999 during an operation in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda air support unit helicopter, which is piloted by Air Corps personnel, inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published which included a number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend Garda air support unit night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps Garda air support unit pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing operation, I announced in February 2000 that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the Garda air support unit. Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
      <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through its Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which it could guarantee and support. Discussions took place with the military authorities and the Air Corps and it was decided to attempt to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter. The tender documentation was prepared and on 27 September 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used AS 355N helicopter to the Department of Defence issued to a total of 15 companies. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the tender competition indicated that there were very few AS 355N helicopters available on the open market. Six responses were received, some of which offered different helicopter types which could not be considered. Essentially, the valid tenders from three companies related to the same one only, AS 355N helicopter, which was available in the Philippines. Having considered the responses and the various factors <Col N="850" /> involved, the option to look further into the possible purchase of this particular helicopter was not taken up by the Department.</P>
    <P>All options for the provision of the night flying training of Air Corps pilots for the Garda air support unit are under active consideration in my Department but the prospect of obtaining a second hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given our experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The new Garda air support unit helicopter, the EC 135, is due to be operational in May-June of this year. In that context, and with two helicopters available, the option of using one of the two Garda air support unit helicopters for training purposes, including night flying training, will be discussed between officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am hopeful of a positive outcome to these discussions which would resolve the issue once and for all and would allow for the Garda air support unit helicopters to be available for night flying operations in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. It is disappointing that members of the Air Corps will not be in a position to obtain the basic training necessary because of the non-provision of the helicopter. What is the position in relation to the possible lease of a helicopter, given that inquiries have been exhausted without success? Is there a possibility of leasing this type of helicopter from countries within the EU or America so that the necessary training can be provided given that the Minister stated in his reply that this is under active investigation? Could such training be sought in another country for Air Corps personnel so that the disappointment expressed to me in this regard can be alleviated and Air Corps personnel can get on with its work?</P>

      <P>We all share the disappointment at the set back which Deputy Wall has expressed. Despite the most exhaustive attempts to obtain a new Squirrel helicopter, we were unable to do so in a satisfactory manner. The new Garda air support unit helicopter, the EC 135, is due to be operational in May-June this year. We are now entering negotiations with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to the possible use of what will then be two helicopters for night training purposes. If we can resolve that aspect to our satisfaction, it will eliminate the problems outlined by the Deputy. However, we must first conclude the negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 14 February 2001, the Government on 18 October 2000 approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL for a six month period beginning 30 October 2000 and also authorised the making of preparations for the selection of a further contingent to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in UNIFIL beyond April 2001. On 30 January 2001 the UN Security Council extended the UNIFIL mandate to 31 July 2001. In his six monthly report to the Security Council on 22 January 2001, the UN Secretary-General stated that two of the three parts of the UNIFIL mandate have essentially now been completed, confirmation of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and assisting as far as possible the Lebanese authorities to return to the vacated area. The focus of UNIFIL is now on the remaining part of the mandate, which is the restoration of international peace and security, that is, patrolling, liaison, close contact with the parties with a view to correcting violations and preventing the escalation of incidents. He foresaw that the need for the UN to perform such functions would continue to exist for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He stated that these functions are those of an observer mission. However, in view of the conditions in the region the Secretary-General was reluctant to entrust the task to unarmed observers alone and recommended a reconfiguration based on a combination of armed infantry and unarmed observers. In this regard he suggested two infantry battalions and a group of United National Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, observers. In view of the situation in the region he advised, as a prudent first approach, <Col N="852" /> returning the strength of UNIFIL to that which pertained before it was augmented last year after the Israeli withdrawal which was some 4,500 all ranks. The Security Council tasked him to take the necessary measures to implement this decision by 31 July 2001, taking account of up-coming rotations of battalions in consultation with the Government of Lebanon and the troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council requested the UN Secretary-General to submit a detailed report by 30 April 2001 on UNIFIL reconfiguration plans and on the tasks that could be carried out by observers as part of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO. On foot of this report the Security Council will review the situation in early May 2001 and will consider any steps it deems appropriate regarding UNIFIL and UNTSO. The Security Council is due to consider the UNIFIL mandate in July 2001.</P>
    <P>The review by the Secretary-General in early May 2001 will determine the nature and level of the force to be deployed in south Lebanon for the longer term. In the meantime the Secretary-General has decided, as one of a number of steps, to reduce the Irish contingent by 50 personnel, the reduction to be effected during the next planned rotation in April-May 2001. This would reduce the strength of the Irish battalion to 559. It is proposed that the six months rotation in April 2001 will take place on the basis of the reduction sought by the UN and I propose seeking the approval of the Government for this course of action at an early date. A battalion is in training to this end. I have indicated on a number of occasions, including during my recent visit to Lebanon, my desire that the Irish battalion could withdraw from UNIFIL by the end of this year on the basis that the task of UNIFIL has been largely completed. The question of participation by the Defence Forces in the reconfigured force in Lebanon, in the event of a request from the UN being received, will be a matter for consideration at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under UNSAS. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The matter of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. The function of the standing interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs is, <i>inter alia</i>, to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to <Col N="853" /> increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this area and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with developments in international peacekeeping. The matter of the deployment of units of the Defence Forces overseas is being kept under continual review and account will be taken of the decisions of the UN Security Council in the coming months in relation to the future of UNIFIL when considering future deployments of contingents of the Defence Forces on missions overseas.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is it correct to say that matters are up in the air until we see the report on 13 April? Has the Minister, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, sought to have the <i>status quo</i> remain until next October? On 22 January the Security Council extended the UNIFIL mandate to 31 July next. Does the Minister foresee the Irish troops withdrawing at that stage or will a small contingent remain in place? I read recent newspaper reports on observers being put into Israel. What are the Minister's views on this proposal?</P>

      <P>During my visit to Lebanon last year I indicated that I foresaw the Irish troops concluding their work in south Lebanon this year. I reiterated this when I visited the troops on St. Patrick's Day. We must bear in mind that the two main aspects of the UN mandate for Lebanon have been completed, we have been in south Lebanon for 23 years, the situation there is calm and normal and the reports given to me by the force commander and the Irish officer in charge were extremely positive for the future. Needless to say, we have to await the outcome of the UN Secretary-General's final report on 31 July.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the battalion was trained and ready to go, I was anxious that it would complete its six month tour, which would bring it up to the end of October. Notwithstanding what might happen in the meantime, this will bring to an end the main contribution made by Irish troops over the years. What happens after that is a matter for the United Nations, but it looks like it will be an observer force supported by armed elements. Beyond that, I cannot tell the House anything else until such time as we receive the final deliberations of the UN later this year. I am anxious to complete this tour of duty for the 89th Battalion.</P>

There was a lull period when it was difficult to get volunteers to go out. Is the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="854" /> actively looking at other areas where Irish forces could serve? The rapid reaction force may not come into being until 2003 and there will be a lull during the interim period.

It is an important aspect in terms of the morale of the Defence Forces, training, new experiences and working with contingents from different parts of the world. Irish troops have proven to be fantastic in humanitarian tasks etc. It is unlikely that a proposition similar to south Lebanon will arise in the foreseeable future. I will be actively looking at and pursuing with the Minister for Foreign Affairs opportunities where the talents of the Defence Forces and our resources can be deployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a progressive increase in the amount of expenditure delegated to the Chief of Staff and it is intended that this delegation will continue. The areas of delegated expenditure include allowances, clothing, catering transport, training, communications and IT, barrack expenses and maintenance. In 2000 the total amount delegated to the Chief of Staff was more than £95 million, while the corresponding figure for this year will be approximately £110 million. There are no plans to extend the areas of expenditure delegated to the Chief of Staff.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it was acknowledged during an early stage of the review of the Defence Forces that there was a flaw in the financial management whereby the Secretary General, as accounting officer, is responsible for the spending of the Defence Vote but is not responsible for performance? This anomaly should be corrected so that the Chief of Staff is the accounting officer. Some years ago there was a debate in the House on giving the Chief of Staff the role of chief executive but this was not agreed <Col N="855" /> to. In fairness to the Minister, no Government would agree to the Chief of Staff having this role.</P>
      <P>I do not see any difficulty in the Chief of Staff being the accounting officer. Can the Minister give me a reason he should not assume this role? I want to give the simple analogy of a woman or man who takes care of the home and who is given a budget by the other person. They have no say in the amount of money they receive or how they spend it. The person carrying out the duty should be responsible for spending the money and have control of the purse strings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government approved proposals for greater financial delegation to the military authorities in 1993 it rejected the option of making the Chief of Staff the accounting officer. I have no plans to change this position. I said in my reply that a significant amount of delegation has already taken place. I want to look at the areas which are not included.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Timmins would agree that the military authorities should decide on the issue of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues of pay, pensions etc. are organised from Galway and a significant number of military staff are dedicated to this important area. On capital building projects, defensive equipment and procurement of contracts, there is a civil-military procurement team. We work as a team to get the best possible results and this is the way it will continue. It is not as if there are two sides. We reach agreement on what is necessary for the Air Corps, Naval Service and Army. My job is to find the resources for it and by comparison with my predecessors it looks like I am doing a better job than anyone else has done.</P>

      <P>I do not see any questions on the Order Paper to me or to Deputy Wall so I am sorry I cannot answer the Minister's question. He has certainly put more funding into the Defence Forces but we live in a better climate than heretofore. There are certain areas over which the military would like to have more control and I ask him to revisit those issues and see if he can extend their role. I realise that he cannot extend their role on pay but as an innovative Minister he could put his stamp on other issues.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of drug-related operations in which the Naval Service was directly involved in 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9081/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. The newest patrol vessel, the L.E. <i>Róisín</i>, was commissioned on 15 December, 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft. Fishery protection activity accounts for more than 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as search and rescue, aid to the civil power, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
      <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to drug interdiction operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the importation of illegal drugs are concerned and during 2000 the Naval Service was directly involved in 16 drug related operations under the auspices of the joint task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Irish coast is a major trans-shipment area for <Col N="857" /> the importation of drugs? Unfortunately this is a trend that will grow. In 1999 the Naval Service was involved in 11 drug related operations and the Minister stated in his reply that they were involved in 16 last year. That is a 50% increase. Will the Minister confirm that the Naval Service has the power to intercede while on routine patrol if it comes across something suspicious? Does it carry out any training exercises with the customs drugs unit? Training is an important and essential part of this because a great number of drug gangs are highly organised and difficult to intercept. Does the Minister feel the Naval Service could play a greater role in trying to prevent drugs landing on our shores? This is equally if not more important than fishery protection. Fishery protection takes up 90% of the Naval Service's time and a small percentage of time is taken up in trying to intercept drugs. I realise that is not its primary role but would the Minister not see it as complementing the fishery protection role? We should look at the involvement of the Naval Service in this type of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and the commencement order introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Naval Service has the powers to search, where it suspects the transport of drugs into this country, without the assistance of the Garda. By and large it works with the Garda and the customs officers under the task force arrangements and find that successful. There is limited training necessary for that but Navy personnel are very qualified to board and search ships. However, as has been shown in fishery protection, the ability of some fishing outfits to hide what they are doing is significantly greater in the context of illegal drug importation so it can be a difficult task.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that our open coastline can be exploited but there have been some extraordinary successes along the coast and the work of the Garda, the customs service and the Naval Service has in recent years put a dint in illegal drug operations. There may be more we can do and we try to be alive to these dangerous importations and to the possibility that Ireland may be used as a base for distribution to other parts of the world. We try to keep a constant eye on this area. While 90% of Navy business is in fishery protection this is also an important area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>On 22 February I visited the headquarters of the Irish Red Cross Society and I was pleased to meet the executive committee, staff members and the central council. I expressed my appreciation and that of the Government for the work of the members over many years and for their ongoing humanitarian activities. I also confirmed the confidence the Government has in the Irish Red Cross Society in dealing with tragedies and emergencies, which was clearly demonstrated with the recent flood relief scheme, when the society distributed humanitarian aid at home to the flood victims with kindness and sensitivity, while ensuring the whole process ran smoothly and speedily to its conclusion. I also thanked the Irish Red Cross Society for its recent contribution in relation to the disasters in El Salvador and India and also for the tireless work undertaken to get essential aid to those suffering from the effects of war and natural disasters in Ethiopia and Mozambique.</P>
      <P>I welcome the completion of the strategic review of the society which was recently ratified by the central council and I look forward to receiving a copy in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. There were problems in relation to industrial relations within the Irish Red Cross Society. Is the Minister satisfied they have now been overcome and is there an actual date as to when the new strategic plan will be launched? Also, was there any discussion on how the grant aid of £500,000 given by the Government was to be spent or was that within the remit of the society? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the second question first. The grant is £609,000. The Red Cross is a totally autonomous society. That money mainly goes towards the employment of its staff and towards the contribution made to the International Red Cross in Geneva. There have been some problems in regard to industrial relations. The strategic review covers an overall plan for the future and deals with industrial relations. I availed of the opportunity on the occasion of my visit to the Red Cross to meet everyone possible from the staff, the central council to the volunteers. There is a clear determination to leave that chapter behind and to move forward. I wish to respond to the changes recommended in the strategic plan in any way I can on the financial side and to their determination to improve and gain <Col N="859" /> an even better foothold in the humanitarian tasks they have performed at home and, particularly, in war-torn areas of different parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the facilities available to the society? My understanding at the time of the industrial relations problem was that the conditions and facilities available to staff at headquarters could be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No complaints have been made to me. I visited most of the offices, spoke to the staff available at the time and looked at some of the systems in place. If there are ongoing needs in these areas we will look at them together in a progressive and open manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people questioned the wisdom of appointing the Red Cross to administer the flood relief. Since the job has been carried out we have not heard one complaint. It deserves to be complimented on having done an excellent job. If such an unfortunate incident recurs it would be well placed to carry out the same function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I complimented them myself and I thank Deputies Timmins and Wall for similar observations.

We would hope it would not be called upon too often to meet those obligations at national level.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Timmins is referring to recent articles in the media which refer to violations of the military airspace over Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, County Dublin, by private light aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background I should say that general air traffic can enter military restricted areas when active, by prior permission and may be subject to certain restrictions. In the case of scheduled flights, this entry is achieved by civil air traffic control making an airspace reservation to cover the period of time the aircraft will be passing through a military area. Light aircraft call on the military air traffic control frequency when they require to transit the restricted military area and generally would be facilitated with a passage through the area. However, military air traffic control can refuse clearance to these aircraft and insist they route around the restricted area. On occasions, light civil aircraft infringe military restricted areas while they are active without clearance and without making radio contact. Mili<Col N="860" /> tary air traffic control prepare an infringement report on these events which are then forwarded to the Irish Aviation Authority for investigation.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the military authorities that a number of infringements of military airspace by private light aircraft have taken place in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome recently. This is a source of concern both to myself and the military authorities. Consequently, the Air Corps chief air traffic control officer has written to the Irish Aviation Authority on the matter, and recommended that these concerns about air flight safety be included in the current ongoing discussions between the Air Corps and the Irish Aviation Authority on airspace and related matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter. Can the Minister tell the House the number of instances in which people entered the airspace without permission? Will he indicate if persons who were refused permission still proceeded to enter the airspace? Are these people coming from the one airfield? I was surprised to discover recently that prior to the recent planning Act a person could set up a private airfield without permission. What steps has the Irish Aviation Authority taken to remove the licence from such people? If one is caught for drink driving on the road, one's licence is removed. That people may be going around in light aircraft and landing in airspace without permission is a serious matter and they should be dealt with harshly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in place an Air Corp flights safety officer who deals comprehensively with this and other areas. I do not know the number of infringements but there were at least three. I undertake to have the matter further checked. The infringements are reported to the Irish Aviation Authority which has full powers to take the appropriate action. Like the Deputy, I view any of these transgressions extremely seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Timmins I am deeply concerned about this matter. One accident would be one too many. Given the seriousness of the situation, will the Minister undertake to follow it up to the extent of advertising in the media or ensuring that warning signs are erected at the various private air strips? Certainly the number of incidents has increased. Two or three warning signs have been put in place in close proximity to Baldonnel and Kildare. This matter will have to be dealt with quickly. I ask that every effort be made through the media and that the relevant warning signs be erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The flights safety officer takes his responsibilities seriously by reporting the infringements to the Irish Aviation Authority.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 66, 77 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service is currently operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV executive jet, acquired in 1991, as the principal aircraft backed up by the Beechcraft King Air turboprop aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Beechcraft provides only a limited MATS operation and it is also used for pilot training. Effectively it operates nationally, to the UK and, to a minor extent, to Europe. The issue of the replacement of the G IV jet is under active consideration at present. The consideration is in the context of the increased level of business for Government Ministers and officials to Europe and further afield.</P>
      <P>The business of the European Union itself has grown by an unprecedented degree over the past decade both in the size of its market and in the depth and range of its activities. These changes have increased significantly the travel requirements of Government Ministers and officials.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing requirement for the Government to maintain a very active involvement both bilaterally and through the EU and multilateral bodies like the United Nations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas so as to build Ireland's political and economic relations with countries from these regions. This requirement also involves substantial air travel by Government Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ministerial air transport service has been a major asset for successive Governments. The service has proved to be extremely flexible to meet the changing timetables of Government Ministers. In this regard I acknowledge the major role played <Col N="862" /> by the Air Corps in operating the service so effectively over the years.</P>
    <P>It is important that any action required to maintain the high standards set for the operation of the ministerial air transport service is taken. In that regard, all options which could improve the service available to the Government are being examined. No decisions have been made as yet but I expect to be in a position to bring a memorandum to Government within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>Any decision on facilities for ministerial air transport would not come from my immediate budget. However, no decisions have been taken on the acquisition of further aircraft. All options are being examined.</P>
      <P>The final payment of about £14 million on the G4 is due this year. This will bring the total cost of the G4 up to about £29 million. The project would have cost £16 million for cash in 1991. If one invested £16 million in Government bonds in 1991, it would return about £39 million today.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Air Corps is disappointed that part of the ser<Col N="863" /> vice has been privatised? Does he further accept it is disappointing for the Air Corps that he is actively considering purchasing a new Government jet while he has allowed part of the Air Corps' work to be privatised? This has a real effect on morale, is disappointing and will have implications for Air Corps training and recruitment. Does the Minister accept that the Air Corps is disappointed he has not allowed it to continue to carry out this work, particularly in view of the fact that Members know of the dedication and sacrifices its personnel have made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not allowed any part of the work carried out by the Air Corps to be privatised. I inherited a situation in which there was a need for new aircraft for the Air Corps. I provided the kind of funds which no previous Government has ever attempted to provide. Tenders for the helicopters will be submitted on 19 April. This is a positive, progressive advance on anything which happened in the past. I am preparing for the acquisition of other aircraft.</P>
      <P>As regards the G4, considerable opportunities for training and advancement for pilots are involved in the military air transport service. It would be wrong to suggest that the Air Corps is not involved in the training and operation of military air transport. The Air Corps carries out these roles very well.</P>
      <P>No decision has been taken on the acquisition of new aircraft for ministerial transport. However, decisions have been taken, and finance has been provided, for the areas in which the Deputy and I are interested.</P>

      <P>Is it the case that parts of the Government jet had to be sent to the manufacturers for overhaul because Air Corps maintenance staff could not carry out the repairs? If these press reports are correct, why did parts have to be sent to the manufacturers for refurbishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Air Corps technical orders and manufacturers' manuals are very prescriptive in terms of the repair, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft. The Deputy will understand the seriousness of the matter. There are occasions on which aircraft are returned to manufacturers for considerable periods for overhaul. I support this process as the manufacturers have the necessary resources to carry out the work. However, the Air Corps has the resources to carry out normal maintenance work. Manufacturers are involved only when necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces it needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That is the overall objective of the White Paper and I can assure the House that implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively.</P>
      <P>The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help achieve the following broad goals: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by the end of 2001 in accordance with the Government decision. It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by Price Waterhouse consultants and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me. I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place following the completion of consultations with the representative associations which are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including the putting in place of the new organisation provided for in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. I <Col N="865" /> am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the future development of the reserve can be built. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. To facilitate this objective, I published the report of the steering group last year and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the new structural and organisational changes for the reserve will require about six years to bring to completion. I was particularly pleased last year to announce an unprecedented additional £254 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sales of property surplus to requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's contribution as regards the £55 million which has been spent on the Curragh.</P>
      <P>The concept behind tabling this question concerns the educational opportunities that are now available to members of the Defence Forces. In that regard, I will ask the Minister a question that may not be relevant&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but he might answer, perhaps by letter at a later date. Tremendous work is being done in developing segments of different barracks at the Curragh. I do not know, however, whether the national school and vocational school there come within the remit of the Department of Defence. If so, will the Minister attend to their refurbishment immediately? If it is a matter for the Department of Education and Science, obviously I will follow it up there. Is the Minister satisfied that his Department and the Department of Education and Science are liaising to ensure that applicants seeking positions within the Defence Forces are aware of all the career opportunities that are available? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's first question, I am extremely anxious to make a massive change in what I inherited at the Curragh, and that is happening. The educational facilities within the Curragh complex must be part of that major change. I will undertake to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, what arrangements can be put in place. There is a massive capital programme for education but I will see to what extent I can assist in ensuring that some of that investment can be steered towards meeting the needs in the Curragh.</P>

      <P>The career paths, promotional opportunities and educational advancement of its members must be continually upgraded and fostered with the developing Defence Forces so that future career opportunities are such as to encourage the maximum number of talented young people to come into the Defence Forces in the first instance. In that context I am looking forward to the implementation plan and the personnel proposals which the Chief of Staff will provide to see in what way we can further advance what we are already doing. It is widely recognised that educational opportunities at third level for Army personnel are quite good. We will see what happens when the personnel plan is produced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps flight safety office has been in operation for some months past and will be an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure upon its formal implementation. I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place once consultations with the representative associations, which are at an advanced stage, are completed. A full-time flight safety officer of lieutenant-colonel rank and an officer of captain rank have been appointed by the GOC Air Corps in the interim. The flight safety officer reports directly to the GOC Air Corps. A programme of specialist training and courses to equip the flight safety officer for his post has been under way since the end of 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, following the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by the Department of Defence in relation to the implementation of the recommendations. In this regard I put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The fifth meeting of the working group charged with overseeing the process was held last Thursday, 22 March, in the Department of Defence involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well a representative from <Col N="867" /> the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed and a composite progress report is currently being prepared in the Department and will be presented to me shortly. In this regard, I am pleased to say that considerable progress is still being reported by all bodies involved in the implementation of the recommendations. This group will continue to meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations relates to the commissioning of an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps. I am pleased to report that Intercontinental Aviation Safety Consultants was awarded the contract for this audit on 21 February 2001 and that the audit commenced last Wednesday, 21 March 2001. The auditors hope to conclude their work by the end of this week and I expect that their report will be available within a number of weeks. All support necessary is being provided by my Department and the Defence Forces to assist Intercontinental Aviation Safety Consultants to carry out their task.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was making the point that it would be both unfair and unacceptable if management and staff in provincial branches of the ACC Bank were made scapegoats in this exercise. I can only speak of my own knowledge of the management and staff of the bank in Cavan town who have provided an excellent service over the years. The branch has operated there practically since the bank was founded in 1927. I understand the difficulties and trauma that the current manager and his staff are facing. The bank's staff have always given their clients good advice which was taken. They are in no way responsible for the terribly bad business decisions that were taken at a higher level and which are causing this rushed sale. Anything that is rushed is never done correctly. It seems, however, that time is not on our side. People obviously did not read the warning signs which were ignored or other people decided to leave before the situation got too hot for them to stay on and face up to the decisions they had made which led the bank into the current mess. I do not deny that the ACC Bank is a small player in the Irish banking business and that it needed a partner. The process of finding a suitable partner with which to merge and grow, however, should have been done over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need this banking facility. As you are aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, services in rural areas are being closed down at a time when the economy is growing. If the economy is to grow further we should continue the existing services and improve them. Banking is an important <Col N="869" /> service, yet we see closures all over the country, not only of bank branches but also of post offices. How are people in rural areas expected to obtain such services? Is it felt that such services are only viable in larger, developing areas, both rural and urban? Does it no longer pay to have a manager and staff in a small provincial town? If we are going down that road we will be making a serious mistake. The banking system, including the ACC Bank, has much to offer. The bank's background was in agriculture and its staff understood the farming scene as well as small retail businesses. Earlier in the debate I heard Deputy Perry speaking about the rip-off that is taking place because of a lack of competition. At the inquiries in Dublin Castle we heard about a system that was put in place known as &ldquo;creaming&rdquo; customers' accounts. Pressure was put on bank managers to bring in profits at all costs. Making a profit was the bottom line and people were obliged to pay for every transaction. I am informed it now costs £20 to make an appointment to meet one's bank manager. I am not sure whether one then pays by the minute or the half hour while one is talking to him or her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the same position as bank managers in that we also provide advice. The difficulty is that people often do not listen to us. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the officials from the Department are listening to what I am saying.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should seek to increase our knowledge of the science of banking. We must address the difficulties and shortfalls which obtain in the ACC. As already stated, we should not be attempting to cut back on banking or post office services in rural areas. We should, instead, set about upgrading and improving those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone should be aware of what is happening in the banking sector. Apparently people were shocked by the fact that money was being creamed off their accounts. These people were not overly diligent, they had the utmost respect for banks and bank managers and would not ask questions. Lo and behold, however, this system of creaming off was put in place without their knowledge and with the sanction of higher authority. I am not pointing the finger at ordinary bank managers or staff in this regard because the order to put this system in place came from top <Col N="870" /> level management. It is not acceptable that people in high places made bad business decisions and ordinary customers &ndash; be they creditors of or shareholders in the bank &ndash; were obliged to pay for them.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments will be taken on board. Whatever happens to ACC Bank, I hope it will emerge from this debacle in a restructured form and that it will continue to provide the service it has provided since its foundation in 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed by the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, because he did not deal, in any serious way, with the problems the ACC faces. He referred briefly to the bank's apology for the position in which it found itself in regard to deposit interest retention tax and stated that &ldquo;ACC has not yet reported its figures for the year ending 31 December 2000 but a loss for the year is anticipated.&rdquo;  He proceeded to say the legislation should continue to allow the taxpayer to guarantee the borrowings of the ACC to the tune of up to £500 million. It is not acceptable that the Minister of State made such casual remarks about losses being anticipated, the impending sale and the fact that the State will guarantee loans to the tune of £500 million without explaining the position, indicating how we got into that position, and outlining how the Department of Finance failed in its supervision of the ACC. The Department of Finance is the sole shareholder in the ACC and it has a responsibility to take action when a bank in which it is a shareholder systematically evades tax.</P>
      <P>There was clearly a failure of supervision on the part of the Department, particularly when one realises that tax legislation it brought before the Dáil was contravened by the ACC. The Minister for Finance is represented on the board of the ACC. Why was his representative on the board not aware of what was happening in the bank? To use a colloquial phrase, it might be stated that, as far as the DIRT scam was concerned, &ldquo;They were all at it&rdquo;. However, I understand that, on a proportional basis and given the size of its deposit portfolio, the ACC was involved in considerably more abuse of the DIRT system than other institutions. That was not explained by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also failed to explain the business strategy of the Department of Finance and the Agricultural Credit Corporation in regard to the sale of shares. It is requested in the last section of the Bill that the Minister for Finance be given discretion to, so to speak, activate the various powers, including the authority to sell shares, being conferred on him. Given that the Minister of State was not prepared to indicate when the Minister intends to exercise the powers he is asking the House to confer on him, one would expect that he would clearly outline the criteria that will be used in making the decision regarding when the power to sell shares will be activated. However, the information he provided in that regard is vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The House has been given no guidance as to the strategy of the Department of Finance or the Government in regard to the sale of a bank whose business will be guaranteed by the taxpayer to the tune of £500 million. That is not an acceptable way in which to treat the House. The lack of courtesy and frankness in the Minister of State's initial speech is compounded by the fact that he is not present to listen to my contribution. I do not believe there is any excuse for this or for the fact that the Government proposed &ndash; I assume the Opposition agreed &ndash; to order the taking of Second Stage today when everyone was aware that the Minister for Finance would be in the Upper House to take Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. To order the taking of an important item of Finance legislation, the ACC Bill, in the Dáil on the same day the Minister responsible could not be present, was poor parliamentary business.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the ACC must be sold are not propitious. For example, interest rates are set to rise in real terms. The spring bulletin of the Central Bank makes it clear that we can anticipate a rise in real interest rates because European Central Bank rates are not going to fall any further while real inflation is going to fall. This will mean borrowings will be considerably more difficult to service than heretofore. There was a substantial decline in car sales during the first month of the year, which is a sign of flagging consumer confidence. In addition, there has been a sharp decline in the housing market. In the second half of last year, there was a 16% decline in the number of houses registered under the home bond scheme. This indicates a slowdown in house building. To the extent that the ACC's business and that of other banks lies in the property market, and disproportionately so, a decline in the buoyancy of that market will affect the value of their loan books. This will not only affect the ACC, but also the ability of those who might be considering purchasing the bank to finance the purchase at a reasonable price. In addition to a decline in the increase in the value of housing stocks, agricultural stocks are also likely to fall in value as a result of foot and mouth and BSE.</P>
    <P>Banks are increasingly moving into areas that are fundamentally unproductive. In the past year, the rate of increase in property lending was approximately twice that of the rate of increase in lending to manufacturing. It is manufacturing which generates the profits that allow people to purchase property. If there is no increase in manufacturing investment, there will be no income to service property investments. There is an increasing imbalance in the economy in that regard, which is a reflection of the fundamental imbalance in the United States' economy. The level of indebtedness of the Americans, who for the past ten years have been borrowing money from the rest of the world, is unsustainable. They are now in a situation where they have borrowed up to their limit and beyond. When they see the <Col N="872" /> value of their houses fall &ndash; they have already seen the value of their stock market holdings fall &ndash; many will find themselves in a position of negative net worth. That will mean a drop in consumption and will lead to a recession in the United States. That situation can be postponed by the Federal Reserve bank reducing interest rates but it cannot be put off indefinitely. The longer the necessary adjustment in the American economy is postponed, the more severe the recession is likely to be.</P>
    <P>Selling the ACC into that sort of marketplace is not to sell from a good position. Serious questions must be asked of the Minister for Finance, of the Department of Finance and of previous Ministers for Finance as to why the Government failed to sell the ACC earlier. The ACC could have been sold at a much better price at an earlier time. Why did that not happen? Was the eye taken off the ball?</P>
    <P>There are a number of difficulties that the ACC faces in moving forward as an independent institution, if it was to attempt to do so. There is a huge investment in technology required from any bank to provide an integration of branch network services, Internet services and ATM services. Customers want all those services available whenever it suits them and at no cost. A small bank has to invest just as much as a big bank to provide this. The technology is not cheaper the smaller the organisation. It is the same cost no matter what the size of the organisation.</P>
    <P>A small bank like the ACC is at a structural disadvantage in making the technological investment required. The ACC is in the difficult situation that it does not have a particularly good branch network. Its branches are not in premium locations. They are in non-premium locations. It does not have the option of getting into the intermediate market where it could, for example, use auctioneers and other professionals to sell its products. Most good auctioneers and other professionals already have links with financial institutions, be it the EBS, First Active, Bank of Scotland or others. The companies left for ACC to snap up, if it wishes to move in that direction, are not great.</P>
    <P>The original remit given to the ACC was a valid and necessary one. In recent years however, it took its eye off the ball and did not move when it should have moved. Against that background, one has to ask very serious questions about the investment by the ACC in the Four Seasons Hotel. The ACC's former chairman, Mr. Dan McGing, who is a man I know and like, was involved as both chairman of the ACC and a director of the company that was developing the hotel. That strikes me as a conflict of interest. As chairman of the bank he could not be as objective as he ought in determining the arrangements for lending money to the hotel company of which he was already a board member&mdash;</P>

        <i> The Irish Times</i> mentioned this man by name in its Thursday, 17 August, 2000 edition. I am quoting from that source. There is no problem with that. It is impossible to discuss this matter without mentioning this person by name. However, I will not mention him further.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should explain to the House what protocol exists as far as this matter is concerned. The House should also be informed what the banking arrangements were between ACC Bank and the Four Seasons Hotel. My understanding is that these were quite unorthodox arrangements.</P>
      <P>There is a need to probe in more detail the reasons for some of the provisions in the Bill. Why is it necessary in section 6 that the State guarantee the bank's loans to the tune of £489 million? Will those guarantees remain in place after the bank is sold? Will the State continue to guarantee loans to a bank that it no longer has a shareholding in? These matters are not clarified in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I question a number of investments made by ACC. In the 1997 annual report we are told that ACC owned a subsidiary called ACC Bank Isle of Man Ltd. What purpose does a State owned bank, supervised by the Department of Finance which is responsible for tax collection, serve by having a wholly owned subsidiary in the Isle of Man for the purpose of operating secret offshore accounts? Why did the ACC buy and set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the Isle of Man? Why did it sell that subsidiary?</P>
      <P>Why did the ACC invest so heavily in property? The ACC has three subsidiary property companies. It owns Harcourt Street Investments, ACC Investments, and Fortfield Services Limited &ndash; all property companies. Why did the bank get involved in setting up property companies? It is a well known piece of business advice that one should stick to what one knows best. ACC does not know the property business. Its staff know the banking business well but why get into property? Why did it move outside its appropriate area of expertise? I note that those property companies are still in operation as subsidiaries of the ACC. Are those companies in a sound financial position?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the extremely thin speech presented to the House by Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, on this Bill. He confined himself to telling us what is in the Bill, which was quite unnecessary as the explanatory memorandum tells us that. He failed to explain why the Bill is necessary, why the State is proposing to sell its shares, how it proposes to go about selling those shares and what the consequences of the sale will be for the State. These issues ought to have been dealt with in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is not here. One of the purposes of a debate is that there should be some exchange in the House. I am not long a backbencher and have not been one for quite a while. I am disappointed <Col N="874" /> with my first debate as a backbencher for some time. I notice that Members come to the House, deliver their speech, then walk out. Nobody listens to anyone else. There is no interchange. All contributions are for the local media. There is no sense that Members are speaking to one another, they are speaking only for the record. Other Members might as well not be in the House as far as discussion is concerned. There was no interruption, no questioning from Members, though that is permissible in Standing Orders. To me, that is an indication that nobody is listening to other Members.</P>
    <P>It is a case of Hamlet without the prince because the prince, the Minister for Finance, is in the Seanad. The princeling, the Minister of State, is somewhere else and we have the Minister of State with responsibility for science instead.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the debate and a lack of any real interaction, and I blame that on this obnoxious system of lists of speakers. People are put on a list. There is no advantage in coming in here to listen to other people because if someone is No. 6 on the list and they come in to listen to speaker No. 1, they will not be called next. The other person who floats into the Chamber not having been present is called before that person so there is no advantage in sitting here to listen to anybody else, and people do not do that. The result is that the debate is not a debate.</P>
      <P>I have digressed sufficiently because this is not relevant to the Bill. I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's patience but this is an important point and it is a pity we have not had a debate about an important Bill. I hope that the proposals my party put forward in the democratic revolution document we published a while ago, which would abolish speakers' lists and require 20 Members to be present in the House all the time, would ensure that we would have a real debate about this type of question rather than the perfunctory series of addresses we are now hearing. In any event, I want to express my thanks to Deputies Ring and D'Arcy, and the Minister, for listening to me.</P>

      <P>That is a problem and we will discuss that matter another day. If one goes to a public meeting there are representatives from Leader groups, Western Development, Meitheal Mayo and various other people at the top table but the TD is at the back of the hall. The only time they refer to the TD is when they want somebody to blame, but the TDs have fewer powers than the people at the top table. They are the gods and the lords but we are the people who take the rap for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted I have another convert to my campaign to bring the power back into this House because the people elect us to represent them in this House. We write to county managers and county secretaries but they do not reply. The health boards should answer the Dáil questions. They should not be referred to the chief executive <Col N="876" /> officer, the 40 or so officials or the press people to put a spin on it. The questions should be answered here.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the proposal to sell the ACC Bank. I compliment Deputy Bruton who has done a great deal of research in this area. He asked very telling questions and I hope whichever Minister responds, with the help of the officials, will answer the serious questions that have been asked. One only has to look at the case of the Four Seasons Hotel, the risk involved and the way those people were treated, or the small individual in County Mayo who may have borrowed £19,000 or £20,000 from the ICC Bank and who may have been brought before the courts and prosecuted. That person may not have £20,000 but he or she may have made every effort in the ten or 15 years to repay it. They may have got into difficulty because the farming scene had changed or because they had not kept up with the times, and they may have had their land taken off them. The Four Seasons Hotel will continue because some other investor will be found. The debt will probably be written off and, as Deputy Bruton said, I hope we will see the arrangements and conditions that were put in place in respect of that loan when it was given to that company. Something smells in that case and it is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We should know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We should know exactly what happened and we should also know, as Deputy Bruton said, about the liabilities and other arrangements that may have been in place in terms of other people in the State. What will be the cost to the taxpayer when this deal is put in place? If the bank is sold we could not have picked a worse time. I was castigated from the opposite side of the House when I made the point last December about inflation running at 10% or 12%, the first person to do so. I was told that was not the case. I listen to men and women who shop in supermarkets and I knew inflation was rising. The cost of living is increasing daily and we can now see the result of that. We can also see what is happening on the American scene.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of what is happening now. Last December, somebody in my constituency was looking for a job and I made representations to an American-German company. That company, Henniges in Ballina, gave me a guarantee that the person would start work in January of this year. The company announced in January that it will let go 175 people. I got a letter a few weeks ago from the company to the effect that it had intended to take on my constituent but it was not taking on any further people this year, so there is a downturn in the economy here and in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the problem of housing and cars. We will see many defaulters over the coming months because the banks gave a lot of money to people to whom they should not have given money. Those people were unable to pay <Col N="877" /> back those loans when this crisis occurred. They had over-reached themselves and we will see many cars repossessed and the banks will have many more difficulties in that regard. There is a downturn in housing also. The Bacon report did its work last year in relation to the investors, although the Minister made a change to that area in the budget. I was against that because I believed he was correct last year and he should have held on for another year and given young people an opportunity to get into the housing market again.</P>
    <P>The banks have pulled out of many small rural areas in my own county. They will not even install ATMs in places like Louisburgh. The banks removed their services from Foxford, Achill and other areas. It is a disgrace that the Government is unable to control the banks which are making outrageous amounts of money yet they cannot provide some services to rural people. Those services could be provided out of the profits made in the major cities but in any event it is wrong that the banks should take away a vital service from a small rural area. We now have the Government telling people not to hold money in their homes but they expect people to travel 30 or 40 miles to get to the nearest bank. That is wrong. The Government should be able to introduce legislation in the House to stop the banks from taking everything and giving nothing back to the people. They have an obligation to the people and they have made money. When the banks were in trouble, there was an emergency in the State. I do not know what party was in Government at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The House had to be reconvened during the summer recess to save them. However, when they got back on their feet, they started purging rural areas of vital services.</P>
      <P>Banks will not operate travelling banks in some places. It is not that banks are not making money, but that they are not making enough profits. We saw recently the amount of money they are making. It is a disgrace. The Government should introduce legislation. I do not expect banks to operate in every village, but small towns, such as Louisburgh and Foxford, should have the same opportunities as the cities, even if they do not make the same huge profits as in cities and larger towns. They should be able to subsidise it so that a service is provided within a region, whether it is 40, 50 or 60 miles between towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the sale of the bank, I was disappointed this morning to hear someone criticising the fact that shares were being given to the workers. The workers provided a good service over the years and they worked hard for this company and for the banks. There is nothing wrong with giving them a little reward from the sale of the bank. Eircom did it for its workers and the ESB will have to do it for its workers. It is only <Col N="878" /> right that if the ACC Bank is being sold by the State, the workers should get part of the reward.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be answered and many statistics to be given to the House. I agree with Deputy John Bruton that the Minister of State's speech was poor. It was like a speech that Ministers and civil servants put together when they want to avoid giving the correct information. It was coded and it did not say enough. It is time the facts were put before the House, including the risks involved and the agreement the bank has entered into with the Four Seasons Hotel in particular. We want to know what liability faces the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an issue which people have raised with me in my clinic. Everyone in the State does not have a bank account. If the council pays a worker tomorrow morning and he or she does not have a bank account, he or she must go into the bank and get the cheque cleared before he or she can get the money. That is outrageous and it is a step too far. Something should be done about that. There was a time when one could go into a bank, get a cheque changed and walk out the door. Banks are advertising on-line banking, 24 hour services and new modern equipment, but they must remember we have an elderly population. Elderly people are affected by this and it is wrong. Banks are only thinking about the students who have been trained in computers in recent years. It does not bother them as they can access networks, including the Internet, to book air flights and do their banking transactions. However, it is not right that a person in this State cannot change a cheque, regardless of the type of cheque, if they can prove their identity. This is about money and profits.</P>
    <P>The Government should ensure that the banks provide a service for the people and that the people pay a fair price for it. They should not be ripped off and charged for things they do not know anything about. People often wonder what the charges are for on their bank statements. It should be like other businesses, including pubs which must display a price list. People should know when they go into a bank how much a transaction will cost. There should be signs on the walls to let people know what they must pay for. There should not be any hidden costs. We will wait with bated breath for the Minister's response to our questions.</P>

      <P>The reason I want to speak is that I served as a director of ACC Bank for a number of years. I pay tribute to the staff at head office and in the offices throughout the country over the years. The Department of Finance did not give the ACC Bank the type of support it should have got throughout the years. There was always one problem after another. During my time there we managed to persuade the then Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, to allow us to spread the interests of the ACC Bank across the country. I was a member of the ACC Bank from 1972 to 1977. During that period we bought offices throughout the country. When the commercial banks refused to give farmers money to finance their operations during that development period, the ACC Bank stepped in. It is a pity it did not get recognition for doing that. I was not pleased when it sold off large numbers of outlets across the country, including one in Gorey and Enniscorthy. We managed to keep the branches in Wexford and New Ross. It was a mistake to sell them off. They did not get the support of the Minister for Finance during that ten year period when there were difficulties supplying finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Bruton in his criticism of the Minister delivering a short three page script. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of ACC Bank, and to put in place the enabling provision required to facilitate the establishment of an employee share ownership trust for the bank. I have no problem with that. The Bill also provides for the future sale of ACC Bank, subject to the approval of the House, at the appropriate time. I object to this provision. I have been of the opinion for many years that this country needs a third financial institution with some strength in it. We do not have that. The two main banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, have far too much control over the finances of the country. They now control about 65% of the total banking business. That is a monopoly and is not allowed in any other country. Their profits are in the region of £1 billion per year, or £3 mill<Col N="881" /> ion per day. Their services are poor. I call on the commercial banks to immediately reduce their interest rates by at least one to one and a half per cent. They are overcharging for money and have done so for the past year and a half.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been going through a difficult time for the past two years, and the threat of foot and mouth disease is having a serious effect on profits in the agriculture industry. The banks show very little sympathy to farmers. Interest rates in the UK have been reduced since Christmas by one and a half per cent, but our banks have refused to give any reduction in the rate of interest, because of the monopoly. I ask the banks to be sympathetic to the agricultural community for the next three years, because it will take at least three years to get over this very difficult time in farming. The net income in farming has reduced over a five year period by approximately 16% to 18%. While the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will claim there will be an increase in net profits this year, the facts are that the net profit will be down again for the third year in succession.</P>
    <P>Section 8 proposes that the Registration of Title Act, 1964, shall not apply to ACC. Section 8(2) proposes that all estates and interests in freehold land and all leasehold interests in land which, before the commencement of this section, have been conveyed, granted or assigned to ACC, shall vest in ACC. How does this section work? Perhaps the Minister could explain the purpose of this section. Anyone wishing to register a property must go to the Land Registry office and the process can take up to 16 or 17 weeks. My understanding is that ACC Bank has a large property portfolio and I wonder if these properties are registered. I do not understand this section and I ask the Minister to explain what the section means so that people with borrowings from the ACC will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>I read with interest an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 August, 2000. It makes the following points: &ldquo;bad debts provisions increased from £700,000 in 1999, to £3.6 million this year following a review of ACC's corporate loan book, a review which is still continuing. Mr. Darling says the provision relates to a number of loans outside of the agricultural sector. Part of this provision is understood to relate to borrowings sanctioned for the development of the Four Seasons Hotel in Ballsbridge, which has run substantially over budget.&rdquo; That was a continuing saga.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain what is the situation in respect of those losses? There were three financial institutions involved in that development, not just the ACC. Will the Minister say what share of the losses were forced on ACC, and why was that bank made to carry losses over and above the percentage of the other financial institutions?</P>
    <P>Another paragraph from the article makes interesting reading: &ldquo;The bank's former chairman, Mr. Dan McGing, is a director of a company linked to the development of the hotel. The bank <Col N="882" /> is keen to emphasise the merits of its new business strategy which involves repositioning ACC largely towards the business market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have always argued that the ACC should have been allowed operate outside the agricultural sector. The Department of Finance consistently refused to allow the bank to do so. I know the bank finally did so in the past ten to twelve years. Its DIRT liabilities last year were in the region of £14.5 million, and I understand that profits next year will be minus £2 million or £3 million. That is a serious situation. I do not understand why the bank did not diversify into other areas of the economy. I wonder if the Department of Finance is still insisting that it operates largely within the agricultural sector. I would welcome the Minister's comments.</P>
    <P>My main point today is to request that the commercial banks show some sympathy for their customers. The recession could come this year or next year. There are already difficulties in America, in Japan, in Europe. The banks have enjoyed a monopoly and the two major banks are now recording profits of £1 billion per year each. I ask that they reduce their interest rates immediately by at least one and a half per cent.</P>

        <b>:</b> The ACC Bank Bill, 2001, provides for the privatisation of a State bank. The ACC Bank is now to be subject to the same treatment at the hands of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats as other crucial national assets over the past four years, since this Government came to office. This House must now listen with regular monotony to Ministers of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, proposing privatisation after privatisation of what are crucial national assets. Telecom has been the biggest so far. They then made provision for the sale of Aer Lingus, ICC Bank, TSB Bank, and now ACC Bank. It is a real misfortune for the Irish people and will in the years ahead be seen to be so. It will be seen to be a real misfortune that politics in this State is unfortunately dominated by not one but three capitalist parties at present. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and the largest so-called Opposition party are enthusiastic supporters of the privatisation of State assets and the deregulation of industries and services to the benefit of speculators and, on occasions, chancers. The main parties in this State have become intoxicated by the current growth rates in this capitalist economy, rates which have remained consistently high for a number of years. The Minister for Finance and the Government behave as if they believe these high growth rates will continue indefinitely, that the low rate of unemployment will be sustained and that job creation levels will remain at their current high levels. That will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The privatisation of extremely important State-owned assets is politically corrupting and constitutes a rip-off of assets which properly belong to the Irish people. It is clear to almost everyone that the Telecom Éireann privatisation was a <Col N="883" /> huge confidence trick foisted on the Irish people by the present Government. Ordinary people were induced, through a very slick advertising campaign, to invest their hard earned savings and in many cases to borrow money to purchase shares. I warned prior to that privatisation that benefits would accrue to major multinational companies, major players in the Stock Exchange and big business interests, not ordinary Irish people and that is precisely what happened. A small minority made an obscene killing on what was properly an asset of the Irish people. The thousands of people conned into buying shares have been extremely disappointed and that should serve as a warning to people about this Government's programme.</P>

        <b>:</b> Not really, I am arguing against section 5 of the Bill on the disposal and issue of shares in ACC Bank. I am merely outlining the outcomes of previous privatisations in terms of who has benefited from them, leading to the conclusion that the ACC should not be privatised.</P>
      <P>The privatisation of the mobile phone licence was a blatant abuse of a resource which belonged to the Irish people. The licence, which was awarded for a pittance, is making an absolute fortune for private individuals and companies. The process of privatisation is corrupting because it has now become clear that large donations were give to political parties by those who benefited from such privatisation. Ordinary people see this for what it is, irrespective of whether it was illegal.</P>
      <P>The privatisation of ACC Bank will be bitterly regretted in the future, as will previous and ongoing privatisations. The current growth rates have created a complacent attitude about levels of employment and other economic indices, but the cycle of capitalism has inescapable consequences for the State's economy and for its 1.7 million workers and their dependants. As sure as night follows day, the laws of the market dictate that recession follows a boom period. So it will be here in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>We have received early warnings from the US economy of what will happen in the economies of EU member states and this will have an even greater effect on the Irish economy due to the Government's policy of introducing myriad American multinationals into the State, virtually turning Ireland into a springboard for US multinationals into the EU. Many leading US companies have issued profit warnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That ordinary people and businesses are seriously over-extended is a sign of impending recession. When that happens, what will we have <Col N="884" /> to fall back on? We have privatised or are privatising assets which were formerly or are currently State-owned. If these assets had remained or were to remain in State ownership, they could act as a buffer against the power of multinationals and big business corporations which will simply up and leave when a recession occurs, leaving thousands of unemployed people in their wake. Privatisation moves more and more control away from Irish people into the hands of people who are not accountable to them. It is a recipe for huge problems in the future when the State will have less and less control.</P>
    <P>This Government plays fast and loose, with abandon, with resources which properly belong to the Irish people. Some weeks ago, I tackled the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources about Fianna Fáil giving away our natural gas wealth off the Mayo coast and asked him how much the gas would be worth to the multinational company involved. I was astounded that the Minister was unable to tell me the price. We must be alarmed when another national asset in the form of an established State bank is put forward for privatisation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is presented in a context in which one can envisage a real role for a State-owned agricultural credit corporation. The foot and mouth crisis is currently dominating Britain, Ireland and some other European countries. This serious crisis has been visited upon the population as a whole, precisely because control has been increasingly taken from the hands of ordinary people &ndash; small producers, small farmers, butchers, local abattoirs etc. &ndash; and placed instead in the hands of agri-business companies and major conglomerates which dominate agriculture in the EU. This has given rise to huge intensification of farming and has created the precise conditions in which diseases such as foot and mouth have spread like wildfire, causing devastation to the farming community and immense difficulties for small businesses, small operators in the tourism trade and thousands of workers in the meat, agricultural and tourism industries, not to speak of the intense suffering of the small farming community affected. That is the result of removing power from local areas and from the people and giving it to faceless and unaccountable interests. I hoped that lesson might have been learned by the Government but, unfortunately, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly the case that agriculture and agricultural practices within the EU must change. Even the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair &ndash; more Tory than the Tories, generally &ndash; and Chancellor Schröder have said as much in recent weeks. There must a return to natural means of production in farming and a move away from the ever increasing control by the agri-business sector, big business and giant supermarkets which indirectly played a major role in the spread of foot and mouth disease by requiring that meat and live animals be transported hundreds of miles, something which facilitated the wildfire <Col N="885" /> spread of the disease in Britain. A change of policy is needed.</P>
    <P>If we had a Government with vision it could lead that change of policy and ACC Bank could be a crucial feature in providing for that. There could be a declaration from the State that it had learned the lesson of the perversion of nature in modern agricultural practices which gave rise to BSE and other disasters. There could also be a major policy turn towards organic free range practices and away from the appallingly cruel practices used on animals in the intensification of agriculture. There could also be a development of the organic sector to be a major part of the economy. This is the way the voice of consumers &ndash; ordinary people &ndash; is going in Ireland and other European countries. A State agricultural bank could play a role in this. It could be part of a movement towards an agricultural revolution which would root out the perverse practices super profit mongers have inflicted on our farming practices and on the agriculture sector, return farming to a holistic means of producing wholesome food and end the type of conditions which create appalling suffering for animals and where disease can spread with the appalling rapidity we have witnessed in Britain in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>This is not the time or place to discuss this in detail but the policy of wholesale slaughter, which has devastated communities and traumatised the farming community, is not a sustainable practice. Were we to have a disaster in Ireland &ndash; and I sincerely hope we do not &ndash; we would have to have a serious discussion on a completely different means of managing the foot and mouth situation with vaccination and other means of control and not with the scorched earth policy unthinkingly employed in Britain simply because it has done it for 100 years. However, that is a different debate, albeit partly related.</P>
    <P>An ACC Bank continuing in ownership of a State with vision and understanding could play a crucial role in the renewal of agriculture in Ireland and could lead the way in Europe and even worldwide. That is what should happen to ACC Bank. The involvement in the DIRT scandal was outrageous and there is no question about that. Those responsible must be called to account. Unfortunately, State owned enterprises have been run too bureaucratically since their inception. There is a need to open up State owned enterprises to real democratic control. There should be a consumers' representative on the board. The workers should be represented much more on the board and involved in formulating policy.</P>
    <P>The bank should be seen as an asset of the people and of the workers in the industry. A completely different approach and ethos to publicly owned industry would create a dynamic new sector. When the chill winds of recession inevitably blow, we would still have many factors within the control of the people to counteract the effects of a worldwide capitalist recession. However, the Government goes recklessly in the other direc<Col N="886" /> tion giving away all levers of control which end up in the hands of massive banking concerns in the case of banks and massive international corporations in the case of Eircom.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom a rá gur Bhille náireach ón Rialtas de chuid Fianna Fáil agus na Progressive Democrats atá againn inniu atá faoi phríobháidiú a dhéanamh ar Bhanc ACC.

      <P>The ACC Bank has had a chequered history since it was founded in 1927 at the same time as many other institutions of the State, such as the Garda, Army and political institutions of the State which we have come to take for granted. Deputy Joe Higgins was often an unwilling participant and is now a willing participant in the democratic institutions of the State. I am delighted to hear him say the bureaucracy of State owned enterprises is the reason for the failure of many of them over the years and that they should be opened up to consumer and customer representation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what socialism stood for, but I also understand what the ACC Bank stood for given the difficult time it was established in the fledgling years of the State. In the <Col N="887" /> 1930s, the bank played a major role in the context of an economic war and stemming the tide of rural depopulation and creating some semblance of enterprising support for the agricultural community. Over the years, the ACC Bank played a major role as a development bank when other financial institutions did not want to lend too expansively to farmers to enable them develop their enterprises under the land project in the 1940s and 1950s. In the industrial era in the 1960s, there was much more competition for capital and the ACC Bank could be relied on to develop the agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>The bank came into its own as a result of developments that took place following Ireland's membership of the European Union in 1973. The Mansholt plan and other European programmes under the farm modernisation scheme gave farmers an opportunity, with EU grant assistance, to develop their agricultural enterprises into modern and competitive entities. They brought them up from the subsistence level to which they were accustomed since before the foundation of the State. Up to recent years, the ACC Bank played an important role in the development of the agricultural economy and consequently the development of rural communities.</P>
      <P>The agricultural community did well in the 1970s and 1980s from a low base. If farmers had not had seed capital and grant assistance from the European Union to inject into their plans, the dark old days and bad old ways of agriculture would still be in existence as they are still in many eastern European countries. I look forward to the enlargement of the Community. This will create opportunities for state investment and EU assistance to be made available to communities to enable them to develop in the same way as western European countries and the Iberian peninsula developed over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The importance of agriculture has not ever been more evident than it is today as a result of the concern over BSE and foot and mouth disease. We are all aware of the inter-relationship between all sectors of the economy. However, there is a realisation in all our constituencies that has not existed for many years about how a potential disaster, like that in County Louth, could bring about a standstill in every aspect of economic activity in the country. Before I came to the Chamber, I received some worrying news about developments in my Kilkenny constituency in relation to the foot and mouth disease scare. I hope the steps being taken are only precautionary because I am aware of the enormous havoc that would be created not only for business and others in my constituency, but throughout the country if the disease spreads beyond the current exclusion zone in County Louth. The Minister of State is from the same region and he understands the impact it would have not only on farming families, but on the tourism industry and businesses which are already feeling the pinch since the scare about this dreaded plague began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The future of the ACC Bank is a worrying issue for the bank and its employees. The bank did not do itself any favours with the type of lending arrangements it made and the tactics it used for recovering some loans in the 1970s and 1980s. It did not endear itself to many customers at that time, but, overall, it was an essential part of the development of agriculture for 20 years from the time Ireland joined the EU. In recent years, the bank appears to have failed to develop and broaden its commercial base and exposure in the same way as other financial institutions. Given the way in which the ACC Bank was involved in community development, particularly in rural areas, it could have advanced itself as doing much of the work credit unions are now undertaking in many communities. In rural areas, the ACC Bank missed an opportunity in terms of capitalising on that niche market. As a State owned bank, with a reasonably small capital base compared to other private financial institutions, it would not ever have had an opportunity to compete with the major financial players in the economy. It should have done more to develop a niche market for itself. The community base and support it enjoyed, particularly in rural areas, should have been tapped to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the ACC Bank wants the House to approve an increase in capital from £50 million to £100 million. It is blaming much of the need for this on the liability to which it was exposed as a result of the DIRT inquiry. However, I am not optimistic about commitments from the management of the ACC Bank in the light of recent history about absolute commitments to ensuring full compliance from the bank's management. The losses the bank has successively accrued over the past three years do not inspire confidence given that there were many opportunities in the economy. The Celtic tiger was roaring, but the ACC Bank sustained losses aside from the DIRT inquiry, the matters it exposed and the amount the bank had to repay as a result.</P>
    <P>The need for the Bill is due largely to the failure of the management to make profits for the company at a time when it was never easier to make profits in the financial services area and the failure of the protracted negotiations about merging with the ICC and the TSB. Why did the ACC Bank fail to conclude negotiations with those two institutions? We did not receive any explanation from the Minister during his short contribution about why the negotiations broke down. If they had been successful, the legislation would be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy mentioned the losses the bank accrued in the Four Seasons hotel project. This hotel is in Dublin 4, but I am sure there were many wry smiles from people, particularly in the agricultural community, who came under pressure and suffered harassment in the 1970s and 1980s from local ACC Bank branch managers trying to recover small sums of money from them. It appears there was a sweetheart deal and that a golden circle was involved in putting the consor<Col N="889" /> tium together. It is ironic that the softest touch appears to have been the ACC Bank, which is a State bank. However, the Minister did not address the issue of what happened in that debacle, the current position in terms of the exposure of the ACC Bank and whether the financial institution will ultimately suffer a loss or recover the loans it advanced. Will the money be substantially recoverable or was a deal done with the new investors to get the project completed?</P>
    <P>If one had to endure a tough master in school, one takes the opportunity to have a go at him when one can in later life, However, the tactics used by the ACC Bank in particular over the years to recover debts did not endear it to people in terms of increasing its customer base when subsequent legislation enabled it to broaden into the housing market and the industrial area. I mentioned this aspect previously, but it left a sour taste in many people's mouths at the time. The Minister has no option but to increase the capital. However, I do not know what eventual benefit to an employee will be a share option in a company which is going into reverse as a financial entity.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say the ACC is losing the confidence of the people because of its failure to successfully conclude a merger and the fact that we need to produce more capital at a time when there should be no need for it, but I do not know to what other conclusion the public can come. If employees are offered shares in the company, I hope they will get a better return than was the case following the flotation of Telecom Éireann. From the point of view of a good bet on the Stock Market employees will be very wary about putting their trust in the management or subsequent sale of the bank. Before entering into any agreements, they would be wise to take careful stock of the past performance of the bank, particularly in recent years in the context of the merger negotiations. Nevertheless, I appreciate the Minister has not many options but to improve the share capital. He should continue to seek a purchaser for the ACC bank because as a stand-alone bank, considering what has been said about it in the context of the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry and the direction in which the bank is heading, it does not have any option but to seek a purchaser in order to remove itself from the exposure it has received over the years and its lack of direction in anticipation of the current economic boom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I declare a certain interest and certain exchanges of views I have had in the past with the ACC bank, particularly in the context of the DIRT inquiry. Having said that, I will try to be as dispassionate and impartial as possible in what I have to say about that financial institution, including financial institutions in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that financial institutions must make a profit. There must be a healthy profit, healthy investment and incentives for investors to invest in order for the institutions to blossom and survive in the financial market. <Col N="890" /> There must be a recognition of the customer who is the consumer. Over the years customers have had to pay high interest rates, very often penal and punitive interests rates, so that the financial institutions could survive. Very often, as a consequence, the customer could not survive. A number of other speakers referred to this aspect. Anyone who studied closely what took place in the 1970s, and particularly in the 1980s, when the economy performed badly and interest rates were running at 14%, 15% and 16%, would note that some financial institutions charged people who were already in great difficulty as much as 28%, 29% and 30%. This put many customers in a position from which they could not possibly extricate themselves. Debt doubled every three years and countless companies went out of business throughout the country at a time when the country could ill-afford it. Many local enterprises in various parts of the country did not survive as a result of an encounter with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Given the tiger economy and the jungle which world economies have become, it behoves us all to remember that era and not forget that the customers, the people who keep the financial institutions in business, who borrow money and invest money with the financial institutions, do not always get the recognition they deserve. That attitude continues to this day. If one studies the activities of ACC bank and all the other financial institutions, and evaluates the degree to which the interests of customers are observed in the first instance, one will find that customers' interests are secondary to the interests of the financial institutions. That is not the way things should be. The customer is the person who is paying for a service. He or she is not getting a free service. There are very few free services in that area. Together with paying for the service, customers must accept the diktats of the financial institution concerned. If one has an argument with them, as we have all done from time to time, one will inevitably find that the financial institution will always claim to be right. How would right be on the side of the financial institutions at all times? </P>
    <P>Surely the law of averages would dictate that the financial institutions should be wrong once or twice. However, for some unknown reason, that is never the case. It appears the financial institutions are correct because they make the rules and customers abide by the rules. If customers break the rules drawn up by the financial institutions, the customers must pay. Why should that be? What precedent has been set to support the theory that in all such instances the rules of behaviour, rules of operation and rules of procedure drawn up by the financial institutions, and paid for by customers, should be observed by customers? Customers must pay for and abide by the rules which are not their policy but the policy of the financial institutions, the purpose of which is to protect the financial institutions. In today's enlightened world &ndash; by that I mean enlightened in terms of fair play &ndash; it would be a good idea to consider the degree to which the financial insti<Col N="891" /> tutions return in kind the trust placed in them by customers and treat customers with a little bit of respect.</P>
    <P>There has been a reference to the share options offer. I have no problem with this proposal, nor have I a problem with the system whereby share options are offered to employees. This should be the case to ensure that employees are retained. I am not sure that is the real reason behind the proposal. Probably the chief reason for the proposal is to get acceptance for the deal. The principle of share options is not wrong and it should not have to wait for a merger, changeover or sale of a financial institution for that to become the normal working practice and procedure. By the same token, it should not become the norm to expect the sale price for shares in such cases is not of an inflated nature to the extent that the unfortunate shareholder will pay a bigger price at a later stage by buying an overly inflated share on the date of issue. I can recall one or two serious instances in that regard in recent years. One would not want to have the longest memory in the House to figure that one out.</P>
    <P>What amuses me most of all is the hype, effort and cost which goes into promoting the share price to certain groups. The share option does not work this way. In recent flotations all the hype has gone into inflating the attractiveness of the share to the consumer who naturally thinks he or she is getting a great deal and will get a good return in a few years. However, that person might never make a bob on it and people blame everyone else for what they said and when they said it. There should be no mystery about this issue as it is simple. If the share price is too high in the first place and people try to redeem or salvage their savings at a later stage, it is too late. I have no difficulty with the preferential shares for employees as it will encourage staff to stay on in the bank. This is important as it is difficult to get good staff. However, it should not be done simply to reach agreement on a proposal regarding a sale or merger.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank was previously the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The agricultural scene has changed over the years and the demands are much greater than they were 25 or 30 years ago. These demands will get even greater and the market will become much more competitive. When I was much younger there was a much greater number of banks and financial institutions. At the time it was decided that the major banks would merge into various blocks we were told this was good for the consumer, the country and banks which would be able to give a better quality and more effective service. What has happened? They have withdrawn from the scene and become totally focused on profit margins and keeping investors happy. There is much more to the banking business than this. Like other major employers, financial institutions have a function in the economy and other functions apart altogether from keeping their investors happy and having a <Col N="892" /> healthy annual report which shows massively increased profits. We must keep in mind this element of financial business and services.</P>
    <P>We were also told that there would be greater competition as a result of these mergers. That was one promise which rang hollow. Was this greater competition to ensure higher profits for the financial institutions or to meet the needs of customers? The customer was not foremost in the minds of those who suggested that there would be greater competition. I am not restricting my criticism to the ACC Bank. Many other banks must also look at the changes in the marketplace, the changed requirements and the different customer expectations. It is no longer enough for financial institutions to tell customers, &ldquo;we have made these rules, this is the way it is and you must accept it&rdquo;. They must say whether these rules are legal and effective and outline their purpose. If the purpose is purely self-serving on the part of the financial institutions there is no use trying to stuff that information down the throats of customers.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and we have moved on. At one time there was a huge level of respect for banking and other institutions, including political institutions. Everyone has paid a price in the intervening period. The financial institutions are better placed than most to become customer friendly, to address their concerns and to ensure they provide a decent and transparent service to customers and investors and do not resort to tactics which are better placed in jurisdictions which do not have a democratic disposition. I make this point in all sincerity. I have more than a passing interest in this debate and will take this up at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interesting contributions. I will try to address all the issues raised. I understand that during my absence queries were raised by some Deputies. I wish to inform them that I was dealing with the Valuation Bill at the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, as were the Finance spokespersons for Fine Gael and Labour. It does no justice to us as politicians when Deputies try to score points when Ministers are busy elsewhere. This gives credence to the perception that we are not working if we are not in the House.</P>

      <P>This is most unfortunate. Sometimes there is an overlap. I have been on my feet, so to speak, since 10.30 a.m. I am not pleased about this but if that is the demand at times then I am prepared to accept it. Deputies who know better should not try to pretend something is other than it is, particularly when Opposition spokespersons are involved in the same work as me. I would prefer to deal with one issue at a time but sometimes this is not possible. I am fully <Col N="893" /> aware of the points raised during my absence and will deal with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the Committee of Public Accounts' inquiry which he chaired and which dealt with the DIRT issue and the banks. I agree that the ACC, in common with most other banks, did not come out of the episode in a good light. The fact that the ACC is a State owned entity made it less acceptable in its case. I do not intend to run through all the events since the findings of the inquiry were published but I will touch on a number of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister wrote to the board on 20 March 2000 and introduced a new reporting structure for the bank to address the finding that the reporting procedures had failed in relation to the DIRT issue. Under this structure, which is in addition to the normal reporting procedures required under the State bodies' guidelines, the chairman of the bank is required to meet and brief the Minister on a quarterly basis. The chairman has met the Minister on five occasions since March 2000. The chief executive officer is required to meet appropriate officials of the Department on a quarterly basis and to brief it on all matters of interest. Four quarterly meetings have taken place.</P>
      <P>The bank has implemented new compliance functions and procedures and reporting methods have been changed by the bank to ensure all issues are brought to the attention of the board. New auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers have been appointed by the bank and the board has requested them to evaluate all the changes in procedures made by the bank. This work is in train and the board expects to report to the Minister shortly.</P>
      <P>The board has replied to the Minister's letter of 18 September in which he expressed his deep disappointment at the need for the ACC to have made a settlement with Revenue and informed them that it was unacceptable that any bank, particularly one in which the Minister for Finance is a shareholder, should have failed in its tax compliance obligations. The chairman in his replies in October and November agreed with the Minister's views, set out a comprehensive reply to all of the issues arising from the findings of the Committee of Public Accounts report and assured him of the board of management's absolute commitment to ensuring full compliance in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of strategy was raised by a number of Deputies. Deputy Mitchell wondered whether the closure of the Dublin branch network was wise. It is part of its new strategy in its preparation for sale. It was decided to refocus towards business accounts and high net worth personal accounts. Branches are not essential to deliver such services to customers. Five business sales teams have been set up in Dublin and there are also four business service centres in Dublin. A centralised streamlined personal banking unit has been established for personal customers. Part of the rationale behind the closure of the Dublin branches was to address the cost income ratio. Overall ACC would not perceive this as a negative from a potential pur<Col N="894" /> chaser's point of view as it is now doing business with customers in a more effective efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of proceeds was also raised. The proceeds from ICC have been taken into the Exchequer and the Minister is giving consideration to the best use of these and will make an announcement in due course. Deputies should note that placing such funds, as has been suggested by some, in the national pensions reserve fund would require a resolution to be passed by the Dáil under section 18(5) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000. The issue of the bank's worth and the sale timetable was also raised. The valuation of a bank is a complex business which involves taking into account the market value of quoted banks, the particular portfolio of the bank to be sold and the fit between the bank and the tenderer's own business and the terms on which the bank is being sold. It would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on what price would be accepted for the bank. However, I would state that it is not proposed to sell the bank for less than its true value. Furthermore the matter will be considered by Government before there is any decision on a sale. Under section 5 of this Bill the Minister will bring forward a motion for approval in the Dáil in the event that he intends to dispose of any of his shares in the bank following such a proposal from the board of ACC bank, with the exception of his disposal of shares in relation to an ESOP.</P>
    <P>In relation to the timetable, the bank is pushing ahead with its preparations including commencing negotiations on the ESOP. The Minister has indicated to the board that he wants to see a change in the ownership structure over the course of the next year. The purpose of the enabling provisions in this Bill is to allow the bank to move quickly when appropriate to do so. The role of this House is safeguarded by the requirement for the Minister to secure a motion of approval before making any sale of the shares. Deputy Bruton wondered why that was necessary. He should be aware following debates involving the ICC, the TSB and now the ACC. I am sure he is aware, given developments in the domestic and EU banking sectors in recent years, both in terms of competition and the regulatory environment, that the Government's policy in relation to banking is that the State no longer requires to be involved in the sector in an ownership capacity. ACC bank has been facing intense competition which has been reflected in reduced margins in its niche sectors. Capital will also be scarce within the public sector and it cannot be guaranteed to be available whenever it is required. In view of this, and given the impact which the euro will have in terms of competition within the banking sector, the maintenance of State banks within the public sector was not considered to be a viable option and nor was it considered to be in the best interests of the staff of the bank.</P>
    <P>The issue of potential purchasers is a matter for the board of the bank who will form a view and <Col N="895" /> make a recommendation to the Minister. It would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the matter. Deputy Fleming suggested it was wrong of the bank not to make a clear provision for the DIRT settlement in the 1999 accounts on the basis that the accounts were finalised in April and the settlement was reached in August. The rise in the bad debts provision, which Deputy Fleming questioned, arose from a fundamental review of the large corporate loans. I cannot comment further on individual cases. The bank is prohibited under legislation governing it from informing the Minister about individual cases.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for help for bank customers affected by the foot and mouth situation to be helped by the banking industry in general and the ACC in particular. This is primarily a matter for the credit institutions and their representatives. There have been calls on the Minister to instruct ACC to introduce a moratorium. This would be a matter for the board which is charged with running the bank on a commercial basis in order to produce a return on the money invested by the State. The bank has informed the Minister that it would treat affected borrowers sympathetically and such cases would be considered on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>On the issue of An Post, the Minister for Public Enterprise answered a parliamentary question yesterday on the matter. She stated that she had received a report prepared by Mr. Phil Flynn at her request and that she would be announcing the action she proposes to take on foot of the report when the Cabinet has completed its deliberations. Mr. Flynn's report considered the matters concerning the role of An Post in providing banking related services. Deputy D'Arcy asked about the operation implications of section 8 which relates to section 23(2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, and concerns property owned by or leased by ACC, even if the registration process is not complete. This only affects property owned by the bank. It has nothing to do with property held as security. This section has been included to provide legal certainty as to the ownership of the bank's properties at the time of the sale. The section will only be commenced when the contract for the sale is being completed.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Hogan, ACC will make a loss in respect of the year 2000. It made a pre-tax profit of £19.25 million in 1999 and £20.5 million in 1999. ACC is continuing to trade strongly and made good operational profits in 2000 which were offset by the DIRT settlement, restructuring costs and an increase in bad debts provisions following a review of the corporate loan book. The bank is trading well this year. Deputy Bruton asked if the section on State guarantees provides for the continuation of existing guarantees. This will only happen when the bank has been sold. In any sale process the Minister will require the production of a counter indemnity from the purchaser of the existing guarantees. This was the <Col N="896" /> situation in the sale of ICC also. The reason for the continuation of these guarantees is that the State cannot unilaterally withdraw from them in any case. The level of the guarantees has been reducing over time and it has been policy for some time that no new guarantees are to be issued. The figure of £489 million is the position at the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also raised a number of queries on ACC accounts and I will write to him directly on these. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Section 4 provides for the Minister to make regulations under the Act. Regulations will in general be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection 2 provides for a number of exceptions to that procedure. Amendment No. 1 had been proposed on Committee Stage to delete the reference to regulations made under section 14(4) from that exemption. While I had no objection in principle to the amendment, as these regulations are originally rooted in separate legislation, the Superannuation Act, I was anxious not to provide for any mechanism in this legislation that may already be covered in the 1980 Act. As Deputies will recall I undertook to consult further on this issue. Having now consulted with the legal advisers I am happy to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;b) to ensure that only qualified teachers be employed or work as teachers in schools,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the objects of the council. I propose that we amend that section to read that it be one of the objectives of the council to ensure <Col N="897" /> that only qualified teachers be employed or work as teachers in schools. We debated this matter on Committee Stage. We recognise that schools are operating with the assistance of a large number of unqualified teachers. It is important to recognise the steps being taken to deal with that problem and the increased intake into the training colleges. It is a fair objective of the council to seek to ensure that all teachers would be fully qualified and it is appropriate that such an objective would be included in the section. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment in the spirit in which it has been tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the point made by the Deputy but in my view the Bill already covers this matter. Eligibility for registration with the teaching council is outlined in section 31. Any person who before the establishment day is employed as a teacher in a recognised school and paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or where he or she is not employed is eligible to be so employed, will be deemed to be registered for the initial period of 12 months. Within the 12 month period existing teachers must apply to the teaching council to be registered and be issued with certificates of registration under procedures set down by the council. The council may also set down procedures for the registration of persons other than those already mentioned. These regulations may set conditions for registration which may include qualifications, teaching experience, medical fitness and evidence of character.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the Bill provides that a school may employ as teachers paid as such from the public purse only persons who are registered with the teaching council as registered teachers. Untrained substitutes currently fulfil an important role in schools and these individuals will continue to be paid for this purpose out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. However, it is my intention that every assistance will be given to enable them to satisfy the requirements for registration with the teaching council. If registration is to have a meaning and if we are serious about the promotion of quality in the teaching profession we must move to an all-trained teaching profession. I have had discussions with the unions and people concerned. They are happy with the special arrangements being made for intensive short-term courses. There are difficulties on the edges here and there but they are satisfied that the arrangements being made by the Department are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Deputy concerning numbers. The question of having a sufficiency of trained teachers has been a problem. At primary level 291 teachers graduated in 1995. The total intake at the colleges has greatly increased since that time to meet demand and to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. The intake for primary teaching in the colleges of education in the 1999-2000 academic year increased to 1,283. That is a significant increase from the 500 entrants in 1996-97. <Col N="898" /> Given that the intake is increasing there will continue to be a good supply of teachers.</P>
    <P>Interviews for posts at second level were held in August last from which 1,000 extra teachers were appointed. There were over 2,000 applications. A position that was difficult has been remedied. As we have said previously, there are difficulties with some areas, such as maths and science. The numbers have been increased significantly and satisfactory numbers are still coming forward for posts. This has been a matter of concern and we are anxious to take care of the position of people who have been teaching for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the letter to which he referred. However, with respect, the Minister has missed the point I am making. I am not raising the issue of registration but rather that under the section dealing with the objects of the council, which are to regulate the teaching profession, ensure professional conduct, establish and maintain standards, promote continuing education and training and so on, should be included the objective of ensuring that only qualified teachers should be employed in schools. I accept all the points the Minister has made about registration but that is not what I am seeking to achieve in this amendment. I am simply saying it is a legitimate objective of a professional body that it would make a statement about the importance of professional qualifications and that it should be an aim of that body to ensure that all persons engaged in teaching are professionally qualified. The amendment has nothing to do with registration. It is simply a statement of the council's aims and objectives, one of which would be to ensure a high standard of professional qualification. It was with that in mind that I tabled the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shortall's amendment. I accept the Minister's point about the shortage of teachers and the steps taken to ensure the matter is addressed. However, he missed the fundamental point contained in the amendment, which deals with the objects of the council. It is related to a number of other issues that arise, for example, in section 30 the issue of the employment of non-registered teachers not being entitled to be funded out of the public purse. The amendment stands on its merits as an objective of the council. There are related issues in the Bill on which we need to close the circle. It is laudable that the teaching council would have as an objective to ensure that only qualified teachers be employed or work as teachers in schools. On this, as on a number of related issues regarding registration and payment and taking into account that hundreds of schools are employing hundreds of teachers on a daily basis who do not have the necessary qualifications, it should be a laudable objective that the council would aspire to having only qualified teachers. The Government has taken steps to try to ensure continuity of supply. <Col N="899" /> On that basis it is a laudable objective given that hundreds of non-qualified teachers in primary and post-primary schools are taking classes on a daily basis.</P>

      <P>The Minister is misreading the amendment. The amendment articulates the objective we share which is to ensure that we reach a situation where all those working in schools are fully qualified teachers. Teachers share this objective in respect of the teaching council which is their proposed professional body.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there was consultation with all the unions. However, one, and perhaps two unions, specifically requested that we include this as an objective. The Minister is being unnecessarily defensive about this amendment. It does not tie anyone's hands or commit us to using only qualified teachers. The system depends on unqualified teachers but we are proposing that we set as an objective that, over time, all those working in schools will be qualified.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 37, after &ldquo;establish&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following consultation with teacher unions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the importance of partnership in education. While the council will be independent of the nominating bodies which have a right to appoint members to it, in the spirit of <Col N="900" /> partnership it should be obligatory for the council to at least consult the teachers' unions.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, stated that this proposal was unacceptable. However, recent events have shown that adequate consultation is important. I am not suggesting that the unions' stamp of approval is required but that they should at least be consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The partnership model is well established in education and it is important that we maintain this approach. If there was not a teaching council and the Minister or the Department proposed to introduce a new code of conduct for teachers, there is no question but that there would be full consultation with the teachers' unions before any such code was introduced.</P>
      <P>For this reason it is important that where we are providing for the establishment of codes of conduct under the teaching council, we include the recognition of the need to consult and, ideally, obtain the agreement of the partners in education.</P>
      <P>We are all clear on the need to distinguish between the role of trade unions and the role of teachers' representatives on the teaching council which will primarily deal with professional issues as opposed to employment or trade union issues. However, for the sake of ensuring good co-operation and consultation and maintaining a high standard of partnership in education, it is important that, before establishing a code of conduct for teachers, the Minister does the unions the courtesy of consulting them. This is a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will note that the Bill explicitly provides for the teachers' unions to have representation on the council, not to act as members of the union but as wider representatives of the teaching profession who, through their expertise and experience, will enrich the council as a whole. Should the teaching council require the advice of the trade unions or any other group, it can do so under section 53 which provides that the council may make arrangements with other persons to assist it in carrying out its work.</P>
      <P>Deputies should also consider the relationship between the teachers' unions and the teaching council. This issue was considered at length by the report of the steering group on the teaching council which identified a clear distinction between the responsibilities of both organisations as regards the representation of teachers' concerns.</P>
      <P>The teaching council will be solely concerned with the qualitative and professional aspects of education while the unions will continue to be primarily concerned with negotiating conditions of service, salaries and pensions. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;, which shall include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the functions of the council. Section 7(2)(<i>b</i>) states that one of the main functions of the council will be &ldquo;to establish, publish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers, which shall include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes to delete the last part of this section as it is important to distinguish between codes of conduct and teachers' behaviour and teaching standards, knowledge and skills. These are two distinct areas which should not be confused.</P>
      <P>Standards of teaching, knowledge, skill, competence and so on are dealt with in other sections of the Bill and, presumably, this will be a major area of concern for the promised commission on teaching. However, I am concerned that there will be confusion on the part of the Department or the teaching council as regards these issues. These are distinct areas and we should separate the behaviour and conduct of teachers from the issue of standards and skills.</P>
      <P>We need clarity on the behaviour of teachers in respect of students, colleagues, principals, boards of management and so on. This is a distinct issue and it would be dangerous to confuse it with the issue of educational standards and skills.</P>

      <P>One of the council's important functions will be &ldquo;to establish, publish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers, which shall include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence&rdquo;. Self-regulation also applies to other councils, such as the Medical Council. This Bill provides for self-regulation for the teaching profession and the majority of the council's members will be teachers. The words the amendment proposes to delete, &ldquo;standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence&rdquo;, are central to establishing the context in which the conduct and standards of behaviour of a teacher must be judged. Without such a context it would be impossible to make such a judgment. If the legislation was not to contain such a description, in all likelihood, the council would have to create such a context in order to give meaning to the concept of a code of professional conduct. The alternative scenario would be a code of conduct so detached from the reality of the teaching profession as to be meaningless. Such a code would serve little purpose in acting <Col N="902" /> as a quality assurance mechanism, either for the public or the profession. It is, therefore, an important and necessary function of the profession. It will be set, run and guided by the profession which will have the majority of members on the council.</P>

The area of standards is a distinct one and for that reason I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>It is an important aspect which, as the Deputy will realise, does apply. If the council will not do it, it will have an important function taken away from it. I refer the Deputy to the Medical Council with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar. We look to the Medical Council to set such standards and are looking to the Teaching Council to do the same for the teaching profession. As it will enjoy statutory independence, from the point of view of those involved in the profession and the public at large, it will give a strong assurance that professional standards will be maintained. In that sense it is important.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on what he considers to be professional conduct or, looking at the other side of the question, what he considers to be conduct unbecoming a professional in a teaching capacity? I am trying to elucidate what exactly we are talking about. Are we talking about the behaviour of a member of the profession outside the classroom or are we dealing strictly with the discharge of one's duties within one's contracted time within a school environment? This could well be a Pandora's box. While everybody would like the teaching profession to aspire to high standards of knowledge in teaching as well as adequate competency and skills, where are we drawing the line in terms of professional conduct? Is it conduct entirely within the school and classroom or outside that environment?</P>

      <P>I have to deal with situations where there are abuses of one kind or another. Inspectors deal with such cases as they come though the system. Under the new legislation, however, the profession will deal with such issues. The Deputy mentioned matters that occur outside the school which, for instance, could include cases of abuse. They would become a matter of one's conduct as a professional. There is no doubt that questions of illegality or criminality are rare, but they have to be dealt with when they arise. The teaching profession wanted to assume that function which, in the first instance, is being left with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 2, after &ldquo;registered&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following the coming into effect of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the functions of the council. It is stated on page 9 of the Bill that one of its functions will be &ldquo;to determine from time to time the education, training and qualifications required for a person to be registered&rdquo;. I am seeking to insert the words, &ldquo;following the coming into effect of this Act&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo;. Will the council be in a position to retrospectively apply standards in order that somebody will be automatically registered on the day the Bill is enacted? The benchmark may be set so high that it may not be possible for him or her to reregister after a period of 12 months. If the council establishes such a high level of training and qualifications for a person to be so registered, it may be unreasonable to expect him or her to be able to meet it. I am thinking of those teaching in the vocational sector who do not hold a higher diploma in education. If the council decides that all teachers employed in a school on the date the Bill is enacted are registered, from that date onwards it will be possible for the council to revisit the issue of what is an appropriate educational qualification. Somebody who does not hold a higher diploma in education, but has 15 or 20 years' teaching experience could find that after 12 months he or she is not eligible to renew his or her registration and is, therefore, no longer entitled to teach. I am anxious to avoid such a scenario. The import of the amendment would be to draw a line in the sand and say that if one is entitled to be registered on the date the Bill becomes law, one cannot be deregistered for reasons that the council may, at a later stage, determine to be an appropriate level of qualifi<Col N="904" /> cation, but which it is not reasonable to expect someone to meet thereafter.</P>
    <P>In his reply on Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said that the council would not be empowered to apply retrospectively new standards to the existing body of teachers, but I fail to see where that is enshrined in the Bill. I am, effectively, seeking to copperfasten the matter in order that the council would not be entitled to so do. The Minister of State said that he would clarify the position before Report Stage. Perhaps the Minister will deal with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concerns in this regard. He mentioned drawing a line, but I will not talk about sand since it shifts a little. The role of the teaching council can only be to set out the standards and qualifications which will apply to those teachers who, in the future, seek to register with it. It is not my intention that the council should be empowered to retrospectively apply new standards to the existing body of teachers. This matter was debated at length on Committee Stage and I sought legal advice in respect of it. I have been assured that the Bill, as currently worded, safeguards the rights of existing teachers. Section 31 provides for the registration of existing teachers on establishment day. Annual renewal of registration will not be subject to a review of the qualification requirements. However, the council will have a proactive role in promoting the value and importance of continued in-service training for teachers. As the Deputies will be aware, such training is an essential part of the teaching profession because it allows its members an opportunity to become familiar with new developments in the field of theory and practice. This duty is provided for in section 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reassured by the Minister's comments. He seems to suggest that the council, when established, could not at any future date establish a particular level of qualification as a prerequisite to being allowed to teach which would not apply to all registered teachers. There are teachers working at present who do not possess a higher diploma in education. If the teaching council decides that, in the course of a 12 month period between registration, the higher diploma is the desirable standard of qualification, on re-registration certain people will not be able to meet that standard. I understand that provision is made in the Bill to allow people to acquire the necessary skills in certain areas. Is it reasonable, however, that a person with many years of teaching experience could find themselves &ndash; I cannot state a definite case here because I would be presupposing what the council may decide &ndash; excluded from their profession because they do not possess, for example, a higher diploma in education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording proposed in the amendment would have the effect of granting an amnesty to those who are already employed as teachers. It <Col N="905" /> would also ensure that they would not be affected by the type of scenario I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We checked this matter with the Parliamentary Counsel and sought his advice. I am assured that the position of a person who is registered, in the first instance, will be safeguarded from the establishment day forward. The other section to which I referred deals with ongoing in-service training, etc. Even in the event of a future council attempting to take action in this area, it will be possible for the matter to be referred to the High Court.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 17, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Minister shall have regard to such advice and shall, in any case where he or she does not accept such advice, publish reasons for his or her decision&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister of State undertook to examine a number of the amendments we had tabled in respect of it. We had hoped that the senior Minister would accept some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for tabling amendment No. 10 is to ensure that the teaching council will not become a mere talking shop and that it will play a central role in the development of teaching as a profession. Section 7, to which it relates, is <Col N="906" /> concerned with the functions of the council and contains a reference to the advice the Minister will be given by the council. I suggest that we amend the section to include the term &ldquo;and the Minister shall have regard to such advice and shall, in any case where he or she does not accept such advice, publish reasons for his or her decision&rdquo;. There has been wide consultation on this Bill and the teaching council, when it is established, will be and important body and it will also be representative of all teacher interests. In addition, there will be a great deal of expertise and experience available among the ranks of the council.</P>
    <P>One of the main functions of the teaching council will be to provide advice to the Minister of the day. It is important that we will be able to discover what happened to that advice once it has been issued by the council. In an ideal world where the council and the Minister work in unison, he or she will take that advice on board. However, where it is not taken on board or ignored &ndash; there may be legitimate reasons for this &ndash; the council should have the right to know why this is the case. In fairness to those involved, where the advice is not taken the Minister should publish the reasons for this. He or she could make a simple statement outlining the reasons for not taking the advice and indicating his or her position in relation to the matter on which that advice was sought. This would ensure that the voice of the council will be strengthened, that it would not be a mere talking shop and that the advice it will give will not be left to gather dust. The council must have an active and effective role in influencing policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I recall that in the recent past the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform got into hot water with regard to the setting up of an advisory body to adjudicate on the establishment of the Human Rights Commission for which provision was made in the Good Friday Agreement. Having put the body in place, the Minister did not taken its advice on board and, understandably, all hell broke loose. That is a lesson that could be applied here. We are establishing a 37 member Teaching Council with 11 members from the primary sector, 11 from the post-primary sector and the remaining members from third level colleges such as UCC, UCD, UCG, Dublin University, Maynooth, UL, St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, and the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines. It will obviously be a high powered council reaching across all sectors of Irish education.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister or his successor, whoever that might be, would willingly disregard advice. The Minister will be obliged to take on board the views of the council and, where he disagrees with it, to publicly outline the reasons for so doing. Otherwise, the credibility of the council will be undermined, which would be undesirable. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy said, all hell would break loose which means that people are interested in the matter. While it is valuable and important that the council should advise the Minister on a range of matters, it is inevitable that there will be instances where the Minister will not be in a position to accept or act on its advice. In such situations the Minister must remain accountable to the Oireachtas, not the council.</P>
      <P>There are means by which the Minister is and will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas. These remain the most appropriate means of ensuring his or her accountability. In a case where the Minister is not in a position to accept or act on the advice of the council and where the council deems it appropriate, reference may be made to the matter in its annual report to be published under section 55. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent it from publishing other reports during the course of the year should it see fit to do so. The normal administrative procedure will be for the Minister to set out his or her views in response to any queries such as those mentioned or the reasons the advice of the council is not being taken. If there are situations where, for what the Minister considers to be good reasons, its advice is not being taken, the Minister must remain accountable to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 25, to delete &ldquo;represent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;present the view of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment. There is a danger that the role of the Teaching Council and that of the teacher unions will be confused. On most matters affecting teachers the current lines of communication are between the Minister, the Department and the teacher unions. There will now be another body in place. Although the teacher unions will be represented on the council, we must ensure there will be a distinct relationship between the Department and the teacher unions, the Department and the council and the council and the teacher unions. Those lines of commmunication should be kept open. The council should not be used as a back door in introducing changes to the code of conduct or any other matter affecting the terms of a teacher's employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current wording is ambiguous. It is important that clear distinctions are drawn between the role of the teacher unions and that of the Teaching Council. Trade unions are normally seen to act in a representative capacity. The wording &ldquo;represent the teaching profession&rdquo;<Col N="908" /> could, therefore, lead to ambiguity, if not amended. I suggest that we change it to read, &ldquo;present the views of teachers&rdquo; to distinguish between the role of teachers on the Teaching Council, who will be representative of the body of teachers generally, and that of those who act in a representative capacity, namely, trade union representatives. If we were to distinguish between those two roles, we would improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>Following Committee Stage and having been advised by my colleague of the Deputy's concerns, I discussed the wording again with my legal advisers. I have been advised that there is no substantive or legal difference from the phrase contained in the Bill. Like the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, the Teaching Council will represent the profession on educational matters. The teacher unions will continue to represent teachers on issues relating to pay and conditions. The teacher unions and teachers will be represented in big numbers with the social partners. The purpose of the Bill is to have a separate body which will deal clearly with the status of the profession which will be kept separate from matters such as salaries.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 4 to 7.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the functions of the council which are dealt with on one and a half pages of the Bill, the last paragraph of which states that the council shall implement the policies relating to teacher education training, probation qualifications, professional conduct and standards of teaching as established from time to time by the Minister. Consultation and the role of the Teaching Council in drawing on its expertise to advise the Minister in drawing up codes of conduct and ensuring high standards are mentioned at the beginning. This is all left aside, however, where the Bill states that the council shall implement decisions taken by the Minister, about which there is a hint of diktat. This does not reflect the spirit of partnership which underlay the consultation with the various education interests. The paragraph seems to suggest that the autonomy of the council may be overridden at the will of the Minister of the day. While that is not the intention of the Minister, it could happen at some point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area of the Bill will not be conducive to good relations between the council and the Minister. While its various sections outline the role and functions of the council, we could have a situation where the Minister issues a ruling or guidelines which must be accepted without consultation or discussion. This negates many of the preceding positive provisions. For this reason the section <Col N="909" /> should be deleted. The Bill would be better if the amendment was carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am pleased to contribute to the debate. With water and sewerage, electricity is one of the three principal ingredients in the provision of any development, be it industrial, commercial or residential. While water and sewerage problems can be addressed, if major difficulties arise due to lack of generation or, as happens in many cases, poor supply or lack of facilities to provide extra capacity, the capabilities of an area will be confined to minimal development. There is major infrastructural development in the greater Dublin area and along the east coast. If this continues, what effect will it have on rural communities and small towns and villages? Will they suffer because of the need for the ESB to ensure maximum generation along the east coast and the Dublin region?</P>
      <P>If deregulation is introduced, as it has been in other sectors, will prospective developers or investors cherry-pick their projects? While cities and large towns would benefit as a result, it would be to the detriment of other areas, particularly the rural economy. That would be a disaster and unacceptable. It is of vital importance that markers are put down now to ensure rural Ireland is not forgotten in the rush by such investors to make the fast buck.</P>
      <P>We have major problems in many areas due to the poor quality of the national grid. In recent weeks I have received numerous representations from householders in particular areas of my constituency of Kildare South, particularly the Ballinteague area where families have lost power for televisions, computers and washing machines because of the low voltage and poor quality of the grid in the area. I have also received representations from members of the farming community who have had to purchase generators to ensure they can use their milking machines morning and evening when there is maximum demand on the grid. They want a back-up service in order that damage will not be done to the machines they use on their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On new housing estates, particularly single house developments in rural areas, the period of time it now takes the ESB to provide a supply is of major concern. In recent weeks we have experienced problems due to foot and mouth disease, although I accept that the ESB has adhered to the request from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not to proceed with such developments where its employees would have to gain access to ESB supplies by travelling across farm land. Apart from this, there <Col N="912" /> is a general concern in relation to the delays because those who are trying to move into their homes are being held up. I am aware that some local authority housing schemes are being held up due to the board's lack of facilities to connect systems.</P>
    <P>We must develop generating capacity. Where companies have stand-by generation systems, such as the former Irish Sugar Company and others, they could be used if negotiations took place between the companies concerned and the ESB on the possibility of using such systems to provide further capacity on the grid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important and timely debate. Last night my colleague, Deputy Stagg, emphasised the severe disadvantage from which many regions are suffering due to the inability of the national power network to provide electricity for industrial and commercial users. The crisis afflicting the power generation and supply network is copper-fastening the gross investment and employment disparity between the greater Dublin region and the Border, midlands and west region in particular, of which County Westmeath is part. Unless urgent action is taken to overcome the current problems, the unbalanced growth of the past decade will continue unabated and render Government commitments to regional development and spatial planning utterly meaningless as one third of the country currently cannot be supplied with the energy required by high consumption commercial users. Major growth sectors of the economy such as data processing, computer software development and telecommunications companies are, in effect, prohibited from establishing in the areas that need these jobs and investment the most. We should ensure remedial action is taken in order that two thirds of the country will be able to sustain this type of investment in five years' time. That is the challenge facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister, no doubt, bears some responsibility for this state of affairs, I do not want to engage in a political blame game. The Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion draws attention to the ESB's plans to invest £2.1 billion in transmission and distribution networks in the coming five years. Investment of this size is urgently needed, but will the Minister give a guarantee that the projects envisaged will be started and completed on time? Every Member is aware of the major delays encountered by major capital projects. It should be recognised that delays in the planning process are affecting implementation of the relatively modest national development plan. I heard the chairman of the Progressive Democrats, in a recent debate on an RTE radio programme, state that the road projects included in the national development plan would not be completed until at least 2010. That opinion was not denied by Government spokespersons. Will that happen to the electricity network investment outlined by the Minister? In the <Col N="913" /> event of the projected shortages, I understand the ESB is committed to importing further portable plant which will effectively supply more than 100 megawatts of electricity in the winter of 2001. That is an indication of the magnitude of the problem.</P>
    <P>People say that the shortages are due to the non-liberalisation of the market. That is not the reason and people should not lay the problem at the door of the ESB. A question arises at EU level about the rush to liberalise the market. While the Government has tried to introduce competition, the market is not as lucrative as some previously thought and when some try to enter it, what will happen to the rural areas about which Deputy Wall spoke? Will they always rush to the most profitable regions and forget about many rural areas, as was the case with many of the major utilities which were privatised? In our mad rush for liberalisation and privatisation we should not forget those in rural areas.</P>
    <P>While the ESB now operates as a commercial venture, it should be given the authority and freedom to build additional power stations which would ensure any anticipated shortages would be met. As part and parcel of the expenditure on electricity generation, it might be appropriate to exploit and support further investment in the generation of electricity through peat which would have a number of beneficial effects. It would meet any shortages in the medium term, assist Bord na Móna in the midlands where it would help to provide jobs in an area which has suffered more than its fair share of job losses in recent times. One only has to look at Longford and Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Widespread liberalisation is not the answer. We only have to look at the state of electricity generation in California to realise this. As liberalisation has effectively meant that generating companies are pulling out of the market, we must be careful in that regard. At a recent meeting in Stockholm the French Prime Minster did not endorse the speeding up of the liberalisation programme agreed at the Lisbon Summit. We should, therefore, watch this area.</P>
    <P>Let me mention briefly the development of a peat-fired station at Coolnagun in north Westmeath, which is in need of investment. There is a huge reserve of turf in the area. It would provide a number of well paid skilled jobs in an area which is beset with employment difficulties. I hope the Minister considers trying to get extra electricity for the national grid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I commend the Minister for Public Enterprise for overseeing the liberalisation of the electricity market. It is important to note that in the past <Col N="914" /> five years the ESB has connected more than 200,000 new customers. There were more than 50,000 new customers in 2000. This is the highest number of new connections since the heyday of rural electrification. This exceptional level of growth mirrors the growth in the economy generally and confirms the strength of the economic boom in Ireland in recent years.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the exceptional level of growth has begun to impose a significant additional load on the electricity network. To provide a continuing network to international standards, I understand the ESB would have to spend more than £2 billion in the next five years, of which £0.5 billion would be spent on the national grid, which is known as the motorway of the electricity system, and £1.5 billion would be spent on the distribution network which brings electricity into homes, farms and businesses. The record level of investment, together with expenditure on the extension of the country's gas network which was recently announced by the Government, will give the country an updated and renewed energy infrastructure which will see us well into the new century. This expenditure will continue into the second half of the decade and beyond.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about the Cork Harbour pilot project at Aghada and Raheen. I am sure Deputy Stanton will have something to say about that. In January 2001 the ESB board announced it had agreed with the Cobh Anti-pylon Representative Association, CARA, to carry out a joint review of the harbour pylons scheme. The review is currently being conducted under the chairmanship of Mr. Phil Flynn and is examining such issues as the ESB's need to strengthen the network in the harbour area, the impact on health and the environment, the effect on agricultural land and the possibility of an underwater cable system rather than overhead pylons. There is a growing demand for power in the Cork area. It is hoped the review will yield positive results which will be fair and acceptable to all the interests concerned. Lines should be laid underground, where feasible, in the interest of the health and safety of our citizens and of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the people of Cork in their struggle to convince the ESB to lay underground and underwater cables in the Cobh, Aghada and Raheen part of our beautiful harbour and county of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about the risk of electromagnetic fields causing leukaemia in children. The possibility remains that intense and prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields can increase the risk of leukaemia in children. The recently published report by Sir Oliver Doll in the UK on the safety of overhead pylons raises many new questions about the prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency magnetic fields. It suggests there is a small risk of <Col N="915" /> such fields causing leukaemia in children. That is enough to merit a full investigation in this country. I called for such an inquiry at the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The residents of Thorndale and Dublin Hill in my constituency in Cork have serious concerns about overhead lines beside their houses. It was a disastrous decision by Cork County Council to give planning permission to builders to build under such power lines. It is currently compiling statistics on the illnesses which have been contracted in the Dublin Hill and Ballyvolane areas of my constituency. I will fight their case in this House if conclusive proof is found that overhead power lines have caused some of the health problems experienced in this part of Cork.</P>
    <P>The ESB will continue to be a household name in the decades ahead. It is based on a tradition of service to the community. The bulk of its workforce lives in the local communities it serves. The challenge for both the company and its workforce is to maintain that spirit of public service. It workforce must be commended for its level of public service for many generations. The ESB cannot afford to be complacent in this era of competition and globalisation, but it should look forward with confidence. It has a tradition of service and a record of delivery and core skills. However, there is much work still to be done. The investment programme in the networks will provide work for the ESB for many years to come. The key challenge for the ESB is to serve the country as well in the future as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff of the ESB in Cork and throughout the country for answering the call of our people in emergencies both during the day and at night. They do so in hail, rain, snow and frost and during holidays, particularly on Christmas Day. I commend them for going out on bad nights. They are a credit to this country. They are dedicated to the service and I would hate to see it diluted in any way. I hope we can help to strengthen that service because it is second to none and it has proved that throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are Dublin based must try to restore the balance of power back to Dublin. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It gives us an opportunity to salute the ESB and the work it has done over the years and to highlight the inadequacies in the motion tabled by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB has been in existence since 1927. It is a byword in best practice in State enterprise. It led the State companies in terms of initiative and co-ordination. Some of us in Dublin Corporation remember when it generated electricity for the city prior to the establishment of the ESB. However, the ESB has done a tremendous job since the 1930s. I remember my first educational tour was to Ardnacrusha on the River Shannon to see the magnificent engineering project the <Col N="916" /> ESB managed to bring on stream. We were advised that it would be a model for other countries, which was the case. At a time when other companies, such as CIE, were cutting back on initiatives and closing rural lines, the ESB continued its work of rural electrification which transformed the country.</P>
    <P>We all remember the work done under the First Programme for Economic Expansion between 1958 and 1963. The film RTE showed last year as part of its celebration of the millennium highlighted the hard work and diligence of the ESB workers, which continues today. Workers worked on mountain-sides and across farms and boglands to provide an extensive network of electricity across the country. It is astounding to think that 130,000 km of electricity lines were laid. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the ESB diversified into different energy supplies, such as oil, water and gas. The Moneypoint station is also a byword in best practice engineering. The ESB has served the country well.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing unprecedented growth. However, at a time when companies in other utilities are tempted to increase their charges, the ESB has managed to keep its prices low. Electricity costs in Ireland are among the lowest in Europe. There were more than 50,000 new ESB connections in 2000. That is a significant barometer of the growth of the economy. If we have any criticism of the ESB's diligence, it is the amount of disruption its workers must cause when they are putting in new lines and upgrading existing ones. The £2 billion investment in both infrastructure and in the grid over the next number of years will transform the nature of power supply in the country. That record of investment, together with the expenditure on the extension of the country's gas network, will ensure that we will have an energy infrastructure which will take us right into the next century.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have adverted to liberalisation and the implications of EU regulation and globalisation. I believe that the cost and competitiveness review agreement which was hammered out in 1996, has prepared the company very well for the challenges that lie ahead. The exposure of 30% of the Irish electricity market to competition last year and up to a further 40% in 2002, with full market liberalisation in 2005, is certainly going to provide a challenge for the ESB and I have no doubt the ESB can meet that challenge. The rate of growth in the Irish market is among the highest in the OECD. Continued growth, even on a reduced scale, would still put us ahead of all our trading partners. It will provide opportunities for both the ESB and companies wishing to build new power plants.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the contribution made by the ESB and its various consultancy companies to European development. Many of the applicant countries for EU membership have benefited greatly from ESB International and other offshoots of the ESB helping them to prepare for EU membership. I wish to salute the public ser<Col N="917" /> vice record of the ESB and its workers. Its staff has worked in all sorts of weather conditions, often at great personal risk. I wish to compliment the ESB for its support of artistic endeavours such as drama and music festivals. Through my involvement with the VEC, I am aware of the support given to apprenticeship competitions.</P>
    <P>Ballymun is undergoing a multi-million pound regeneration; it will cost the best part of £1billion. I am pleased that the ESB has agreed to use underground cabling in the new Ballymun. At the moment, high tension cables run through the only park in the area and they are very close to houses. Overhead cables are visually obtrusive and I am concerned about them from an environmental and health point of view. I am extremely concerned about the proximity of high tension lines to a new Traveller housing development in my area. Avila Gardens is a fine development but the residents are very concerned about the health implications of living cheek by jowl with high tension cables and massive pylons. There was a debate on &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; last week about the health implications of living beside these installations.</P>
    <P>I wish to commend other modes of energy transformation which have been undertaken. The gas company in co-operation with Wimpey Limited has converted the methane gas in the Dunsink landfill site into the gas grid. I am pleased that one of the first private generating plants in the country is being developed in the Roadstone quarry site in Huntstown. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate and I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the ESB and its workforce and the dynamic management it has produced over the years. It has had great engineers and a great leader in Mr. Paddy Moriarty who was very far-seeing in what he did with the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak from a background of involvement in the private sector. Members opposite would know that I worked as a senior executive with Esat Digifone before I was elected to the Dáil and I still continue to advise that company. People talk in hysterical terms about capacity constraints. Capacity constraints arise in the private sector as much as in the public sector. They are as always unforeseen, unplanned and cannot be planned for. No country such as ours could have planned or foreseen the enormous economic success we have achieved. It is extraordinary that we are recording 8% or 9% year on year growth. With the American slowdown, we are going to see a progressive downscaling from the dizzy heights of 8% and 9% year on year growth. We are now seeing severe capacity constraints in relation to the supply of electricity and our ability to serve the growth in the economy. It is particularly acute, less for Deputy Stanton's constituency than the area Deputy Higgins serves. When it comes to infrastructure, the areas around the Border, the midlands and the western <Col N="918" /> region are particularly disadvantaged, whether it be in the provision of roads, telecommunications infrastructure or electricity.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I asked a senior official from the Minister's Department whether it would be possible to land an Intel style project in Leitrim. It would not be possible to do so. If Deputy Higgins were trying to deliver this for his constituency, it could not be done because the power supply is not available in that region. That is a huge challenge to the cornerstone of our current thinking in terms of regional development.</P>
    <P>I had to come to grips with Deputy Higgins in my previous life with Digifone in relation to the spreading of the mast infrastructure in telecommunications. It is a very tricky and difficult business.</P>

      <P>The meetings were wild and wonderful. We need to look seriously at how we roll out national infrastructure, be it in electricity or telecommunications. I think it is daft to have such a level of public concentration in this area. If you really want the jobs and investment to follow that infrastructure, there must be a centralised system. We had to confront this in relation to the motorways and the roads by creating the National Roads Authority. There is a limited level of consultation but the authority rolls ahead with the infrastructure. That sort of approach must be applied to electricity and telecommunications if we are going to live up to the promise of delivering state of the art infrastructure to the less well off regions of the country. The ESB is a great Irish company, and it is in a position to do just that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has adopted a sensible approach. My aunt is the person in charge of government policy but I think if Deputy Higgins or Deputy Stanton were in government, they would implement much the same thing. There is an element of bipartisanship in this House between the two main parties and, to a lesser extent but more so since Deputy Quinn arrived, the Labour Party which is adapting to the free market and seeing the sense in deregulation. However, with regard to deregulation, the Minister should make haste slowly. I would err on the side of caution. If there is a significant downturn in the next few years, globally or in a European sense, many of the new competitors could quickly disappear and leave us with an unplanned net<Col N="919" /> work of no use or value when the economy picks up again. We need to reinforce what the ESB is doing, add to its capacity and hope the private sector will add to that capacity.</P>
    <P>By upgrading the interconnector between here and Northern Ireland we can add to the pool of capacity available should the economy have another dizzy spell, which I do not expect to happen for another five to ten years. We are in a progressive decline which will see us reaching normal growth levels of 3% to 5% with which other European economies are very satisfied. Mr. Greenspan would, certainly, be satisfied with the lower end of that spectrum.</P>
    <P>We must plan our networks properly. The Minister for Finance should closely examine the tax treatment of wind power generating stations as representatives of the industry argue that it is not as benign as it might be. Some argue that he should go as far as extending BES-style incentives to those who invest in wind power generating stations. We must consider such measures if we are to take infrastructural investment seriously. Taxation purists would not approve of BES-style schemes because they tend to allow those who are very well-off to evade or avoid tax responsibilities. We must consider the matter in the same democratic manner we considered the savings scheme. One could ask whether it is more appropriate for people to put money into a savings or tax-driven system whereby they would invest money for a guaranteed period in infrastructure such as power generation. Perhaps the Minister will turn that issue over in his mind as he approaches his next and, possibly, most successful budget which will lead us into a successful general election.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment to the motion and commend the Minister on her very impressive and able defence of her brief. I acknowledge, too, the great service the ESB has provided for the people since its establishment in 1927. ESB employees often work in very dangerous and difficult conditions and I commend Mr. Ken O'Hara and his staff on their good work. The ESB also provides services in the fisheries area such as stocking lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the difficulties confronting us have been generated by our economic success. We are lucky to be confronting the problems of success rather than failure. The economic growth in recent years has transformed the economy and society. Our prosperity is the undoubted result of the good foundations laid by Fianna Fáil-led Governments back to the groundbreaking <i>Programme for National Recovery </i>in 1987. That programme successfully introduced the partnership model to the management of the economy, a model which continues to excite envy and interest abroad. Nobody foresaw the scale of our success. Our economic boom is currently tempered by the <Col N="920" /> regrettable outbreak of foot and mouth disease which has created some new bottlenecks and imposed new constraints on the economy.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, which involves expenditure of some £40 billion, is partly designed to remove or alleviate many of the problems created by our success. The increased demand for energy supplies of all types has arisen as a result of surging economic activity which has also resulted in increases in personal income and expenditure. It is entirely reasonable that, in circumstances of unforeseen and unprecedented growth, the demand for power supplies would begin to rise to a point at which it could, at peak times, affect the peak capacity of the generating system. The Minister acknowledged this rather obvious point in her contribution last night and stated that there is a need for additional generating capacity.</P>
    <P>Additional capacity is under construction with the ESB Statoil plant in Ringsend and the Huntstown Meridian plant. Other generating stations are at planning stage. Schemes are also being developed to generate power such as wind energy from alternative and renewable sources. I welcome the recent announcement that a Turkish civil engineering company is to participate in the construction of the Meridian plant on a joint venture basis. We must be careful, however, to ensure we will not be visiting these plants as museums in the future. Joint ventures are one means of removing obstacles to infrastructural development arising from the fact that the economy is operating at almost full capacity. The controlled involvement of qualified foreign construction companies is a welcome means of taking heat off the construction industry here. With the removal, via deregulation, of overall responsibility from the ESB to ensure adequate power supplies, the Government has, through the appointment of a commission for electricity regulation, provided a sound and comprehensive framework for the development of industry at a pace which will ensure sufficient capacity is constructed to enable supply to exceed demand in the future by a safe and comfortable margin while adequately providing for the demands of a growing economy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the public-private partnership framework, the national development plan provides for significant investment in the development of transmission and supply throughout the country. Investment of £500 million is scheduled for the national grid in coming years, from which Cork and other areas on the western seaboard will greatly benefit. This investment is part of the NDP, an integrated national programme designed to address the development needs of the category one BMW region. The IDA's regional development plans and the Government's plans will provide a solid infrastructural platform for Ireland's development as a European, and perhaps worldwide, centre for e-commerce. Adequate and reliable power supplies are a prerequisite for integrated development of this nat<Col N="921" /> ure, in addition to improved communications and transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>For development to be successful we must proceed in a planned and balanced fashion. The Government is conscious that its actions must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate industrial and commercial developments which arrive virtually without warning as a result of the ever increasing pace of technological development and the reduction in lead-in times from prototype development to manufacture or operation. There has been much debate about the development of web farms and data hosting centres and the Minister has blown away the inaccuracies trotted out by some members of the Opposition and the media on the nature of power supplies to these companies. She has offered welcome reassurances to those operating or contemplating the development of such centres.</P>
    <P>Power supplies are essential to domestic and inward investment. There is no crisis in power supplies in spite of the futile efforts made to convince us otherwise. We should not involve ourselves in irresponsible scaremongering merely to score cheap political points. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, for tabling this motion. It is timely to examine the issues, especially as we emerge from the peak winter season, when demand was at its highest, and enter summer, when demand will fall off. We witnessed the effects of high demand during winter when the ESB was forced to bring in generators from abroad. There were also a number of close shaves when a power station almost went off-line, which would have caused major problems, and where there was a switching mistake in Cork and major firms such as IFI and Irish Steel shut down automatically. That shows what can happen when things go wrong.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House want to sound warning bells in good time. We want to jump start the Government and put some power into it to get some action. There is a lack of energy in the Government. I am delighted to see the Minister of State present, but she has no support from her colleagues. They have all gone away to be recharged because it took so much energy for them to come here and read out their waffle. We are concerned about the growing demand for power, especially where the technological sector is concerned. We are also concerned about the slow process of deregulation, although we are careful that it should be done properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA is concerned about the position and I know jobs have already been lost in the Cork region. Whatever about the blather of the Mini<Col N="922" /> ster of State and her colleagues, the unmistakable facts were given at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on 5 October last. The ESB told committee members at that meeting that what had been said previously on television about job losses was a fact. Mr. Donnelly, representing the ESB, said:</P>
    <P>At least one industry was looking at the Cork area but because of the significant issues surrounding the future uncertainty of the electricity supply to Cork it backed off the region.</P>
    <P>Our information is that 500 jobs were involved. That is only one of which we know. How many other industries have backed off because of the problems with infrastructure? Mr. Donnelly has said this repeatedly for two years. He said two years ago that the standard of supply in Cork did not meet international requirements and that there were questions about security.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn alluded to a problem in Cork with the proposals of the ESB to set up a transmission system around the harbour. The Government has failed to meet the fears of local people about the system, and I am glad to hear Deputy O'Flynn finally coming around to what we have been saying for a number of years. People are scared and the Government has not allayed their fears. Every time I raised this issue in the House the Minister said it was not a matter for her but for the ESB. The Government should commission a study into the risks, real or imagined, associated with electromagnetic radiation.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister of State's attention to research carried out by a Professor Henshaw in Britain which was criticised by Sir Richard Doll of the imperial cancer research fund unit in Oxford. However, an advisory group on non-ionising radiation headed by Sir Richard Doll, which conducted a recent study into electromagnetic fields and the risk of cancer as part of its report, said:</P>
    <P>There is, however, some evidence that prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency and magnetic fields is associated with a small risk of leukaemia in children.</P>
    <P>It went on to say:</P>
    <P>Unless, however, further research indicates that the finding is due to chance or some unrecognised possibility, the possibility remains that intense and prolonged exposure to magnetic fields can increase the risk of leukaemia in children.</P>
    <P>This scares people and, when they hear about it, it is only to be expected and understood that they would protest strongly against high voltage transmission lines.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Flynn said, there is an alternative available in the Cork region in that the power lines can be put underground. However, the management of the ESB has consistently resisted this measure for a long time. It is not feasible to proceed with the overground route in Cork. Other <Col N="923" /> Members on both sides have said there are questions over the transmission of electricity because of the resistance of local people. If this is delaying the implementation of infrastructure and it is not feasible to proceed with overhead power lines, the Government should investigate the possibility of going underground because it may be the only feasible way of bringing power to where it is needed. I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on those issues and I ask him to respond to them. Is he aware of Sir Richard Doll's most recent findings and what is his opinion of them?</P>
    <P>When the grid was first erected in Ireland, people did not object to it because they did not know any better. Europe is ahead of us in that its grid was established 30 to 40 years ago. The Government should get its act together. I would like to see it put more effort into combined heat and power plants. They are more efficient and the gas can be brought to where it is needed and used. I am delighted to hear the ESB will construct a wind farm at Moneypoint. That is welcome. I commend ESB workers who, over the past few winters, had to prop up a grid which is not up to standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I also compliment ESB workers who have built a tradition of excellence and dedication to duty and who have shown bravery and courage in extreme weather conditions over a number of winters. The appointment of the regulator of competition in this area has brought about a new era for the ESB. It presents it with an enormous challenge and opportunity. An investment of £2.1 billion over the next five years, a growth of 6% in use and more than 56,000 new connections last year for consumers speak for themselves. The old ESB is no more and it has entered a new era of the challenge of competition.</P>
      <P>We have had many arguments about the endless network of pylons throughout the nation which, although they are unsightly and unwanted, are necessary in terms of the transmission of power. When World Trade Organisation talks were held in Singapore, the major question the Chinese asked was whether it was possible to transmit power without power lines. I am not sure it is, but I agree that the combined heat and power process for major plants should be examined in depth by the Government. It does away with the need for pylons and provides a stable power supply through the gas field. A major plant employing 1,000 people could supply enough energy and electricity not only for its own plant to provide certainty of supply but for the town nearby. That is something which should be examined.</P>

    <P>In the context of the provision of transmission lines, the Government should form a public private partnership with a major contracting firm of world class standards to ensure the national plan, in so far as this and other areas are con<Col N="924" /> cerned, is implemented on time, to cost and under budget. It is being implemented in a very amateur fashion at present.</P>
    <P>I notice from the ESB's <i>Electric Mail</i> newsletter for last month that the company intends to provide broadband communications through power lines. It mentioned a number of areas where it intends to provide these lines. The one county it did not mention was County Mayo, which is at the western end of the Border, Midlands and West region. If the Government policy of equalisation of advantage is to be implemented, that area should be included.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I hope the Minister will consider the issues raised. The Minister attended a meeting with the north Mayo delegation on 4 October 2000 at which the question of a replacement for Bellacorrick peat power station was raised. The ESB is not eligible to build a gas fired station there, but a 200 MW or larger gas fired station should be built in that location by a private contractor or under a public private arrangement. This station is necessary to provide an energy source for the north Mayo district.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the work done by the ESB staff and management over the years in identifying and responding to needs when required. In common with other Members, over the past three years I have tabled a series of questions about the ability of the national grid to meet requirements. I had no difficulty getting replies when the answer was positive, but, amazingly, in the past year the response has changed to the statement that the Minister has no responsibility to the House for the matter. This is not a reflection on the Chair, but it appears that when the answer was positive, there was no difficulty replying to questions in the House. However, when the answer became negative, I was told that the Minister had no responsibility for the matter. This is extremely bad for democracy and accountability. It means that State and semi-State companies are not aware of what Members of the House feel about a particular matter.</P>
      <P>In common with other Members, I did not have any data or statistics other than the increase in population and the increased demand for electricity from the various industrial enterprises that have developed in the past five or six years. One does not need to be a mathematician to work out that there had to be a serious drawdown of electricity and that the national grid needed to be replenished. However, this did not happen as readily as one might have expected. The result is that in my constituency, and other areas, there are continual black-outs and a danger of overloading. We were lucky this winter. Although there was plenty of frost, we did not have prolonged snowfalls. If there had been snow for two or three weeks, there would have been serious breakdowns and a serious energy crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major aspects of planning any enterprise is the ability to identify issues before <Col N="925" /> they become crises. The Department should have identified this problem, but it has been passed on to the regulator or some other body which is not responsible to the House. This is not right. The Department should have responsibility for identifying the full extent of an issue long before it becomes a crisis. A crisis is approaching and it will be much more serious next winter unless the matter is addressed. The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, identify the most expeditious means of ensuring a dramatic improvement in supply to the national grid.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for sharing his time and I support the motion. It is regrettable that the Minister in her contribution ignored the potential in Ireland for increasing the amount of energy from renewable resources, particularly wind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the issue was considered in hindsight. It is ironic that the Minister of State will address that aspect given that the ESB today announced a £15 million investment plan for a wind farm at Moneypoint. If we are serious about generating additional supplies, the way forward is wind energy.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government recognises the capacity of landowners, particularly in the BMW region and along the west coast where most of the existing wind farms are located. In its last budget, the Government failed to provide any incentives to encourage farmers and communities along the west coast to develop wind energy facilities. If wind energy were tapped, imports would be reduced and it would enable Ireland to comply with European legislation that requires a reduction in our dependence on imported fossil fuels. It would also enable the country to honour its commitments under the Kyoto protocol regarding a reduction in our use of fossil fuels which create greenhouse gases and damage the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government provides grants for feasibility studies on the potential of wind farms along the west coast. They would require huge investment, but people are seeking alternative uses for land. They could come together, pool their resources and generate electricity. However, the Government has not responded. I ask the Minister to introduce a package of finance and grants for those people. If the rental income from forestry projects is tax free, there is no reason that a similar incentive cannot be given to people who lease their land for the production of electricity. This would be a welcome and meaningful response to the efforts of the individuals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should insist that the ESB change its attitude to people who want access to the national grid. Heretofore, the company placed every obstacle possible in the way of easy access to the grid. It is important that this attitude is <Col N="926" /> changed and this may happen now that the company is becoming involved in wind farms.</P>
    <P>There are three major infrastructural developments in my county, the new N6 road, the gas line and the new huge ESB power line. These are located within a mile of each other and run in the same direction. A Government Department should take responsibility for co-ordinating such services in areas to avoid causing disruption to farming communities throughout the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I wish to outline the situation in my constituency. I concur with the compliments to the staff of the ESB, especially those on the ground. We are not aware of much of the work they do, particularly following storms. The last ESB person who worked in my house told me he had worked for two and a half days without sleep because of the serious shortage of staff. Is the Minister aware of the serious lack of staff in the ESB to carry out daily duties?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people who built a new housing estate comprising up to 20 houses and who made an application last November are still waiting for a quote for connection? Houses have been built and sold, but people must wait a further two months before they can move into their homes. Is the Government aware that this is happening in my village in County Meath and on every site with which I have contact? People are waiting for electricity, but no staff are available to carry out the work. There is not even someone to draw up a quotation and there is currently less and less supply across the board. What is the Government doing to ensure an adequate supply for the extra numbers of people and houses in the country? People who have built their own homes in parts of my constituency have been told it will be ten or 12 weeks before they can receive an electricity supply. A number of people who are paying mortgages, many of whom are still living in mobile homes or rented accommodation, cannot move into their homes because the only supplier of electricity, which has a monopoly across the board, is telling them they will have to wait ten or 12 weeks for a supply because it cannot carry out the work.</P>
      <P>This is a serious problem for people moving into new homes throughout the country. I know of 20 people who wanted the electricity supply to be connected before Christmas. These people had to wait until the middle of January to be connected. It is not acceptable in this day and age, given the progress of recent years, that the main supplier of one of the most important services cannot carry out the work required. In 2001 the situation has got worse rather than better. I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of my points and talk to the ESB about this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Just this week the Chairman of Connacht Gold, <Col N="927" /> Mr. Michael Farrell, highlighted power shortage as a huge obstacle to Sligo's progress. Everyone in Sligo agrees with this point of view. A high quality electricity supply with consistently stable voltage and frequency is an essential requirement for the operation of most industries. Where such a supply is not available, firms have no option but to locate elsewhere. That is the situation in Sligo.</P>
    <P>In this country, there are regions with 275-400 kv and 200 kv while areas all around the west have just 110 kv. It is crucial that at least 220 kv supply is available, particularly in the north west region. In light of the Corrib gas find, which has now proved to be commercial, consideration should be given to the possibility of constructing an electricity power station of substantial capacity in the region. A strong grid is a prerequisite for development. It enables flexibility in the location of new loads and of new generating capacity. It also copes with the changing location of industry as technology changes. The time required to plan and construct a grid runs to a considerable number of years. This is proving to be a constraint on the location. The development of wind farms in the region and the fact that there is no grid to take that capacity is of concern.</P>
    <P>The former chief executive of the IDA, Mr. White, said recently that there was a failure to put the different pieces of infrastructure in place in the regions. The study found that up to 2003 a total of 6,271 graduates will come from the north-west. The best of our talent is leaving due to the fact that new industry is not being provided. He also stated that practically every IDA itinerary in recent years included Sligo, but no company had yet set up there. The town has not yet achieved a critical breakthrough in terms of high tech industries. I must give credit to the engineering and health care companies on which Sligo has relied since the 1970s and 1980s. This was despite unprecedented growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the ESB's transmission network, the north-west and the western seaboard has certainly suffered. There is a need for greater capacity in these areas. The Castlebar, Athlone, Letterkenny and Sligo areas are depending on 110 kv. That is the main concern of people who wish to set up new companies in the region. It is important for the Minister of State to take on board what the chief executive of one of the biggest companies in the region has said publicly. Sligo has been identified as one of the future growth centres in the country and it is important that the region is provided with the basic infrastructure. The growth of the region is the responsibility of Government.</P>
    <P>Mr. Niall Murray of Collins McNicholas, which is a very important company, said there were no job opportunities for IT graduates within a 30 mile radius of Sligo. That is mainly due to a lack of high tech industries in the region. The reason for this is that Belfast, Derry, Dublin and Limerick are on 275-400 kv., Carlow, Cork, Dundalk, Galway and Waterford are on 220 kv and <Col N="928" /> Athlone, Castlebar, Coleraine, Letterkenny, Sligo and Tralee are on 110 kv. It is imperative to have a time frame for at least the 220 kv supply. There has been a great deal of controversy about the erection of pylons from Flagford to Sligo.</P>
    <P>We must now look at the Corrib field which is the way forward. A gas fired generator could be developed which would more than adequately supply the region. I attended a meeting recently with the Minister of State when he indicated there would be a link into Sligo in the future. I ask him to consider providing a gas powered generator in Sligo. This would solve a huge number of problems and spare the landscape from the blight of these pylons. It would make the gas connection to Sligo more viable and ensure its success. I hope the Minister of State will take on board my proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>This debate is very timely as it raises an issue which many people take for granted, that is, the reliable and efficient supply of electricity. It will come as a surprise to most people that we have reached such a critical stage, given the generation and transmission capacities of the ESB. Clearly the shortfall in supply is already having an economic impact. If this is not rectified, the consequences could be very serious. It seems we are unable to properly service existing IT industries and the inadequate service is becoming a deterrent to future investment.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing a Border constituency, I view this with grave concern. If the Dublin region, where the mass of new industry is located, is experiencing this problem, what hope is there for the Border, midlands and western regions in attracting new job creating investment, which we need so badly. The neglect of successive Governments has meant that we are already at a disadvantage in terms of infrastructure, including electricity supply. If we come to crisis point in electricity supply, our region, before others, will be plunged into darkness.</P>
      <P>I reject the notion that the panacea for the energy supply problem is privatisation of the ESB. On this I differ greatly from some of the earlier speakers. The Minister for Public Enterprise signalled that privatisation and complete deregulation of the electricity supply industry should be in force by 2005. I oppose the privatisation of the ESB. Tribute should be paid to the ESB and all its workers who, over the years, built up our vital energy infrastructure for the benefit of all the people. This is a strategic sector which should remain in public hands and should be given all the support necessary to ensure it provides the best and most efficient service. We have all admired the public spiritedness of ESB workers who risked life and limb in dangerous weather conditions to ensure that service was restored to citizens in all parts of the country, including isolated rural areas. They have given service in other countries also in times of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> When we look at the pathetically small proportion of our power supply which comes from wind energy, we can see another failure of policy on the part of successive Governments. That said, I welcome today's announcement by the ESB of the decision to invest more than £50 million in a new wind farm development adjacent to the Moneypoint station in County Clare. It is incredible that in a country which is buffeted by Atlantic winds the whole year round we have not harnessed this natural and clean resource before now. Instead the Government and some members of other parties prefer to see waste incinerators built. These incinerators are bad in terms of waste management, the environment and health. These plants have been described as waste-to-energy but the corollary is that we will be dependent on the continuing production of waste at current and even expanded levels to produce energy. We have heard little in the debate about energy conservation. A major part of the solution to the emerging power supply problems is a concerted campaign to reduce the wasteful use of electricity where feasible.</P>
    <P>On a note of mirth &ndash; I do not often get this chance &ndash; there is no electricity in the lift system in block 2000. The Ceann Comhairle may need to give Members extra time to get here for the vote. Will the Minister have it fixed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on energy. It was a useful debate on this important and critical topic and the contributions were robust. I wish to address a number of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the situation in California, which is entirely different from that in Ireland. No major new power plants have been built in California for many years while the reverse is true in our case. The new ESB plant at Poolbeg has been operational for more than two years. This was followed in December 2000 by the IVO peat plant at Edenderry. Foot and mouth precautions permitting, the upgraded electricity interconnector with Northern Ireland will kick in towards the end of the year. The ESB-Statoil plant at Ringsend is on track for commissioning in February of next year to be followed in June by the Viridian plant at Huntstown. All of these developments represent a steady stream of new additions to our power supply and do not take account of other planned projects such as major wind farm developments in the pipeline and other gas fired plants being planned by developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stagg said that the Ringsend and Huntstown plants were not scheduled to come on stream until 2003. I can categorically confirm, having checked with the companies today, that both plants will come on stream in 2002 as scheduled &ndash; the Ringsend plant in February 2002 and the Viridian plant in June 2002. My Department has received letters today from both companies <Col N="930" /> which put this matter beyond doubt and I can make these available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The power supply for data hosting centres, also known as web farms, was covered at some length in the debate. The Minister dealt with this issue last night and it has been checked again today with the ESB and EirGrid. I can confirm the information the Minister gave to the House that no data hosting centre has opted for an interruptible supply arrangement and the ESB, in collaboration with the development agencies, is responding positively to all requests for power.</P>
    <P>While the power requirements of web farms are significant, both the ESB and EirGrid have categorically assured the Minister that at no time has an existing data hosting centre been requested by the ESB to switch off its systems due to inadequate power supply. This has been confirmed by both companies again today. The ESB has succeeded in connecting all those enterprises which had been in a position to receive a supply. It is understood from the ESB that a small number of interruptions to supply have occurred but in each case these were the result of damage to underground cables caused by construction works unrelated to the ESB.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the BMW region. The House will be aware that the infrastructure needs of the BMW region are being addressed in a major way in the national development plan. From an energy perspective, a large proportion of the extension to the domestic gas network, which I recently announced, will take place in the BMW region. The infrastructure developments planned by the ESB and Eirgrid will also include a number of significant projects in the BMW region. These developments will give the BMW region a significantly enhanced energy infrastructure within five years and will place the region in a much better position to compete for investment.</P>
    <P>The question of renewable energy, including wind farms, was raised during the debate. As Minister of State with particular responsibility for that area I wish to respond to this point. The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, gives special recognition to renewable energy where it liberalised the entire market for electricity generated from renewable energy sources. I continue to promote the increased use of renewable and alternative sources of energy as a priority. In September 1999 I published a Green Paper on sustainable energy which sets a course for the further development of our renewable energy resources and a more focused approach to the adoption of energy efficiency measures over the next five years.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper I set a revised target of 500 megawatts of additional renewable energy based generating capacity, the majority of which will be in the wind energy sector. This revised target will, in effect, double the contribution that renewables make to meeting our electricity needs over the next five years. As it stands, more than 5% of electricity consumption is based on renewables. My aim is to increase this figure to 12% by 2005.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The last four years have been ones of intense activity in the energy area. Some of the key milestones include the CCR process, the opening of the market to competition last year, the tripartite agreement of February 2000 which set out the framework for the future of the electricity sector, the building of the new IVO peat station in Edenderry &ndash; the first independent power plant to come on stream, the passage of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, the establishment of the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation, the setting up of the national grid part of the ESB as a separate independent company now known as Eirgrid, the joint decision by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and Sir Reg Empey to upgrade the main North-South electricity interconnector, which is currently in progress and the announcement last year that the electricity market will open fully to competition in 2005. The foregoing represent the most sustained series of decisions and activity since the days of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and I as Minister of State have continued the work of the previous Government with vigour and commitment. The milestones I set out above stand as solid testament to that commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Enright, Cosgrave, Healy and Higgins.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on tabling this appropriate motion on a serious problem, particularly in County Mayo. Every week since Christmas the electricity supply in north Mayo has been cut for one day. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the problem caused by the wind. While the wind and storms may cut the electricity supply in some areas, it only takes a rush of midges for the supply in north Mayo to be cut. I ask the Minister to ensure that the ESB restores the power lines. New lines are needed in Glenamoy but nothing has been done. Why should the people of County Mayo have to put up with this kind of service when they pay the same charges as everyone else?</P>
      <P>It is hoped that a natural gas supply will be brought ashore in the county in the near future. I hope there is a new gas power station in Bellacorick so that there is sufficient electricity supply for County Mayo and the rest of the country, if needed. The first item on the Government's agenda should be to build this power station. The station in Bellacorick will be closed in a few years, with a large number of job losses. This would help in a small way to hold some of the workforce in the area.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Higgins referred to equipment imported by the ESB from America. The way this equipment, paid for by taxpayers, was abused and not used will give rise to another scandal. Some of this equipment was not used, while more of it was not used to its full capacity. There will be an investigation into this matter in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> It is important that the necessary infrastructure is put in place in County Mayo. We promote County Mayo and the west in an effort to attract jobs. The IDA and State agencies tell us they cannot get American companies to invest in the west because the necessary infrastructure is not in place. We need proper roads and an electricity supply. We have no commitment from the Government in relation to jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins and the other Fine Gael Deputies on tabling this important amendment. I would be totally against any move by the Government to privatise the ESB or to sell it to a private company or outside bidders. We must have a say in the control, production and management of our power supplies. A large private company could come in from anywhere and buy a large segment of our electricity production but we should remember that such companies come not because they like us but to make as much profit as they can. Such a company would find out rapidly that we are a very small market and they would not be prepared to provide a service in uneconomic areas such as the BMW region. They would pull out then or withdraw and we would have to try to get somebody else in or depend on an outside body. The ESB has been a great company and we always had control in the management, production and control of our power supply and our energy. We should do all we can to retain that.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke guaranteed enough energy and electricity supply for next winter. There were 12 to 14 amber alerts and about five red alerts last winter and the ESB was terrified there would be a shutdown. Those alerts occurred at peak hours and the city of Dublin was on red alert on a number of occasions. In regard to Shannonbridge and Rhode and the stations across Laois and Offaly it is essential that the Minister proceed as fast as possible with development of the bogs as a source of energy. There is some level of progress in Shannonbridge and I urge to Minister to continue to develop our bogs as a resource for electricity generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this motion and congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins for bringing it before the House. The failure of this Government to address the adequacy and reliability of the supply of electricity is a cause of frustration to urban dwellers in the Dublin area. It is a national problem which will have long-term effects on the economic well-being of the State. Every sector is affected by the failure to upgrade the infrastructure which is required in the distribution of electricity and it is a threat to the long-term well-being of the State. Within less than a 20 miles radius of this House continuous supply interruption occurs due to the lack of infrastructure. The economic investment to provide employment in North Dublin is under direct threat due to the lack of adequate power supply while every existing business holds its breath <Col N="933" /> waiting for a blackout or a power surge. One recent power surge was in the Kilbarrack area and I compliment the ESB staff for their handling of that. A great deal of damage was done to household equipment but the staff ensured that proper replacement and compensation was made to the households.</P>
      <P>The Government lack of action in planning the provision of adequate supply or distribution is just one of its disgraces. The Government expends effort encouraging people back into the work force and talks of the need for the work force to expand through the introduction of external labour but it has not made any provision to deliver the electricity to power the economy in the years ahead. We learn with dismay that an American plant is going home. The IDA speaks openly of its fears of the threat posed to its efforts to attract investment to Ireland by the energy deficit. Its job is made more and more difficult by the failures of the present administration which seems not to have the capacity to manage the economic needs of the nation. Management is about shaping the future while supervision is about implementation of policy procrastination. The ESB has warned of the danger for some years and the national strategic planners have highlighted the problem. Without a policy to sort out the lack of supply it will start to slip behind. The size of the work force or how good it is will not matter if the proper electricity supply is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a totally inadequate transmission and distribution network in south Tipperary. A high quality electricity supply with consistently stable voltage and frequency is an essential requirement for the operation of most industries. Where such a supply is not available firms have no option but to locate elsewhere. In south Tipperary we are at a significant disadvantage in the location of industry because of the bad electricity infrastructure. The Tánaiste told us in the Forfás enterprise 2010 report that effective access to a 220 kv power supply is now a basic requirement for sustained enterprise development. We have no area in the county supplied by a 220 kv supply. The towns of Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary and all of west Tipperary do not even have a 110 kv supply. Those areas have been at a significant disadvantage in job creation. We in south Tipperary urgently need job creation investment and jobs. The areas I have mentioned have large scale unemployment. There is twice the level of unemployment in south Tipperary compared to Kilkenny and 50% more compared to our countymen in north Tipperary. Urgent job creation measures are obviously needed and I urge the Minister to ensure that at least 110 kv supply is made available throughout the county. The west Tipperary area has suffered huge loss in population since 1986, down 8.4%. Fifteen hundred people travel to work outside the area every day, some up to 50 miles. I urge the Minister to <Col N="934" /> ensure at least a 110 kv electricity supply throughout south Tipperary in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The amendment brought forward by Deputy O'Rourke to the Fine Gael motion on the electricity process is grossly inaccurate and misleading. The amendment notes that the amount of generating capacity available continues to exceed the level of peak demand. It also notes that all demands for power supply have been met and that neither the general public nor the industry have suffered any interruptions or shortages apart from interruptions caused by normal maintenance and repair work, localised storm damage and builders digging up cables. That is blatantly untrue. As Deputy Enright said we have had amber alerts, red alerts, power cuts and power shortages. Industries have had to cease production. Enterprises have had to install their own generators. Computer material has been lost and computers damaged because of power surges. It is the same story with TV sets, washing machines and medical equipment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's advice to the House yesterday flies in the face of the confidential DKM report compiled for and presented to her Department. It warns of unplanned outages, of economic consequences for the future, because of the failure to invest in generation and transmission. It warns that there would be a flight of digital capital to economies where power supply is guaranteed. I now demand that the Minister and the Government publish the DKM report in full.</P>
      <P>I thank everybody who contributed to the debate, in particular the Labour Party for its support. The Green Party suggested that the motion has too narrow a focus. I agree the focus is narrow, but that was deliberate in order to focus on the real short-term issue which is that we have a major power crisis on our hands which needs urgent action. We fully support green energy alternative power concepts but that is a debate for another day. Last night eight Deputies contributed to the debate and 13 tonight and six were Government Members. That highlights the gravity of the situation. They all have tales to tell of power crises in their own constituencies and that is the prevailing situation throughout the country. We have had many pious aspirations about balanced regional development, a more equitable distribution of jobs, the BMW region and Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is farcical. The ESB admits and the IDA acknowledges that no industry of any consequence can locate west of a line from Galway to Cavan because the power is not available. That is an absolute scandal. Why has this happened? It has happened in the past four years because there was not any planning, vision, cohesion or co-ordination of policy. We welcome the two plants under construction at Ringsend and Viridian. These will come on stream in the next two or three years but will not provide the necessary secure margins to ensure there are no <Col N="935" /> blackouts. Effectively we are running hard to stand still.</P>
    <P>The Erris area of County Mayo is one of the most remote and beautiful but neglected regions of the country. It could supply the entire energy needs of the Border, midlands and western region. It has thousands of acres of the finest bog and yet its power station in Bellacorick is to close in 2004 with the loss of 95 permanent jobs, 120 part-time jobs and 80 associated jobs. </P>
    <P>It is obvious that privatisation and deregulation are not working. It is not delivering the electricity and energy needs of the economy. The liberalisation of the market with the opening up of 28% <Col N="936" /> of the electricity industry from February 2000 has not had the positive effect anticipated. The constant challenges to the directives of the Commission for Electricity Regulation have delayed and frustrated progress. It is ridiculous that EirGrid, the independent State owned company and the transmission system operator, simply manages the grid while the monopoly producer, the ESB, still owns and maintains the system.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government acts immediately along the lines recommended by the Fine Gael motion, the worst predictions of the DTM report will be realised. Unless action is taken there will be another California here. We are calling for action, immediate action, before the lights go out.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy Shortall).</P>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): My intention in this section is simply to lay out a structure for the operation of the council. It will continue to be a responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science to set out general policy for the effective administration of the education system of which the components of probation teacher education and qualifications, and standards of teaching are of paramount importance. Within the context of such broad policies, the teaching council will be given specific tasks such as details of the code of conduct or the procedures for probation. It is of course not possible for the Minister to carry out these tasks without regard to the council. Equally, it is not appropriate for the council to have no regard to overall Government policies when it is carrying out its duties. This framework allows for a balancing of the roles and responsibilities of both parties to allow for a harmonious and coherent relationship. Accordingly, it is my view that the current draft of the Bill should be retained.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 21, after &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(2 of whom shall be nominated by the Irish Primary Principals Network)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the Irish Primary Principals' Network would have a nominating right for two members in the 11 places reserved on the teaching council for primary school representatives. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State said he did not want to be prescriptive in terms of the membership. He said it was possible for the principals to secure two of the 11 places which had been set aside for the primary sector. We rehashed this argument but, regrettably, the Minister did not see fit to change his mind, on Committee Stage at least. Principals and vice-principals bring a wealth of experience of the primary school system but they also bring a different perspective. In many respects, they are seen as managers or employers of the remaining staff whose immediate bosses they are. That perspective would be valuable on the council. If the Minister does not change his mind it is likely that 11 primary teachers will be elected to fill the slots. In addition, although it is impossible to be certain, it is quite likely that the principals and vice-principals will not be heard on the council. That would be regrettable so I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 13 and 14. I wish to speak to my own amendment No. 15, but the aims of all three amendments are the same. Earlier in the debate we discussed with the Minister the consultation that took place with various partners and the report by the steering committee. It is important to bear in mind that when that consultation took place neither of the principals' groups at primary or post-primary level was organised. The IPPN and the NAPD did not exist at that stage. We have all had contact, including correspondence and submissions, <Col N="939" /> with both groups. In fact, representatives of the NAPD recently addressed the Committee on Education and Science. We were all extremely impressed by the fledgling organisation's professionalism.</P>
      <P>Many people wondered why we had not heard from principals as a distinct body in the past. It is an idea whose time has certainly come. It is surprising that up to very recently principals were not organised on that basis. There is no doubt that principals have a distinct and particular role within the education system. The vast majority of them are members of the teacher unions but given the nature of our education system, principals are in an unusual in-between position, being neither staff nor management. They have a very different role to play and a different contribution to make to that of ordinary staff teachers. That role has been built upon and enhanced with the formation of their respective organisations at primary and secondary levels. In particular, the second level NAPD group has made enormous progress over the past year. Its submissions to our committee have been invaluable in examining education, particularly in respect of current difficulties within the post-primary sector.</P>
      <P>The NAPD has been to the fore in raising issues which everyone now agrees need to be addressed by way of the commission on teaching. It has already made a submission for that proposed body. The NAPD has a significant contribution to make as an important voice within the education system. For that reason it is essential that principals should be represented on the teaching council. They have a specific and clear role concerning the recruitment and induction of new teachers, staff development and the preparation of school plans.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons morale among teachers is low at the moment, but a significant factor is the extent to which a school is well managed. Most of the management work is done by the principals. We have not managed to transfer modern principles of staff development, management training and other techniques &ndash; which have now been accepted within public administration generally and certainly within the private sector &ndash; into our schools. We need to devote much more attention to this area in future and hopefully it will be considered by the commission on teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School principals have a key role in setting and maintaining high standards of professional development and conduct. It will be essential to hear the voice of principals within the teaching council. I fully support the points made by Deputy Creed about primary school principals. When we discussed the Bill initially I was not even aware of the existence of the IPPN. It is now rapidly becoming organised, however, and to judge by some of its recent publications, the organisation is displaying the same type of expertise and professionalism which the secondary school principals' group has shown to date. <Col N="940" /> There is a very important role for principals to play at both levels.</P>
    <P>We must also learn a lesson from the experience in Scotland where a teaching council was established without any provision for principals. When the Scottish council had been in existence for some time, that gap in representation was recognised and the legislation had to be amended to provide for school principals to be represented. I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of the development of the teaching profession, to provide a central role for school principals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. At a time when we expect partnership in education, it is unthinkable that we would establish a council involving the various partners in education and omit to involve or ignore the representatives of school principals and deputy school principals. Management, teachers, parents and the Department will be represented on the council and I do not know whether it was intentional that school principals and deputy school principals should be omitted. The Minister should reconsider the position and ensure they are included.</P>
      <P>School principals and deputy school principals are responsible for the day to day operation of schools and the buck stops with them. For that reason, it is unbelievable that they will not be represented on the council.  The nature of the council's business will necessitate their presence and contribution. They must be involved in the work or inquiries in which the council will be engaged. They must be requested to supply some of the information that will be required. They must be included if the council is to be all-embracing. I do not understand why they cannot be accommodated and it is unbelievable that they are being left out. They play a pivotal role in the management of schools and in conducting any inquiries which might arise.</P>
      <P>School principals and deputy school principals want to be represented on the teaching council. The council may not function to full capacity because of their omission. I accept that teachers were omitted from certain bodies in the past. However, it is unbelievable that the Minister and whoever was responsible for deciding on the membership of the council took the option of omitting school principals and deputy school principals. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and include them on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Burke's closing remarks, I point out that school principals served on both the steering committee and the technical working group, which were responsible for drawing up this plan of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The unions, teachers and school principals were all represented, in different <Col N="941" /> capacities, on those bodies. The membership of the teaching council outlined in the Bill exactly reflects the proposals put forward by the steering committee. By and large, when drafting the Bill we went along the lines proposed by that committee. The steering committee sought to achieve a formula that would allow for a balance between teachers and lay people, include the teacher education institutions and the other partners such as school managers and parents and take account of the public interest. In undertaking this task, it relied heavily on the report of the technical working group which included among its members noted educational experts. Nevertheless, we should not understate the difficulty of this task. It is a tribute to the committee, particularly its chairman, Dr. Seamus McGuinness, that it was able to arrive at such an agreed formula.</P>
      <P>Deputies will realise that I am, accordingly, reluctant to revisit such a formula. This formula is appropriate. I accept, however, that school principals are an important segment of the teaching profession. Their proven expertise and experience in the key areas of the teaching profession, such as induction and probation, makes it likely that the profession as a whole will choose to ensure that they are represented on the council, either through nomination by a teacher union or direct election by the body of teachers. However, I would prefer to leave this choice to the members of the teaching profession in order that they can judge for themselves who should be their representative on the teaching council. Should the council require the advice of any particular group in its consideration of any of its functions, it can seek it under section 53 which provides that it may make arrangements with other persons to assist it in carrying out its work. I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is disappointing. On one hand he seems to imply that school principals have a legitimate voice which should be heard while, on the other, he is closing the door on the manner in which they can secure representation on the teaching council. We rehearsed this argument at length on Committee Stage and I had hoped there might have been a change of heart in the Department in the interim. However, it is obvious the Minister is not amen<Col N="942" /> able to these proposals. I intend to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed by the Minister's reply because Deputy Creed and I made a strong case both on Committee Stage and here this evening. I am aware that this case has been put to the Minister or his officials by both of the organisations involved. The case stands on its merits. School principals have a key role to play in the education system and it is vital that they be represented on the teaching council. They were not represented, <i>per se</i>, on the steering group because, as already stated, their respective organisations were not in existence. The Minister should bear in mind the developments that have occurred since the initial consultations took place and ensure that they are represented.</P>
      <P>Ideally, I would have liked to see the numbers increased, namely, that we would have retained the 11 teachers at both levels and, in addition, appointed two school principals. The Opposition, because of Standing Orders, could not propose the appointment of additional members. However, the Minister could have done so. He could have retained both sets of 11 teachers, as agreed. In the absence of that, it would have been a fair compromise if two places on each panel could have been set aside for school principals. This is a missed opportunity and we have no choice but to press the amendments to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputies that it is a balanced formula arrived at with great difficulty, by teachers, their union representatives, parents' groups and other relevant bodies to which they could adhere and subscribe. I am not prepared to upset that balance because, to do so, I would have to consult with everyone concerned. Teachers will be well represented on the council, as, I believe, will school principals.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall ensure that at least 40 per cent of members shall be men and that at least 40 per cent of members shall be women&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We dealt with this amendment at some length on Committee Stage. The Bill makes reference to appropriate gender balance and I would urge the Minister to consider specifying that. The standard policy now is to aim for at least a 40% male and a 40% female representation on all boards. It is important to make a statement in this legislation and ensure that those proportions are achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought clarification from a draftsman. The purpose of the register on the one hand is to serve as a clear indicator by the profession to the public, of the membership of the profession, and their qualifications to teach to high and consistent standards. On the other hand, the members of the profession are entitled to some privacy in respect of certain details contained on the register. For example, it may be important for the council to know the date of birth of any given teacher but not necessary for such a fact to be known to the public. My legal advice is that the question is essentially one for the council and is addressed in section 29(6)(<i>a</i>). As the guarantors of the standards of the profession, it is their duty to provide sufficient information to the public to make that guarantee meaningful. At the same time they also have a responsibility to protect the purely personal information on the teacher.</P>

      <P>This is a related point to one which was made at the very outset about people who are at present employed in a teaching capacity but who may not be <i>per se</i> qualified teachers. I am talking about an amnesty. The point was made repeatedly on Committee Stage that there is a danger that some people may find themselves with the rug pulled from under them, in the most disadvantaged interpretation of the contents, and they could find themselves out of a job. That is the reason for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I note the points the Deputy has made but, in my view, this subsection is an important bedrock for the council, ensuring the maintenance of high quality standards in the teaching profession. The nature of the profession in which teachers act <i>in loco parentis</i> and, to an extent, as a form of moral standard for the pupils in their care makes it imperative that, where a teacher substantially and consistently departs from such a standard, the council should be in a position to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions. I outlined the example earlier of teachers being convicted of serious criminal offences such as drugs related offences which would not have a direct relationship to the teaching position.</P>

      <P>Section 42(1)(<i>a</i>) lists some of the grounds for initiating a fitness to teach inquiry. These are failure to comply with or contravention <Col N="950" /> of any provision of this Act, the Education Act, 1998, the Education Welfare Act, 2000, the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1999, or any regulations, rules or orders made under those Acts. Some would argue that this section is all-encompassing and could give rise to fears that complaints could be made against teachers for minor infringements. There are sufficient safeguards in section 42(3)(<i>b</i>) to ensure that minor or isolated infringements will not be used to instigate investigations. All applications will be examined by the director of the teaching council.  The right to engage in a legitimate trade union dispute is an unspecified right under our Constitution and the Bill will not alter that.</P>

      <P>Having read section 44, I felt the degree of punishment provided for was excessive and that some provision should be made for the issuance of a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo;. Amendment No. 31 seeks the censuring of a registered teacher if that is required. Amendment No. 32 would provide that if the council must reconsider a further complaint against a teacher previously censured, one of the other penalties provided for in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) could be invoked if the council were to find against the teacher.

      <P>I stated on Committee Stage that it appears totally wrong that a teacher can be struck off without even being informed of an application made to the High Court. Any application should be notified to the respondent; that is standard practice. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, wondered what would happen if a teacher were abroad and could not be contacted. The requirement under the <i>ex parte </i>rule is that a notice must be served on the last known address so the Minister of State's argument does not hold water. The Minister accepts there are concerns about this and, presumably, he will remove the <i>ex parte</i> request.</P>

      <P>I have applied pressure with regard  to this matter for the past two weeks because there is an urgent need at St. Colmcille's national school for this extension. The school was built in 1992 to cater for 150 pupils and it now has almost 200. A further increase in enrolment is expected this September which will lead to severe overcrowding. The area in Westport served by this school is a large one with a mix of urban and rural in which there has been a great deal of development in recent years. The population in the area will increase because of the new housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school applied for the extension in October 1999 and there has been little progress to date. An architect from the Department of Education and Science visited the school but there is no great sense of urgency. I appeal to the Minister and his officials to deal with this as quickly as possible because there is a serious overcrowding problem. This is an excellent school run by an excellent principal with excellent teachers and an excellent board of management. They are all deeply concerned about the overcrowding in the school, and some of the facilities, including the assembly hall and even the princi<Col N="953" /> pal's office, are being used for children with special needs. This is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ask his officials to treat this as an emergency? I would like to see the extension put in place before next September when new pupils will be enrolled because, if it is not, it will lead to greater overcrowding. The school has an excellent staff working in difficult circumstances. Will the Minister have his officials give this matter their full attention to deal with it as a matter of urgency? It was common to say funding was not available, but now we listen daily to stories of all the funding coming into the Minister's coffers from taxpayers. There is no shortage of money. I appeal to the Minister to sanction the extension and progress the stages. Too many stages are involved in the sanctioning and building of school extensions. They are a stalling tactic. I want all the stops to be pulled out by the Department. Will the Minister direct his officials to take a number of steps together to try to have the extension in place next September?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding this school. At present, the school has a staffing level of one principal, six mainstream class teachers and a shared remedial and resource teacher. The latter is not based in the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2000 was 182 pupils. The school's facilities consist of six classrooms with sanitary facilities and ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>An application for grant assistance towards the provision of an additional classroom and additional ancillary accommodation was received in the Department of Education and Science from the school management in January 2000. A member of the Department's architectural staff visited the school to assess conditions there, and the Department is considering the most efficient and cost-effective way of providing the required accommodation.</P>
      <P>This project is one of a large number being processed by the Department. There are more than 300 major projects in architectural planning in the primary sector alone. Major projects in this context are those of an estimated value of £250,000 or more. In addition, approximately 400 applications are being processed which have not gone to architectural planning. Due to the large number of applications to the Department for grant aid in respect of capital works, delays in the processing of individual projects are inevitable. It is not possible at this point to say when construction will commence. However, every effort will be made to process this project as quickly as possible. I note what the Deputy said about the urgency of the matter, especially given the overcrowding which he emphasised. I will have to examine the matter closely.</P>

      <P>The time has come for the Dáil to request the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, to investigate all aspects of the privatisation and deregulation of telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland. Following the sale of the second mobile phone licence in 1995, there was and continues to be wide public concern that a vital part of the national infrastructure was sold for a pittance and that the bitter complaints of the losing applicants may have had a serious basis. The privatisation and flotation of Eircom has been controversial, with many citizens on low incomes believing they should have received shares as of right. While the flotation raised a substantial sum to kick start the national pension reserve fund, many citizens are still aggrieved at the subsequent performance of the company and the poor returns on their investment.</P>
      <P>Latterly, especially last year, many constituents raised profound concerns about the attitude of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation on the sale of the third generation mobile phone licences. Many of them believed the director lost her best window of opportunity for the third generation mobile phone network by not opting for an auction process. These concerns have been raised widely in the media throughout the past six years, most effectively by Matt Cooper, editor of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, Gene Kerrigan of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and Fintan O'Toole of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
      <P>The extent of the ongoing public unease is such that a full investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General, John Purcell, is warranted. This need not impinge on any matters which might be properly investigated by the Moriarty tribunal. As with the DIRT inquiry first conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it may be necessary to confer additional special powers on his office to enable him conduct a full examination of the privatisation of Eircom and telecommunications deregulation. If that is the case, as it appears to be, the Dáil should do precisely that and request Mr. Purcell to report to it in full on all aspects of deregulation and the sale of Eircom. The Dáil should concede to the Comptroller and Auditor General whatever powers of discovery and investigation and other resources are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, will remember that I raised the issue of the disposal of third generation mobile phone licences with her on 10 May last year when she informed me of the options open to Ireland in this regard, including the auction process, which happened in the United Kingdom and Germany, the so-called beauty contest route and the lottery route. She also referred me to the powers of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, and the director subsequently sent me her document entitled, The Introduction of Third Generation Mobile Services in Ireland. The document referred to the issue of four new licences and stated that they <Col N="955" /> were being chosen by the beauty contest, not the auction, route.</P>
    <P>Like many of my constituents, I was unhappy with this decision and referred it to the Comptroller and Auditor General. He told me by letter last September that, until the level of licence fee to be charged for the successful third generation applicant was decided, subject to the approval of the Department of Finance, it would be premature for him to become involved in any examination of the current position. However, he concluded that he intended to examine the papers dealing with the award of the third generation mobile phone licence and report on the matter to the Dáil if appropriate.</P>
    <P>When I wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General last summer, I also raised the issue of the second mobile phone licence. Mr. Purcell replied:</P>
    <P>I examined the sale of the second mobile phone licence to Esat Digifone from the point of view of regularity and propriety and I was satisfied that proper procedures had been applied for the entire award process.</P>
    <P>However, following recent press reports, especially the queries raised by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> relating to the role of the European Commission, the work done by Andersen Management International and previous consultants, the scoring or marking process, the credibility of the business plan of Esat, the beneficial owners of Esat and the alleged political donation by a company in the winning group, I again contacted the Comptroller and Auditor General about the third generation and second mobile phone licences. He reiterated his earlier position but said that, realistically, he would need powers similar to those conferred on him by legislation for the purpose of carrying out the DIRT investigation.</P>
    <P>I call on the House to consider urgently bestowing those powers on the Comptroller and Auditor General. In his recent communication he said that, since a committee or tribunal will examine the matter of the second mobile phone licence, he could not see the Oireachtas giving him such special powers for this purpose. However, the time has arrived to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with this matter because it involves hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of pounds worth of public infrastructure. We must ensure that it was disposed of to the best benefit of our constituents and I ask the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to refer the matter to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister for Public Enterprise has no function in relation to the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> The Comptroller and Auditor General's powers, as provided in the Act, include the power to carry out examinations as he considers appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining whether and to what extent the resources of a Department, person or fund have been used and, if acquired or disposed of by a Department, person or fund, have been so acquired or disposed of economically and efficiently and whether any such disposal has been effected upon the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General reported on the transfer of the public telecommunications system from State control to the private sector in his 1999 annual report. This report was laid before Dáil Éireann in accordance with the provisions of the Act and it did not outline any concerns in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination. This matter has also been examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Deputy has concerns in relation to the award of the second mobile telephone licence. The Minister gave the following response to Priority Question No. 21 yesterday:</P>
    <P>There is the question as to whether the matter raised by the Deputy may be considered by the Moriarty tribunal. The solicitor to the tribunal has informed my Department that the investigative phase of the tribunal's work is conducted on a confidential basis. Because of this and to ensure that it is enabled to perform the tasks assigned to it by the Oireachtas, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in relation to any matter which may be subject to investigations by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the Minister's position today. I also remind the Deputy that the second mobile telephone licence was awarded by the previous Administration when his party was in Government.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that the Deputy has concerns in relation to the forthcoming third generation mobile telephone licence competition. The Minister has stated that it is a matter for the Telecommunications Regulator to decide on the format of the competition to be held. The current position is that the director has outlined the framework to be used for the third generation mobile licence competition. The Minister is informed that the competition will take place shortly on conclusion of negotiations between the director and the Minister for Finance on the matter of licence fees.</P>
    <P>With regard to liberalisation in general, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation &ndash; ODTR &ndash; was established in June 1997. The office is responsible for making the liberalised market work in accordance with EU and national law while carrying out its functions of issuing, renewing, enforcing and general administration of licences and managing the frequency spectrum. Full liberalisation took place in Ireland on 1 December 1998 following the Government's <Col N="957" /> decision to end Ireland's derogation from full liberalisation. Prior to that, a number of significant areas had been opened to competition. These included the provision of fax, data and value added services. This area was liberalised in 1992 and over 50 licences were granted prior to full liberalisation. They also included the provision of mobile telephony networks and services. In addition to Eircell Limited, a subsidiary of Telecom Éireann, a second mobile telephony operator, Esat Digifone, was licensed in 1996 to operate a digital GSM mobile telephony service. A competition for the licensing of a combined GSM 900 and GSM 1800 service was conducted in 1998. A third mobile operator, Meteor, has also subsequently commenced operations. They also included the provision of satellite based telecommunications services and the provision of infrastructure for already liberalised services.</P>
    <P>Much of the legislation necessary for liberalisation of telecommunications has been introduced through the transposition of EU directives into Irish law. Following a recently completed review of the impact and effectiveness of the earlier directives, five new draft directives are actively under negotiation within the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. It is anticipated that these will be agreed in 2001. In light of these EU reforms and taking into account the Government's regulatory reform programme and the policy document on governance and accountability in the regulatory process, legislation is now being prepared with the objective of enhancing and adapting the telecommunications regulatory framework in order to respond to the rapidly developing market environment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry has provided for improved consumer choice. Competition is the catalyst for the innovative technically advanced and value driven society that we all recognise as the means to underpin future prosperity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter appertaining to ambulance drivers and services in all ambulance stations in the Southern Health Board region and elsewhere in the country. The problem is that ambulance drivers operate a 48 hour shift. They work from 8 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. in their stations and they are on call from 7.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. the following morning. They work this shift for two consecutive days. This means they are working for 48 hours and the personnel involved want to establish a 12 hour roster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As EMTs, they provide an emergency service to the public. However, unlike their colleagues in the fire service and the Garda Síochána, they do not qualify for emergency pay. Ambulance drivers, who are also described as EMTs, carry out their duties in a professional manner and it would be just to pay them accordingly and in line with their colleagues in the fire service and the Garda <Col N="958" /> Síochána. I call on the Minister to allow common sense to prevail and to correct this serious anomaly in the ambulance service, which is vital to everyone.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Minister about this matter two months ago and he had the courtesy to reply to me. He said he was investigating the matter and that it was under consideration. I would be pleased if he gave me an assurance that this anomaly will be rectified as quickly as possible. Ambulance drivers, who are also trained EMTs, are a vital section of the community. They are a vital cog in the wheel of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this matter. I am happy to discuss our emergency medical services and to outline the significant developments which have taken place and continue to take place to further enhance this service. However, first, I wish to pay tribute to all those involved in the emergency medical services who work so hard to provide life saving care in circumstances which can be difficult and often unpleasant.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of policy documents, notably the report of the review group on the ambulance service which was published in 1993, and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The report of the review group, which contained wide ranging recommendations, set out an ambitious programme of developments which were needed to align standards in emergency medical care in Ireland with best international practice in this area of medical care. The report, <i>inter alia</i>, addressed the level of cover currently provided by ambulance crews and made recommendations on how improvements might be made.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by the Southern Health Board on the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review group. This progress has been facilitated by special development funding from my Department to the board of in excess of £3 million in recent years. Much of this investment funding has been directed by the board towards improvements, on a phased basis, in the level of duty hours cover in all the board's ambulance stations. The board's service plans continue to address the issue of increasing the level of in-station duty hours cover with a subsequent reduction of on-call hours cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staffing ambulances with personnel specifically trained to provide essential life support in an out-of &ndash; hospital setting is in line with widespread international best practice in the provision of pre-hospital care. The introduction of two person crewing of ambulances by emergency medical technicians was a key recommendation of the report of the review group. I am pleased to inform the House that the Southern Health Board was among the first health boards to implement a programme to have all its ambul<Col N="959" /> ances covered by full-time, professionally qualified emergency medical technicians. Moreover, I understand from the board that in excess of 75% of all its emergency medical technician staff have completed the new and expanded EMT training programme.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning here that responsibility for training programmes for the future development of professional standards in the ambulance service, and in pre-hospital care generally, now rests with the pre-hospital emergency care council. I recently established this council in line with a recommendation of the cardiovascular health strategy &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; and it has replaced the National Ambulance Advisory Council. The council will carry forward the work of the NAAC in ensuring that the skills and training of emergency medical technicians continues to meet all necessary requirements.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks the council will be asked to address is the issues surrounding the development of advanced emergency medical technician training, including the regulatory issues which arise in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board last year established a strategic review group to review the implementation of the recommendations of the 1993 report in the board's area and, in particular, to address the issue of the appropriate level of ambulance stations and hours of cover in those stations with a costed implementation plan for all the boards' area. This strategic review will include a costing analysis for 24-hour cover in all the board's ambulance stations. I am informed by the board that this strategic review will be completed before the end of this year and I look forward to its outcome.</P>
    <P>The reduction of on-call cover and the increase in 24-hour cover in ambulance stations, not just in the functional area of the Southern Health Board, but nation wide, is but one of the many aspects of the emergency medical service that requires development. I am satisfied with the progress which has been made to date, while at the same time recognising that much still remains to be done. Negotiations are ongoing in the Southern Health Board in relation to &ldquo;shift cover&rdquo; through a management-union committee set up through the National Partnership Forum. I hope the issues raised this evening can be resolved through that mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Government has pursued, and will continue to pursue, a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service, including 24-hour cover, training, equipment and vehicles. I am committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the recommendations of the 1993 report, the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy and in response to the priorities identified by the health boards. I will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the continuing development of the emergency services <Col N="960" /> nationally to ensure that those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to once again raise the appalling housing situation as it affects my constituency and the entire eastern region.</P>
      <P>The situation has gone from bad to worse. Over the past three years, I have raised this issue in this House on numerous occasions. I will once again outline the sequence of events. In my constituency 2,500 families are on the local authority housing list. Another 2,000 families who have an income in excess of that which would qualify them for a shared-ownership local authority loan cannot buy a house. These people, in turn, are being forced on to the local authority housing list and have no chance ever of getting a house under that regime and will not have a chance of buying a house in the foreseeable future. There are young couples who cannot marry because they cannot buy a house. They are unable to live together as a normal family. In many cases the single mother of a child must live in separate accommodation from her boyfriend or husband who, in some instances, must live with his parents.</P>
      <P>There is now almost utter despair among people. I make a serious request to the Minister tonight to declare a housing emergency. Nothing will happen unless something serious is done. We are told there is insufficient land available. We are told that the process is too slow and that there are not sufficient planners to process applications and so on. These issues can be overcome because if the local authorities do not have the necessary wherewithal, they can hire it from outside as many authorities have done from time to time.</P>
      <P>I point to the seriousness of what is taking place at present. Families of people who settled in the eastern region 30 years ago, the second generation, are now homeless. These people have no chance of buying a house and their options are very limited. They can move 60, 70 or 100 miles down the country. They can commute to their jobs on a daily basis or they can emigrate. These are the stark options they now have. In regard to the availability of land in this city and county and the entire eastern region, one does not have to be an expert to drive around and see the countless available sites, some of which are lying dormant and vacant for years. It is an absolute scandal that so many people have been living in such awful housing conditions and in such tremendous need for so long with so little effort being made to address their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that my local authority and surrounding local authorities have made an effort in recent times to come up with some plans. I do not agree with the plans in some instances because they would intensify development to the extent that could well create slums 30 or 40 years down the road. However, they are three years too <Col N="961" /> late because the third generation of these plans should now be coming to fruition, which is not the case. The sad fact is that the local authorities are now talking about building hostels. The only reason hostels were used was that there was nothing else available. Why not build houses? Why not give the people a reasonably decent chance to get a start in life and live a normal life? Why not provide houses and spend time coming up with emergency measures? I appeal to the Minister in this regard. I note that neither the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Ministers of State are present. That is no reflection on the very capable Minister sitting opposite, but particular Departments have responsibilities and their Ministers or Ministers of State should be available to come to this House for the Adjournment Debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal is unable to be here to respond to this question. He asked me to do so on his behalf, which I am pleased to do.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Government is absolutely committed to maximising housing supply and protecting the interests of first time house buyers. The Government's publication of Action on Housing last June was the third in a series of major initiatives aimed at relieving the pressures in the housing market primarily by the delivery of additional housing supply. These initiatives include the serviced land initiative, which was introduced at the end of 1997. This has been extended over the past three years by the provision of additional funding and the approval of new schemes. The initiative will provide some 167,000 additional housing sites. There will be the use of strategic development zones to ensure the early development of large-scale residential developments, with a levy for non-development within SDZs within a specified time frame. Project offices will be developed to drive key infrastructural projects, together with targeted investment in key water, sewerage and non-national roads infrastructure. There will be measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry, in particular to address shortages of professional and skilled workers. A public transport standing committee will be established to integrate public transport provision with new housing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's measures are having the desired effect. Last year was the sixth consecutive year of record housing output, with completions just below 50,000 units. Moreover, the prospects for a continued high level of housing output are positive with approximately 88,000 housing units receiving a final grant of permission from the local authority and An Bord Pleanála, an increase of approximately 15% on 1999. The stock of serviced building land is also positive, with the availability of approximately 10,800 hectares of ser<Col N="962" /> viced land which has the capacity to provide more than 263,000 housing units.</P>
    <P>The effects of this increased output are reflected in moderating house price trends. The most recent house price figures available provide strong evidence of a moderation in the rate of house price increase, particularly in new house prices with annual increases in the 10%-14% range compared with a peak of 42% in early 1998. It is widely accepted that the Government's actions have been critical in achieving house price moderation. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken a range of measures to ensure that our social housing needs are met. We have provided an increased level of capital funding for the local authority housing programme which is more than 40% greater than last year. Overall funding provided for the local authority housing programme will have more than doubled since the Government came into office in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government has also introduced a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000-03. The multi-annual approach allows for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets. At this stage we expect that local authorities will have completions this year of at least 5,000 units and that commencements of new projects will exceed 7,000 units.</P>
    <P>Funding is committed for 41,500 starts in the local authority housing programme over the period of the national development plan. This indicates the Government's commitment to increasing momentum in the programme to respond to rising need. We have urged local authorities to front-load their construction programmes to meet existing demand more quickly. Uniquely, they have <i>carte blanche</i> to start as many projects as they possibly can. Local authorities know that the necessary funding for the capital programme is in place and there is no impediment on this front. In 1997 the number of house starts allocated to local authorities was 3,500. The figure has now been virtually doubled.</P>
    <P>While local authorities are the main providers of social housing, the voluntary housing sector is also playing an increasingly important role. The Government has increased the levels of assistance provided for the voluntary housing sector over the past two years and this has achieved a turnaround in the decline in activity which had been experienced in the sector since 1995. Output from the sector reached almost 1,000 units last year, up 64% on 1999. The Government is committed to further developing the voluntary housing sector and our target is for the sector to achieve an output of 4,000 units per annum by the end of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant recent developments regarding housing supply was the introduction of the Planning and Development Act <Col N="963" /> last year. This Act introduced fundamental changes in the way local authorities plan and provide for housing. It requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies by the end of July this year which must identify the overall need for housing within the area covered by the strategy, including the need for social and affordable housing. Local authorities will be able to reserve up to 20% of residentially zoned land to meet the identified needs for social and affordable housing. The provisions of the Planning and Development Act will be of significant benefit to first time house seekers generally.</P>
    <P>The priority afforded by the Government to the housing area and the direction and force of Government policies are widely acknowledged as correct. We will continue to give priority to ensuring higher housing output to meet the needs <Col N="964" /> of our growing population and, in particular, the needs of the most vulnerable groups. I am sure the Deputy will agree that the evidence is, if one excuses the pun, concrete.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, during a visit to Moscow in 1999, an invitation was extended to the Russian Premier to allow members of Russia's Federal Security Service, who have been accused of human rights violations in Chechnya, to train with the Irish Army in the Curragh and in Galway.</Quest>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 14 February 2001 when replying to a question an this subject, the Taoiseach, during his visit to Russia from 14 to 16 September 1999, indicated to the Russian Federation authorities that the Irish security forces would be willing to share their expertise with regard to helping the Russian Armed Forces in dealing with terrorism. It should be noted that this commitment was made shortly after a number of bombs had exploded in Russia, killing many civilians in their apartments. The Deputy will agree that these atrocities were a gross violation of the most fundamental human right, the right to life. The Russian Armed Forces were experiencing problems in dealing with urban terrorism, particularly in relation to car bombs, and other explosive devices planted in urban areas. The Irish Defence Forces have a recognised expertise in this area and the Russians were anxious to avail of such training. The Government agreed on 28 September 1999 to official visits to Russia by the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner. As a result of this decision the Chief of Staff visited Moscow from 26 to 28 June 2000, and met the Russian Armed Forces to discuss their training requirements.</P>
      <P>Two explosive ordnance disposal experts from the Defence Forces travelled to Moscow from 13 to 17 November 2000, to assess the Russian Federation's needs in this field. Following on from this, 12 members of the Russian Armed Forces have visited Ireland for appropriate ordnance training. This training is, of course, purely of a defensive rather than an offensive nature.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that similar training facilities have been provided to other countries, including the USA, Canada, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland and Austria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 May 1999 during an operation in the ClareGalway region, the Garda air support unit helicopter which is piloted by Air Corps personnel inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
      <P>To facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced in February 2000 that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of GASU.</P>
      <P>Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence was issued.</P>
      <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through their Irish agent Atron, who are based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place with the military authorities and the Air Corps and it was decided to attempt to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter. The tender documentation was prepared and on 27 September 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used AS 355N helicopter to the Department of Defence was issued to a total of 15 companies. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the tender competition indicated that there were very few AS 355N helicopters available on the open market. Six responses were received, some of which offered different helicopter types which could not be considered. Essentially, the valid tenders from three companies related to the same, one only, AS 355N helicopter <Col N="967" /> which was available in the Philippines. Having considered the responses and the various factors involved, the option to look further into the possible purchase of this particular helicopter was not taken up by the Department.</P>
    <P>All options for the provision of night flying training of Air Corps pilots for the GASU are under active consideration in my Department but the prospect of obtaining a second hand Squirrel helicopter for this work is not good given our experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>The new GASU helicopter, the EC 135, is due to be operational in May-June. In that context, and with two helicopters available, the option of using one of the two GASU helicopters for training purposes, including night flying training, will be discussed between officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am hopeful of a positive outcome to these discussions which would resolve the issue once and for all and would allow for the GASU helicopters to be available for night flying operations in rural areas.</P>

      <QRef>[8839/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 57 together.</P>
    <P>The position is that the ministerial air transport service is operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV executive jet, which was leased for this purpose in 1991. The Beech King Air turboprop aircraft had been used as a back-up aircraft to the Gulfstream. However, over the past decade significant changes have developed in the needs of the service.</P>
    <P>The business of the European Union itself has grown by an unprecedented degree both in the size of its market and in the depth and range of its activities. These changes have increased significantly the travel requirements of Government Ministers and officials.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing requirement for the Government to maintain a very active involvement both bilaterally, and through the ELT and multilateral bodies like the United Nations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas so as to build Ireland's political and economic relations with countries from these regions. This requirement also involves substantial air travel by Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>Owing to its limited capacity range and endurance the Beech King Air aircraft could only provide a limited service and could no longer be regarded as an adequate alternative to the Gulfstream IV aircraft. Therefore, in situations where the Gulfstream IV aircraft was unavailable for any reason it became necessary to avail of an air taxi service. Details of such occasions since June 1997 are shown in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with my reply.</P>
    <P>I have included passenger numbers only as the composition of the Ministerial group is a matter for each individual Department.</P>
    <P>In this connection my Department is responsible for the hire of air taxis for all Government Ministers. The use of air taxis must be cleared in advance by each individual Minister with the Taoiseach. It is only when this approval has been obtained that the request is transmitted to my Department to hire the required aircraft. Where time permits the air taxi service is acquired through a tender competition. Otherwise a rotation system is used among the Irish providers of air taxi services. The question of the use of commercial airlines is a mater for the requesting Department itself.</P>
    <P>Air Taxi &ndash; 1997-2001</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 33 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU Headline Goal as a rapid reaction force. The response capacity currently being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a rapid reaction force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out Petersberg Tasks, tasks of crisis management, peace<Col N="972" /> keeping and humanitarian activities, the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long and distinguished record of involvement in a wide range of UN peacekeeping missions in diverse operating environments. The commitments made in relation to the EU Headline Goal must be seen in the context of continuing Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, I would reiterate that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The comments made by General Guthrie have not been raised with the British authorities. I would not consider it appropriate to respond to informal comments of this nature made by an outgoing Chief of Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware as a result of recent public concern regarding possible environmental and health risks relating to the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Balkans, the Defence Forces have put in place a medical screening programme for all Irish troops who served or are serving in the Balkan region, as well as personnel who served as military observers in Kuwait following the Gulf War. All personnel, including those who have retired, are being called to the various brigade centres to undergo screening. This process is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The screening programme commenced in January 2001. This medical screening programme has been put in place to provide reassurance for personnel and their families and includes blood and urine tests along with a clinical examination.</P>
      <P>To date a total of 258 Defence Forces personnel have received screening. No unusual medical problems have been detected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 100 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The <Col N="974" /> barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
    <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near future. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities to complete the sale are progressing.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks concerned, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the lands at Murphy Barracks will be critical in the future overall development of Ballincollig. Last April my Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan. Discussions are ongoing between Cork County Council and my Department to determine the best way forward to realise the potential of the integrated plan, while taking account of the aspirations of all sides. It is hoped to bring the matter to conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In view of those needs it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. This matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. My Department has advertised a tender competition for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the barracks of 13.66 acres. At present the tenders are <Col N="975" /> under examination and sale of the property will proceed this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the forgoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following: 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for £2.5 million; 6.39 acres known as Susan's Field, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork to Cork Corporation for £1.2 million; 3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick Corporation for £915,000; 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for £550,000; 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for £215,000 to assist with the construction of the Kildare bypass, and 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare to residents which will realise £3 million approximately.</P>
    <P>The disposal of ten acres at Mellows Field beside Renmore Barracks, Galway will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>The costs associated with the sale of the six barracks identified for disposal in 1998 are as follows:</P>

    <P>Savings to date on military security duty allowances amount to £840,000 approximately. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks. Contingent on the closing dates for the sales, additional costs will arise in respect of the sale of the barracks.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces. The barrack re-investment programme commenced in 1999 and will run until 2003. Expenditure to date amounts to:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in reply to Questions Nos. 28 and 91 on 14 February 2001, the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was published by the Minister for Finance on 31 January 2001.</P>
      <P>The commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the military service allowance, and the consequences for pensioners generally in chapter 22, section 6 of its final report. It indicated that it had obtained actuarial advice on the impact of making the allowances in question pensionable in the specific case of Garda and Defence Forces' pensioners for future pension payments only. The commission was advised that, at 1997 costs, this would result in an immediate increase in expenditure of £9 million a year and that the accrued liabilities of the State would increase by £116 million if this change were implemented for both groups.</P>
      <P>The commission, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long standing public service pensions policy in that context and the cost implications involved, did not recommend any concession. Its conclusions are contained in paragraph 22.6.6 of the report and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has shown that the cost of any change in policy on this matter would be substantial. In addition, a change in policy could possibly be extended to other groups with similar claims for pension increases. <Col N="977" /> Accordingly, having assessed the arguments involved, the Commission does not recommend any increase for the groups concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government has yet to make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations and will do so once it has had an opportunity to consider the report in detail. It is relevant to mention in this context that the report is a lengthy and complex document and contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations regarding public service pensions generally.</P>
    <P>In publishing the report, the Minister for Finance noted, in particular, the view that the commission's recommendations, as set out in its final report, represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of measures as a whole. This element will be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>

      <P>The Air Corps has been given the task of establishing a crash rescue service in Finner Camp and the interviews for fire crew have been conducted in the past week. Upon finalisation of the interview results, training will commence as soon as possible for the successful applicants. They will thereafter be permanently located at Finner Camp with the new equipment and the new fire tender.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of these facilities at Finner Camp, the Air Corps is currently providing a 24 hour search and rescue service using a Dauphin helicopter from Sligo Airport. It is planned that when the fire and crash rescue service is in place on a 24 hour basis the Dauphin will return to Finner Camp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 65, 94, 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the strength of the Defence Forces at 31 December 2000, both male and female, and the number of personnel who have left the Defence Forces in the year 2000 is shown in tabular statements which I propose to circulate with the Official Report. The statistical information is the latest available from the military authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government has now considered the final report from Price Waterhouse. It agrees in principle to the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multitasking-multi-capabilities and dedicated services, and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing of the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be made accordingly. The manpower levels of the Air Corps and Naval Service as provided for in the White Paper are in accordance with the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I am satisfied that a vigorous continuance of this policy will ensure the maintenance of proper strengths at agreed levels in the Permanent Defence Force. It is proposed to enlist about 800 personnel in the Permanent Defence Force from the 2001 recruitment campaign.</P>
      <P>The annual cadetship competition was advertised recently and it is proposed to offer 68 cadetships in the current year of which 12 will be Air Corps cadetships, 42 Army and 12 Naval Service. Last January 15 personnel were enlisted as apprentices in the Air Corps. A competition is currently being held for 40 additional Air Corps apprenticeships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, 40 Army cadets, eight Air Corps cadets, eight Naval Service cadets and nine non <Col N="979" /> commissioned officers are due to be commissioned later this year. Competitions for the appointment of direct entry officers to fill vacancies for medical officers, marine engineers, Army engineers, electrical artificers, instrumentalists and watchkeeping officers will continue throughout 2001. At present a proposal for the intake of a number of aeronautical engineers is being examined.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 4. In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 42 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, I announced last October that I had decided to proceed with the establishment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces, the appointment of which is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the representative associations, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
      <P>Discussions are taking place with both of the representative associations with a view to defining the scope and powers of a military ombudsman in terms which will meet the divergent needs of the various parties. The discussions are also likely to result in an updating of the existing internal complaints procedures. As soon as those discussions are completed, I will make the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the ombudsman proposal.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces have a derogation from the Employment Equality Act in respect of the criteria of physical ability and age. Therefore, the current age, medical and physical requirements for entry into the Defence Forces reflect the fact that only able bodied and fit recruits can satisfy the difficult and strenuous physical demands of the training and operational environment of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The percentage of civil servants employed in the Department with a disability is 5.1%. The comparable percentage for civilian employees employed by the Department with the Defence Forces throughout the country is currently 2.5%. There are three bodies under the aegis of this Department, namely Coiste an <i>Asgard</i>, the Army Pensions Board and the Irish Red Cross Society. There are no persons with a disability employed by Coiste an <i>Asgard</i>. It would not be practical to employ a person with a disability as a member of the professional crew of the sail training vessel, <i>Asgard II</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Pensions Board consists of a chairperson, an ordinary member and a member of the <Col N="981" /> Permanent Defence Force. There are no persons employed by the board. The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. It adheres to the general public service guidelines on the employment of persons with a disability.</P>

      <P>Following a tender competition, which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The first two vehicles were produced at the end of 2000 and following rigorous inspection and acceptance testing procedures were officially handed over to me on 11 January 2001. Both vehicles will remain in Switzerland until the end of May 2001 to facilitate training of Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The full production run will commence in June 2001 and I am delighted to say that all of the vehicles will have been delivered by January 2002, almost two years ahead of previous expectations. I am delighted with the progress made on the APC programme. The purchase of the APCs forms an integral part of the ongoing re-equipment programme. The imminent arrival of the vehicles is a great boost for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>By 28 February 2001, a total of 15,598 claims had been received by my Department in respect of alleged loss of hearing caused to current or former members of the Defence Forces during their military service. A total of 254 claims have been the subject of court awards, with a further 7,194 claims being disposed of through out of court settlements. A further 372 claims have been either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. Some 7,782 claims are still outstanding.</P>
      <P>On 24 January 2001, the High Court granted an adjournment of Army hearing loss claims from 5 February 2001, to facilitate out of court settlements under the early settlement scheme. In the six week period since that date, my Department has generated a total of 1,600 instructions to settle individual claims. Five firms of liability loss adjusters have been engaged by my Department to deal with approximately half of these instructions, with the remainder being dealt with by officials of the Chief State Solicitor's office. Some 154 firms of plaintiffs' solicitors have been included in the scheme and to date approximately 400 settlement offers have been accepted by plaintiffs, while many more offers have been recommended for settlement or are under active negotiation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the early settlement scheme represents a speedy and efficient mechanism of resolving the majority of outstanding hearing loss claims, while yielding considerable savings to the taxpayer on legal costs. It has operated successfully to date and I am anxious that the progress made during the adjournments can be maintained. In this regard, the question of further adjournments was reviewed by the High Court today and I can inform the House that Mr. Justice Johnson has extended the current adjournment for further review until 25 April 2001.</P>

      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon during the period 12 to 16 March 2001. I also visited the Czech Republic from 16 to 18 March 2001. During my visit to Lebanon, I was accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. The main purpose of my visit was to observe at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the area and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
      <P>During the course of my visit to Lebanon, I met the Lebanese Minister for Defence, Mr. Khalid Hrawi, the Lebanese Chief of Staff and Commander in Chief of the Lebanese Army, General Sleiman and the UNIFIL Force Commander, Major General Obeng, as well as other local representatives and dignitaries. Minister Hrawi told me that he regarded the situation in south Lebanon as good some nine months after the Israeli withdrawal. However, he pointed out that the Shabaa farms area was still occupied, which meant that Resolution 425 had still not been fully implemented. The continued presence of UNIFIL in the south was positive and much desired by Lebanon. Ireland's contribution was highly valued and Ireland's programme of assistance to civilians was greatly appreciated. Minister Hrawi expressed his consciousness of the level of losses sustained by Irishbatt over the years and expressed the gratitude of the Lebanese people and the Lebanese Government.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, I explained that our UN role was of great significance to the Irish Defence Forces. Ireland now had 23 years experience in Lebanon and had developed a great rapport with the Lebanese people and an understanding of their position. I indicated that I will be proposing to the Government that we send a further battalion in April 2001, which would be in place until October of this year. We await the Secretary General's report to the Security Council in July, when he will make suggestions about the future UN presence in Lebanon. An observer force with an armed element seemed the most likely future presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister Hwari expressed concern regarding the question of de-mining, both in the formerly occupied areas and in some villages. Assistance had been received from the UN and EU but he said that more was needed. The Lebanese Government would hold a workshop on de-mining needs and resources for potential contributor countries. I indicated that Ireland would do anything as a member of the Security Council to promote UN assistance regarding the question of de-<Col N="984" /> mining. The question of the attendance of Defence Forces technical personnel at a workshop on de-mining which is being planned by the Lebanese authorities would, I indicated, be considered. I emphasised that the experience of Lebanon had been positive for the Defence Forces and for Ireland. I also took the opportunity to commend the work of Honorary Consul General and Mrs. Daouk in support of Ireland's role in Lebanon over the years.</P>
    <P>I also visited Prague from 16 to 18 March 2001 where I met with the Czech Republic Defence Minister, Mr. Vladimir Vetchy. I was accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department. The principal items of discussion were Irish peacekeeping experience in Lebanon and the peace process generally in the Middle East; mine clearance in conflict areas; the White Paper on defence: the Irish experience; conditions of service for military personnel; developments on the Macedonia-Kosovo border and Czech membership of the EU.</P>

    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): Since 23 February 2001, the Defence Forces are rendering assistance to the gardaí and to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development arising from the foot and mouth crisis as follows. From 23 February 2001 to 2 March 2001, as a result of a request from the <Col N="985" /> Gardaí, the Defence Forces provided nine mobile patrols, each of which had a strength of one NCO and three privates on a 24 hour basis on the Border.</P>
    <P>From 2 March 2001 to date, as a result of a request from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Defence Forces, in conjunction with the gardaí, are manning 104 checkpoints on the Border. These checkpoints are manned by the Defence Forces from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. with up to 200 personnel involved each day.</P>
    <P>From 22 March 2001 to date, as a result of a request from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Defence Forces are providing a monitoring service at Dublin Port. The service consists of monitoring ships' waste and escorting it to a dump, two personnel from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, and briefing ships' captains, providing them with disinfectant and mats on the arrival of their ships in ports, two personnel on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>At 11.50 p.m. on 22 March 2001 a request was received from the gardaí for Defence Forces assistance in operating an additional 34 checkpoints on the County Louth border with County Monaghan and County Meath. These checkpoints also operate between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. each day. First Southern Brigade were ordered to send First Infantry Company and Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh, were ordered to send First Platoon from the First Air Defence Regiment to assist Second Eastern Brigade in mounting this operation. The first 20 of these checkpoints were put in place at 11 p.m. on 23 March 2001. Seven Mobile Patrols, each consisting of two personnel, also operate in conjunction with these checkpoints. The remaining 14 checkpoints were put in place at 8 p.m. on 24 March 2001. There are up to 60 personnel involved each day on this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, has recently submitted a claim on behalf of members of the Defence Forces who have been engaged in additional duties arising out of the foot and mouth disease scare and this claim is being processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme. By agreement with the association, discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this issue at present, other than to say that I am hopeful of an early resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 52, 64, 95, 102, 103 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU headline goal as a rapid reaction force. The response capacity being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a rapid reaction force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out Petersberg tasks, that is, tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
      <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, I reiterate that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The commitments made in relation to the EU headline goal must be seen in the context of Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. In this regard, the White Paper on defence, published last year, set out key elements of the Government's approach to overseas peace support operations and I refer to a number of the most important and relevant elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. In this context, the White Paper contains the strategy for the Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten <Col N="988" /> years and concluded that the Permanent Defence Force requires a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad. Ireland's commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU headline goal is to be met from within the United Nations stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS, commitment of 850 members on overseas service at any time.</P>
    <P>In relation to military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As a reflection of the evolving defence and security environment, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine. Since this Government came into office, very significant progress has been achieved in investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. An unprecedented level of investment has been made since then and the investment situation continues to improve following decisions made on the White Paper on defence.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    <P>As detailed in the White Paper, the Government decided that the State will not seek to commit Air Corps equipment resources to an overseas operation. In a situation where there are many demands on resources, it would not be reasonable to participate beyond the domestic context. As part of their normal training, Air Corps personnel attend specific training courses abroad from time to time. In 2000, two officers attended a basic survival course and two officers-NCOs attended a flight safety course with the RAF in the UK. These are annual activities. No conventional military operational activity was undertaken with EU member states.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is progressing well and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The new equipment and building programmes are a top priority for me. The programmes will ensure that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation, in which people are proud to serve.</P>

      <P>New investments in the development of training are being applied from resources made available as a result of barrack closures and the former VER scheme. At present, significant investment is being made at Kilworth and at the Glen of Imaal.</P>
      <P>A perceived deficiency in collective training was referred to in the Price Waterhouse review and, accordingly, this aspect has been addressed as a matter of priority. The Defence Forces training strategy for 2000-02 encompasses training up to APC battalion level operations. As part of that strategy, the concept of annual assessment of units was introduced. This assessment is designed to ensure that all operational troops are trained in the most modern and up-to-date procedures and practices, so that tasks can be achieved safely, efficiently and cost effectively. The assessment includes all traditional military skills and drills. In 2000, the strategy commenced with platoon level exercises. In 2001, company groups will be exercised. It is planned that these exercises will evolve into full APC battalion exercises in 2002-03.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 , 67 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes, as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals, RFP, stage and a request for tenders, RFT, stage. Responses to the REP were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received. The six responses were evaluated and a short list of four companies for participation in the RFT stage was drawn up. The documentation for the RFT stage issued on 5 March 2001 and tenders are due back in the Department on 19 April 2001. Following receipt of tenders, a comprehensive evaluation process will begin on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take <Col N="991" /> some time to complete. It is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The lead-in time for the delivery of the helicopters will differ and this is a matter that will have to be discussed with the successful tenderer in due course. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates, while also taking account of the intensive training requirements involved. The primary responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services lies with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Irish Coast Guard, and my Department and the Air Corps will do its utmost to facilitate the Irish Coast Guard whenever possible.</P>
    <P>The placement of the new helicopters is one of the issues being considered by a Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and Department of Defence working group. The work of the group is ongoing but progress has been made on the Waterford situation. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, announced in the Dáil on 21 March 2001 that his Department had commenced negotiations on a contract for the early provision of a new dedicated night flying medium lift helicopter capacity at Waterford to replace the service currently provided by an Air Corps Alouette helicopter. This provision will be an interim arrangement pending a more permanent placing of a fully suitable service in Waterford. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has also commenced the contract procedures for the acquisition on contract of the latter service. It is expected that the replacement helicopter will be in place later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in the presentation document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by this House. The presentation document included the five priority areas of co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection <Col N="992" /> of the environment and co-operation in marine matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland's objectives for participation in PfP include to promote the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to foster democratic control of armed forces internationally; to contribute to development of best practice in the areas of international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; to enhance the capabilities of military officers, civil servants and diplomats engaged in the shaping and executing of security and defence policies; to enhance the capabilities, including the area of interoperability, of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates; to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other relevant organisations to contribute to the areas of civil emergency planning; to share information and expertise, particularly in the area of international peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Following on from joining PfP, a programme for Ireland's participation has recently been agreed. This is Ireland's first individual partnership programme, IPP, and, therefore, provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach and planned activities. The IPP has been drawn up in the light of existing legislation and therefore no new legislation is necessary. Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, have been placed in the Dáil library.</P>
    <P>As a primary function of PfP is to enable states to enhance their capacity to co-operate in peace support operations, I take this opportunity to re-state the Government's position, which is that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN in accordance with the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 63, 83, and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET, troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of US $1087.10 per person per month. The total amount of money due to my Department by the United Nations as at 28 February 2001, in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions, is calculated at £9.5 million approximately. This figure breaks down as follows: UNIFIL £7.93 million; UNFICYP £0.95 million; UNTAET £0.2 million; UNOSOM £0.4 million; miscellaneous £0.02 million.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the moneys owed is in respect of troop costs arising from service with UNIFIL, UNFICYP and UNTAET. A sum of £1.25 million is owed in respect of death and disability claims arising from service with UNIFIL and UNFICYP.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concerns regarding arrears. In 2000, the UN repaid arrears of approximately £9 million almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL. Since 1 January 2001, the UN has repaid arrears of approximately £1.2 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper on Defence the Government decided the Defence Forces require a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad. Having regard to the defence and security environment, the Government's policy for defence is aimed at ensuring the following requirements are met: </P>
      <P>To maintain a military force structure that provides a basis for responding to any major change in Ireland's strategic circumstances in the medium to long-term, as well as demonstrating an appropriate commitment to national defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To maintain a military force structure capable of responding to requests to provide aid to the civil power and, in that context, contributing to the prevention of security challenges <Col N="995" /> from abroad including terrorism and arms smuggling.</P>
    <P>To fulfil Ireland's international and regional responsibilities arising from membership of the UN by providing a range of military capabilities that can effectively be employed to participate in a broad range of multinational peace support and humanitarian relief operations. Ireland has committed a maximum of 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate Ireland's commitment to European security by having a suitable range of military capabilities that can be used to make appropriate contributions to regional security missions authorised by the UN.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Air Corps, the Government decided that the State will not seek to commit Air Corps equipment resources to an overseas operation. In a situation where there are many demands on resources it would not be reasonable to participate beyond the domestic context.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to the Naval Service, the Government has decided that the emphasis will be on utilisation and development of the Naval Service to contribute to the maximum to all of the State's requirements in the maritime domain and to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. Fishery protection activities account for more than 90% of Naval Service operations.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into office, significant progress has been achieved in investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. An unprecedented level of investment has been made since then and the investment programme continues to improve following decisions made in <Col N="996" /> the White Paper on Defence. The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive and developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new and unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern and sustainable defence organisation with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
      <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The first two of the new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing £40 million in total, were produced at the end of 2000 and officially handed over to the Department of Defence on 11 January 2001. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January of next year almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
      <P>There has been significant investment in recent years on new vehicles for the Army with more than £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles deployed to KFOR and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4s, and three ton trucks.</P>
      <P>More than £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package includes the purchase of light Infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces is also to commence immediately.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is progressing well and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>The build of the second new ship for the Naval Service which is similar to <i>L.E. Roisin</i> is well advanced and well ahead of schedule. As with <i>L.E. Roisin</i>, the new ship will also cost more than £20 million. The ship should be completed by the end of April.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, approximately £67 million has been spent on building projects and maintenance works designed to upgrade operational, living and recreational accommodation for members of the Defence Forces. In the next three years, 2001-03, a further £81 million is expected to be spent on a continuation of that programme. Recent major accommodation projects included a new NCOs' mess in Finner Camp costing £0.8 million, and refurbishment of billet blocks, Clarke Barracks, Curragh costing £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current ongoing major projects include NCOs' mess east, Curragh, costing £2.6 million; student accommodation, Connolly Barracks, Curragh, costing £2.8 million; upgrade officer accommo<Col N="997" /> dation, Cathal Brugha Barracks, costing £0.8 million and upgrade of billets-ablution block, Coolmoney Camp, costing £0.45 million.</P>
    <P>In this year's programme, major works are proposed for Coolmoney Camp, Glen of Imaal, costing £4.7 million; Kilworth Camp, County Cork, costing £2.5 million; upgrading of billets, Cathal Brugha Barracks, costing £1.4 million; upgrading of billets, McKee Barracks, costing £1.8 million and upgrading of billets, Naval Base, costing £1 million. Over the next three years, further major accommodation projects listed in the building programme include McKee Barracks, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Connolly Barracks, the Curragh, Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny and Casement Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>The new equipment and the building programmes are a top priority for me. The programmes will ensure that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve.</P>

      <P>For many years, Ireland has contributed to international efforts to prohibit, control and eliminate nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Ireland is a signatory to the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Non-Proliferation Treaty and is an active participant in all meetings relevant to the achievement of the goals of these international agreements.</P>
      <P>As part of Ireland's individual partnership programme, IPP, for 2001, a member of the Defence Forces was nominated to attend as a student at the NATO nuclear biological and chemical, NBC defence basic course in Oberammergau, Germany. The aim of the course was to teach students the basic concepts, procedures and responses to defend against the risks associated with NBC weapons. Major emphasis is placed on individual protection drills and procedures.</P>
      <P>My Department was subsequently advised by the NATO school that this course had been cancelled and as yet no date has been fixed for the re-scheduling of the course.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the working relationship outlined between NATO and the European Union in the Annexes of the Declarations at Nice, particularly in Annex VII, Standing Arrangements for Consultation and Co-operation between the EU and NATO.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of NATO in ESDP stems from the fact that, as it develops capabilities for the conduct of Petersberg Tasks, the EU, which is not a military organisation, is likely to remain dependent on NATO infrastructural and transport capacity, as the UN &ndash; mandated operations such as SFOR and KFOR have shown.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the relevant annexes to the French Presidency's Report to Nice further define the principles underpinning EU-NATO consultation arrangements and reiterate general principles agreed at Feira on the decision-making autonomy of each organisation and on non-discrimination against any state. The annexes to the report also make clear that consistency with the planning and review process, PARP, of Partnership for Peace, PfP, is a requirement of any future EU-NATO arrangements.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council on 22 January, agreement was reached on the frequency of EU-NATO meetings at ministerial level, of which there will be at least one per EU Presidency, and at the level of EU Political and Security Committee-North Atlantic Council Ambassadors, of which there will be at least three per Presidency. The first such PSC-NAC meeting under the Swedish Presidency took place on 5 February and a further meeting took place on 14 March which allowed for discussion of events in the Presevo valley region in Kosovo. Ireland approaches the EU-NATO relationship as a dimension of ESDP and places importance on the principles agreed at Feira of non-discrimination between member states and autonomy of decision-making by both organisations.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussions have been taking place between the EU and NATO on the modalities for the use of NATO assets by the EU in carrying out specific Petersberg tasks where the EU does not itself have adequate capabilities. In this context, it is envisaged that the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, DSACEUR, would have a co-ordinating role between the EU and NATO on the allocation of NATO resources for a specific operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The command arrangements for an EU-led operation would be for the EU to decide and the EU would maintain the political control of any operation using NATO assets and capabilities. Moreover, I would emphasise that Irish involvement in operations where the EU and NATO co-operate will only occur where our peacekeepers act under a UN mandate. In common with the other neutral and non-aligned EU countries, Ireland has placed importance on the role of PfP, and the planning and review process, PARP, in particular, as a mechanism to facilitate planning for the headline goal, and that all EU member states should have an equal input in planning for the Petersberg tasks. Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops <Col N="999" /> or other resources. Ireland will only participate in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I reiterate that Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of neutrality and our commitment to international peace and security. We therefore approach this task in a positive and constructive spirit.</P>

      <Quest>if it is the Government's policy to support the formation of a United Nations observer force to report on incidents of violence that occur between Israelis and Palestinians; the proposed terms of reference of such observer force; the proposed location of any such force; the discussions to date in which the Government has engaged concerning such proposals; and the role which he envisages the Defence Forces would play in any such force.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9156/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories. We condemn the latest wave of attacks against civilians and call for an end to all acts of terrorism. The international community can play an important role, in co-operation with the parties, in bringing this violence to an end.  </P>
      <P>Last December, a draft Security Council resolution which would have expressed the council's determination to establish a UN observer mission in the occupied territories failed to gain sufficient support. In light of the developments since, the Security Council returned to the issue and had a detailed debate starting on 15 March in which Ireland made its position on the violence and the urgent necessity to resume negotiations very clear to the council. During this debate, representatives of the non-aligned movement introduced a similar draft resolution with a view to the establishment of an observer mission to protect civilians from the violence in the occupied territories.</P>
      <P>The view of many members of the Security Council, including Ireland, and also of the UN Secretary General, is that any effective presence of UN observers would require the agreement of both sides to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that a UN mission may in the future be part of a comprehensive settlement.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been very active in exploring the possibilities for the adoption of a resolution which could command unanimous support in the Security Council. We see it as essential to preserve the principle of consent of the parties. This is required where any mission is being established other than under the enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the UN Charter. In the case under examination here, it is very difficult to see how a mission could operate without the co-operation of both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>France, Ireland, Norway and UK held intensive discussions with other members of the Security Council, including the non-aligned, in a sustained effort to agree a broader resolution which would deal constructively with the entirety of the situation on the ground and in the peace process. The broader resolution would have set out a number of measures to help bring an end to the current violence and permit the resumption of peace negotiations. It would have referred to the continuing violence, settlements, the closures, the <Col N="1002" /> vulnerability of the Palestinian economy and the need to resume peace negotiations.</P>
    <P>A key aspect would have been a request to the UN Secretary General to consult the parties on early steps to implement these measures as well as on setting up a mechanism to contribute to the protection of civilians and to report to the Security Council within one month.</P>
    <P>In the event, consensus on a comprehensive resolution on the entire situation in the peace process did not prove possible on this occasion. We regret that this proved to be the case, particularly in view of the intensive nature of the discussions in the Security Council since 15 March and how close the council came to agreeing such a resolution, a step that would have marked concrete, practical progress.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Security Council, Ireland will continue to urge all parties to agree on practical and useful steps to overcome the real problems obstructing the peace process.</P>
    <P>The role which the Defence Forces might play in any such mission, if it is agreed at some future date, will be a matter for consideration at the appropriate time.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's view of the announcement made by the Belgian Government that upon taking over the European Union presidency on 1 July 2001, it will seek to progress greater integration between the European Union and the Western European Union alliance; and his views on the impact of any such proposed merger on Irish neutrality.</Quest>

      <P>I understand the Belgian authorities have yet to make any formal announcements regarding their EU presidency work programme in the security and defence area. I am not aware of any current proposal to integrate the Western European Union into the EU.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was envisaged that the Western European Union would play a key role in the security and defence area. Article 17 of that treaty evoked the possibility of a future merger of the EU and Western European Union. However, with the enhancement of the EU's capabilities in the area of humanitarian and crisis management tasks, through the European security and defence policy, the role of the Western European Union has diminished. In effect, the issue of the possible integration of the Western European Union into the EU has now been left aside. In the Treaty of Nice, the relevant clauses regarding a possible future EU-WEU merger have now been deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the French EU Presidency, the Council of Ministers agreed in principle to the transfer of certain Petersberg Task functions of the Western European Union into the European Union. These comprise a satellite image analysis centre <Col N="1003" /> located in Spain, an academic security research institute currently based in Paris and a police training and advisory mission in Albania. The modalities to facilitate the transfer of these functions are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the ESDP, incorporating the transfer of the Petersberg functions of the Western European Union, is to enhance the conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities of the EU. These objectives are fully consistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality, to which the Government remains firmly committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 2000, the EU Commission issued a communication on accelerated action targeted at major communicable diseases within the context of poverty reduction. The communication focuses on the need for accelerated action targeted at HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB. World wide these three diseases cause the deaths of more than five million people each year with the greatest impact on morbidity and life expectancy in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The communication says that the rapid spread of these communicable diseases has become a global emergency which requires an accelerated response. The communication emphasises that the Community's response should complement long-standing and ongoing Community support to strengthen health systems to deliver services that benefit the poor.</P>
      <P>The framework for Community action outlined in the communication covers three broad areas: optimising the impact of existing interventions, services and commodities; increasing the affordability of key pharmaceuticals; and increasing investment in research and development of global goods targeted at the three major communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>On existing interventions, the communication points out that HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB are largely preventable through existing low cost interventions. The EC will improve its efforts to strengthen health systems, provide for key commodities and pharmaceuticals, support national budgets, scale up effective approaches and improve donor co-ordination. A key element in this approach is the strengthening of innovative partnerships with civil society organisations, support for organisations experienced in the social marketing of health commodities and partnership with private sector distribution networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On affordability, the EC advocates that the pharmaceutical industry use tiered pricing to <Col N="1004" /> allow manufacturers to offer the lowest possible prices to poor countries. The EC recognises that tiered pricing requires effective measures to be put in place to prevent parallel exporting of the low price pharmaceuticals to the markets of higher price developed countries. The communication also recognises that the Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreement negotiated in the World Trade Organisation permits Governments the flexibility, in cases of emergency, to permit the compulsory licensing of patented drugs. This means that local manufacturers can be licensed to produce generic versions of the drug without the consent of the patent holder.</P>
    <P>In the area of research, the communication notes that only 10% of global health research targets those diseases which compromise 90% of the global disease burden. The EC proposes three complementary strategies consisting of large scale and more effective public investment, the development of an incentive package for private investment and participation in a global partnership.</P>
    <P>Overall the communication displays a high level of coherence between the different directorates within the Commission. It draws on development, trade, research and public health expertise in a comprehensive policy which tackles the multi-sectoral nature of the response required to fight HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB.</P>
    <P>Ireland has welcomed the communication recalling that the Taoiseach wrote to Commission President, Mr. Prodi in January 2000 calling for an accelerated EU response to the rapid spread of HIV-AIDS in Africa.</P>
    <P>In our national response to the communication we have also stressed the need for the accelerated action programme to complement existing efforts in the field to strengthen health systems. We have called for the proliferation of international health initiatives dealing with the spread of communicable diseases, WHO's massive effort and roll back malaria, the global alliance for vaccines and immunisations, the International Partnership against AIDS in Africa, etc., to co-ordinate their activities and to work with donors in sector wide approaches to the development of sustainable health systems. We have also called for additional resources to be devoted to the fight against the spread of communicable diseases and for the Commission to prioritise health sector development in the EC aid programme.</P>
    <P>The communication on accelerated action will be followed by an action plan which will set out the detailed programme the Commission will implement to achieve the objectives identified in accelerated action. The action plan is currently under discussion and is expected to be finalised in the coming month. It will be discussed at the next Development Council in May.</P>

      <P>I understand that proposed railway developments in the Cork area are currently being considered by consultants who have been engaged by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council to draw up the Cork Strategic Plan 2000-20. The consultants have issued an interim report and this, among other things, contains proposals that the area along the rail-land corridor from Blarney <i>via</i> Cork to Middleton be rezoned for major residential and commercial development. These proposals have been put forward in the context of major rail development proposals which would involve the re-opening of the line to Middleton and the opening of a number of railway stations along the line.</P>
      <P>It is my position that major public transport projects are best considered when they are developed in line with appropriate land use planning policy and practice which will justify their capital and ongoing operating costs.</P>
      <P>The strategy being adopted by the consultants working on the Cork strategic plan accords, in principle, with this position. Further work needs to be done on the rail proposals, such as detailed cost-benefit analysis, consideration of funding options and passenger demand evaluation. I understand that work on these elements of the study is proceeding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I understand that Iarnród Éireann is progressing plans for the provision of a new passenger concourse and related facilities on the south side of Kent station and for the re-modelling of the trackwork and platforms in the station. I am informed that in developing its plans Iarnród Éireann is taking account of the rail development proposals of the emerging Cork strategic plan.</P>

      <P>A condition of the light railway order that I made for the Tallaght to Abbey Street light rail line was that, prior to the demolition or occupation of certain of the properties on Arran Quay Terrace, CIE should submit to me proposals for the redevelopment of the terrace. Such redevelopment should include details of any agreements <Col N="1006" /> with the residents and details of the relocation of any residents within the area.</P>
      <P>I understand that negotiations are well advanced with the residents for whom CIE is obliged, under the light railway order, to provide alternative accommodation. CIE are confident that they will be in a position to submit detailed proposals to me shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards residents on the side of Arran Quay Terrace not to be demolished, the findings of the public inquiry were that the eventual outcome will not be negative in terms of living accommodation.</P>
      <P>While these residents will be subjected to some inconvenience during the course of construction, there is no specific provision for compensation for them. I understand that CIE is making every effort to minimise any disruption or inconvenience to the residents in question. Discussions are being held with these residents in relation to how this can best be achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 104 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's approach to participation in Partnership for Peace, PfP, was set out in the presentation document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by this House. The presentation document included the five priority areas of cooperation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters.</P>
      <P>Ireland's objectives for participation in PfP include: to promote the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to foster democratic control of armed forces internationally; to contribute to development of best practice in the areas of international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; to enhance the capabilities of military officers, civil servants and diplomats engaged in the shaping and executing of security and defence policies; to enhance the capabilities, including the area of interoperability, of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates; to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other relevant organisations to contribute to the areas of civil emergency planning; to share information and expertise particularly in the area of international peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> It will be recalled that participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.</P>
    <P>Following on from joining PfP, an Individual Partnership Programme, IPP, for Ireland's participation has recently been agreed. This is Ireland's first IPP and therefore provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach and planned activities. Ireland's policy approach will be developed in the light of initial experience and the IPP has been drawn up in a flexible form to allow for the adjustment in the light of ongoing experience.</P>
    <P>Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, have been placed in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    <P>The activities chosen are, in the main, training courses, seminars and table top exercises and will involve participation at officer level and non-commisioned officer level. A sum of $245,000 has been allocated in 2001 for participation in such activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> Since my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 122 raised by the Deputy on 24 October 2000 two meetings have been held at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>On 20 November 2000, my colleague, the Minister for State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, attended the Capabilities Commitment Conference in Brussels on my behalf. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the General Affairs Council embodying security and defence elements and the associated conference meetings with the third countries wishing to contribute to the EU headline goal.</P>
    <P>Ireland offered to contribute up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the headline goal from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system. The largest element of the commitment involves a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, along with an Army ranger wing platoon of 40, in addition to small numbers in national support, headquarters and observer elements which make up the remainder.</P>
    <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued after the conference which outlined progress to date on the elaboration of the voluntary goal in the lead-up to the Nice European Council. It clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European army.</P>
    <P>On 21 February 2001, I met with the Belgian Defence Minister, Mr. Andre Flahaut, in my Department. Minister Flahaut requested this meeting in the context of his preparations of the forthcoming Belgian EU Presidency. The meeting afforded an opportunity for Minister Flahaut to discuss informally matters relating to European Security and Defence Policy &ndash; ESDP &ndash; and in particular the Belgian priorities for advancement of Helsinki headline goal capabilities during their presidency. The meeting of its nature was an exchange of views and non decision making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently met with both the closure committee in Clancy Barracks and representatives from the joint industrial council for State employees to review progress in the matter of accommodating staff who will be required to move following the closure of Clancy Barracks later this year. Of the 91 staff still remaining in Clancy Barracks, the present position is that upwards of 11 are expected to opt for the voluntary early retirement package, 14 will be transferred to other locations in the Dublin area, three have indicated their willingness to transfer to the Curragh, 29 have indicated a preference to remain in the Dublin area, 33 have expressed no preference and one staff member will have retired. A number of vacancies still remain to be filled in the Dublin area and staff in Clancy Barracks have been invited to apply for these posts. Seniority is one of the factors which is taken into account when filling such posts. My Department is in discussions at present with other Departments and State agencies regarding the possibility of some personnel transferring to those Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the person referred to in the Deputy's question, I understand the employee concerned has not as of yet expressed any preference. Accordingly, I suggest that he should contact the information desk in Clancy Barracks which is staffed by officials from my Department where the specific options open to him can be discussed and explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My immediate priority is to contain the single outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The very strict control measures that were in place prior to this outbreak have enabled us to convince the EU Commission to confine the necessary temporary restrictions on our exports to other Community countries to <Col N="1013" /> animal products originating in the county of Louth. The Commission decision in this respect permits the continuation of exports of animal products, subject to relevant certification, from all parts of Ireland with the exception of County Louth. Arrangements were quickly put in place to provide the necessary certification. Exports of animal based products from County Louth can also continue subject to heat treatment of these products. I am hopeful, therefore, that given the goodwill and commitment of all those concerned that the impact of foot and mouth disease on our valuable indigenous industry can be minimised.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility for the market development and promotion of food both at home and abroad, is concentrating its efforts on ensuring the provision of accurate information and the clarification of issues as they arise, in order to correct any misinformation or confusion that would jeopardise our markets abroad. An Bord Bia's priority is the continuation of service to the markets and the maintenance of programmes to the maximum extent possible. A programme tailored specifically to the current situation is in place. The focus of this programme within all markets is on trade liaison as the main activity with plans for promotional activities within the limitations in place.</P>
      <P>The food related elements of the national development plan provide for an indicative public funding allocation of £282 million for the period to 2006 of which £48 million is earmarked for promotion and market development. This funding will be utilised by An Bord Bia to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of markets for Irish produce.</P>

      <P>The person named lodged an application under the previous scheme of early retirement from farming at her local FDS office on 30 December 1999. An exceptionally large number of applications were received in the last weeks of 1999 because 31 December was the closing date for applications under the scheme. The resulting heavy volume of work at the local office concerned meant that the file was not examined until 24 July 2000 when a number of essential core documents were found to be missing. This documentation was submitted in October 2000 and the application was subsequently deemed to be valid with effect from the date it was submitted. The person named will be paid, therefore, with effect from 30 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Before payment can be made, however, it is necessary to establish whether the applicant qualifies for a national retirement pension because she reached the age of 66 on 23 March 2001. On 5 February 2001 she was asked to provide evidence of the position. As soon as this information is received, immediate arrangements will be made to pay her the appropriate rate of pension and she will also receive the arrears due to her.</P>

      <P>The 2000 area aid application for the person named was randomly selected for inspection in accordance with EU regulations. The person named claimed a total of 21.25 hectares on his area aid application. Following the inspection an area of 18.83 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 2.42 hectares or 12.85% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P> Under article 9 of EU regulation 3887-92, the penalty is based on double the difference when the difference between area claimed and area found is between 3% and 20%. Therefore in this case a penalty of 4.84 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 13.99 hectares. Payment of his entitlement under the 2000 cattle headage scheme, amounting to £713.80, has now been issued to him as has his entitlement of £884.34 under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. No penalties applied to these payments.</P>

Documentation requested by my Department was supplied in December 2000. When this was examined it raised questions in relation to his title to part of the lands being claimed under REPS. My Department will write directly to the person named in the next few days to set out the position in full and explain its bearing on his payments under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal was established to consider applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the introduction of the milk quota system. In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors:</P>
      <P>(i)current quota size;</P>
      <P>(ii)off-farm income and/or other farm enterprises;</P>
      <P>(iii)size of holding;</P>
      <P>(iv)family circumstances, including succession;</P>
      <P>(v)commitment to dairying;</P>
      <P>(vi)financial problems and</P>
      <P>(vii)butterfat representative level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal also considers applications for temporary milk quota allocations on animal disease <Col N="1016" /> grounds. In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors:</P>
    <P>(i)herd size;</P>
    <P>(ii)period of restriction;</P>
    <P>(iii)number of reactors;</P>
    <P>(iv)previous disease problems;</P>
    <P>(v)milk yield.</P>
    <P>At the moment the tribunal is considering applications for additional temporary quota from producers who could not sell their in-calf heifers or a significant number of surplus dairy cows, other than cows to be culled, because of the current ban on livestock marts and other restrictions, which form part of the national effort to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The closing date for application forms under this measure was 14 March 2001.</P>
    <P>While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available, to meet the demands of quota from all applicants.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer applied for the one parent family allowance with effect from the 1998-99 tax year. The taxpayer's claim was refused on the grounds that the information available to the Inspector of Taxes indicated that the taxpayer was cohabiting with the mother of his child. The one parent allowance cannot be claimed by a taxpayer who is living with another person as man and wife.</P>
      <P> If the taxpayer is no longer cohabiting, and he considers that he is now eligible for the one parent family allowance, he can renew his claim for the allowance by providing the inspector with documentary evidence of his changed circumstances.</P>

      <P>The amount spent by my Department on advertising for the prevention of drug abuse and AIDS in the years 1996 to 2000 was approximately £1.28 million. However, while no specific funding has been provided to health boards for advertising in relation to this issue, funding was provided each year to develop a range of appropriate responses to the drug abuse problems in the respective boards. Since 1996 an additional sum of £32 million has been provided to health boards for drug misuse services. This additional funding covers the cost of treatment services as well as education and prevention services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on foot of a Government decision it was decided to conduct an inquiry to review all post mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970, and in particular as it relates to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside of the State and related matters.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the inquiry, Ms Anne Dunne SC, published a public notice in the national press on 23 February 2001 indicating that the inquiry had commenced its work.</P>

      <P>My Department does not directly employ psychologists to deal with persons suffering from drug addiction. The ten health boards have statutory responsibility for the provision of drug treatment services and they employ experts in this area and advise me when necessary. Three consultant psychiatrists with an expertise in drug misuse are responsible for the clinical management of drug misuse services in the health boards in the Eastern area where the majority of drug misusers <Col N="1021" /> reside. In all boards, following initial assessment, people requiring counselling and/or treatment will be referred to the relevant specialist for these services.</P>
      <P>Policy decisions are made based on international experience of best practice and on input from experts in the field of drug addiction and those working in the services of the health boards.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of information within the educational system to deal with drug addiction rests with my colleague Deputy Michael Woods, Minister for Education and Science. However, I am satisfied this information and the programmes being delivered through the formal and non-formal educational sectors are effective in helping young people to make responsible decisions regarding the use of all drugs, both legal and illegal, in their lives.</P>
      <P>The substance abuse prevention programme is a drug education and prevention programme for both primary and post-primary schools. The primary programme is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. The post primary programme is offered nation wide through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science. This programme undertakes to extensively train teachers in the methodologies required to deliver this type of programme. Teachers and schools are then supported by regional health promotion officers from the health boards.</P>
      <P>Social, personal and health education (SPHE) is a broad based lifeskills programme which has been incorporated into the curriculum of the junior cycle since September of last year. A support service to implement the programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with regional health boards, Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The substance abuse prevention programme will be incorporated into the SPHE programme in the future. Over the years a range of other programmes have been developed and implemented within schools that aim to offset or at least delay the onset of smoking, alcohol misuse and drug use. These programmes included the SmokeBusters programme, the Teaching Everyone About Cancer and Health (TEACH) programme and other regional and local initiatives supported by health boards and the health promotion unit of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the informal education and youth sector the National Youth Health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and <Col N="1022" /> Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nationwide. The programmes supported include the youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue, Knowledge is Power and Drink Awareness for Everyone. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to assist them in dealing with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work.</P>
    <P>Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
    <P>My Department and health boards will continue to support schools and the non-formal education sector in their efforts to create a greater awareness of drug issues among young people and to equip young people with the skills necessary to make responsible decisions regarding the use of drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services and organising of seminars in relation to drug misuse is a matter for health boards in the first instance. Funding is provided by my Department to health boards each year in their letters of determination to develop a range of appropriate responses to the drug problems in the respective boards. This would include initiatives to raise people's awareness of the drug problem or training seminars for those involved in delivering services to young people and also to those providing treatment. It is not possible to put a figure on the number of seminars which have taken place in health boards over the past five years. However, it would be fair to say that a large number have taken place and the following gives an outline of the types of programmes and interventions being undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, runs, or is involved in a number of initiatives which are aimed at tackling and reducing the number of young people misusing substances nationwide and most particularly within the eastern region, where the majority of problem drug misusers reside. These initiatives include supporting drug education and prevention programmes and social and personal health education (SPHE), a broad based lifeskills programme for junior certificate students, in schools. A support service to implement this programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with health boards, Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The substance abuse prevention programme On My Own Two Feet will be incorpor<Col N="1023" /> ated into the SPHE programme in the future. Teachers and schools are also often supported by regional health education officers from the health boards. Part of this support would include running regional and local seminars.</P>
    <P>Within the youth sector the national youth health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nationwide. The programmes supported include the youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue, Knowledge is Power and Drink Awareness for Everyone. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to assist them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported. Once again regular meetings and seminars are organised to provide this training and support.</P>
    <P>Within the community setting Drugs Questions, Local Answers is a community based programme offered by health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drug problem specific to their own area and then to look at ways in which the community can respond to the issues arising. The programme was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department and is delivered regionally by local people who have been trained in delivering the programme. Being Well is another community based programme which has been developed by the health promotion unit. This programme encourages people to take a holistic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol. Again this programme is supported by regional health boards and delivered by local people, who have been appropriately trained.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to target interventions on drug education at parents. In this regard Family, Communication and Self Esteem is a parenting programme which aims to look at ways in which parents can pro-actively deal with the issue of drugs within the home. This programme is supported at a regional level by health boards. A range of other parenting interventions are also supported by my Department at a regional and local level.</P>
    <P>Health boards also fund a number of voluntary organisations whose work involves prevention and treatment of drug misuse and these organisations would have run seminars with financial support from the boards. Agencies such as the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Pharmaceutical Society have also run training seminars for their members, which have been funded by health boards.</P>

      <P>The health boards have statutory responsibility for the provision of drug treatment services including the number of treatment facilities available. There are currently 55 treatment locations in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area including the mobile methadone bus service. There are two centres in the Midland Health Board and two centres in the South Eastern Health Board. The number of treatment facilities has risen from three to the present number in the last six years. In addition, health boards provide financial assistance to a number of centres run by non-statutory agencies which provide drug-free treatment and rehabilitation to drug misusers. Examples of such centres are Aislinn in Ballyragget in Kilkenny, Cuan Mhuire in Athy and Bruree and Anchor House in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The current maximum rate of the allowance is £45.60 per month and is being increased up to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001. It had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have given further consideration to this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has now been decided that while the increased rate of up to a maximum of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax concessions, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of up to a maximum of £45.60 per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years &ndash; an allowance once granted will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>

      <P>Mobile Swedish Wooden Houses are not specifically exempted <Col N="1031" /> from planning permission under the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1994-2000. However, Class 18 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 86 of 1994) exempts the keeping or storing of a caravan within the curtilage of a house provided no more than one caravan is so kept or stored and that the caravan is not used for storage, display, advertisement or sale of goods or for the purpose of any business and that no caravan is kept or stored for more than nine months in any year or occupied as a dwelling while so kept or stored.</P>
      <P>If any question arises as to what, in a particular case, is or is not development or is or is not exempted development, the question can be referred to An Bord Pleanála for decision under section 5 of the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 2000, (S.I. No. 181 of 2000) increased the size of domestic extensions that are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission from 23 square metres to 40 square metres, subject to compliance with certain conditions and limitations. The regulations specify different limits for different circumstances e.g. whether or not the house had been previously extended and whether it is detached, semi-detached or terraced. In addition, the regulations contain a number of conditions designed to ensure that the changes in relation to exempted development extensions do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties. The regulations apply to both single storey and two storey extensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in this year's budget. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>
      <P>The standard £5 per week rate of fuel allowance was set at its present level in 1985 and the smokeless fuel allowance was not increased since its introduction in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluation studies. The work<Col N="1032" /> ing group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance payment rate cannot be looked at in isolation from primary payment rates as every person who gets a fuel allowance also gets a weekly primary social welfare payment, such as unemployment assistance or old age pension. It is important that the overall increase, taking primary payments and fuel allowances together, is sufficient to fully compensate for all inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>Increases in overall weekly social welfare payment rates have compensated fully for inflation, including fuel price inflation, in the period from October 1985. For example, the total weekly payment for a single retirement pensioner with a fuel allowance rose by over 79%. This does not take into account the increases announced in this year's budget which were the largest ever provided.</P>
    <P>To put this in perspective, fuel price inflation since October 1985, as tracked in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index, was 22.8% in total. The overall consumer price index rose by 51.6% in that period.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. These facilities are considered to be a more appropriate mechanism for meeting heating needs outside the fuel season.</P>

      <Quest>if, notwithstanding recent improvements to certain categories of welfare recipients, his attention has been drawn to the completely inadequate rental support for persons in low paid work; if his attention has further been drawn to the hardship and poverty traps this causes, particularly in the Dublin area due to escalating rents; and if he will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 and take emergency measures to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000 I introduced a new £25 disregard in the assessment of means for rent supplement for people who take up part time employment or participate in training courses. As a result, a higher rate of rent supplement is paid in these cases. This ensures that the person is better off after taking up employment.</P>
      <P>In the particular case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned has a total income of £60 per week more than the standard rate of unemployment assistance payable in that household's circumstances. The total amount of rent supplement in payment is £24 less than what would ordinarily be paid and consequently, the household is £36 per week better off. This £36 comprises the £25 disregard that I introduced last year and a disregard of £11 per week towards work-related expenses, such as travel.</P>
      <P>I have now also arranged for one of my officials to contact the person in question to give her details of the full range of supports that are available in her circumstances.</P>
      <P>On the wider policy issue, I share the Deputy's concern about escalating rents in the current housing market. There is a process in place to adjust rent supplement payment levels to take account of this. Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, e.g. single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regu<Col N="1035" /> larly by the boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>Health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>An overpayment of some £9,000 was assessed against the person concerned in September 1993, after she admitted that she had continued to cash her lone parent allowance for almost two years after her marriage.</P>
      <P>The social welfare amnesty applicable at that time related to prosecution for fraudulent claims, not to the overpayments arising in such cases.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of December 2000 the person concerned had repaid £2,156 to this Department, by way of agreed monthly deductions from her child benefit payment. The balance of some £6,900 remains outstanding.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been in contact with the Department recently, seeking a review of her case. Some information has been received in support of her case and further documentation is awaited from her. As soon as this additional information is received, her situation will be reviewed in accordance with the code of practice on the recovery of overpayments and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <Quest>the guideline figures made available to community welfare officers for payment of the standard special needs payments under the supplementary benefits scheme; if the £60 clothing and footwear allowance has been increased; if so, the effective date; and if movements in the standard allowance over the past five years can be traced.</Quest>

      <P>Normal day to day clothing needs are expected to be met from weekly social welfare or health board payments. However, there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to people in certain circumstances who have clothing needs that they cannot be reasonably expected to meet from their weekly income.</P>
      <P>In 1995 my Department issued guidelines to the health boards in relation to exceptional needs and urgent needs payments. The guidelines, which were published, were aimed at ensuring greater consistency of treatment of applications for ENPs both within and between the various health boards. Specific guidance was included on the type of circumstances where payment of an ENP may be made for replacement clothing and footwear. No payment rate was specified as community welfare officers are required to examine each case on its own individual merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of an ENP payable to cover special clothing needs is a matter for the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases or in providing guidelines on standardised amounts to be paid. I am aware, however, that many of the health boards have adopted standard maximum amounts of ENPs for special clothing needs. This is for administrative reasons and ensures that people with similar needs in similar circumstances are treated in a consistent and transparent manner. The health boards in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, for example, have set a standard maximum payment of £60 for ENPs issued to adults in respect of claims for assistance with <Col N="1037" /> special clothing needs. This amount was set in 1995 and has been increased to £100 since the beginning of this year. A number of other boards have also set similar standard amounts.</P>
    <P>These internal health board guideline figures do not however restrict payment of an ENP to a specific rate where the boards consider that the circumstances of a particular case warrant the payment of a higher amount.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority is responsible for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, for including in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>I am supporting the planning authorities through the carrying out of a nation-wide survey by my Department under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999 to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. As these surveys are carried out on an area geographic basis, elements such as the monuments referred to by the Deputy will be addressed as part of that process.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of funding, all of the resources available to me in this area are dedicated to the completion of the surveys as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the proposed golf course in County Kerry, is situated in a candidate special area of conservation (SAC). The EU Habitats Directive requires the State to protect and conserve the ecological integrity of sand dune habitats. On consideration of the plan for the proposed golf course, the scientific advice was that it would damage habitats in the SAC. The Deputy will also be aware that works had commenced, which constituted a &ldquo;notifiable action&rdquo; under the Natural Habitats Regulations, 1997, without my written consent, and were, therefore, unauthorised. My Department secured an injunction to prevent any further damage.</P>
      <P>Similarly, an injunction had been taken out in respect of the proposed golf course in County Donegal, which is also located in a candidate SAC. This site was the subject of an appeal to the SAC Appeals Advisory Board, chaired by former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, which was established by me to provide a forum for people who wished to appeal on scientific grounds against the designation of their lands as SACs. Following acceptance by me of a recommendation from the SAC Appeals Advisory Board, and following provision by the developer of an undertaking not to commence any works prior to agreement with my Department on a management plan and to comply with all obligations and requirements under the Natural Habitats Regulations, 1997, the injunction was lifted by the court.</P>

      <P>The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI) received funding from my Department of £103,721 in 1999. In 2000, £150,000 was provided to the NCCRI in the estimates. An additional allocation was provided to carry out an evaluation of the forthcoming anti-racism awareness programme and to organise the National Conference on Racism. The outturn in 2000 was £215,297. My Department also provided the NCCRI with an office premises and facilities at no cost to the committee. In 2000, the NCCRI rented additional office premises at a cost of £25,000 per annum. The rent for the additional premises is paid by the NCCRI out of its annual allocation.</P>
      <P>The NCCRI also received a grant of £6,000 in 2000 from the Department of Foreign Affairs towards the costs of the National Conference on Racism. In the same year the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs provided £20,835 to the NCCRI for anti-racist initiatives under the community development programme.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the NCCRI also earned income from anti-racism awareness training. It established its own training unit which provided anti-racism awareness training to Departments, national media organisations, trade unions, employer and community organisations. The total income earned by its training unit in 2000 was £3,465.</P>
      <P>An amount of £196,000 has been allocated to the NCCRI in respect of 2001. The allocation for 2002 has been estimated at £203,000. These amounts may be amended if the NCCRI is requested to carry out additional tasks in connection with the forthcoming anti-racism awareness programme. In addition, it is expected that £50,000 will be provided in each of the years 2001 and 2002 by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the community development programme.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): I have been advised by the director general of the Irish Prison Service that statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. At present, the <Col N="1047" /> compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually and as this is an extremely time-consuming and staff-intensive process it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
    <P>A new information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prison Service is well advanced. As part of the programme, a comprehensive prisoner-records database is currently being deployed across the Prison Service. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that in regard to medical treatment for drug addiction, there were 250 prisoners in receipt of methadone maintenance and a further 56 prisoners in receipt of detoxification on 27 March 2001. The number of prisoners currently on methadone maintenance has increased by 36% on the figures of 6 December 2000. These figures indicate both my own and the prisons service's commitment to delivering a prison-based drug treatment service which is equivalent to that available in the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to lay out the numerous steps that I have put in place to try and combat the drug addiction problem among the prison population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example: all committals to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's who misuse drugs are offered a 14 day detoxification programme; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who misuse drugs are offered a 21 day detoxification programme, or less depending on their remand period; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed continue their programmes while in custody there &ndash; this development was extended to Mountjoy Prison in October, 2000, with all new committals and prisoners transferring from Cloverhill Remand Prison who were on approved treatment programmes continuing to receive this while in the prison; on-going addiction counselling and education programmes; community-based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; an information forum is provided by the education-welfare services to prisoners informing them of the risks posed by communicable diseases; a detoxification and drug-free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug free therapy programme co-ordinated by the Probation and Welfare Service and delivered by a <Col N="1048" /> multi-disciplinary team is in place; a second drug treatment programme began at the health care unit in Mountjoy in March 2000. This offers detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over 12 weeks to prisoners nearing release, with a view to returning them drug-free onto a structured drug treatment programme in the community; a new drug-free wing in St. Patrick's Institution with a capacity for 76 inmates was officially opened on 22 November 2000. An initial group of 24 staff underwent developmental training to assist them in working with the new regime. This development has proven to be very successful with the wing currently operating to full capacity.</P>
    <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved in 1999 provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request, the director general of the prisons service established a national steering group for prison-based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Senior Prisons Service Management, Probation and Welfare Service, Prisons Psychology Service and the Prison Education Service. The group submitted their first report to me in July 2000 and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing &ndash; and other expenditure-related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance, as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. A series of meetings have been held since November 2000 between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Prisons Service and health boards. Following these discussions, I understand that the position of co-ordinator of drug treatment services (prisons) identified in the steering group is due to be advertised shortly by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and that discussions will begin in the near future with the Department of Finance in regard to the other posts proposed.</P>

      <P>Under the multi-agency National Drugs Strategy Initiative, my Department conducted a drugs seminar on 6 December 1999 in the Dublin Metropolitan West Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the seminar was to provide and exchange information in order to facilitate better co-ordination and integration of services relating to the implementation of strategy plans prepared by the 13 local drugs task forces. Presentations were made by senior officials from all the rel<Col N="1050" /> evant divisions and agencies within my Department, which included Crime, Garda, Courts, Prisons, Garda Síochána (Community Relations, Garda National Drugs Unit) and the Probation and Welfare Service. The presentations addressed for the respective areas, the overall policy regarding drugs and local drugs task forces, representation on task forces, existing programmes, planned programmes, mainstreaming of funding to successfully evaluated task force projects, and other relevant issues.</P>
    <P>In addition, details in relation to drug lectures given by the Garda Síochána are contained in the Garda Síochána annual reports for the years 1995-99 and are set out as follows. The statistics for 2000 are not available yet.</P>

      <P>Both the Garda Commissioner and I are totally committed to tackling the supply of illicit drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policies in combating the drugs problem are well known: tough legislation backed by strong law enforcement in tandem with an inte<Col N="1052" /> grated partnership approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage. This combination has resulted in significant drug seizures, major Irish-based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and local communities being actively involved in dealing with problems in their own areas.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to play its role in the development of the national drugs strategy and both my Department and I are represented on the various structures that have been established to implement this strategy. This ensures that we continue to contribute to the development of integrated policies to tackle drug misuse at national and local level.</P>
    <P>The Garda tackles both major drug trafficking groups and street-level drug dealing, as well as dealing with the international aspects of drug trafficking. The major trafficking groups are constantly being targeted and a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made. Garda operations such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap continue to prove effective in targeting street dealing and the distribution of drugs in nightclubs and licensed premises. Provisional figures for 2000 indicate that the Garda made almost 7,000 arrests under these programmes last year alone.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the drugs issue remains a high priority for the Garda Síochána and enforcing the law in relation to drugs is one of the six key result areas established under the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy Document 2000-04. A number of specific performance indicators have been established within the annual policing plan to achieve the overall objective of enforcing the law in relation to drugs and specific targets have been set concerning all drug related offences.</P>
    <P>The national drug strategy unit at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides literature in relation to drugs and drug interventions upon request. Literature is provided on topics such as: local drug task force handbook; information note in relation to the young people's facilities and services fund; directory of training courses in dealing with drug misuse.</P>
    <P>In addition, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children implements a wide range of initiatives aimed at creating a greater awareness of the problems of drug misuse and preventing young people from turning to drug misuse in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The substance abuse programmes operated by the Department of Education and Science, in both primary and second level schools are structured to ensure that every child has the necessary knowledge and life-skills to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that community gardaí attached to Mountjoy Garda Station visited houses in the vicinity of the one mentioned by the Deputy last weekend and spoke to the occupants. I understand these residents indicated that they have not made any complaints to the Garda regarding anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>With regard to noise, I am further informed that on one occasion in mid-February, when the Garda were contacted regarding noise, they called to the house and the noise ceased. The Garda powers in this regard relate to ensuring that a breach of the peace does not occur and complainants may also be advised by the Garda of their civil entitlements under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>I am assured there is no suggestion of anti-social behaviour in this locality; neither have there been any complaints relating to lack of response from the gardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated by my Department to People with Disabilities in Ireland Limited, PwDI, for 2001 is £1,000,000. PwDI, formerly the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, was established in March 2000. Elections under the new constitution to most of the network committees around the country took place in late 2000 and early 2001. A few remaining networks have yet to complete their election procedures.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the articles of association for a maximum of 30 network committees and each committee, which has at least ten elected members, may appoint one person to the board of PwDI. In addition, the board may co-opt a further two members, bringing the potential board membership to a maximum of 32. An interim board, comprising the seven person steering group, appointed by me in January 1999, and two other nominated members, will remain in place for approximately three months after the appointment of the first elected board of PwDI to facilitate the transition.</P>
      <P>It was proposed to hold an induction course for nominees to the new board on 10 March 2001. This course was postponed owing to then current restrictions in relation to foot and mouth disease. A new date for the induction course has been set for 7 April 2001 in view of revised instructions issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that within one month of the induction course, the board nominees will be invited to a meeting at which the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, in this instance the members of the steering group, will formally appoint them to the board, in accordance with <Col N="1055" /> paragraph 54 of the memorandum and articles of association of PwDI.</P>
    <P>The groundwork has been laid in developing this democratic process for people with disabilities. I look forward to the imminent completion of the process and to the emergence of a vibrant and active representational forum.</P>
    <P>On another disability issue raised recently in parliamentary questions, I would like to take this opportunity of clarifying what the position is with regard to a possible constitutional amendment in the area of disability equality.</P>
    <P>As you know, both the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy M. Wallace, and I outlined that there was a recommendation by the Constitutional Review Group for an amendment to Article 40.1 of the Constitution to provide for equality and non-discrimination. The group recommended the following wording in regard to discrimination.</P>
    <P>No person shall be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on any ground such as sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, colour, language, culture, religion, political or other opinion, national, social or ethnic origin, membership of the travelling community, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>The part of the reply to the parliamentary questions which related to a proposal for this amendment to be put before the electorate was based on the understanding held by my Department about the working approach being adopted by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. However, it is now understood that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee proposes to complete its work on the institutions of State and then deal with the area of fundamental rights. The equality amendment will be considered in the context of the latter tranche of proposals. I hope this clarification is of assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services which is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers has entered into an agreement with the proprietor of Mosney Holiday Centre for the provision of full board accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers on part of the centre. <Col N="1056" /> The centre, together with all its facilities, including the caravan park, remains in the ownership of its proprietor.</P>
      <P>As such, the siting of mobile homes at Mosney is a matter, in the first instance, for the proprietor. He has indicated that they were formerly accommodated there on foot of an annual licence and that the owners of the mobile homes were informed by him late last year that no new licences would be issued.</P>
      <P>The proprietor has further indicated that a number of mobile homes have already been removed from the centre and that more are likely to be removed in the near future.</P>

      <P>The overall aim of the Government's drugs strategy is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. The Deputy is probably aware that my Department is currently finalising a review of the National Drugs Strategy. The overall aim is to ensure that the policies and strategies which are being pursued at present remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground. The review will be published in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of this Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund was established in 1998. The fund assists in the prevention of drug abuse, through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or has the potential to develop. The aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at <Col N="1057" /> risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas to these facilities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. More than £37 million has been allocated by the Government to support over 340 facilities and services projects under the fund.</P>
    <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs was established by the Government in July 2000. Its role is to advise the Government in relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of the drug problem in Ireland, based on the committee's analysis and interpretation of research findings and information available to it. It is overseeing the delivery of a three year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland. </P>
    <P>Meanwhile, local drugs task forces have been operating in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly that of heroin, since 1997. The task forces bring together key State agencies to work with the local community and voluntary groups to develop appropriate responses to local drug problems. Over 200 projects were allocated funding to pilot a range of interventions and, following detailed evaluation, it was decided last year to mainstream over 120 of these projects. Currently, the task forces are updating their plans for the next three years and the Government has provided £15 million <i>per annum</i> for this purpose. The Cabinet Committee <Col N="1058" /> on Social Inclusion has already considered and approved funding of over £3.6 million for plans from six task forces covering a variety of initiatives in the areas of prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction. The other task forces are still developing their plans for consideration by the Cabinet Committee.</P>

      <P>I understand that the school to which the Deputy refers already has the services of a remedial teacher on a full-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999, the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools in the <Col N="1063" /> country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil:teacher ratios were advised that they could seek a remedial service if they could demonstrate a need for such a service. All available remedial teacher posts have been allocated as part of the process of extending the service on a nation-wide basis.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Guardian Angels national school will be taken fully into account in the event of additional remedial teacher posts becoming available for allocation.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to address the possible outcome of the benchmarking exercise under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P> Currently, the pensions of retired teachers are increased in line with general pay increases, which apply to all employees in the State, and special pay increases, which apply specifically in the case of teachers. In addition to general increases and special increases, a teacher's pay may also be increased through restructuring, which can take the form of restructuring an existing allowance or introducing a new allowance. Restructuring increases are fully reflected in the pensions of all teachers who had the benefit of the restructuring increases in pay.</P>
      <P>The general issue of pension increases for public servants is considered in the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published in January. The Government intends to make formal decisions on the implementation of the Commission's recommendations, including those relating to future pensions increase policy, once it has had an opportunity to consider the report in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>The ERCs records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils in the school with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the ERC for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question have been forwarded to the ERC. In order to advance consideration of this school's situation, the ERC wrote to the school on 20 March requesting further information before 6 April. When the ERC has received and considered the school's response, my Department will then be in a position to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy and all students and their parents that the 2001 certificate examin<Col N="1067" /> ations will proceed without any diminution in either the integrity or validity of the examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the results of the examinations may issue later than usual if delays are experienced during the marking process. Some delay may be unavoidable in the case of <Col N="1068" /> the junior certificate. The priority will be to ensure that standards are maintained. It is essential that the high reputation enjoyed by our public examinations continues and that public confidence in the examination system is preserved. As the Deputy may know, discussions are at an advanced stage in the Labour Court. A successful outcome to these talks would be helpful.</P>
