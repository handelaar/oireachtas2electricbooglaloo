      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately. I call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Gay Mitchell and now call on him to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the following urgent public business, namely, the need for a statement from the Minister for Health and Children on the capacity of hospitals to handle emergencies; the critical state of the ambulance service; the lack of sufficient medications to meet certain types of emergencies and the need for more urgent, comprehensive and proactive steps to prepare for national emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing Order 31 and therefore cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second topic, I have received notice from Deputy Seamus Healy and now call on him to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the call by Mrs. Mary Robinson for the suspension of the bombing of Afghanistan in order to facilitate the provision of emergency aid to its citizens and to arrest the death toll of 300,000 children each year.</P>

    <P>In regard to the third topic, I have received <Col N="878" /> notice from Deputy Trevor Sargent and now call on him to state the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I request that Dáil Éireann be suspended under Standing Order 31 to address the urgent need for a co-ordinated and properly resourced emergency plan to instantly respond to any direct or indirect attack on Ireland &ndash; or close to Ireland &ndash; involving biological, chemical, nuclear or other means and to include the establishment of facilities in Ireland to quickly test for anthrax, for example. The Government needs to respond quickly given the mockery being made in our newspapers which are saying: &ldquo;please do not bomb before Christmas because we are not ready&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business shall be No. 25, the motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 4) Regulations, 2001 &ndash; returned from Committee; No. 2 the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage and No. 55 the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 25, shall be decided without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 25, the motion re the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 4) Regulations 2001, to be taken without debate agreed to? Agreed. We shall now take leaders' questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a divergence of policy position between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on the proposed abortion referendum. I would like the Taoiseach to clarify that. The Taoiseach is probably aware that in his absence yesterday the Tánaiste said that while her party was committed to the legislation which is being published, no date had been agreed for a referendum. Not very much hinges on that. She went on to say that in her view, unless there was a consensus &ndash; whatever that means &ndash; there would not be a referendum. Subsequently a spokesperson on her behalf is quoted in the newspapers as saying,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I don't believe the Government would enter into a referendum process with a proposal they didn't believe was going to get passed. What we are keen to avoid here is a repetition of the Nice Treaty debacle. There were lessons to be <Col N="879" /> learned there. You can't take people for granted on this issue.</P>
    <P>Is there to be a referendum? Is it contingent on a consensus emerging either in the House or outside it? What is the position? There are comments attributed to the Progressive Democrats' Whip saying that Second Stage should continue into the spring and that the debate should be so open-ended as to be indefinite. We need clarification from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Fine Gael's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that the Taoiseach is regretting allowing the Tánaiste take leaders' questions yesterday. I anticipate that her future outings on these occasions will be severely curtailed and tightly monitored. She was let out of the box yesterday morning and indicated that the Government &ndash; as distinct from the Fianna Fáil party dominant within the Government &ndash; would not proceed to fix the date for a referendum until such time as it was guaranteed or reasonably assured of success. Can we take it that we are into Government by opinion poll?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mention confidence&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Keep taking the tablets Deputy Roche.</P>
      <P>From what the Tánaiste said yesterday can we take it that the date of the referendum has not yet been set? The Taoiseach has indicated that before to the House, so there is nothing new in it. More pertinently, is the Government's position on the issue today that no date will be set and no referendum called unless it is reassured by opinion polls on the one hand and consensus, whatever that means, on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea to repeat to the House the comments made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, some of which have been quoted this morning. I checked them and she stated.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to put forward legislation that will be put to the people in a referendum. If this legislation is adopted by the people, it can only be changed in a subsequent referendum. The Government has not decided when that referendum will take place because, clearly, it would not be wise to proceed down the road of a referendum if we cannot build consensus, particularly among those in the middle, around this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, the Government has not taken a decision on the date. Our position is we <Col N="880" /> hope to have the legislation ready before Christmas. Given that we have three months to do so, there are no grounds to be worried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It leaves plenty of time to go through a Bill and clear it before Christmas. As I have said, I do not believe January would be a good month for a referendum. Therefore, February would be the earliest opportunity. However, we still have to fix a date. I hope we will get broad support, but I have made it clear several times that I do not expect we will get full support. That is what the Tánaiste meant by &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; on this decision. We will have the referendum. I hope Deputy Noonan will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will know from his extensive experience in Government that when a Minister brings a proposal for a Bill to Cabinet, he usually has answers to every possible question that contrary colleagues around the table might put to him. I presume when Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, proposed this Bill he possessed a full brief with which he could have answered all possible questions. Why has it taken two weeks to answer the questions I put to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>Today's <i>Irish Independent </i>has a banner headline declaring our anthrax defence has been exposed as a shambles. No doubt the Taoiseach has been briefed on the story for questions this morning. The article proceeds to explain and describe in fairly horrifying detail the level of chaos which has become normality in major hospitals and emergency installations around the country. In light of events in other countries and the fact that most national systems around the world have been on some kind of alert since 11 September five weeks ago, what is the state of the national emergency plan and who is responsible for drafting it? We know Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, is responsible for repelling a nuclear attack&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A specific protocol to deal with a suspected anthrax attack has been prepared and is in operation. The protocol deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack, in particular, patient treatment, management, post-exposure and guidelines. The protocol is being issued to the fire service, the Garda, the Defence Forces and directors of public health. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax. These are available on the Department website at www.health.ie. In general, if a suspicious package or letter is received, the advice is to place the package in a plastic bag or a sealed container in order to prevent leakage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The room or premises should then be evacuated and the Garda contacted immediately.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan's important question, the Garda should be contacted in the first instance. They are responsible for contacting the appropriate agencies, the fire service, Defence Forces, directors of public health. In the event of exposure to anthrax, the Irish Medicines Board has confirmed sufficient quantities of antibiotics are available.</P>
      <P>On a separate matter, I was asked a question during the week on the penalties for sending hoax mail. There is legislation on this matter, but it dates back to 1908. I have asked that it be reviewed. It is a criminal offence to send a package containing any dangerous or noxious substance by post. Indictments can lead to small fines but, depending on circumstances, prosecutions can also be brought for murder, manslaughter and assault. The problem is the difficulty with getting convictions. That area, therefore, will need to be reassessed. The legislation exists, however, so people should not believe they can have fun and play games with the issue. On the other hand, we also need to be conscious there might be more sinister people involved. For that reason we are reviewing the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> The Government has set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence. Its purpose is to take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat. There is already a national emergency plan, which health and local authorities deal with and have successfully used in the past when terrible events such as the Stardust tragedy or bombings have occurred. That plan is being continuously updated by the authorities. The new body will examine the new threat from international terrorism and the possibility of an escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses of the various agencies. We endeavour to proceed on a similar basis to our efforts earlier in the year with the foot and mouth disease outbreak. The office is chaired by the Minister of Defence. It includes the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by association the Garda, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and by association the local authorities and the Department of Public Enterprise and by association the radiological protection agencies and other associated groups. The group will meet as often as is required to co-ordinate events.</P>
    <P>The reality, which was made clear to me again yesterday in Brussels, is that the best funded countries in the world, with the biggest armies and laboratories and the best police forces, are having major difficulties getting a handle on this and so are we. However, we must try to the best of our ability and as quickly as possible. European procedures on this issue are either non-existent or very sketchy, but we must move as quickly and efficiently as possible. I assure the House that we will do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation would be funny if it was not sad; and it would be sad if it was not now deadly serious because since 11 September the reality is that the world is changed in terms of national and international security. We live quite close to a major terrorist target &ndash; Sellafield &ndash; which could cause devastation along the entire east coast of this island. The total lack of preparedness revealed yesterday in the many different sentences that the Taoiseach spoke on the record of the House and which will have to be parsed and analysed, is frightening. During one of his statements, he said that the new plan is already in existence, as least that is what I think I heard &ndash; he may have gone on to contradict that.</P>

The Taoiseach's comprehensive reply indicated that the plan had been agreed even though the Minister for Health and Children said it was not in his bi-lateral signalling semaphore across the floor of the House. It is quite evident notwithstanding anything that the Taoiseach said in his reply this morning that the people to whom ordinary citizens would turn in the first instance if they felt that they were suffering from some form of biological attack &ndash; the staff in the hospitals &ndash; have no knowledge of what to do or how to deal with it. There is no point in the Minister for Health and Children screwing up his face; the reality is what happened yesterday as described in the newspapers&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am more worried about today than yesterday. I regret if there was any confusion on some of these issues yesterday. The Eastern Region Health Authority will have to answer that <Col N="885" /> question. The protocol was launched yesterday. It is available on the website, www. health.ie and can be accessed by everybody. People should not wait for information to be sent out because it is there on the website.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked a correct and simple question when he inquired as to what happens and who is responsible. People in that situation should contact the Garda and they will contact the appropriate agencies. If members of the public have any concern or fear of any potential threat, they should contact the Garda and it is the responsibility of the Garda to contact the other appropriate agencies, the fire service, the Defence Forces, public health directors. There is a protocol on this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn's first question was about Sellafield. Plans have been in place for a long period to deal with any kind of tragic event happening in Sellafield.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001, to the House. I have already initiated the Bill in the Seanad where we had a useful and interesting discussion. Amendments agreed on Committee Stage have led to greater clarity in certain aspects of the Bill. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for: the establishment of an independent and commercial statutory State body, the Railway Procurement Agency; a single statutory railway order procedure for the approval of railway infrastructure projects, including light rail and metro; and the regulation of light rail services when operating on street.</P>
      <P>As its title indicates, the main focus of the Bill is on railway infrastructure. Provision of high quality infrastructure to support a reliable and efficient public transport system is one of the greatest challenges facing us today. This is particularly true in the case of our urban centres where an increasing level of car ownership has resulted in a serious problem of congestion which, if unchecked, will threaten our future economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a public transport investment strategy for the period 2000-06 designed to achieve a radical transformation of the public transport system. Investment of £2.2 billion is provided for in the plan for public transport. This is an unprecedented level of funding which will enable significant advances to be made in the coming years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report progress to date in delivering a number of public transport projects under the NDP. For example, since 1999, 275 additional buses have been acquired by Dublin Bus, 16 new DART carriages entered into service this year, 60 ARROW rail cars have been ordered with delivery commencing in 2003, and 148 new buses were acquired by Bus Éireann in 2000 &ndash; 40 for the greater Dublin area and the remainder for use in provincial cities, towns and for rural services. In addition, Dublin Bus has acquired 156 replacement buses in the past two years. I am pleased also to report that an improved rail service to Maynooth commenced in August last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a railway safety programme is under way involving investment of £430 million by Iarnród Éireann in the period 1999 to 2003. To date in excess of 220 miles of track have been upgraded as part of this programme along with safety improvements to 189 level crossings, with work on some 50 further crossings to take place before the year end. Approximately 190 bridges have been renewed with work on a further 45 to be completed by end of year. This safety work will continue in 2002. I intend to publish a Bill <Col N="893" /> later this year to provide for the establishment of a new regulatory framework for railway safety.</P>
    <P>Turning to the light rail system for Dublin to which this Government has been committed, I am glad to report significant progress in the provision of the first phase of the Luas involving services from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. Almost all utilities and enabling works contracts have been awarded and many have now been completed. The main construction contract involving track laying and cabling has been awarded and work is progressing satisfactorily. The depot at the Red Cow has been completed. Some 40 trams have been ordered and the first will be delivered in the coming weeks. A competition for the award of the operator's contract for the first lines is progressing with a view to the preferred candidate being selected by the end of 2001. The construction of both lines remains on target for completion in 2003 with passenger services commencing shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Commuters from Tallaght and Sandyford who will travel on Luas into the city centre will enjoy a quality and reliable service which will serve as an example of the standard that public transport can and must deliver for the future. Extensions of Luas and a metro are also badly needed to serve other parts of the city. The Dublin Transportation Office strategy document, A Platform for Change, sets out the measures that need to be taken to provide a public transport network to meet the demands of the coming years. The proposals in the document are being examined at present. As Members may be aware, the Government has already approved, in principle, the development of a metro system for Dublin. Immediately following this decision, I asked the light rail project office of CIE to commence the necessary preparatory work and report progress to me on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>We are now on the brink of an era of reform in the public transport sector and that is why new structures are required to deliver quality public transport projects. The construction of the metro and the extension of the light rail network will require the focus and attention of an implementing body and that is why I propose, under the Bill, to establish the Railway Procurement Agency. In the meantime, in order to allow the preparatory work to continue, I have appointed an interim railway procurement agency to take a preliminary position on the procurement process pending enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The ongoing work on Luas of which I have spoken is being co-ordinated by the light rail project office of CIE. This office, suitably restructured and expanded, will form the starting point for the new agency. In line with the July 2000 Government decision on light rail, a franchise will be allocated for the operation of the Luas lines. I intend that the Railway Procurement Agency, when established, will be the contracting authority for this franchise. Appointment of the interim agency last July will ensure that there will <Col N="894" /> be minimum delay in formally establishing the agency once the legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>The light rail project office has already commenced initial feasibility work for the procurement of the metro. I will bring specific proposals on the metro development to Government in the coming weeks with a view to commencing the procurement process before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As always, money will play a vital role in determining the priorities for the construction of projects. The magnitude of the public transport infrastructure projects identified and the costings means that the Exchequer alone will not be in a position to provide all of the funding required. We must look at new ways of financing large infrastructural projects as outlined in the national development plan and the DTO strategy. In this regard, the proper application of public-private partnerships, PPPs, offers huge potential benefits to the State in meeting this investment gap. The emphasis in any PPP should be on genuine collaboration between the private and public sectors, combining traditional public sector values with the perceived efficiencies of the private sector in order to deliver high quality public capital infrastructure and services. Advantages of PPPs, such as value for money, optimum risk allocation, the inherent focus on services and accelerated delivery of projects, have considerable appeal for major transport projects. The Bill gives the Railway Procurement Agency all the necessary powers to apply the most appropriate procurement process, including PPP, in the delivery of its projects.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the success of the overall PPP programme must also be closely linked to our social partnership model. This system of delivering stability through consensus on major economic, social and other issues is one of the main reasons for our recent economic success. Successful PPPs must also be built on the development and maintenance of trust between key stakeholders and shared objectives for the delivery to the public of quality public transport. In this context, I welcome the input of the wide group of social partners represented on the public transport partnership forum to transport policy generally and the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The work done by the public-private advisory group on PPPs in developing a framework for public-private partnerships is also extremely important. The advisory group includes representatives of the social partners in addition to departmental PPP units. I am pleased to note that this framework has been agreed by all parties and will be formally launched by the Minister for Finance on 1 November. It represents an important step in clarifying guidelines for participation of the public and private sectors in PPP arrangements. In addition, it will ensure there is a coherent and consistent approach across the public service in advancing Ireland's PPP programme. The advisory group will also monitor and review implementation and adherence to the framework. The <Col N="895" /> Railway Procurement Agency will be required to conform with these guidelines.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support the ICTU has given to the Bill. In its recently published document, The Route to Success, it recognises the need for the creation of a railway procurement agency with the remit to procure an operator for Luas and ensure the development of the metro in Dublin through PPP. In order to advance the application of PPP for construction of the metro my Department recently undertook a market consultation exercise on the procurement of the metro. The response to the consultation has been positive, with a significant level of response from major companies both in Ireland and across the world. An analysis of the responses has taken place and will assist with the preparation of procurement documentation.</P>
    <P>This consultation will lead to what will be a key factor in the success of PPPs in transport, the development of a PPP public transport model appropriate to Ireland and which has the potential to contribute to the delivery of high quality public services. My Department undertook a consultation process on the proposals contained in the general scheme of the Bill and the views of the parties which responded have been taken into consideration in its drafting.</P>
    <P>The Bill is separated into five main parts. Part 1 contains standard sections covering the short title, interpretations, repeals, continuations and so forth. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the Railway Procurement Agency. Part 3 details the statutory approval procedures for any new railway infrastructural project. Part 4 deals with the on-street regulation of light railways and Part 5 contains various miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains many standard provisions in relation to the short title of the Bill, the interpretation of words and phrases used and procedures under the Bill for laying orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In particular, section 3 provides for the repeal of sections 2 to 11 of the Transport Act, 1963, and the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, which deal with the approval process for heavy and light rail projects respectively. However, many of the provisions of the 1996 Act will be re-enacted in Part 3 of the Bill. It is proposed that a single statutory approval mechanism will be introduced for heavy rail and light rail, central to which is a mandatory public inquiry prior to the granting of a railway order.</P>
    <P>Part 2, sections 8 to 35, contains sections directly related to the establishment of the Railway Procurement Agency and are similar to many found in other legislation establishing commercial State bodies. There are provisions dealing with the establishment of subsidiaries, annual reports and accounts and the format of such accounts as well as the appointment of the board, the chief executive and staff of the agency. The agency will be required to account for its activi<Col N="896" /> ties if called before a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agency are set out in section 11. They will relate to the procurement of metro and light rail. The possibility of extending the remit of the agency to all railway infrastructure will be considered in the context of possible future legislation relating to the regulation of the public transport market generally. It is proposed in section 11 that the agency may enter into agreements with other bodies to finance such projects by means of concession, joint venture, public-private partnership or any other means and to acquire and facilitate the development of land close to a railway where such acquisition and development will contribute to the economic viability of the railway.</P>
    <P>Provisions in relation to the composition of the agency, its chief executive and staff are dealt with in sections 20 to 29. These provisions follow recent examples of legislation establishing new State bodies. Section 24 allows the agency to appoint staff and provides for the transfer of staff of the CIE light rail project office to the agency. Sections 33 to 35 provide a mechanism for the transfer of property, rights and liabilities, and the continuation of any pending legal proceedings in relation to the Dublin light railway project, from CIE to the agency.</P>
    <P>Part 3, sections 36 to 53, deals with the statutory approval procedure for applications for railway orders to construct, operate and maintain railway infrastructure. It applies provisions similar to those contained in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, which makes the holding of a public inquiry mandatory for all such applications. I am satisfied that these arrangements have worked well for Luas and should be maintained. In that regard, I pay tribute to Judge O'Leary and those who helped him on that project.</P>
    <P>Railway developments, as authorised by the Minister and as specified in a railway order, are to be exempted development in the context of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. However, the interests of planning authorities and the public are protected by other provisions in the Bill which require statutory consultation with the planning authorities and any person directly affected by the proposed railway works. Furthermore, any application for a railway order must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>Before making a decision on whether to grant a railway order section 43 obliges the Minister to consider the application and accompanying documentation, the report of the public inquiry and any submissions made by any person or planning authority. Where the Minister is of the opinion that an application for a railway should be granted, he or she will make an order subject to such conditions, restrictions, requirements or other terms as he or she sees fit. A railway order cannot come into operation until a two month period for application for judicial review has <Col N="897" /> expired or on the determination or withdrawal of such judicial review.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill, sections 54 to 62, deals with the on-street regulation of light railways. Although the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, made general legal provision for the construction and operation of light railways, it did not deal with the specific legal aspects of its day-to-day operation and, in particular, its operation on-street. The regulation of traffic is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and governed by the Road Traffic Acts. As these Acts apply only to &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicles,&rdquo; the definition of which specifically excludes trams, the Bill extends certain necessary provisions of these Acts to ensure they cover light rail vehicles. Among the safety matters covered in this part are speed limits and qualifications and competencies required by a driver of a light rail vehicle.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill, Part 5, sections 63 to 71, contains miscellaneous provisions such as the creation of penalties for trespass on a railway or unlawful use of a railway. In addition, the Minister or the agency may make by-laws in relation to railways under section 65. Provision is also made for CIE, with the consent of the Minister of the day and the Minister for Finance, to set up one or more subsidiary companies under the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>Section 71 amends the Transport (Re-Organisation of CIE) Act, 1986, to allow for an increase in the number of board members of the three CIE subsidiaries Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. This has the effect of increasing the maximum number of directors and removes the requirement to have a majority of directors common to both Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann. This is designed to give each of the bodies a stronger strategic focus and in the case of larnród Éireann is consistent with the recommendations in the report of the three wise men, The Way Forward, published last July.</P>
    <P>This Bill plays an important role in providing a structure under which railway infrastructure can be developed. Once this agency is in place we will begin to see real progress in having a metro and future extensions of the light rail system to parts of the city where demand will increase in the coming years. In parallel, the focus of the agency will be on ensuring that Luas operates within schedule. All the indications are that this is happening. The Luas vehicles are already arriving and in two years' time, a light rail service will begin operating from Sandyford and Tallaght to the city centre.</P>
    <P>While I want debate on this Bill, I hope it will have an early passage into law. I say that without at all cutting across the democratic process, which is, that any Member who wants to is entitled to speak on any Bill. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>The first thought that springs to mind is whether this new procurement agency is necessary. The travelling public will feel justified in asking whether the level or quality of service which they can expect will be improved. Their primary concern is whether the new agency will provide a higher standard of service than that which they could have expected if management of the new lines had been left to the existing management agencies, the holding company, CIE, and the management company, Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that CIE has been starved of resources over the years, a large question mark hangs over the manner in which CIE and Iarnród Éireann management have performed. As that aspect is the subject of an inquiry in a different forum, I cannot comment further on that.</P>
      <P>We are now well into 2001 and, as far as I am aware, there is still not a train timetable for this new year. When one queries the matter, one is told it is the same as for 2000. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The industrial relations track record of the company has been appalling. This State rail company owned by the Minister has left the nation's commuters stranded time and again. While the unions must shoulder their share of the blame, particularly where lightning strikes and unofficial strikes are concerned, there is undoubtedly an ongoing human resource management malaise within the company. The company has brought in somebody whom they describe as a human resource manager, but the human resource management within the company is not adequate or satisfactory. I am not satisfied that the heavyweights brought in by the Minister have sorted out the difficulties in the area of industrial relations. I hope I am wrong, time will tell.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise in a number of her policy statements has made integrated ticketing one of her main flagship proposals. We have listened to its merits being extolled in successive debates and in press announcements. Integrated ticketing would cost very little. Its advantages are obvious. All that is required is imagination, organisation and co-ordination, yet it has not happened. We have listened to the Minister laud the advantages of park and ride. It is a perfectly logical proposal. The idea was that up to 10% of commuters would switch to public transport. They would abandon their cars at established locations on the outer perimeters of the city and would take either the bus or the train for the remainder of their journey into the city. While a certain limited amount of park and ride has happened in terms of bus transport nothing has happened in terms of train usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the projects to be managed by the new agency is Luas. We heard the Minister in the House yesterday and today talk about the Luas <Col N="899" /> being completed in 2003. She makes a subtle distinction between completed and commissioned, as to when the project will be completed as against when it will be up and running. It will not be up and running in 2003. Preliminary work got off to a bad start 18 months behind schedule. Construction work will take at least another 18 months and the training of drivers and testing of the system could take from a year to 18 months. The truth is that, from the point of view of Luas being up and running, commissioned and transporting people, we are talking about at least 2005. We will not see passengers on board Luas traversing the streets and roads of Dublin until at least 2005 or possibly longer and all the while the light rail office continues to spend public moneys with expensive front page advertisements in national daily newspapers assuring the general public that Luas is literally around the corner.</P>

        <b>:</b> I would wager that if the Minister and I travelled on the train to Mayo this evening, we would have the same experience as many commuters have had in the past two years. One can fly from Shannon to New York or Boston in five hours. In the past two years, furious commuters from Mayo have gone on Mid West Radio to recount their experiences during the 160-mile journey from Dublin to Westport, which takes five hours. Passengers are packed in like sardines. Up to 50 people, some of them elderly pensioners or people coming from hospitals in Dublin, have to stand in aisles or in spaces between carriages. On many occasions, no trolley service is offered. Those who wish to avail of dining car facilities cannot do so, as passengers have no option but to spill into the dining car when there are no seats available elsewhere.</P>
      <P>One of the saddest sights in terms of railway infrastructure is to see the overgrown foundations of defunct railway lines that were closed 20 or 30 years ago. The Collooney to Claremorris line was closed 30 years ago, but thanks to the determination of the western rail action committee, headed by Fr. Micheál McGréil, it has remained intact, although in a state of decay and disrepair. If reopened, the line would link Sligo to Limerick and on to Waterford. It would mean reopening the section between Claremorris and Athenry, which would make perfect environmental and economic sense.</P>
      <P>I recently asked the Minister what the capital cost of repairing the line would be. She told me that it would cost £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> That is right. I recently rang Mr. Joe Beirne, the Mayo county engineer, to inquire as to the cost of the new seven miles of road between Knock and Claremorris. The total cost of the new road, which is currently under construction and which will bypass the two towns in question, is estimated to be £45 million. We should compare a cost of £45 million for seven miles of roadway to £100 million to rebuild 70 miles of rail track between Collooney and Athenry. Every morning, hundreds of workers from north, east and south Mayo commute to Galway or Sligo in private cars on roads which are increasingly choked with traffic. The commuters of Mayo would love to use a railway ser<Col N="902" /> vice which would take them right into the heart of Sligo or Galway in 45 minutes.</P>
      <P>I understand that studies have been officially commissioned into this line and a number of other lines. In the event of defunct lines being reopened, is it envisaged that they will come within the remit of the procurement agency which is being debated in the House and for which we are passing legislation? There is huge merit in reopening closed lines. A new railway line should be constructed between Dungarvan and Youghal to facilitate a link between the cities of Cork and Waterford. Similarly, serious consideration should be given to other lines as alternatives to road. A line between Dublin and Navan is under construction, but we should seriously consider an extension of that line to Monaghan, Cavan, Enniskillen and Bundoran. Rail transport is the way to go.</P>
      <P>I welcome the concept of public private partnership, an area in which there is great potential. There is a reasonable prospect of a return on investment where there is a high population and a high turnover. Along with the obvious merits of social and commercial partnership, the reduction of the burden on the public purse by drawing private finance into major proposals is attractive. I do not see such partnership as a viable option in many parts of the country, such as in rural Ireland where profits cannot be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The issues of privatisation and ownership require a clear policy statement from the Government. I do not believe the privatisation of the rail system is an option.</P>

        <b>:</b> On our doorstep, in the United Kingdom, we have the finest example of a country where privatisation became the dogma and the sacred cow, but where it has been an absolute shambles. Safety has been compromised in the UK, where there are no trains, slow trains, high fares, chaotic timetables, accidents, deaths and major tragedies. It is a clear lesson for us. The idea was to provide competition to produce lower prices and to increase efficiency, but the net outcome has been a disaster. As we speak, private companies which entered the market with such zest and appetite are being bought out by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this Bill, where is the demarcation between CIE and the new procurement agency? Where is the demarcation between the holding company and the new agency? I look with a certain amount of dissatisfaction and concern at the fact that all seven members of the board are to be appointed by the Minister. Why was it not possible to assess a number of agencies and organisations to find those who have a specialist interest in aspects of the rail industry, rather than giving the power to nominate people to the board entirely to the Minister for Public Enterprise? It should have been possible to look at different sectors to determine the people who <Col N="903" /> should be allowed a key input and whose expertise would be of benefit. The entire discretion for the nomination of the board should not have been given to the Minister. Time and time again, unfortunately, cronyism has become the main qualification for appointments to State boards. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is not the only Minister to have done this.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance managed to change the mind of the Minister for Public Enterprise regarding the ESB, so I am worried, but she may hold firm on this.</P>
      <P>I live in the midlands and I am anxious about railway services from the midlands to Dublin. In the 1920s, there was a double rail track from Tullamore to Dublin. I am not sure if the double track extended to Athlone, but the Minister can check that for me. The double rail track stops in Portarlington, but the bridges are wide enough to accommodate such a track. I ask the Minister to do everything possible to ensure the Dublin to Portarlington double rail track is extended to Tullamore, Athlone and the west. This is most important and, as a representative of the midlands, I ask the Minister to place particular emphasis on the extension of the double rail track from Dublin to Tullamore and Athlone, which is near and dear to her. It is essential that this matter is addressed.</P>
      <P>I understand many of the problems regarding additional train services and lines are related to Heuston Station. Most of the trains entering and exiting the station go under the one bridge and this limits the opportunity to expand lines. There is a need for approximately six additional lines into Heuston Station and I ask the Minister to consider the expansion and improvement of the station. This would allow rail services to be further developed and this matter should be addressed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the double rail track, the Minister is aware that the Arrow service has been extended to Portlaoise. It is a limited service but it is up and running. Iarnród Éireann should extend the Arrow service to Tullamore and <Col N="905" /> Athlone. The Minister is aware of the relatively good train service from Athlone to Dublin, but it is very limited in that there are no trains between 9.30 a.m. and around 1 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>At 12:50 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no further trains until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. The service is also limited on the return leg. A huge number of people would leave their cars at home if there was an expanded timetable. I ask the Minister to consider that important aspect because it would help reduce the number of people travelling by car.</P>
      <P>When I first travelled to Leinster House in the 1970s, I could make the journey at a normal speed from Birr to Leinster House in two hours. I can now travel from Birr to Newlands Cross in 90 minutes but it could take up to a further two hours to reach Leinster House from there. The real blockage is from Newlands Cross to the centre. Iarnród Éireann and the railway procurement agency should consider developing huge car parks on the edge of Dublin and providing good light rail or bus services into the city centre. The delays people now experience entering and leaving the city are severe.</P>
      <P>The midlands needs a double rail track, the extension of the Arrow service and a greater frequency of train services. There is also a need for trains to run later in the evenings to the midlands, for example, up to 9.30 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. I agree with the points raised by Deputy Jim Higgins. The wise men in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s who were in charge of CIE came, in the main, from the Minister's side of the House. When deputations about railway line closures met these men, they were laughed at and told to go home because the car was the way of the future and railways were no longer viable. Numerous railways lines were closed, but I welcome Deputy Higgins's proposal for a line linking Sligo, Limerick, Waterford, Athenry and Claremorris. This is the way forward. Irrespective of what the National Roads Authority does, there still will be major congestion on the roads. Railways lines are the way to proceed. This is immensely important and it should be progressed.</P>
      <P>Every day we are told about the establishment of new bodies, but they cost a fortune to run. I have doubts about the need for many of them, but I will reluctantly agree to the establishment of this body on the firm understanding that it is not the first step towards the privatisation of our rail tracks. The people paid for the development of railway lines. The money invested in them was provided by the people and they own the railways. I do not want wealthy individuals to take over our railways lines because they belong to the people and should remain in public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this issue, we should remind ourselves why there is a need for public transport and consider what form it should take. We are discussing an effective and efficient <Col N="906" /> means of moving large numbers of people from one place to another in the shortest possible time and in the most comfortable way. Various means have been devised to do this, including by rail, bus or air. Unfortunately, another mode of transport has been developed that is expensive and is a polluter, but it is the main mode of transport now for most people.</P>
      <P>Public transport should be identified as an important means of connection in terms of people communicating with each other in rural and isolated areas. It enables them to get into towns and villages from rural areas. A bus service was introduced from Galway to Castlebar and it passed the house in which I was born and reared. This service changed the lives of all the people on the route. Many of them were old age pensioners because most of us were in Dublin, having moved there to get jobs. The pensioners had free travel passes, but they had been isolated because there was no transport. The bus service changed their lives. They were able to go to Castlebar, have a choice of shops and visit people in hospital. They could do all the things they wanted that they could not do previously. This ability to communicate with others is an important aspect of public transport and I welcome the developments in that direction under the Minister's remit.</P>
      <P>It is now recognised that the private car is not capable of doing the job. Nevertheless, 100,000 new cars were bought in Dublin last year for use on roads that are full. The motorways in my constituency are full of cars. They can be driven at 80 mph, but effectively they are in a traffic jam because the cars are bumper to bumper. I was one of the people who bought a new car, but an increasing number of cars are being piled on to roads that are already full. There is no end to this or any possibility of serving people's needs by that mode of transport and I am glad we are now discussing developing rail services.</P>
      <P>It is now fashionable for all parties to say they are in favour of public transport. We used to have a monopoly on the idea of public transport, but we did not receive public support to implement it. It was always left as a Cinderella or lame duck on the side. However, I am not wiping out our responsibilities. When we had a measure of power, we did not do enough about it. I welcome</P>
      <P>all the new converts to public transport in the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party. As a result of their conversion, there is a real possibility that public transport will be developed because it is likely to have a large measure of public support. However, some people in both parties are half hearted about it and would prefer private public transport, whatever that would mean.</P>
      <P>The foreword to the Irish Congress of Trade Union's response, called the Route to Success, to the Minister's red book states:</P>
      <P>The quality and cost of public transport is a key factor underpinning participation in economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that sense it facilitates social inclusion and <Col N="907" /> by extension the establishment and maintenance of a just society. In Ireland the public transport system has suffered from persistent under investment resulting in an inability to keep pace with the rapid growth in demand for services. This under investment has perpetuated low pay and low morale with attendant industrial relations problems in the State operating companies.</P>
    <P>In this context Congress welcomes the commitment in the national development plan to invest in public transport infrastructure. It is a matter of regret, however, that the Government has also apparently decided to fragment the public transport infrastructure by handing over significant elements of it to the private sector. It is the view of Congress that this approach has failed in other jurisdictions and that there will be a significant degree of public antipathy towards it.</P>
    <P>Congress believes the Government's proposal as set out in its consultation paper, &ldquo;A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport&rdquo;, is seriously flawed.</P>
    <P>It is important to put the views of Congress on the record.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with one aspect of the public transport issue in this legislation, namely rail transport. Deputy Higgins asked whether the Bill will deal with all new rail projects and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The legislation will only deal with Luas, when we eventually see it, and Metro, if we ever see it, and I am glad that is the case. The original Bill when introduced in the Seanad was a very different animal to what is before us. It was the Minister's intention, despite her protestations to the opposite, to use this Bill as a stalking horse, the first phase of the privatisation of the rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how it is done. Department officials are not ever up front. No officials in the Department of Public Enterprise would ever say to a Minister that a Bill is the first stage of privatisation but they have a clear agenda no matter which Minister is in the Department for the privatisation of all public enterprise. They bring forward measures to various Ministers which are seen as desirable and necessary in some aspects but are part of the jigsaw that the officials have created from the Secretary General down to ensure Ministers are conned into bringing forward measures into the House that will facilitate privatisation. They have a definite agenda in that regard and I speak from direct experience. They will work to that agenda and against any other agenda put forward. I compliment the Minister on accepting the <Col N="908" /> advice from Congress to limit this legislation because there is no doubt the original intention was that it would be the first step in privatising rail transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution on Second Stage in the Seanad related to a Bill that covered all new rail infrastructure. However, her last sentence was very instructive. It came out of the blue in the context of her contribution. She stated: &ldquo;The Bill is concerned with the operation of Luas and the Metro, although I am more than willing to listen to the views of all Members who contributed, and it is not concerned with heavy rail&rdquo;. This was the last sentence in a contribution about railways generally and the application of the new agency to the railways. I compliment her on upstaging those with an agenda of privatisation. That sentence was not scripted by her officials but I am not attacking the Department or its officials. They have a job to do which generally they do well but they also develop agendas when they are <i>in situ</i> for a long time.</P>
    <P>I read the entire Second Stage debate in the Seanad and I came across a gem of a contribution from Senator Caffrey. Having heard the final sentence of the Minister's contribution, he stated:</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not confer powers on the existing agency and board of CIE rather than set up another board with a new chief executive and all that entails in terms of money, responsibility and accountability? On reading the Bill, one would think that powers could be transferred to the existing machinery in CIE unless it is an attempt to give a new image to the light rail and metro systems. Perhaps it is an attempt to lay the Percy French ghost of the railway system to rest.</P>
    <P>I am still suspicious of the Minister's intentions and I remain to be wholly convinced that we are not heading for privatisation but we will tease out the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage. Despite the experience across the water there is still a large school of thought in our political parties and Departments that favours selling Irish Rail and hiving it off to the highest bidder. I know how the Department of Public Enterprise works.</P>
    <P>In that context the recent Labour Party conference restated its policy on privatisation and the following motion from my constituency was overwhelmingly carried and is binding on the parliamentary Labour Party:</P>
    <P>Conference opposes the planned privatisation programme of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government which will lead to the privatisation of ESB, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis, An Post, CIÉ, Coillte, RTE and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Conference reaffirms Labour policy to retain the commercial public sector in public ownership, and it will legislate for the commercial freedom of the individual companies and for regulated competition in the areas where they operate. Labour will further insist that univer<Col N="909" /> sal service obligation and postalisation of charges will be applicable to all services.</P>
    <P>Conference urges the Labour Party not to agree to any Programme for Government with any other parties that does not include this policy.</P>
    <P>I want to give credit where it is due. The Minister has achieved a level of funding for public transport and railways, in particular, that has not been seen since the foundation of the State. The funding achieved in the national development plan exceeds anything that has gone before.</P>

      <P>However, I am far from pleased with the use of these public funds. I refer to Luas which is the subject of this agency, in particular. The Minister almost inquired Luas to death. When the inquiry results did not suit the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Progressive Democrats the inquiries started all over again. At one stage the Minister proposed building the on street light rail system underground at the behest of the Progressive Democrats. Seemingly the party has an expert on tunnels but that will never happen. I recall the day the Minister announced the proposal in the House. I said there would never be a spoonful of that tunnel dug and the Minister for Finance burst out laughing. Not one grain of that tunnel should ever be dug nor will it be. Light rail systems must be built on street, not underground. Metro systems using trains that can pull big loads are built underground.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Minister's inability to make a positive decision on Luas, the system has been reduced to a line from Tallaght to St. Stephen's Green and a temporary line to Sandyford. There would be none of the system left only for the Government deciding to leave a little of it so that the Minister could save face. There is no valid reason for Luas given what has happened. There will only be one line from Tallaght to St. Stephen's Green with no connection to the rail system and there will be a temporary line to Sandyford to satisfy the Government Chief Whip who campaigned for it be built until the Metro is in place.</P>
      <P>We will have to wait 16 years for the metro, according to the Minister. If she had acted positively on the work done by her predecessors and given the back of her hand politically to the Tánaiste, the Luas would now be constructed and would carry thousands of passengers per day. However, all we get <i>ad nauseam</i> are photo opportunities of the Minister sitting in the Luas engine somewhere, although it is not going anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in expressing concern about the huge amounts of money being spent on a promotion campaign for Luas. I cannot understand what it is for. It is promoted in sections of newspapers and glossy magazines and <Col N="910" /> there are nice photographs of the Minister. I do not object to the Minister getting her picture in the newspaper, but for what is the Government promoting Luas? As soon as it is built, it will be full because it is an attractive mode of transport. There is no need to spend this money. Perhaps the officials in the Department could find out why that is happening. I am sure the Minister and the Department are keeping a good eye on how the money is spent in CIE after what happened before.</P>
      <P>Railway buffs and train watchers come to see us on a regular basis to talk to us about the merit of rail. They remind us that whatever else the British left when we drove them out of this country they left us a comprehensive rail network and electric trams on the streets of Dublin. What became of this vital link? Deputy Enright was right that Fianna Fáil and Todd Andrews closed the trams down, tore them up and sold them. The worst thing they did was to sell the land on which the track was laid which meant no one else could use it. I used to put pennies on the track in Roundfort in Mayo when I was young to make them as big as a half a crown, which my father used to get. He left them on the track for a full run. That track is now used by farmers for silage pits because there is good drainage from it. I know where the drainage ends up and I know why there are many weeds in the river in which I used to fish. It is dreadful that happened. The pendulum has now swung full circle because we must now replace that infrastructure. It would have been easier to upgrade it than to replace it. I am not blaming the Minister for that because it is history. It was a bad mistake that was made.</P>

    <P>While the Bill deals with such matters as approved procedures for new rail infrastructure and on-street regulation of light rail, the main issue is the establishment of the rail procurement agency. This was intended to cover all rail systems, heavy, light, metro, etc., but it has now been reduced to Luas and the future metro. This is a massive vote of no confidence in the existing procurement authority, Irish Rail, by the Minister and the Government. Given that the proposal is limited, will the Minister accept the wise advice of Senator Caffrey and give the resources to Irish Rail to do this limited job compared to the original intention? I agree with Senator Caffrey who asked why another bureaucracy and a board full of Fianna Fáil hacks must be set up to do something which is already being done by a board full of Fianna Fáil hacks. Fianna Fáil hacks are there now because that is the system. If the Labour Party and Fine Gael were in power, they would be Labour and Fine Gael hacks. I acknowledge and accept that is a bad system which needs to be <Col N="911" /> examined to see how it can be corrected. The value of this agency is doubtful.</P>
    <P>As regards responsibility in the House, I am glad the Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are acting together through the Whips in relation to the proposed Dáil reforms. Part of the reforms will require the Minister to answer questions on the floor of the House for agencies under her control.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that public private partnerships have certain values, but they also have downsides or negatives. Their development is just another name for privatisation. We are handing over lock, stock and barrel, huge chunks of public infrastructure for a limited investment. If the Minister is considering public private partnerships in the context of Luas or the metro, she must ensure that ownership and control of the utility is retained publicly even when there must be a return on investments. It is a device for giving a slice of action and of the profits to the private sector when there is no good reason to do that. If profits are taken out of these areas, the costs will be higher. Is there a need to take this route? We already employ private contractors to do the work. We do not have to ask them for their money as we pay them for doing the work. They do that on a competitive basis. We could employ contractors to run a business as well if we want to and we could do that on a competitive basis. We could employ contractors to run the Department if we wanted to and we could have tenders for doing so. That might work well. It might be a refreshing idea to apply some of the medicine to the doctor. It might do an enormous amount of good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards needing funds, if these areas offer valuable investments from the private sector point of view and a good solid return on them, why does the Government not invest the pension funds? There are colossal amounts of money available in the public and private pension funds. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, also has huge stacks of money as a result of surpluses in recent years. Why is that not invested in our infrastructure if it is possible to get a return on it? I know the private sector will not invest unless there is a return. Perhaps the Minister might speak to the Minister for Finance about the possibility of investing the pension funds, which are generated in Ireland, in major <Col N="912" /> infrastructural projects here with a return in the form of shadow tolling, for example, rather than investing them abroad. A return would be necessary in the interests of pensioners.</P>
      <P>The ICTU document is a response to the red book. The basis of the red book was that private ownership would be the format for public transport. In that context, I will quote again from the ICTU document under the heading, &ldquo;The Future of Rail Transport&rdquo;. It states:</P>
      <P>There can be little doubt from recent experience in Britain that the efficient and safe operation of railways is best secured through public ownership. The Government has, on a number of occasions, sought to assure unions that it has no intention of privatising the railways, but has argued that some reform is necessary, if only to allow the proposed investment proceed.</P>
      <P>Unions recognise the need for reform and support the following proposals: the retention of Irish Rail in public ownership, with the operating and infrastructure side of the company consolidated under a single company structure; the creation of a railway procurement agency with a remit to procure an operator for the Luas, and ensure the development of the Metro in Dublin. The development of the Metro could involve the use of a PPP; and the creation of a rail safety agency.</P>
      <P>That is very different from what the red book said. I assume the Minister would generally support what Congress is saying.</P>

      <P>When I read the red book I was very nervous that the main philosophy behind it was that privatisation was some sort of Mecca. When it was examined by the EU, in particular, it was found that it was no great answer to the problem. While one got a slightly cheaper service with deregulation, the quality and level of service was greatly reduced, as well. The Labour Party will support the Bill in so far as it contains safeguards against the future use of the agency to bring forward the privatisation of Irish Rail, the Luas or the Metro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. This resulted in a visit to Cork from the highest levels of CIÉ management to discuss the future development of rail infrastructure in the Cork region. I thank Dr. John Lynch, chairman of the company, for having accompanied his team to Cork. I speak, therefore, with some experience of and interest in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in five Parts. Part 2 is a substantial part dealing with the establishment of the railway procurement agency. Part 3 deals with conventional railway matters, and Part 4 with light railways or tramways. Part 5 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.</P>
      <P>I will set out my own vision of what railway transport infrastructure should be. We have a great railway engineering heritage, dating back to the renowned Irish railway engineer, Dargan. Even Brunel worked in Ireland and engineered substantial parts of what should soon become known as Metro na Laoi, namely the Cork to Cobh section of the Great Southern and Western Railway.</P>
      <P>Deputies should be aware that railway engineering was a profitable private investment in the 19th century. The Great Southern and Western Railway regularly paid annual dividends of 6% in its early decades of operation. It was a bit like the Internet today. Railway engineering was always controlled by Acts of Parliament so what we are doing with this Bill is nothing new.</P>
      <P>There are, unfortunately, a number of fundamental problems with the Irish railway infrastructure, of which everyone in the House should be aware. First, the population distribution was very different then from today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was far more uniform and rural. Some of the western counties had populations approaching that of Dublin. In addition, the relative importance of larger towns and cities was very different then. Belfast was the commercial hub of Ireland, similar in size to Dublin. Today, Dublin is three times the size of Belfast. Waterford was much larger than Galway in those days, and Galway even lost its corporation and mayor at one time, until Fianna Fáil restored them in 1941. Cork City was important as a sea port and agricultural market, its butter exchange having an importance at global market level. Cobh was the equivalent of Shannon Airport and Heathrow Airport in one, and most American mail for Britain came into Cobh and up the Great Southern and Western Railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway infrastructure was designed for the population distribution and economic priorities of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. It <Col N="914" /> was also designed for the military transport purposes of the British army in Ireland, if for no other reason than that it was a large source of regular income.</P>
    <P>Second, there was no road competition when the railway was built, and most people were too poor to travel. It was, therefore, primarily designed for goods transport, with passenger transport as a secondary revenue earner on many railways.</P>
    <P>Third, there was, and remains, a major problem with the railway gauges. Most people will be familiar with the concept of railway gauge, or track gauge, as the spacing between both rails, but few people are aware that our track gauge is different from that of any other country. There is however a second important gauge called the loading gauge. This is essentially defined by the clearance under the bridges and overhead wires and beside platforms.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our loading gauge is also out of step with most countries. The reasons are as follows. Brunel, the English engineer, was pushing the idea of broad-gauge railways with a six-foot track gauge. He maintained this would give a better ride and allow larger rail vehicles. More or less everyone else in the railway world was building to a track gauge of 4 ft. 8.5 ins. or 1435 millimetres.</P>
    <P>Why was this peculiar measurement so common, however? If I may, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will provide the House with part of the history involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason was that most carts happened to have their wheels spaced apart by that much. In fact, smaller and older cars have their wheels about 5 ft. apart. Carts had wheels 4 ft. 8.5 ins. apart and this measurement fitted nicely into the ruts made by traffic in the dirt roads of Europe over a period of 2,000 years. Everyone made carts that way. Believe it or not, all this dates back to the standard spacing between Roman chariot wheels. In Ireland, the Dublin to Dún Laoghaire railway was built with a track gauge of 4 ft. 8.5 ins., and so was the Dublin to Drogheda railway. The only problem was that the broad gauge supporters managed to influence the Ulster Railway which started building southwards at a 6 ft gauge. By the time they got to Portadown, the British Government stepped in with a royal commission which was responsible for the mess we have today. Instead of setting either the broad gauge or the standard gauge, the commission made up its own compromise gauge measuring 5 ft. 3 ins. Nobody else uses it and nobody makes railway carriages for it, except to special order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Europe, only two other geographic areas have this problem; Spain and Portugal are on a broader gauge of 1672 mm or about 5 ft. 5.75 ins. In addition, Basque Railways have a narrow gauge system. I do not know why this is, but it <Col N="915" /> means that the entire railway system in the Iberian peninsula is isolated from France and the rest of Europe, apart from a few trains, which can have their wheel gauge changed at the Franco-Spanish border.</P>
    <P>Russia and her former colonies, including the Baltic states and Finland, have a 1524 mm track gauge, 5 ft. They also have some international trains that are jacked up at the border to allow the wheels to be changed. This is no way to run a railway and Britain recognised that at a very early stage. Brunel had got control of the engineering for the main England to Wales railway, called the Great Western, which was built to a 6 ft. gauge. It was converted, towards the end of the 19th century &ndash; in a single weekend shutdown, using thousands of labourers &ndash; to the standard gauge of 1435 mm, which is the old English measurement of 4 ft. 8.5 ins.</P>
    <P>The Spanish authorities took a radical decision about 15 years ago with the new high-speed train from Madrid to Sevilla, which was built at standard gauge. They are also building from Madrid up to the Basque country at standard gauge. It will eventually reach France with a standard gauge line so that they can have high-speed trains running through to the middle of Spain.</P>
    <P>Should we consider converting some railways to the standard gauge? This is a cross-Border issue as all Ireland shares a unique railway track and loading gauge. We do not have international trains as we have no tunnel out of the country, but the issue is one of how easily we can acquire extra spare rolling stock.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for ensuring that the Luas tram system is already being built to standard gauge, not Irish gauge. This will make it easier to buy extra tram sets quickly. This is an important issue. My constituents have to stand on old crowded trains, especially going to Kerry and Mallow. Unlike many of its European counterparts, Iarnród Éireann cannot purchase good serviceable second-hand carriages to use as spare capacity on holiday weekends and other busy periods. It has to wait for new carriages to be specially built.</P>
    <P>The second related issue is the loading gauge. We have the same small, penny-pinching, Mickey Mouse loading gauge as Britain. Anyone who has been to the Continent will have seen real trains, capable of being built as double-deckers for commuter use without extending platforms and able to carry cars and loaded lorries. This gauge is also an obstacle to the importation and use of high quality second-hand rolling stock from Europe as a quick solution to our rolling stock shortage. Britain is the only place from where we can import rolling stock which fits our loading gauge. Most of this stock comes from the specialist second-hand railway supplier, Vic Berry. Some carriages in the fleet came from this source and had to be re-wheeled.</P>
    <P>We need to consider the modification of selected railways to fit the UIC loading gauge used on <Col N="916" /> the Continent. In terms of the ability to carry freight easily, this is a bigger issue than the track gauge. Such investment would also allow double-deck trains to be used in urban areas, without the need for costly platform extensions for longer trains. The Minister should consider this issue for the longer term.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of private investment in the railway infrastructure. Railway privatisation as it was implemented in Britain has proven to be a disaster. However, the German model is working well. What is the difference? In Britain, a franchising arrangement was established for train service providers to come in and take over the operation, as a monopoly, of sections of the railway service. In Germany, Deutsche Bahn stock was issued in an IPO so institutional investors came in and the system did not become an open target for get-rich-quick merchants looking for a licence to print money. Most of the independent private operators in Germany run rail cars on small provincial lines that Deutsche Bahn has stopped serving. In general, they do not operate in the large population centres. Some German local authorities also run rail services.</P>
    <P>If we privatise the rail service here, and I do not see it as a priority compared to the bus service, it should be done through the retention of a single large company whereby smaller operators would be allowed to operate additional services. Tickets must be interchangeable and on a single fare tariff and structure based on distance travelled. Train operators in Ireland should not be allowed to impose profiteering charges as in Britain. The charge of £20 sterling, or IR£25, for a return train ticket for a 15-minute journey from London Heathrow to Paddington constitutes profiteering to the extent of being the heftiest airport tax in Europe. There should be a unified timetable and fare structure for the entire country. The best model for private sector investment in the railways is the public-private partnership which has the advantage of not disrupting the system.</P>
    <P>I see no reason the State should not continue to invest in, and own, substantial profitable parts of the rail network. The WTO and the OECD have no business dictating to sovereign European Governments how much tax revenues they can invest in infrastructure. Likewise, the EU cannot put limits on state investment in transport, as it has done with air transport, while calling for an EU tax for military spending.</P>
    <P>The approach outlined in the national development plan is correct as it strikes the right balance. The national development plan is recognised by the people as the crowning achievement of Fianna Fáil in government. I commend and congratulate the Minister for her Trojan work on investment in rail and bus services since she took office. I thank her for the investment in bus services in Cork city and county.</P>
    <P>As a Cork Deputy, I find it frustrating that the only InterCity service from Cork goes to Dublin, <Col N="917" /> with a connection to Limerick. Fifty years ago we had a direct train service to Belfast and a rail connection to Galway and Waterford. It is time the Ennis to Athenry section via Gort was upgraded and re-opened for passenger traffic to enable rail travel from Munster to Galway city. There should be three trains each way per day between Cork and Waterford, via Limerick Junction, to Limerick, Ennis and Galway. That would be a real intercity service.</P>
    <P>Branding is an important part of any modern business. We do not have proper train classifications. The idea that all trains outside the Dublin suburban system and the Cork-Cobh line are InterCity is nonsense and almost constitutes false advertising. The German rail service has the best system of train classification in the world which sells each type of train as a product. The classifications are even run by different departments in the company. The train classifications we should borrow from Germany are eurocity for selected Cork-Dublin-Belfast express trains, intercity for express trains serving the major cities, interregional for slower trains on the main lines and trains on lines to smaller towns and regional train for rural branch trains and short distance trains from cities.</P>
    <P>The fare structure should be reformed so a single ticket does not cost almost as much as a return ticket. There should be a basic fare with supplements charged to make up the full fare, but only payable on the genuine intercity and eurocity expresses. We should keep the Arrow, Luas and DART brands for suburban trains.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister and Iarnród Éireann are considering the provision of through trains across Dublin by way of a tunnel. They should also consider the possibility of a new central station in Dublin at some point in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome Iarnród Éireann's decision to support the development of the suburban rail network for the Cork area, a service for which I have been calling since before my election to the Dáil. I suggest &ldquo;Metro na Laoi&rdquo; as a brand name for this new service. This system will probably become an extension of the Cobh service beyond Kent Station to serve the Kilbarry Technology Park, and then Blarney, possibly Rathduff, and certainly Mallow. It will then extend along the re-opened east Cork line to Carrigtwohill and Midleton. There is no reason it should not go all the way to Castlemartyr, Killeagh and Youghal which has become a major commuter town for Cork city. There is also a need for a station at Dunkettle providing bus links to Glanmire-Riverstown and the Ringaskiddy industrial area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the idea of extending the rail network to Cork Airport, via Ballincollig, with the intention of providing rail access to Carrigaline and Ringaskiddy. These areas are in my neighbouring constituency of Cork South Central, but rail access in the Cork area is a matter of importance for the entire city. It is about access to jobs and reducing traffic in <Col N="918" /> the city. I do not take a narrow-minded view of my constituency and have always said I would stand up for all of Cork.</P>
    <P>The hub of the railway infrastructure in the Cork region is Kent Station. At present, this station is configured for through rail traffic only and access to it by road is inconvenient. I support a complete re-development plan for Kent Station and the plan to move the suburban section of the station closer to the city. Kent Station also needs to become a bus terminus for several city bus routes. The station is not currently served by public transport, except for one or two special buses. CIE supports such a proposal.</P>
    <P>We also need to consider a light rail network for Cork. At least one line, as part of Metro na Laoi, should run along the quay to the Opera House, the university area, Cork University Hospital and Cork Institute of Technology. Such a service would dramatically reduce car traffic in this congested area.</P>
    <P>Cork has a high density of population, and a second light rail line, or perhaps two branches, are needed for the major north-east and north-west suburbs. Trams can run on steep gradients and do so in many hilly European cities such as Prague. Cork had a tram service in the past.</P>
    <P>Germany has introduced tilting high speed trains &ndash; the ICE class 3 &ndash; which can run on the type of lines we have in Ireland with steep curves. We need to consider if such rolling stock could provide a high speed Cork-Limerick-Dublin-Belfast-Derry service, and also perhaps serve Galway.</P>
    <P>We need a long-term plan for the rail system for the next 50 years. It may be better to start from scratch and build a new high speed line from Dublin to Cork via the more densely populated areas of Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny city, Clonmel and Fermoy. Deputy McGuinness will speak about Kilkenny during this debate. The cost of such a service would be high, but as a wealthy country we need to start planning this type of investment project. Likewise, other parts of the country need to be linked by high quality, regular train services which would substantially reduce the number of road deaths. Our rail network has existed for 150 years and it is only proper that we should plan 50 years ahead.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Northern Ireland network, or what is left of it after Stormont vandalised it, as a separate entity does not make any sense with the exception of the commuter rail system in the Belfast area. In the context of a united Ireland, or perhaps even sooner, we will have to face up to the restoration of the railway to the north-west. The closure of the Derry road line from Portadown to Derry, via Omagh and Strabane, deprived the whole country of a key part of its railway infrastructure. The northern half of the country is poorly served by railways and this impacts on people in Munster and elsewhere who want to travel to the north or midlands.</P>
    <P>This is an area ripe for cross-Border co-operation. Although the relevant Minister in the <Col N="919" /> North is from a party which is not well disposed to cross-Border bodies, I hope he will see the sense and benefit of such co-operation. Perhaps the Minister will raise these issues in the cross-Border body on transport.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill and hope it marks the start of the regeneration of our railway infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Its historical insights were very useful.</P>
      <P>The Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001, highlights a very important crossroads in regard to investment in our rail network. It provides an opportunity to examine some of the current flaws in the system and to identify development potential. Hopefully, public-private partnerships will result in additional investment in the rail network. It will ensure proper rail infrastructure throughout the country, not merely on the eastern seaboard.</P>
      <P>We need to radically overhaul our thinking in regard to investing in and delivering key infrastructural investment. Ireland's infrastructure is bursting at the seams. Our road network is unable to cope with the daily demands levelled on it and our rail infrastructure is under-utilised. The long-term outlook for the development and expansion of our rail network is extremely limited. The establishment of the proposed agency will, hopefully, result in a revised view of the rail network's potential.</P>
      <P>The national development plan and the introduction of public-private partnerships resulted in the production of this legislation. Yesterday, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister stated that there will be 80 new carriages on the network by the middle of 2002. These carriages are to be divided between suburban and mainline services; some will be used to provide new services and some will replace existing stock. Will the Minister outline precisely how many carriages will be provided for severely overcrowded mainline services and for suburban services which require further investment? How many will be used for the provision of new services as opposed to replace existing stock? My colleague, Deputy Higgins, stated yesterday that the current overcrowding on our rail services resembles the Calcutta express and I endorse that view. Buses are subject to maximum load requirements but there is no such requirement on trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the new agency does not represent the first step in a Government policy to privatise our rail network. We should not make the same mistake as that made by the UK Conservative Party Government in 1996. The decision to privatise the UK network has resulted in the disintegration of basic infrastructure and the loss of public confidence in rail transport, due in the main to a disastrous safety record. This lack of confidence was <Col N="920" /> copperfastened by the announcement on 7 October last that Railtrack, the owner of the rail network, was going bankrupt. The British Government now finds itself in a position where it must re-nationalise the network to protect rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Many parts of the network urgently require investment. These areas of the network are currently closed but, if developed and reopened, would help to stimulate investment in regions such as the west. Economic considerations would prohibit this happening if the network were privatised. Public-private partnerships will work in highly populated areas but will not work in areas where population numbers does not guarantee a return on investment. The money saved by the State through public-private partnerships in regard to Luas and suburban rail should be used to redevelop and reopen some of the dilapidated rail infrastructure and open new lines.</P>
    <P>I hope the new agency will not only consider the financial viability of new infrastructure but will also examine the potential for economic development which would result from its provision. If the agency adopts the same view as its counterparts in Bord Gáis, the underdeveloped regions of the country will become poorer as other areas become congested. The Bill appears to have been drafted for the sole purpose of developing the Dublin light rail project&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>And the metro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the agency have a role in the development of new rail infrastructure outside Dublin? The key to the success of this agency will be whether it can expand and develop infrastructure. The Bill contains numerous references to &ldquo;new rail infrastructure&rdquo;. What about the closed and under-utilised lines in the existing network? Will the agency invest in these lines such as that between Athlone and Mullingar? The current road network between Athlone and Mullingar used by thousands of commuters on a daily basis is deplorable. Will the agency have a role to play in the development of a commuter service to Galway city or similar services on the four lines serving Athlone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The western rail corridor, on which the Minister has received numerous submissions, could be used as a passenger or freight route from Ballina to Limerick and onward to the south-east and Rosslare. This route could prove valuable in linking towns in the western region, thereby enhancing their development. It would also facilitate the development of tourism along the route, diversifying tourism growth to more inland regions. Several sections of the rail track, including the Collooney-Claremorris, Claremorris-Athenry and Athenry-Ennis sections, would have to be substantially upgraded to carry passenger and freight traffic. It is estimated that the upgrading of the western rail corridor from Collooney to Ennis to allow for speeds of 60 to 70 miles per hour would cost in the region of £100 million. <Col N="921" /> This includes the cost of ancillary works. It corresponds to less that 1% of the total transport initiative for Dublin. The western rail corridor could also be linked to the development of commuter routes between the centres in the region such as Sligo and Galway. It would also serve Knock Airport, making it the first airport in the country to have a rail connection. This would help develop the airport and remove the severe congestion at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>As there is no capacity for new services entering Dublin, to develop services from the western region to the capital will require investment at Heuston Station. There is a business case for an additional daily service between Galway and Dublin. However, until new rolling stock becomes available and additional capacity becomes available at Heuston Station, consideration of additional routes cannot proceed. Where stands the redevelopment of the service between Heuston and Connolly Stations? There is an existing rail line between the stations running through Phoenix Park. Opening that would immediately make additional capacity available by routing some services to Connolly Station.</P>
    <P>Every day we travel on congested roads and see container after container travelling to and from the ports. This leads to huge frustration for motorists and long delays for exporters, which brings with it associated additional costs. Yet our rail network remains virtually unused for 12 hours each day. Ballina serves as a freight terminal for Castlebar and the Ballina region. There are two freight trains from Ballina to Dublin. Freight traffic also travels between Athenry and Ennis on a seasonal basis, averaging three trains per week. As far as possible, freight should be transferred from road to rail by discriminating positively in favour of it by making it commercially attractive and ensuring the reliability of such a service. What role will this agency have in the development of that policy?</P>
    <P>Over the summer months tremendous work has been ongoing on the upgrading of the existing line between Athlone and Castlebar. The Minister and Irish Rail are to be congratulated on that. It was probably the most dangerous rail line in the country when the Minister took office. It is beyond comprehension how there were not major fatalities on that line. Thankfully that did not happen. Questions have been raised by a number of people about the erection of new fences and the removal of hedges and banks along the line. Was there a need to carry out that extensive work? Did that work break the law? Hedges are not supposed to be disturbed between the April and September. Under legislation, a land owner or local authority can be prosecuted for undertaking such work, yet Irish Rail seemed to be given the go-ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to allow private sector participation in the construction, operation and maintenance of new railways. We <Col N="922" /> have seen in the United Kingdom that maintenance did not take place on the rail network under the stewardship of Railtrack. That was part of the problem which caused a drop in public confidence there. It also caused a number of fatal accidents on that network. It is important that we ensure that we do not make the same mistakes. We must ensure that proper maintenance takes place on our rail network. We are in the fortunate position that before any private maintenance contracts are awarded, our rail network is at an acceptable standard. That was not the case in the United Kingdom where major investment was required following the network's privatisation.</P>
    <P>How will the Railway Procurement Agency be responsible to this House and to the Minister? More often than not we get the same response from the Minister that she has no responsibility to the House for the many semi-State companies under her control. The same can be said of the NRA which is under the control of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It focuses attention on the point which Deputy Jim Higgins raised earlier regarding Luas. There are very glossy advertisements in all the national papers but the Luas line will not be operational until 2005. These advertisements are a waste of public money. No one has been told how much money is involved or why that advertising campaign is taking place at this stage. Even though that organisation is squandering public money provided by a Vote of this House, we cannot get answers. Is the same thing going to happen with the Railway Procurement Agency? In six or 12 months time when I table a question to the then Minister for Public Enterprise, will I be told that the Minister is not answerable to the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The body is answerable to the House through the Oireachtas committee. That is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The point is that we will be extremely lucky if we get that agency before the committee once a year. Issues will surface from time to time. There should be a mechanism available to Members to question the agency and get responses as to how they are spending their money and what their plans are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister elaborate on some of the functions of this agency? One of the functions is to acquire and facilitate the development of land adjacent to railway infrastructure where such development could contribute to its economic viability. That is a positive development and something which is welcome. How is this property to be acquired? Will it be acquired through compulsory purchase orders? The Minister knows that compulsory purchase orders are not very popular in either her constituency or mine. Will recognition be given regarding CPOs to the potential of that property or will it be got at a <Col N="923" /> knock-down price through CPO with huge potential for the Railway Procurement Agency to realise profits at the expense of the former owner?</P>
    <P>The Bill will also confer additional functions on the agency in the area of public transport by rail or road. Does the Minister see this new agency as having a function in taking over some of the functions currently carried out by the Department of the Environment and Local Government? Yesterday the Minster said there was a need for an overall department of transport and I agree with her. It should not be split between two Departments and there should be some co-ordination between the various Departments. Does the Minister see the Railway Procurement Agency expanding its role and having a role in ensuring that co-ordination takes place?</P>
    <P>Section 71 of the Bill will remove the need for a common membership of the boards of Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann. At present a minimum number of members must be common to both boards. Section 71 of the Bill will remove this requirement. How can we ensure Bus Éireann and Irish Rail will take a proper co-ordinated approach if membership of both boards is not co-ordinated? This is important because in the past, unfortunately, various Departments and organisations have worn blinkers. They have focused on their own areas and neglected co-ordination on housing, roads, rail and bus services. All the authorities involved in either housing or transportation need to take a co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board, a matter briefly touched on by Deputy Jim Higgins, is another important issue. It is vital criteria are set down governing membership of the board, regardless of whether it is appointed by the Minister or a nominated body. It is important that it is not made up of people with a party membership card. They must have expertise and be able to augment the abilities of the board, thus ensuring the new authority has real powers, a proper outlook and a proper development plan as opposed to constantly hauling in consultants before rubber-stamping its reports. I do not mind if members are members of a political party provided they are able and competent. I hope that transpires with this agency. It would mark a first in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on her work to date in her Department. There is no doubt the Department covers a huge amount of activity and has a heavy workload. There are major changes taking place in the economy and demands for better services and reform to meet the needs of economic growth. It is a challenge for any Minister to respond to all of these in a constructive manner. The Minister is coping quite well and has introduced some very imaginative legislation to deal with some of the issues that have arisen.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the speakers in the debate so far. My friend and colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, made an excellent contribution. I almost feel inadequate following in his footsteps given the history lesson and statistics he gave us and the vision he spelt out for the rail service. He was standing behind the Minister. I advise her to keep an eye on him.</P>
      <P>I concur with the Minister's statement in her opening remarks that we are in a changing environment in a changing economy. The Department faces challenging demands to make appropriate changes in response to economic development. In the context of creating proper road and rail infrastructure, this Bill is a step in the right direction. The Minister also outlined the national development plan and pointed out that investment in the period 2000-06 is designed to achieve a radical transformation in the public transport system. The spend on transport outlined by her is concentrated in Dublin. We all recognise that the main urban centres, notably Dublin and Cork, deserve the kind of investment required to take the car off the street, provide a better public service and reduce the traffic jams we experience on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with those specific problems there is a need, in the context of this Bill, to reflect on what is required throughout the country. A selection of services is needed. We must also consider passenger and freight services. There was a time when CIE, as it was then, dealt with freight services in a much more constructive and competitive way. Much of that service has now fallen to one side. The emphasis now is on the passenger service, rightly so. A state-of-the-art service is needed throughout the country to ensure every part of rural Ireland is connected in some shape or form to a public transport system. This is simply not happening. Some rural areas are not accessible by public transport. As a result, they do not enjoy the benefits of economic growth and are unable to participate, even on a social level, in local community or regional activities. This issue needs to be addressed in a modern country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge problem with the disability sector and existing transport services. Disabled people are not able to fully access the public transport service, be it bus or rail. Disabled people living in rural areas face a huge battle to get to an urban centre or even to a hospital to access health services. We can no longer stand over this. We need to introduce legislation to <Col N="925" /> force the service providers to ensure their services do not just serve the profitable urban centres, but also provide services to rural areas and give access to rural communities. It must be strongly emphasised to providers that they need to change their focus in the area of disabilities, which is not being addressed.</P>
    <P>There is now an organisation called DISC in my constituency, which addresses the whole issue of public transport. One of the key points on its agenda is the fact that hospital services in the region cannot be accessed by public transport or taxi. That is not good enough. We have to set down in legislation or make it a goal of Government that people with disabilities have easy access to public and other services using public transport. We must strive towards this aim.</P>
    <P>The Bill comes before the House at a time when transport in general is being debated in many constituencies. Another organisation called CAST, Campaign for Sensible Transport, has been established. It has been asking politicians to focus on the need to develop an integrated approach to our transport problems. The Minister was asked if the new agency would be able to extend its remit to take into account road, rail and bus route developments. There should be a Government or Civil Service co-ordinating body charged with ensuring every aspect of transport is deliberated on and delivered in a comprehensive package rather than by piecemeal investment. To get value for money, one needs to examine the overall picture in terms of service delivery and the planning mechanisms in place in Government to ensure road, rail and bus services are delivered in a total package. We would then know what is required in each area.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities are debating the spatial strategy, growth centres and how they will cope with new growth in their areas. They will not be able to cope with growth in a constructive way without an integrated approach to transport. If we had an overall plan or a single body dealing with public transport, issues such as the Piltown-Fiddown bypass in my constituency, the N8 or the N9 would not arise.</P>
    <P>We might not need that extent of road development impinging on rural Ireland and on our local agricultural communities if the rail network was developed in tandem with the development of the road network and proper bus routes. A substantial amount of traffic could be taken off the roads if we had the type of commuter system that is being demanded by the general public, by the route users.</P>
    <P>I cannot travel to the Dáil by train or bus because the timetable does not facilitate that public transport need. There is no commuter service for Kilkenny with a population of 80,000 to 90,000 people. Many people commute to Dublin from the city and county of Kilkenny. I meet them on the road and I see them driving home from Dublin. Yet there is a train service subscribed to by a huge number of people &ndash; the carriages are always full. The company which runs the train <Col N="926" /> service does not propose to extend it to ensure a daily commuter service from the growth centre of Kilkenny to Dublin.</P>
    <P>At a European Affairs committee meeting two years ago, an official from CIE or Iarnród Éireann told the committee that the reason the commuter service from Kilkenny was being delayed was that the receiving station at the other end did not have the infrastructure to take extra services. That is nothing short of a disgrace in a growing economy. If the company is interested in developing its structures and business, it should reinvest adequately in its services. This has nothing to do with Government; the management is in control of the services, it has access to Government. Even though the Opposition nods its head or stands up and gives out about this and constantly tries to blame our Minister, throughout the history of CIE nothing has been done to adequately develop it in a truly commercial sense and give the public a better service. Unless the company is forced to acknowledge that it needs to develop and to deliver the services, we will be talking about this in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn raised an interesting point &ndash; a similar point was made by the official who appeared before the European Affairs committee &ndash; about investment in the rail structure causing a problem because the gauge of the railway line is not compatible with European standards. As a result, the carriages and rolling stock must be built specifically for the Irish line.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to draw up a plan to be executed in the next five to ten years which would address the services as we know them at present and then ensure we transfer the gauge from the present measurement to the European standard. We could then readily access the carriages we need. That is a fundamental issue which needs to be addressed and funded. If that is done, it will open up the possibility of extending the rail line and allow immediate access for everyone, regardless of disability.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that Kilkenny does not have a commuter service. If people wish to travel from Tralee to Kilkenny, they must first go to Kildare to change trains and there may be another change at Mallow before finally reaching Tralee. I cannot understand why that has not changed. I appreciate that the railway line involved was built at a time when the economy and population structure was different, but that railway line has been the same for as long as I can remember. I wonder why the investment was not made or the structure changed to reflect the changes in population structure and the demands of the general public.</P>
    <P>There is now public pressure and demand because people want these services; they want to protect the environment and the way to do it is by using the railways. There is huge public support throughout Europe for public transport systems but we have fallen behind in terms of development. We are coming up to scratch in terms of the main centres such as Cork, Limerick and <Col N="927" /> Dublin, but there is an immediate need to address the regions.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill and this agency, will the Minister examine the deficiencies in the regions? We have an entitlement to participate in the economic upturn that still exists. People are willing to commute to work; they are willing to accept new concepts of work with some people preferring to work at home. There has been a shift in work patterns and we are not responding to it quickly enough. I ask that this agency be given a remit in the area of bus routes and that it links in with a co-ordinating body within Government to deal with the issue of roads and their linkage to the rail and public transport initiatives.</P>
    <P>The cost structure must be examined in terms of what passengers are paying for their tickets and the service. A greater competitive edge would encourage different packages and ticketing structures to enable people to travel and commute on a daily basis. It could introduce weekend and family group travel. The rail service could be marketed to encourage families and individuals to use the service as an alternative means of transport. It is a growing area but it is not growing fast enough because the time schedules do not meet the needs of people and the scale of charges is not attractive to the pockets of people who use the services.</P>
    <P>Rail safety is an issue and I link that with Government and public-private partnerships. The spend on the railways will be colossal in the next five to ten years. The joint approach of improving and extending the track and services to urban centres should be linked to the spatial strategy which is currently being debated at local authority level. Some package must be put together in an imaginative way which will give value for money for Government spending. It must be attractive to those financial institutions who will contribute by way of public-private partnership.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers that there needs to be some way for the House to question the direction of this agency or any other agency by way of parliamentary question or by way of questions to the Minister. Replies to parliamentary questions frequently state that the work of such agencies is not within the remit of the Minister. Running the country is the remit of the Government and it is responsible to the people. There should be some form of access to enable us to gain information from the Department through the Minister. While companies can be brought before committees of the House, that committee structure is limited. As we know, committees have been brought before the High Court and made to jump over all kinds of obstacles. It is up to this House to change that structure to ensure that we, as public representatives, can get information directly from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are dealing with Luas, light rail and the general rail infrastructure. I hope the comments made in this debate will be relayed back to the company concerned, that <Col N="928" /> those involved can learn from it and that some attractive packages will be put in place to invest in the infrastructure to improve rail and bus services.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy McGuinness on his excellent speech which, as usual, was well researched and thought out, although I might take issue on one or two points.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill and public transport generally, we need an almost total change of mind-set. In the past seven or eight years, we have gone through a period of unprecedented economic growth which has led to considerable stresses and strains in our economy. One of the most evident features is the growth in car numbers and road transport. Never before was there a greater need to develop our public transport network. With the predicted downturn in the economy and the reported disappearance of the budget surplus in the coming years, perhaps we have missed the boat. This Government will be judged on how it spent the money which it inherited in the good times. It is quite evident that the Government did not invest in the rail network, in a visible way, as distinct from the work which I know has been done on the important safety aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McGuinness, I have had the experience of putting down parliamentary questions and being informed that the Minister had no responsibility for the matter and that I should talk to some other body, only to be told by that body that it does not have to tell me anything. I am concerned about setting up yet another agency and, perhaps, when I ask a question about its work, being informed that the Minister has no responsibility for it. We are in danger of voting ourselves out of the role which we are supposed to fulfil on behalf of the people. People are becoming very annoyed, when they go to their public representatives for information on some issue and find that they cannot get it. I suggest that the Minister consider an amendment to the Bill to put a statutory obligation making the agency answerable to this House through parliamentary questions, if that is what it takes to make this and other agencies answerable. Deputies should be in a position to ask questions and get factual, truthful and timely replies. When we write to these agencies, we may have to wait for weeks or months for a reply &ndash; perhaps an unsatisfactory reply. If we pride ourselves as a democracy, this must be sorted out. These agencies are funded by the State and they should be answerable to this House by way of parliamentary question. It is not good enough that they come before committees occasionally and present a bland report, as some of them do and we do not really <Col N="929" /> have time, on a once yearly basis, to go into sufficient detail.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have asked if we need this agency at all. We run the risk of smothering the country in bureaucracy, paper and red tape. In the health services, we have more administrators than medical staff. In local authorities, people cannot make decisions; they pass the paper up the line and back down again. The buck has to stop somewhere. An agency like this runs the risk of being another paper swapping exercise. I ask the Minister to have another look at what restructuring can be done in CIE and Iarnród Éireann to have an internal agency answerable to the Minister and to this House, rather than setting up a whole new agency, with a whole new administrative structure, board of directors and chief executive. Is that absolutely necessary, or is there another agenda involved? Is it the intention that this agency will eventually take over certain roles and, perhaps, be privatised? Who knows? I will raise these questions again on Committee Stage and we will have to consider whether to support this Bill or oppose it.</P>
    <P>I asked questions in the Dáil yesterday about the additional carrying capacity which the Minister intends to provide on mainline rail. Iarnród Éireann has often been criticised in this House but the staff and management are doing the best they can with very limited resources. Many of the rail carriages are 30 years old and the newer ones, I understand, are 17 years old. They are totally out of date and worn out. The Minister said there are carriages on the way, but it appears they are not actually main line carriages but DMUs. I understand there is a provision in the national development plan for the purchase of 20 new main line carriages. Is it true that this proposal has been shelved? I also asked about the time scale and did not get a reply &ndash; the point was evaded. Will the Minister do me the courtesy of answering my question, perhaps by letter, as to when these 20 carriages will be on stream? Have they been ordered yet? That is what I asked and I did not get an answer. It is no wonder people are annoyed.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, I travelled by train from Dublin to Cork at 12 noon. We found ourselves in a DART carriage, because of a shortage of carriages for mainline rail. Those who are familiar with DART carriages will know that one cannot move from one carriage to another. On this occasion, the carriage was full, including older people and parents with small children. During the three hour journey, it was not possible to get a cup of tea, a sandwich or even a drink of water. I do not blame the people in Iarnród Éireann for this &ndash; it is not their fault and they are doing their best. The only toilet in that carriage broke down and could not be repaired and, as I said, people could not move from one carriage to another. One would not find such a situation in the Third World. It is ridiculous and the Minister still cannot tell me when the 20 mainline carriages will be made available, if ever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Why is it not possible, for instance, to buy one's ticket on-line? Is that happening? I hope it is. What about integrated ticketing? We keep asking about it but it still has not come on board. Why does one have to queue at train stations for tickets? Parking at Cork station is a huge problem. Many people arrive at the station, cannot park their cars and have to drive to Dublin. The staff are doing the best they can but the money is not coming through from Government to facilitate the work that is needed. The decisions are not being made at that level. Why do we not have machines at railway stations from which one could purchase one's ticket? Why does one have to queue up all the time? In regard to ticket structuring, if one wants to buy an annual ticket, one has to wait until January. One cannot buy one in July, August or September because it only goes from January to January. Why is that? Surely, we can do better than that.</P>
    <P>We need to co-ordinate buses and trains much more so that when people get off the train, there is a bus waiting to take them where they want to go. For instance, if one gets off the train in Dublin, one very often has to wait in the rain for a bus. If one wants to travel from the centre of the city to the station, one has to traipse down to O'Connell Bridge to get a bus. That is not on. It is not good enough in this day and age. Perhaps they do not want people on the trains because they do not have the capacity. Others made the point that we need to integrate transport, and that is true. Perhaps we need a Minister in charge of transport who would co-ordinate all transport in the State, including road, rail, air and sea transport, so that somebody has an eye on them all. That is very important and is needed.</P>
    <P>Park and ride was mentioned by many speakers. It is virtually non-existent. If we are serious about easing the traffic gridlock, we will have to provide park and ride which must be linked up with buses and trains. That is vitally important.</P>
    <P>For quite some time, I have advocated a local issue, opening the rail link to east Cork, to Midleton. Again, I will be parochial. I raised this issue when elected to the House in 1997. A feasibility study was commissioned by Iarnród Éireann, costing £25,000. It looked favourably on the proposal. Four and a half years later, it has decided to commission another feasibility study to look at all aspects of it, the technical, commercial and economic aspects and so on. How much will that cost? I asked that question in the Dáil yesterday but was not told. We have had feasibility study after feasibility study but nothing has happened on the ground. We need action where rail is concerned. I would like to see these new rail carriages ordered and in place as soon as possible. We have been told they will take two or three years to come on stream from the date of order. The information I have &ndash; I would like to be corrected &ndash; is that these 20 new mainline carriages have not been ordered. Why is that the case? </P>
    <P>I have grave doubts about setting up another agency. We need to examine the matter carefully <Col N="931" /> to see if there is another way to do this. I do not see any merit in setting up another layer of bureaucracy if we can avoid it. We should be trying to trim the bureaucracy that is there. We wait in hope for action on the railways and for major investment which will be seen on the ground. A lot of work has been done in Dublin on the railway stations but parking in many areas is a huge problem. The railways have to be comfortable, convenient to use, economic and, above all, safe. I know a lot of work has been done on safety, which is the priority, but comfort, convenience and value for money leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I travelled to Dublin from Cork. The train broke down outside Mallow and we had to sit for one and a half hours before another locomotive arrived. We then moved into Mallow and had to sit for another half an hour before we left. There was a two hour delay which is not good enough. I call on the Government to invest massively in rail, to change thinking in regard to public transport and to focus totally on rail with a view to upgrading it because it is badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for sharing his time. I, too, have grave reservations about any body being set up which takes powers from a Minister or lacks accountability in the House. We are always complaining about An Bord Pleanála and Bord Fáilte. We seem to be doing ourselves out of a job and making ourselves more irrelevant. Why do we set up such agencies, particularly when we have a Civil Service which we say is well staffed?</P>
      <P>A few years ago there was much talk about traffic and transport but there now seems to be an acceptance of it among people. I travelled on the N11 through Cabinteely to the east of Wicklow on Tuesday evening and it was amazing to see the people stuck in the traffic. It was like watching a mass production of &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo; when one looked at the faces of people in the cars, people with their mouths open, radios on and their windows down. There was almost an acceptance, a despair, that nothing could be done.</P>
      <P>One might well ask why is there traffic on that road given that the DART has been extended to Greystones and there is a rail service to Bray. I asked myself that question. I received a letter on 12 October 2001 from someone who had recently bought a house in the vicinity of the DART station in Greystones in the hope that they would be able to use the DART to commute into the city. They stated that in recent weeks they have learned that CIE's advertisement, DART to Greystones, is utterly misleading, that there are very few trains, that many of the trains scheduled do not travel, that hundreds of commuters are regularly left stranded in Bray and that no satisfactory explanations are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the rail service, I received a letter from a constituent in Wicklow town who spoke about the carriages and said that the trains are <Col N="932" /> old British Rail stock, freezing in winter and roasting in summer, that the trains are constantly late and that she had been late for work four days in one week. She said the trains are filthy and that she called it the Bangladesh express. I have travelled on that train on occasion. Over a year ago on what one might call a policy public relations promotion for Fine Gael, we travelled on that train. An RTE camera crew came with us but, unfortunately, the cameraman could not get the camera up on his shoulder because the train was so overcrowded. It was a bit of a waste from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the first phase of the Luas and the service from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. I raised with the Minister previously &ndash; I think Deputy Conor Lenihan represents that constituency &ndash; the fact that the terminal will be in or around The Square and I believe there may be a multi-storey car park on one of the old CIE sites. One finds it difficult to get into The Square in the first instance. I do not understand why the Luas terminal was not brought out to the Embankment or somewhere in which there would be ample car parking space. At present we are looking at the Red Cow and another car park somewhere else with shuttle buses. We are back to square one. The ideal would be that one could drive into a car park, step out of one's car and get on to the Luas. I would avail of that service because I come in on that road on a number of mornings and the traffic is very heavy. If I had to drive into The Square in Tallaght, go up one of those multi-storey car parks to get a space and, more often than not, come back down because of a lack of spaces, I would continue to drive into Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the east side of the city, there will be stops at Sandyford. I put down questions in the past which examined the feasibility of extending that service to Bray. Deputy Stanton said he was being parochial when he mentioned the east Cork railway, but that is all we can be in that we are here to represent our constituents. Earlier I conveyed the more sane parts of two letters but I get a lot of letters which are not abusive but which are symbolic of the frustration of constituents. There was a review of the Dublin suburban rail system in March 2000. It referred to various matters such as the rail tunnel in central Dublin, two way additional tracks to Kildare and so forth. However, the 50 point executive summary did not mention County Wicklow. The 22 paragraphs of recommendations do not mention County Wicklow. Capacity restraints are mentioned in many places, but never in County Wicklow. This is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>Wicklow town and Arklow are designated as primary and secondary growth centres. Greystones and Bray are in the metropolitan hinterland according to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin region. Transport policy was supposed to work in tandem with these guidelines. However, there is no mention of <Col N="933" /> County Wicklow in the context of improvements in rail services. When I table questions to the Minister she talks about improvement works on the rail line, but that is only upgrading the safety of the rail line. There is no additional service. One cannot designate areas for population growth and not put in the proper infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Councillor Derek Mitchell from Wicklow is on the consultative committee of the DTO. It is only as a result of his pressing the issue of the suburban rail review that the DTO has agreed to examine what can be done for County Wicklow. It should not be necessary to bring such a matter to the attention of the review group. I hope many of the recommendations which have been sent to the review group can be taken on board. I do not know who is to blame for the situation, although the Minister bears ultimate responsibility. There is despair in many areas of County Wicklow at the terrible transport service.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to correct the assertions made by Deputy Timmins in the course of his enjoyably informal contribution to this debate, but there should be some effort at explanation. He expressed his puzzlement that after four years people had given up on the traffic chaos and does not understand the reason nothing has happened. There is a simple explanation. People have got used to the traffic jams. They have to understand there is a medium to long-term solution to this. No Government, not even one comprising the collective brilliance of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, could have coped&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;with the extraordinary level of growth this country has achieved in the last four years. There has been 9.9% growth, year on year, for the past four years. That is a golden era of growth; we will never again see such figures over a sustained period.</P>
      <P>That level of growth generates unique problems. There was a history of under-investment in our railroads and transport infrastructure. That chronic under-investment is now being addressed by the national development plan, which is a structured way of rolling out infrastructure and public transport solutions that meet the needs of the growing population generated by our economic growth. That is the simple explanation of what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a political reason. People have seen through the nonsense spoken by a previous Fine Gael spokesman who shares my constituency, Deputy Brian Hayes. He spent the best part of three years talking up the traffic chaos to no avail. The greater publicity he generated by talking up the traffic jams and chaos, the more reality dawned on the ordinary motorist and commuter that everything was not as Fine Gael claimed. They realised it was hype rather than reality and <Col N="934" /> that no Government could cure the problem overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hayes, in his usual clever style, got out of that portfolio when he realised the game was up. He is now spreading alarm on other issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins referred earlier to Tallaght and wondered where in Tallaght he could park his car. There will be two opportunities for the Deputy to park his car. He can do so in the multi-storey car park in The Square or he can use the generously appointed park and ride facility which will be located at the M50 junction. It is not true that he will have nowhere to park. If he wishes to make the journey from Wicklow and leave the car in Tallaght, he can leave it in The Square and have a coffee. Alternatively, he can go to the park and ride facility at the M50. It is important he is aware of that rather than ask unnecessary questions of the Minister about his travel options.</P>
      <P>There was reference to the late Todd Andrews and the usual canard about getting rid of the Harcourt line. It was a tragedy, but hindsight is wonderful. With hindsight we can see what a terrible decision it was. However, the reality at the time was that Ireland was a chronically under-performing economy. There was no money available to invest in the railway infrastructure because we did not have the population. The Irish were the disappearing race of the globe. People were writing articles in the 1950s that the Irish would disappear from Ireland, such was the outflow from our shores. Todd Andrews is being unfairly blamed by those who look at these matters retrospectively.</P>
      <P>Now, however, the State has the resources to invest in the railroads. An era of under-investment is over and we are reinvesting in railroad infrastructure which this agency is being established to supervise. However, it is not just a functional agency for procurement of carriages and so forth. The word &ldquo;procurement&rdquo; will probably in the long run be dropped from the agency's title. I envisage the agency evolving a role that extends way beyond the simple procurement of infrastructure to encompass the guiding and development of that infrastructure and the promotion of individual train lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has formed the view that the metro and Luas should be self-governed and privately run. That is appropriate and right. We should steer away from the road taken by the United Kingdom in terms of the privatisation of railroads, but need to look urgently at the issue of public-private partnerships in relation to running individual lines. The centralised marketing by Irish Rail has not been great for individual lines. It is time to bring together industry, business and tourism promotion agencies in consortia which could form joint partnerships with those who run the railroads to promote individual lines. There is great potential to promote competition among <Col N="935" /> the regions of the country by involving the private sector, which benefits from greater passenger numbers using the railroads. There could be far greater competition between different regions and different lines. The Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Galway lines, for example, could be promoted vigorously and aggressively through public-private partnerships to encourage people to use them.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for reinvesting in railroads. The primary reason is environmental. There is huge pressure to get people out of private cars and into public transport, particularly trains. This is an exciting development. The national development plan is flawed to the extent that it puts too much emphasis on motorways. It is a sorry truth that the more motorways there are, the greater the traffic will be. Eventually the motorways become clogged with traffic which defeats the original purpose. They do not become efficient means of travelling from one part of the country to another because journey times are increased with the traffic overload. We must examine how, in the medium to long term, we can reduce the building of motorways and improve journey times between certain key parts of the country.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this agency will be in charge of promotion. In the long run, it will have a developmental role in terms of making the vital switch of commuters from one form of transport to another. That is most important. Dublin does not yet have integrated ticketing. We must look at this again and I hope the Minister will address it as a matter of urgency. People will not switch to using public transport unless there is an integrated ticketing system covering one form of transport to the next. If necessary, integrated ticketing should extend to include taxis and hackneys. We have neglected those options and we should examine them more closely.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in Dublin are not co-operating with each other. There is no single transport tsar or chief for the city of Dublin. That is a disgrace and needs to be rectified quickly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the quality bus corridors, my local authority, South Dublin County Council, performed its side of the task and delivered on it on time. When those involved in that work hit the city area it was discovered that those involved in the work at that end were not ready for this famous quality bus corridor from Tallaght and had not prepared the way in alerting shop holders, retailers and the general public of their plans to clear an additional lane. If we are serious about this system, we will need a single transport authority or chief for the city of Dublin to co-ordinate the interaction between the four local authorities we have created. It is good those local authorities have been created, but a high level of co-ordination on transport matters is required between the four.</P>
    <P>There are compelling environmental reasons we should cut down on the building of motor<Col N="936" /> ways. I am very much with the Green Party on this. We have concentrated too much on the building of roads rather than providing an alternative to them.</P>
    <P>The UK experience shows the falseness of privatising the roads. That was a dangerous path the British Government went down. We saw the results of that in the past week when it has had to come back from that. I am not saying that private sector involvement in the railroads is automatically wrong just because the British got it wrong. There is a type of slavish adherence in Ireland to the notion that British practices are some form of lesson for us. The British may have got it wrong in that they failed to invest in the railroads and then expected the new agency to operate efficiently, effectively and profitably in the economic and business sense and from the public point of view.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to Aer Lingus and to other issues. When is it right to sell a State asset? That is a perennial question. Many left wing critics would not agree with this view, but if the State decides to privatise a company, it must make sure that the investment levels in it are appropriate. The State has to take a gamble on that and invest in the infrastructure and then sell it. I am not suggesting that should be done with CIE. Public private partnerships in relation to Irish rail should be the way of the future. The management function and the promotion and business development function should be vigorous and led by the private sector side of the partnership. In the long run companies like Irish Rail are not particularly well attuned or ready for the changeover to being operational and commercial in the way that is now required in the modern world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting it should be privatised lock, stock and barrel. If the Deputy has been listening to me carefully, he would know that I believe the private partnership is the best way forward and that the private sector should take a role in the management and running of the commercial aspect of the railroads. In other words, it should take a role in the promotion of the service as enjoyed or not enjoyed by the passenger but the basic infrastructure would still be publicly owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar analogy could be drawn in terms of whether one would be in favour of the privatisation of the country's airports. Some members of the Government are in favour of privatising Aer Rianta while some members of it, including the Minister for Finance, are opposed to the privatis<Col N="937" /> ation of State infrastructure such as airports. The obvious compromise between those two positions is to allow a franchise or a private sector company to run the airport while the airports continue to be State owned. That would achieve the best result of all. The State would get a return on its asset.</P>
    <P>This is what I am talking about regarding the railroads. The company that owns the infrastructure, the land and the basic core assets of Irish Rail would be State owned and the operational side of the commercial development would essentially be a private task or a task given to a public private partnership or a private partner. That is the answer to all of this. At that level the State would be responsible for the infrastructure, its development and reinvestment in it and it would also be responsible in the long run for the safety, security and strategic planning of rail network. In that way the environmental and other economic imperatives, for which only a Government can plan, can be made. I refer to strategic investment that the private sector is reluctant to make, particularly in relation to railroads and large public infrastructure. The State takes on board and guides those decisions and the operational side could be run based on a private sector ethos. That would help everyone.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the service to date has not been great on Irish railways. We have a rail service to Belfast that is arguably up there with the best of services available in the rest of Europe, but one is faced with an inferior service on almost every other rail journey in Ireland one might have to make. It is difficult even to get a cup of tea or, if one does get one, to get one that is hot when delivered. It is usually moderately cool. There seems to be a dichotomy in the service in that tea is either too hot or too cold, it is never just right, but that is a minor point.</P>
    <P>We are living through exciting times in terms of reinvestment in the railroads. This procurement agency is one of the ways that will be done.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by Deputy Naughten's assertion that the Government was responsible for appointing political hacks of one kind or another to State boards. The board that has been appointed to this procurement agency is a model for what we should do with regard to State boards. Its chairman is Mr. Padraic White, a former leading person in business and commercial life. He is a former chief executive of the IDA and since then has been plying his wares in the private sector. I would have thought he is an ideal person to be chairman of an agency such as this which will have to deal with large procurement issues and big picture purchases. For the information of the House, including Deputy Naughten, the other members of the board are also interesting. They include, Mr. David Manley, an accountant and former president of the chamber of commerce, Margaret O'Mahony, a transport engineer and a lecturer in Trinity College, which is not a bad qualification to have as a member of a board such as this, Colin Hunt, an <Col N="938" /> economist, Fionnuala Kennedy, an economist and Tom Wall, assistant secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The mixture of those skills is perfect for the long-term development of the railroads in which this agency will have a role. Its board members have a mixture of private sector skills from accounting to private sector companies. It has a person with trade union experience and a transport engineer and academic who would be aware of the bigger issues affecting railroads in the long run.</P>
    <P>This board is a model for the type of board that all the politically correct Members of this House insist should be in place if we are to have a company that runs well. I do not necessarily agree with that line of thinking that someone must be qualified in a particular area to serve on a State board nor do I agree with the assertion that political appointments <i>ipso facto</i> by their nature are bad. Some of the appointments made to Irish Rail by the Members opposite were good chairmen, in some cases, and also distinguished business people. We must stop suggesting that the people we, as political parties, collectively appoint are somewhat less than qualified. We all know the strength of the people we have supporting us as political parties. Some of them are extraordinary people who, if there was justice and fairness in our political system, would probably be better off being in this House running the country, but for a variety of reasons, financial and otherwise, they have chosen not to go down the road of politics, which is a poor and badly paid profession. Who could blame them for their choice? We should try to enable those with honest political motivation, whether they support Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, to assist and help develop public companies.</P>
    <P>It is pernicious nonsense to suggest that one has to be specifically qualified to be on a board. One does not need to be a pilot to be on the board of Aer Lingus or an engineer to be involved in the NRA. It is a totally wrong presumption, as the real strength of public boards, as in the private sector, is to have a range of skills available. Those who can give expertise from different backgrounds are needed and this is often achieved by the system of political appointments to State boards. People with a range of different valuable and desirable skills are appointed. We should continue with such a strategy and stop the nonsense of criticising a system which has served us reasonably well.</P>
    <P>A number of State companies, including Irish Rail and CIE, are not regarded as being managed very well. A series of different measures, including the establishment of this agency, have been taken to reform companies. In some cases, public-private partnerships have been set up or people have been allowed to run parts of companies, which is particularly desirable given recent experience. It would have been foolish to simply throw money at Irish Rail or CIE while allowing the existing management culture to remain intact. The Government is addressing the underlying problems, but it will take a long time. The indus<Col N="939" /> trial relations problems of the Irish rail network will not be cured overnight, but greater results will be slowly achieved as we invest more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of sentiments expressed by Deputy Conor Lenihan. There is merit in many of his comments. The Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001, has been overdue for some time. The tradition of inefficiency, unreliability and under-financing in the rail system has to be ended.</P>
      <P>I raised questions in the House about 20 years ago about the capacity and willingness of Iarnród Éireann to raise the railway bridge in Castlebar. The reply given by the then Minister was that it could not be done as there was to be an attempt to electrify the lines. It was also said that we were to have air conditioned carriages, but I pointed out to the Minister that the carriages were already air conditioned. One needed an overcoat if travelling by rail in the west. Things have changed, however, not just as regards money, but in terms of management, quality, efficiency and professionalism. I have always been a supporter of railways. It is a fact that more people and freight can be moved per hour by train than by any other method. There should not be any argument about this. We have had almost five years of unprecedented economic growth and unprecedented generation of wealth. Prioritisation and clarity of agenda are needed if we are to deliver on this growth.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lenihan that the national plan is somewhat skewed in favour of the development of motorways and dual carriageways. A massive development of 100 km of road between Kilcullen and Waterford, 100 metres wide and costing £550 million, was announced last Monday. It will be implemented by 2007. A gargantuan swathe of land is to be transformed forever. Cars, lorries and other vehicles will travel on the motorway only to arrive at further bottlenecks. Bottlenecks have always been evident on the road to the west. There can be delays of up to ten miles at Enfield on a Friday or Sunday evening. When the motorway was built at Lucan, it simply meant that traffic could get to the end of the new stretch of road more quickly before becoming jammed. There should be a readjustment of the national development plan in favour of the rail system, provided there is clarity of agenda and an ability to deliver. Motoring is no longer a joy in Ireland, as it has become a lethal pursuit. I drive to Dublin twice a week and observe at least ten incidences of potentially serious accidents. If a driver in front is travelling slowly and somebody takes a chance by passing out six or eight lorries and cars, an accident may happen with tragic consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More people would use the rail system if it was reliable, efficient and cost-effective. It is a pleasure to travel on a good train system. I travelled between Castlebar and Dublin by train for <Col N="940" /> years, but it became so unreliable that I stopped. There has been a great deal of work in recent years on the line from Heuston to Manulla Junction, just outside Castlebar. It has led to a great improvement, long overdue and much needed. I understand the projection for lines to be upgraded next year is being cut back from 27 miles to 12. It is a shame if that is the case and another example of the lack of clarity and lack of ability to deliver which I mentioned. Why has the projection to provide money for the upgrading of 27 miles of track next year been changed to allow for just 12 miles? Is it because money has been withdrawn, curtailed or overspent?</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has spent a great deal of money on the freight yard in Ballina. It is a big yard, well capable of handling major equipment. A number of multinational industries in the west use the yard extensively. The line from Manulla Junction to Ballina is inferior and should be placed high on the priority list for upgrading. If the freight yard in Ballina is to be used extensively and if investment is to be attracted to County Mayo, the upgrading of the line has to be prioritised. The line from Manulla Junction, through Castlebar, to Westport should also be finished, as both spur lines are the last remaining segments to be redeveloped. Iarnród Éireann will then be in a position to manage effectively a quality asset.</P>
    <P>We need to know what will happen to Heuston Station. There have been rumours of a new station there for some time, but plans have been shelved on numerous occasions. What is the position? On Friday evenings, when the stampede begins on the platforms, people are often knocked in the rush, including people who are on waiting lists for hip operations or other procedures. In most European countries, one can book a ticket in advance. I know this happens in part on the southern line, where travellers can book tickets on the Internet or at stations. There is a practical problem, however, as if a person has a ticket they are entitled to get on the train. A regulation needs to be put in place which takes into account best practice in other countries. It is not right that women with young children and elderly people who come to Dublin to visit, shop or go to hospital are expected to stand in overcrowded carriages. It would be practical for consumers if they were able to book tickets in advance on a system that works.</P>
    <P>I hope the long-standing practice of having different rates of fare from the west to Dublin and from Dublin to the west will be dealt with for once and for all. There are many types of promotion. It was once dearer to travel from Dublin to Westport than from Westport to Dublin, even though one did not travel a longer distance. It was an anomaly that Iarnród Éireann seemed not to want people to travel from Dublin, but did want people to travel to the city.</P>
    <P>People are creatures of habit. Hundreds of students arrive at the rail stations in Westport and Castlebar on Sunday in particular for the 6 p.m. <Col N="941" /> train. They decide to go to a football match or wait around after lunch to spend time with their families before taking the overcrowded 6 p.m. train. They could catch the train at 12.55 p.m. and it might be in the interest of Iarnród Éireann to provide an inducement to encourage people to take the earlier train, such as offering tickets that cost £5 less. Students would avail of such promotions and it would spread the load between the two trains and make it more comfortable for everyone.</P>
    <P>These practical points should be implemented in the interests of consumers who will then use the services. Road travel is now unpredictable. One can leave a certain point at the same time in the morning but find that one's arrival time in Dublin varies by up to 90 minutes, depending on traffic jams or unforeseen incidents. There is room for an early bird train service from Westport and Ballina to Dublin because one cannot exceed the speed limit on the roads. It is the law and one is likely to be apprehended by the Garda or caught by speed cameras. It could cost £200 to get to Dublin by car if one is in a hurry and is caught exceeding the speed limit. When penalty points on licences are introduced, driving and breaking the speed limit could become a heavy burden. This is as it should be and, in this context, people would prefer to use a good train service where they could read a newspaper and have their breakfast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to the western corridor involving a rail link to Rosslare. A decision has been made in principle. There was a long campaign over 20 years, which was led by an tAthair MacGréil, to save the line. Legal cases were taken to ensure that the line could not be lifted. It is still intact in parts. In terms of its redevelopment, there is enormous potential for freight movement, particularly in relation to forestry which is ag fás in the west and north-west in huge tracts of land. In addition to normal freight, the line would be of assistance in sending harvested trees to the plants that use them.</P>
    <P>The number of trucks using the roads is continually increasing. I pointed out in the debate last night that multinational companies in County Mayo alone move £3.5 billion worth of freight by road annually. Much of that freight could be sent by rail, thereby eliminating tonnage from the roads and reducing the impact on the environment. That figure does not take into account the indigenous freight generated by other companies in the county and western region in general.</P>
    <P>When one arrives in Heuston Station, one then has to get a taxi or a bus or walk to the city centre. When I first started coming to the House, the train used to arrive in Westland Row. This meant one arrived in the city centre and was in a position to travel from there to any point. There may have been good reasons for the change but a person arriving in Heuston Station must travel on by some other method or walk to the city centre. I am not sure what the plans for the new Heuston <Col N="942" /> Station involve or whether this aspect will be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>It is a question of considering what could be on offer and I am a strong believer in the capacity of the rail system to be a powerful social and commercial asset to the country. Iarnród Éireann has had a social remit over the years, but it has always needed heavy subsidisation from the Government. The advent of the PPP system is good and I agree with Deputy Lenihan about bringing commercial efficiency into the social end of the rail system in terms of professionalism. While there is a social element in relation to rural parts of the country, the system should be also professional, efficient and competitive.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline how the industrial unrest that has been endemic in Iarnród Éireann will be related to the procurement business or will it have any function in that regard? Will it strictly relate to the business of carriages, etc? If they are not in hand already, plans should be made for the procurement of new carriages. I understand a number are on order and that other good carriages are being purchased from British Rail. However, the purchase of further new carriages should be planned. In addition, the problem of disabled people never getting a fair deal should be addressed. I appreciate that issues such as the width and length of platforms, heights and carriages had to be taken into account, but it is a terrible indictment of us all that a young girl from Ballina in a wheelchair had to sit in the mail van on a number of well documented occasions.</P>
    <P>In one incident, when she arrived in Heuston Station and her friend got off the train to seek assistance, the train was shifted half a mile away to a siding with her still on board. Such problems can be, and are being, rectified but there should be clarity. What will be the position with regard to the new carriages? When will they be available and how many facilities for disabled people will be provided? I recall the famous disabled Olympic champion, Rosaleen Gallagher, who said when she arrived in her wheelchair in Castlebar that they could carry her on because she was a person too and she had a right to travel on the train. She had to sit in her wheelchair between two carriages for the entire journey to Dublin. This was a number of years ago and the situation has changed. However, it should change more and much faster.</P>
    <P>I support the thrust of the Bill and I ask the Minister to refer to the idea of an early bird service from the west. I also want information on the completion of the lines from Manulla to Ballina, for freight and passengers, and from Manulla to Westport. I ask the Minister to clarify that there will be no reduction on the mileage that it was intended to complete next year. I also ask her to clarify the positions regarding carriages, Heuston Station, consumer rights and practicalities for train users. Promotions would result in many people using a system that they know can be good, but which has operated, for whatever reason, to an inferior level for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. The railways have a long and proud tradition in Ireland. The advent of the railways was as big a revolution in the lives of ordinary people as computers have been in the lives of people today. As a young person, I remember how, on a fair day in Tubbercurry, cattle had to be brought to the local railway station and taken from there through Sligo and Leitrim to Northern Ireland and exported to England and Scotland. Unfortunately, cattle bought at marts these days must be exported on lorries.</P>
      <P>That route was part of the closed Colooney-Claremorris railway line. I would like this railway brought into use again. It was the line on which I had my first rail trip and it should be brought into use again to facilitate tourists and people working in Tubbercurry and Charlestown who wish to travel to Sligo. I hope that some day a Minister will reopen the track. Trains on this line carried many emigrants from Tubbercurry, Sligo and Claremorris via Limerick to Cobh where they departed for the United States. Deputy Kenny referred to Father MacGréil and I pay tribute to him for trying to keep the line open and develop a branch line to Knock Airport. I hope some day he will succeed.</P>
      <P>What a pity we did not have a Minister like Deputy O'Rourke in the 1950s and 1960s when many branch lines were forced to close and the track was taken up, particularly in the north-west. This resulted in increased traffic on our roads and nowadays the road network cannot cope with the volume of traffic. The narrow gauge lines that were taken up could have been used to develop a significant tourist attraction such as the one I visited in Snowdonia in north Wales.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of the rail system is a long and tedious process. Much needs to be done in laying modern, continuous track and the provision of comfortable, air conditioned rolling stock. I acknowledge the work of the Government and the Minister, in particular, in upgrading the Dublin-Sligo line. A total of £40 million has been invested in the line over the past four years, the vast majority of which was used to lay continuous welded track and concrete sleepers. Some level crossings, fencing and bridges have been upgraded but the bulk of the money was invested in safety, which meant replacing old timber sleepers and joined track with concrete sleepers and continuous welded track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our railway system is an essential part of our infrastructure for both passenger and freight traffic. At a time when road travel has become more hazardous we are privileged that Ireland's rail safety record is second to none. It is alarming, however, that there is a new sinister threat to <Col N="944" /> passenger safety, namely stone throwing. Stones are thrown at trains as they approach Dublin city and Connolly Station, in particular, and I have witnessed people being injured. I was travelling to a football match in Dublin on a train one Sunday when a stone crashed though the window of top of us as we played cards. It is a shame and I am aware of a number of incidents which resulted in people needing hospital treatment. I call on the relevant authorities to take all the necessary steps to eliminate these acts of outrageous vandalism. Young men are involved and if they were spoken to it may not happen again.</P>
    <P>Trains are the most comfortable mode of travel. Approximately 20 minutes has been saved in the journey time from Dublin to Sligo. The service no longer stops at Maynooth because an Arrow service has been provided to the town, which is welcome. It is wonderful that a number of stations such as my local station, Ballymote, have been upgraded considerably.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny that people should be allowed to book train seats in advance. Sometimes people arrive to catch a train in the evening but all the seats have been taken and this creates a problem for elderly people in particular. Certain tickets should be capable of being booked in advance. Rail companies throughout Europe provide advance booking which means that one is guaranteed a seat and that would be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a daily service from Longford to Dublin, which means that people from the midlands and north-west can go to work in Dublin and return home in the evening. Constituents of mine from Carrick-on-Shannon travel daily to Dublin to work. They drive to Longford, take the train to Dublin and return home in the evening. This significant improvement and the investment of £40 million in the rail service has been of tremendous benefit to those using the Dublin-Sligo line.</P>
    <P>I recall that when Deputy Jim Mitchell was Minister for Transport during the 1980s I would regularly ask him to upgrade the Dublin-Sligo line during debates in the House. Afterwards he would ask me how was the line and I would say to him that the Government had not spent much on it yet. However, there was not much money around at the time. The provision of EU funding has allowed the Government to fund the upgrading of our railway lines. The rail network is excellent and many people avail of it. The Dublin-Cork line is one of the best and the finest rolling stock is used on it. However, I hope the services to Westport, Ballina and Sligo will be upgraded to the same standard as the Dublin-Cork line so that the west can benefit from the Celtic tiger. The upgrading of the Dublin-Sligo line is almost complete with only three miles of continuous welded track to be laid. When that has been done, it will be one of the best lines in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan outlined for us everything that was splendid about travelling <Col N="945" /> to the west and Tubbercurry, in particular, in the good old days. He will also recall an occasion many years ago when he travelled to Dublin and missed a boat connection because the train was late. I wonder whether anything has changed in the interim.</P>

      <P>We criticise our rail and bus systems too often and that affects the morale of the workers. I thank those who work on the Dublin-Cork service as it is absolutely excellent. They are generous with their time, forthcoming and amiable. They sell Iarnród Éireann well. In recent years I have been very pleased with Irish Rail's marketing strategy for the Dublin-Cork service. It is treated as a commodity which provides a comfortable mode of travel and more and more people are leaving their cars behind. That has generated its own problems but I commend the Minister on the funding that has been made available for the upgrading of the Dublin-Cork line because travel between both cities is now faster and more comfortable with a dramatic improvement in the quality of carriages.</P>
      <P>The integrated transport system is the new phrase. When one talks about transport integration, one is talking about roads, railways and airports. It is vital to co-ordinate all such activities. If we do not do that, it will not be possible to encourage people out of their cars and into the trains. It is important to co-ordinate all the services, including the buses which feed the train stations and the airports. We must ensure the necessary funding is put in place.</P>
      <P>We should not separate the National Roads Authority from the national transport system. We should look at the mistakes which have been made to date and at the road network around Dublin and the airport. Although an excellent major road infrastructure was put in place, it seems strange that we did not also design a light rail system which would take people from Dublin city centre to the airport. There is no point crying about something which did not happen, but it should have been done. As our population expands and we continue to invest in our national development plan, it is important to ensure that county and city development plans take into account the co-operation which needs to exist between the National Roads Authority and the rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House an example of what I mean and I hope I am forgiven for being parochial. There are 16,000 people in Ballincollig. A new strategic plan for the next 20 years will soon be introduced. The NRA is currently carrying out a scoping study on a road to link Ballincollig with the northern ring road and the Mallow road. It is a sensible and logical plan. However, the NRA is looking only at the possibility of a road link and not a rail link which would take people from the western end of the city to the new stations which will be developed in the Blarney, Monard and <Col N="946" /> other growth areas. That would help the new developments in the city. That level of co-operation is vital if we want to get the integrated system we desire.</P>
    <P>There is much property adjacent to our railway stations which could be better utilised. Strategic plans should be drawn up to develop them. Could we develop them in tandem with IDA Ireland, Forfás, the county enterprise boards or the Leader programmes? There are opportunities to develop the land banks and buildings at many of our railway stations throughout the country. We have not utilised them to their full capacity. Perhaps Iarnród Éireann would benefit from the small businesses and industries which could develop around such centres.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the Cork strategic study and the implications for the rail network and the integrated transport system. Part of the strategic study includes a plan for dock development in Cork city. We will refurbish Ceannt railway station and make it more customer friendly. However, I have been told that Bus Éireann will not have its main terminus in the new development. We are planning for the next 20 years and trying to remodel the railway station, yet people will have to walk into the city centre or get a taxi. There will not be a major bus terminus in the proposed station which would help the flow of commuter traffic. The Minister should ask Bus Éireann and Irish Rail to ensure that there is proper integration between the rail and bus services in the new development. If that does not happen, it will be a big deficit in the overall transport system.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to service many of our towns with improved quality bus corridors. I live in a town where the population has increased from 4,500 to 20,000 in the past 20 to 25 years, yet we do not have a city bus service. Carrigaline, Glanmire and Blarney do not have one either. Yet the strategic study suggests that the main emphasis will be the refurbishment of the rail line to ensure that more stations are developed to accommodate people. It will also ensure that more buses and quality bus corridors are provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, was a member of Cork Corporation when the LUTS plan was introduced which placed great emphasis on rail and bus services. However, as the land use and transportation study came to an end, a proper review of how much money was put into the transport infrastructure was not carried out. An adequate level of funding was not put in to match the growth of the towns which were part of the overall plan. This strategic plan is based on the fact that houses should be built beside a rail line. If we want to be consistent, the rail line must be extended to Midleton. The county development plan proposes to zone land along the rail line which will enable people to leave their cars at home and take the train into town. However, if a bus terminus and <Col N="947" /> service are not provided at the new Ceannt station, it will not work.</P>
    <P>A situation is developing at present which is extraordinary for Bus Éireann. New buses will be provided for the Ballincollig service at the end of the year. However, while it will have capital funding, the funding to employ people to operate the buses has not been provided. It has been suggested that the buses will be provided but there is no guarantee that there will be enough funding to employ people to operate the buses when they come on stream.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the position in Ballincollig and Carrigaline where additional bus services are being proposed. He should ensure that the necessary funding is available. In order for bus corridors to operate successfully it is vital to examine the example of some British cities where on-street parking is banned. Drivers are thus being forced to park off the streets in multi-storey car parks. If that system was introduced here our bus system could operate far more efficiently and effectively.</P>

      <P>This important Bill provides for the involvement of public-private partnerships concerning Iarnród Éireann in what can be a growth area. I wish to seek clarification of certain matters, however. Is the Minister aware that a comprehensive feasibility study of a commuter rail project in Sligo has been completed and has been on her desk for the past six months? When will the Minister give a decision on this innovative project which involves the towns of Ballysadare, Collooney and Ballymote? </P>
      <P>I acknowledge the investment that has been made in continuous rail and I congratulate the Government for that, but now that we have the track it should be used. It represents a great opportunity for economic development.</P>
      <P>I must acknowledge the work undertaken by the south Sligo rapid transport group, whose personnel includes Tim Mulcahy from Ballymote, Wendy Lyons from Collooney, and Jude Gilligan from Ballysadare. These three towns south of Sligo are growth centres which are experiencing a greatly increased level of road traffic. The group's study has lain on the Minister's desk for six months, yet the committee has received no reaction to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the south Sligo group's committee for having appointed Halcro, the leading European consultants, to work on the study. The study has provided clear indications that such a rapid transit system would be economically feasible. I appeal to the Minister to make direct contact with the south Sligo rapid transport group concerning <Col N="948" /> this important issue. We should get a commitment and a decision from the Minister. When voluntary groups engage top consultants it is a clear indication that the project is feasible. The massive investment that has been made in continuous rail track underscores the transport opportunities that exist in the Sligo area. Progress has been made in the development of transport infrastructure in the Border, midlands and west region, including the Border counties. The investment that has been made presents huge opportunities but the Minister should ensure that people can commute from Ballymote or Boyle to Sligo.</P>
    <P>Given the changes that are now being planned in transport infrastructure, the role of private enterprise is becoming increasingly important. Business opportunities will now arise from the modernisation of railway lines that have been under-utilised to date. The Bill represents what is very much an east coast brief from the point of view of alternative services. It would be remiss of the Government, however, not to avail of the opportunities arising from railtrack investment in the west. The associated private enterprise opportunities should be allowed to develop also and if a public-private partnership opportunity arises it should be exploited.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to note that the Minister has not replied to the report which has been on her desk for the past six months. I do not know the reason for this but I would be interested to have her reaction. Her Department should contact the relevant committee for serious consultation. I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on this important issue.</P>
    <P>The development of the Sligo-Claremorris-Limerick railway line is an issue which is dear to my heart. The Minister has indicated that it would cost £100 million to re-open this line but one should consider that £45 million is being spent on the Claremorris bypass. I raised this matter on the Adjournment recently in order to establish the prospects of re-opening the Collooney to Claremorris railway as part of the Sligo-Limerick route. There is an unbalanced approach to the east and west coasts. Millions of pounds are being spent on roads but I cannot understand why such investment is not being made in the railways. Some weeks ago I saw an Iarnród Éireann engineer on TV3 who clearly indicated the viability of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>Such an investment of £100 million would present opportunities to develop the entire west coast, further opening up the tourism potential of the area. I congratulate Dr. Michael MacGréil who, as chairman of the western intercounty railway committee, has repeatedly made the case for restoring the Collooney-Claremorris line as part of the Sligo-Limerick route. Over the years, Dr. MacGréil has discussed the project with Deputies representing the region.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department is preparing to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on re-opening the Dublin-Navan rail link. A fraction of those sums would benefit the west by providing <Col N="949" /> rail transport from Sligo to Limerick and on to Waterford and Rosslare. The idea represents a huge potential for the future. We are extraordinarily lucky that the rail system is owned by the State. If the Government will not take the initiative then the Western Development Commission should do so. All we are seeking from the Minister is a feasibility study.</P>
    <P>This morning, I heard that more consultants are being appointed by the Government. It is time for the Minister to commission a consultant to produce a report on the Sligo-Limerick rail link. Failing that, I am calling on the Western Development Commission, a statutory body, to take the initiative by commissioning such a study. That rail line would be of benefit to so many counties on the western seaboard for which the commission has responsibility. While we have not succeeded in commissioning a report so far, the Western Development Commission has a mandate to work for the development of the western counties. I am also calling on the enterprise boards in the relevant counties to co-fund such a feasibility study. I am convinced that such a rail link would play a major role in developing tourism by opening up the western seaboard to growth opportunities both at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>Access to the west by modern public transport is vital for such developments to occur. The rail link I have outlined would also bring about a reduction in road accidents as well as promoting energy savings. So many benefits would accrue from this link that I cannot understand why it is not being accepted by the Government. We are talking about spending £1 billion on the dome in Dublin &ndash; although the Taoiseach is having second thoughts about it now &ndash; but such investment is required for the BMW region.</P>
    <P>There are many committees and designated areas, but it is all talk and no action. A clear commitment to an improved transport system in the west is required in order to develop the region, particularly given the existing levels of road traffic. A proper study of transport needs would illustrate the demand for such a rail system. The Government must try to understand the current transport difficulties so as to be able to offer adequate responses instead of paying lip service to the problem.</P>
    <P>We must examine the development of the Sligo line and the rolling stock which is up to 40 years old. There is great potential in the region but, unfortunately, it has few population centres. The main connection is a twice daily service between Dublin and Sligo. The loss of the connection to Enniskillen was a significant blow if we are to grow the island of Ireland as a tourism destination. Rail is a luxurious way to travel.</P>
    <P>A top consultancy firm, Halcro, has been commissioned to produce a feasibility study regarding the south Sligo rapid transit initiative. I appeal to the Minister to approve this proposal as it is a great idea which will bring life to this important Bill. There is no point introducing a Bill for the <Col N="950" /> sake of it. I hope this legislation will provide guidelines for private sector involvement to provide this service in south Sligo. I congratulate the communities in Ballisodare, Collooney and Ballymote for this idea and for their commitment to concluding this study. I hope the Minister will respond favourably in the next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on Iarnród Éireann as it exists in my constituency. The West Clare Railway was known in song and story such as &ldquo;Are Ye Right There Michael&rdquo;. However, in the early 1960s the Government closed the service for economic reasons. This was a narrow gauge railway which is working well in India to where the equipment was shipped.</P>
      <P>This region is also served by a main line which runs from Limerick to Galway, through Athenry. This line was closed and then reopened and 100 passengers use the 6.45 a.m. service every day travelling to work in Limerick or on to Dublin or other destinations. However, the line is not attractive as a 30 mph speed limit applies.</P>
      <P>As a result of the growth in passenger numbers, I understood that Iarnród Éireann was to complete the upgrading of this line. However, no upgrading has taken place on the seven mile stretch which was supposed to be completed this year. At the same time Clare County Council and my colleagues are seeking the opening of a rail spur to Shannon Airport which would take heavy traffic off the Limerick to Ennis and Limerick to Shannon routes. This would provide a modern airport with a rail spur.</P>
      <P>There has been an absence of thought and planning in this regard. For example, a bridge is being built at Ballycasey Cross which will only accommodate road traffic travelling from Sixmilebridge and east Clare into Shannon. This was an opportunity to provide additional road space if Iarnród Éireann contemplated a rail spur. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, told her Fianna Fáil colleagues in Clare that she supports such a spur. I criticise Iarnród Éireann as it does not seem to co-ordinate its plans with the NRA or other infrastructural developments which are taking place. Significant amounts of money will be spent on this new bridge if the Minister obtains the money to provide the spur connecting the rail line from Limerick or the west to Shannon Airport. It is disheartening that planning has not been integrated.</P>
      <P>Given the quality of the line and the 30 mph speed limit, I do not understand why work on the seven mile stretch has not been completed this year. Why are these areas placed on the long finger? Ennis has experienced significant growth in recent years. I could suggest that the town has grown every year since I became a Deputy for Clare in 1981. I am proud to be associated with that growth, but we are limiting access opportunities to the wider world by not developing this rail line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the issue of the station in Ennis. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe spoke about proposals for <Col N="951" /> Cork. At least there seems to be a happy relationship between Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann in Ennis and the bus and rail stations are amalgamated. However, the station requires upgrading, a rub of paint and to be brought into the 21st century. Such developments would persuade more people to use it and would make it more attractive for visitors to travel the line from Ennis to Limerick when it is provided.</P>
    <P>The problem will not be resolved unless a feeder service, similar to that planned for Dublin, is provided for the Ennis to Limerick line. This will require the acquisition of small commuter trains. The procurement of trains is provided for in the Bill, but this rolling stock is being acquired for Dublin only. There is nothing about the south whether Cork, Ennis or Limerick. Are we to be given cast-offs when the tired engines begin to creak in Heuston Station? Will these engines be sent down to us and used on the Limerick to Ennis line? That is unacceptable. When Iarnród Éireann is planning commuter services it should plan for areas throughout the country. Growth areas such as Ennis and Limerick are attractive. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe spoke about Ballincollig and Cork city and there are plenty of growth areas outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>When Minister of State I supported Father MacGréil's initiative and I still do. This initiative entails the reopening of the Collooney-Claremorris-Limerick line. There is a need for a western corridor to act as a counter. However, this proposal has been left in abeyance. It was put on the long finger when my party was in Government, but the Western Development Commission provided new opportunities. The commission was given authority to provide venture capital for infrastructural developments which would not normally be undertaken by the private sector. By securing private sector investment in a public-private partnership using Western Development Commission venture capital, the entire line from Limerick to Claremorris could be opened through the provision of small commuter services. These services could also transport freight, such as that from maturing forests, which is currently being moved by road. The volume of forestry products being delivered to Ennis station is growing significantly. To complement the significant investment in the roads infrastructure, the Western Development Commission and the private sector could be given a licence to operate commuter services on the Sligo to Limerick line. It would be possible to run short commuter services around Sligo, Ennis, Shannon and Limerick.</P>
    <P>Money has always been an obstacle in regard to the provision of rail services. When I was a Minister of State, Iarnród Éireann was prepared to upgrade the line to Athenry but nothing has happened. The line between Ennis and Athenry is in an appalling state of repair. Will it take another Fr. MacGréil to ensure the Ennis to Athenry line remains open? The Bill, which is somewhat restrictive, should address these serious local issues. The purchasing power provided for in the Bill should extend to the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2000. The Bill's main purpose is to provide for the establishment of an independent commercial statutory body &ndash; the Railway Procurement Agency &ndash; whose main function will be the procurement of railway infrastructure. The Bill is also designed to facilitate private sector participation in the construction, operation and maintenance of new railways. The Bill repeals the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, and re-enacts its provisions in a modified form to provide a single railway procurement procedure and to provide for the regulation of light rail. Nobody could disagree with the purposes of the Bill as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, foremost of which is the development of quality infrastructure to support a reliable and efficient public transport system.</P>
      <P>Most of us have used rail services. There is much discussion in Dublin about the closure of the Harcourt Street line, a real old chestnut. Hopefully, we will witness visionary developments in regard to this line and others. It must be acknowledged that serious work has been done to ensure we have an adequate transport network in the years ahead. Many of my colleagues from the regions referred to line closures and, of course, we would like to see these lines reopened. I spend a considerable amount of time in County Cork. A colleague from that region informs me that it takes him as long to get out of Cork county as it does to get from Cork to Dublin. It is difficult to comprehend why anyone decided to close the regional rail lines, such as the Bantry line which was closed in the 1960s, which operated in the past. These lines should be reopened to serve what are now densely populated areas.</P>
      <P>The closure of rail lines throughout the country has had a ripple effect on the owners of domestic and commercial property along those lines. If these property owners want to develop their properties, they are informed that the future operation of the lines is under consideration. I appreciate, as would most reasonable people, the need for due consideration to be given to these issues. However, in certain instances, State and semi-State agencies and bodies working under their aegis are perceived as leaving matters on the back burner for unacceptably long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is outside my constituency, I was contacted by people in the Kilmessan area in which there is an old railway line. These people made inquiries through the appropriate channels many years ago but to no avail. In one case, a commercial property owner who is surrounded by competitors who are free to develop their businesses has been informed that he cannot develop his commercial activity because of the potential implications of such development on the disused line. Swift decisions should be made about these lines once they have been given adequate consideration. That would allow people to weigh up their options, sell their properties and move on <Col N="953" /> rather than having to wait years for a decision which may or may not benefit them. It is frustrating for property owners to find themselves prohibited from extending either their homes or businesses to make them more viable.</P>
    <P>I intend to focus on services in the Dublin region and wish to acknowledge the fact that whenever I bring an issue to the Minister's attention, she is more than willing to attempt to resolve and progress it. Over the years I have tabled many questions on the operation of the transport network in the Dublin region. The Minister has often approached me privately and given me as much assistance as possible.</P>
    <P>I recently brought to her attention the difficulties that commuters experience during peak travel hours in the city area. I expressed my concerns about DART and in particular on grounds of health and safety. She very quickly arranged for the chief railway inspector, Mr. John Welby, to meet with me at a station of my designation, at a time of my choosing, to see the difficulties that commuters experience at peak times. I appreciate Mr. Welby taking the time and trouble to meet me and I appreciate his understanding of the issues that I have brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When a Member tables a question on the use of a particular system by a semi-State company, the response is often that operational matters are the day-to-day responsibility of the relevant board. That bothers me. The DART, which runs through my constituency, has the potential to bring many thousands of people to and from the city in safety. It allows users to avoid using other forms of transport, both public and private. I have a great appreciation for the work of Iarnród Éireann, CIE, Bus Átha Cliath, DART and all the others that have been involved in the provision and delivery of transport services. They have one of the best safety records not alone in this State, but internationally. I say that of DART in particular, it has a very proud safety record.</P>
    <P>I am known by my constituents to attend DART stations at the peak time of 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m.&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy feel that setting up another agency, not accountable to the Minister, might make it more difficult for him to represent his constituents by way of parliamentary questions in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have concerns about setting up another agency. One must try to achieve a balance. If this will assist in the procurement of new railway infrastructure that otherwise could not be achieved and bring in PPPs, that would be good. On the other hand I appreciate where Deputy Stanton is coming from with his question. I am somewhat frustrated with the existing system. One wonders why only two DART carriages arrive in a busy urban station at peak time. When a question is tabled, it is referred to as being an operational matter and therefore a matter for the day-to-day running of the service. In other instances when it relates to an outside agency, it is not a matter for the Minister to respond to.</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous safety record, but I am concerned at the high numbers currently using the DART. I am also concerned at the capacity of Iarnród Éireann to respond to current requirements. Unfortunately hooligans did tremendous damage by setting fire to DART carriages in Fairview depot. That put a number of carriages out of use. At the same time 16 new carriages were delivered.</P>
      <P>Maybe we should be prepared to go ahead with new ventures, such as those proposed, but let us correct the ills of the past and tie them into contractual arrangements. I hold very strong views on Bus Átha Cliath. It is heavily subvented via CIE, which in turn is subvented by Government. It is my desire to see these companies get subvention with a mechanism, by means of consumer response, to determine if there is a satisfactory bus service in place. The first I hear of a bus service being withdrawn or re-routed in my constituency is when a constituent calls me. In many instances people have a genuine concern it has been done because the population in the area is elderly and many have free travel passes. The perception is that the service is being withdrawn because it does not generate cash. I believe these decisions are made by the service provider without regard for, or communication with, the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome an opportunity like this that may allow us to tie such issues into new mechanisms. We can learn from the past where agencies have been established and then we find that we cannot find anything out about it in the House. We cannot get a reply because it is not the responsibility of the Minister in question. If establishing new agencies creates these kinds of problems, let us correct it now when setting up a new agency. Equally, in those instances where Members are informed that operational day to day matters are the responsibility of the service provider, we should put our heads together to ensure a satis<Col N="955" /> factory mechanism is put in place to provide an adequate response.</P>
    <P>It is vital that these service providers are asked to establish a user council type group. This should occur on a regional basis to accommodate Members and allow us to raise a regional issue or express a view, similar to views raised by several speakers today, on an annual or biannual basis either to the Department or agencies operating under its auspices. Nowadays, there is usually unanimity among Members and public representatives making representations on behalf of a group of constituents on the provision of services.</P>
    <P>Due to time constraints, I will not be able to focus on several issues. I have been party to a huge body of research undertaken on service provision in my constituency of Dublin North-Central. I express my appreciation for the work of the staff of the Department of Public Enterprise, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and the Minister in particular.</P>
    <P>I note none of the Members present is from the Dublin region, where the greater Dublin transportation initiative is being undertaken. It involves an immense amount of work, most of which is dead, in other words, its benefits are not yet tangible. I understand that the benefits of the tremendous investment under way, will be tangible from the year 2003 when the Luas, the metros, the Dublin port tunnel, integrated ticketing and many other initiatives come on stream. I wish all involved continued success. We are monitoring developments closely. I welcome the Bill. It will improve our infrastructure and, I hope, encourage private public partnership.</P>

        <b>:</b> Tuigim go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair chun feabhais a chur ar an gcóras sa todhchaí ach chuala mé Teachtaí ag caint inniu faoin gcóras atá ann faoi láthair. Bhí daoine acu ag moladh agus daoine acu ag gearáin agus leanfaidh mise ar an tslí céanna, ag moladh agus ag gearáin.</P>
      <P>When I heard Deputy Donal Carey refer to the West Clare Railway, it convinced me I am approaching the fossil stage. I admit that in my youth I heard and saw the West Clare Railway arrive and leave Cragaknock station, which was not far from my home. I am pleased the carriages are performing so well in India transporting thousands of people on the narrow gauge line. The reference to the narrow gauge railway reminded me that the Carlow to Dublin line was a double line until several years after the foundation of the State. That double line continues today from Cherryfield through Kildare into Dublin. Reopening the second line from Dublin to Carlow could make a big difference to the existing service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have requested the extension of the Arrow system to include Carlow. This does not necess<Col N="956" /> arily mean running the same number of trains provided closer to Dublin. However, the provision of a more regular service between Carlow and Dublin is required. At present, a train departs at 6.30 a.m. from Carlow. That is an excellent time, but it is too early for people who do not need to be in Dublin at 8.00 a.m. The next Dublin bound train leaves at 9.00 a.m. which is too late for people working in Dublin. Many people have bought houses in Carlow to commute to Dublin. It would be better to encourage people off the roads. I, therefore, ask the officials to consider reopening the second line from Carlow to Cherryfield to allow more trains to run.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Owen, has been fighting bravely for her constituents to get a better inward bound morning train service through Donabate and Malahide. I have been informed of several reasons this train service is a danger to the public. It should carry a health warning for passengers. The train now leaves from Dundalk rather than Drogheda and is crammed full by the time it reaches Donabate, which means people have to force themselves on board.</P>
    <P>I have heard several reports about this line which would be funny were they not so serious. People are boarding the train backwards because it helps avoid getting caught in the closing doors. I am informed that a girl who normally has her feet firmly on the ground travelled several miles without her feet touching the floor because she was caught between several men. In another case, a schoolboy carrying a satchel on his back was asked to take it off and hold it over his head to allow another passenger to board the train. What is happening with the service? Where are the health and safety regulations? If one of these full trains was suddenly forced to stop, what would happen to all those passengers squeezed in like sardines, swaying to and fro in a motion similar to the domino effect?</P>
    <P>I realise Deputy Owen is fighting a battle on this matter. We, obviously, need extra carriages. It may not be possible to get them overnight, but there is something wrong with a system that did not anticipate the need for extra carriages. I will not be smart or claim 20/20 vision or ciall cheannaithe, but it is absurd that a person could leave home with a full set of teeth and arrive in the city centre with front teeth missing because a fellow passenger has fallen on top of him or her. Recently, someone tripped over another passenger's plaster cast. Why is something not being done for the safety of passengers using the train service at Donabate? One can imagine the effect of trying to board an already crammed train in Malahide. RTE, instead of trying to create comedy programmes, should film people having to push to get on these trains. They would have a ready made programme which might get something done and even provide amusement for people in Wicklow.</P>

      <Quest>the arrangements which are in place to defend this State and the institutions of this State against an air attack such as occurred in New York; the arrangements which have been agreed to with the British Government should a plane be hijacked in Irish airspace and substantial concern arises that any such plane could be used here, in Britain or any other European Union member state to mount such an attack.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The dastardly deeds in the United States on 11 September 2001, have highlighted new security risks for the entire world. While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken.</P>
      <P>In this regard mutual assistance and co-operation is maintained between the Irish security services and those of other countries to ensure effective flows of relevant intelligence. It will be appreciated that, in the interests of security, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific measures being undertaken to guard against or to counter such terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the security committee which was convened on the evening of the attacks on the US on 11 September members of the Cabinet were briefed on the security precautions which had been put in place immediately arising from those attacks. A high level contact group was set up to monitor developments and emergency services were asked to ensure their arrangements were fully up to date. Since then the security committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group continues to meet on a regular basis. In the aftermath of the terrorist events of 11 September, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, NCASC, which is chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise and which includes, <i>inter alia,</i> civil and military representatives from my Department, has convened seven special meetings to date, the first of which took place on the day following the events in the United States. At those meetings, the NCASC has been reviewing existing aviation security procedures for Irish aviation in the light of the current security situation, has strengthened existing procedures and is examining specific security proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the handling of a hijacked aircraft, procedures have been agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, for the <Col N="958" /> exchange of relevant information between member states.</P>
    <P>At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation. In support of the emergency planning authorities in updating their emergency plans it was arranged that the contact group would seek to identify specific additional threats which needed to be taken on board in revised emergency plans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The unprecedented attacks on the US have clearly changed the context in which emergency planning must take place. Accordingly, a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has taken place, following which the Government have decided to set up an office of emergency planning in my Department. That office will take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to confirm that he is aware that the Chief of Staff said that this State has no airborne defence capacity. I ask the Minister to answer the question I asked him. If he learned this afternoon that a plane had been hijacked in Irish air space, that it was in Irish air space and if there was a concern that it was going to be used as a weapon to crash into people and buildings in this State, in the United Kingdom or in France, is there an arrangement in place with the British Government which would allow us to call for assistance from the RAF to intercept such aircraft?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief of Staff made that statement. We do not have an air intercept capability; we have surface to air missiles. The Deputy is talking about a doomsday situation. In the Indian situation recently, the captain in the cockpit of the plane thought the hijacker was in the rear; the people in the rear of the plane thought the hijacker was in the cockpit. There must be a degree of certainty about these matters in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The number of planes using the airspace means that there is a need for a degree of accuracy and this calls for a care which is certainly not within our capacity. I am fairly certain that it is not available too close to us either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>

What action would the State take? What arrangements have been agreed with any other state to take action? Would we simply sit back and adopt the Joe Jacob philosophy of military technique which maintains that it will be all right on the night? <Col N="959" /> The people are entitled to know if something specific has been agreed.</P>

      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This project forms part <Col N="960" /> of the major investment programme upon which this Government embarked in 1997. The competition involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001, and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Ltd. from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland.</P>
      <P>The tenders are being subjected to a comprehensive evaluation process which included visits to each of the four companies involved. This evaluation process is being undertaken by a project team comprising officials from my Department and Air Corps personnel assisted by an outside consultant. The team's report will be examined by my Department to ensure policy and procedural compliance, after which negotiations will be entered into with a selected contractor.</P>
      <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation states that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, not necessarily in order of priority: (1) functional characteristics; (2) technical merit; (3) all maintenance and on-line technical support; (4) after sales service and warranty terms on offer; (5) cost and ready availability of spare parts; (6) tender prices; (7) life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>
      <P>I am advised that other factors cannot be taken into account as part of the evaluation process. It is not possible to alter the award of contract criteria once the competition has begun.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in EU procurement directives for the use of offset and therefore it is not the practice of the Department of Defence to consider offset or countertrade issues in the assessment of tenders. In any event, it would not be possible to measure objectively the value of such offers in the assessment of tenders. The long-term economic effects of such offers would be unquantifiable for a variety of reasons.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on countertrade, were they to be a consideration in the course of a tender competition, would invariably take place between the tenderer and a company or number of companies located here. In such circumstances there could be no control over the conduct of those negotiations by the Government Department in question.</P>

        <i>Additional information</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>From the point of view therefore of maintaining a truly competitive process any consideration of countertrade should only come into play after a decision to enter into contract negotiations with the chosen tenderer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Once a decision on the merits has been made on a particular contract it is the practice in my Department to seek offset in Ireland in the case of major contracts. It is, of course, made clear to the contractor that there is no legal or contractual obligation to provide such offset. Many contracts have resulted in significant offset to the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>One company in the tendering process sought an extension of the closing date. During that period the company submitted a new bid which was 27% less than the original bid and the Department of Defence now refuses to accept this second bid. Considering the financial implications for the Department and the overall cost of this project, why will the Department of Defence not recognise the second offer from one of the participants, given that it was within the tender period?</P>

I assure the Deputy that this process is being carried out in strict adherence to EU procurement regulations and I expect to make a final decision on the matter before the end of the year. Once a decision on the merits has been made on a contract, it is the practice of my Department, at that stage, to look at whatever offsets in Ireland may be available, in a major contract of that size.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the evening of the attacks on the US, members of the Cabinet were briefed by the security committee on the security precautions which had been put in place arising from those attacks. The security committee includes the Secretaries General to the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department <Col N="962" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>A high level contact group, chaired by Department of the Taoiseach and comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the Departments immediately concerned, was set up to monitor developments. The emergency services under their aegis was asked to ensure its arrangements were fully up to date. Since then, the security committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group has also met regularly. At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation.</P>
      <P>In support of the emergency planning authorities in updating their emergency plans, it was arranged that the high level contact group would seek to identify specific additional threats which needed to be taken on board in revising emergency plans. At a meeting in the Department of the Taoiseach, of key Departments and agencies involved in emergency planning, arrangements were made for Defence Forces ordnance experts to assist planning authorities in their review of existing plans to take account, as appropriate, of any possible chemical and biological weapons threat.</P>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is taking place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context for such emergency planning. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peace time emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from international terrorism. In those circumstances, the Government decided, on 2 October 2001 to set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence. The new office is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved, and exercising an oversight role in relation to peace time planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The existing lead role of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will continue.</P>
      <P>I established the office of emergency planning on 4 October 2001. The office, which includes four senior staff, both civil and military, with additional support staff to be assigned as required, will be located in the Department's head office in Dublin. The operation of similar bodies in other jurisdictions is also being looked at to benefit from best international practice. I will make regular reports to the Cabinet and the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to the work of the new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is in place an extensive framework <Col N="963" /> of peace time emergency plans, it is now clear that the basis on which emergency planning is currently carried out needs to be reviewed to take into account the possibility, however remote, of chemical and biological or other attacks on this State and its people or on neighbouring countries which could indirectly impact on this State. This process of review is continuing.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the activation of major emergency plans have not changed in light of the Government's decision to set up the office of emergency planning. The responsibility for specific emergency planning functions and response arrangements will remain with the relevant Departments and agencies, as heretofore. Response planning for major emergencies is carried out at local authority, health board or Garda division levels and inputs from my Department, including the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, are factored into these plans. My Department will assist the development of the continuous process of threat assessment being conducted by Government. The high level contact group, established in the wake of the events of 11 September, will in future be convened by the Department of Defence to support the office of emergency planning.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target for international terrorist attacks. It is prudent that the situation is kept under constant review in light of any escalation in international terrorism, but the most important defence against any attack is vigilance leading to detection of potential terrorists and prevention of their activities by the security forces. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces have assured me that all necessary resources are being deployed to this end.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all Departments and agencies through the high level contact group and the office of emergency planning. The Defence Forces are ready to provide any assistance required of them.</P>

      <P>The office was established on 4 October, it currently has two civil and two military staff and additional resources will be provided as necessary. There are very senior and experienced people involved at that level. The office will play a lead role in co-ordinating matters and has met every day to work out the scope of its brief and to enjoin with the other Departments and agencies in updating the plans to <Col N="964" /> ensure that we have the best possible arrangements in place to deal with any emergency or threat that could arise.</P>

Will the office have a role in co-ordinating the Defence Forces, the Red Cross, the Department of Health and Children etc. I want to pin down exactly what the office will do. Does the Minister envisage that, as a result of this group being set up, there will be a request for additional resources and will his Department take that into consideration in the Estimates? What precise role will the office have? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that is an important question because that kind of lead role, or co-ordinating role, can be misunderstood. The line Departments have full charge of their emergency activities. In the case of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, it is from that line Department that the local authorities and the fire services will get their directions. Similarly, the remit of the Department of Health and Children includes the expert group, the health boards, regional health authorities and hospitals. We are asking these agencies or Departments to bring forward the most updated plan they have to deal with whatever threats may emerge. We will consult together, check for any gaps and continue to improve on the plans. An immense amount of work has been done in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The people who serve in these agencies and the front-line people deserve our greatest support. For example, when there was a scare in Sligo yesterday, the Garda were called in and they, in turn, called in the Army personnel, who were equipped with chemical and biological suits which had already been dispersed to each region. They sealed the container and it has been sent for analysis.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the plans, we will consider what improvements we can make collectively.</P>

      <Quest>the equipment available to members of the Defence Forces to enable them to take appropriate action in the context of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack and the fall-out from such attack affecting this State; and if he has satisfied himself that the equipment furnished to the Defence Forces meets all the needs of the Defence Forces should such circumstances arise.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24755/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the setting up of the office of emergency planning in my previous reply and the important work that the office will carry out. One of the roles will involve the analysis of the capabilities of terrorist organisations or individuals to conduct chemical and biological or other attacks. This should include an assessment of the likelihood of attack and the possible direct and indirect effects on this country or on neighbouring countries. The Defence Forces would play an integral role in the event of the investigation of any possible threat of this nature in Ireland. The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time.</P>
      <P>A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment is deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the ordnance corps. The question of additional requirements arising from the events of 11 September is being examined by the Ordnance Corps and any proposals in this regard for new or additional NBC equipment will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment which meets their current requirements. In particular, there is a total of approximately 1,800 nuclear, biological and chemical suits available to the Defence Forces at present. An order for an additional 4,000 NBC suits was placed in July 2001 with a delivery date in December 2001 &ndash; January 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these.</P>
      <P>In the current climate, there is understandable concern and anxiety among all members of our society. However, it is important to emphasise that there is no reason to believe Ireland is a direct target for international terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>The most important defence against any attack is vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. To this end all the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are being deployed and all that can be done is being done in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me and acknowledge that should there be a biological, chemical or nuclear attack, be it not in this State but elsewhere, we must be fully prepared to deal with any collateral risks or damage which results. Does he agree that in the context <Col N="966" /> of a defence force with 10,000 members, 1,800 suits is grossly insufficient to enable the Defence Forces to fully respond if they need to do so should such an eventuality occur?</P>
      <P>Have any steps been taken since the events of 11 September to ensure the additional 4,000 suits ordered last June are furnished with greater speed and priority than some time between January to March of next year? In the light of the changed world in which we live, will the Minister clarify when he expects to receive an assessment of what additional equipment, be it suits or other types of equipment, may be required by way of precautionary measures to ensure our Defence Forces are fully protected when they need to be and are equipped to enable them to be of assistance to civilians should a major emergency arise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The personnel required to step into the breach and provide the front-line services in dealing with threats deserve the fullest possible support at all levels. In some ways, I was glad I had moved to improve the equipment before this terrible act took place, and we are improving equipment right across the board. The suits are due between December and January, not January and March. If it is possible to expedite that, I will do so.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are on full alert. The Ordnance Corps has been asked to look at every aspect of this to see what else is required that would enable them to provide enhanced security in the very much changed scenario for all of us. I am open to helping with the additional resources that would be necessary to do that once I get their report. They have been asked for this but so far there has been no further request for additional equipment, clothing or protective gear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House agrees that the Defence Forces deserve every support and assistance. They are entitled to have whatever equipment they need should an eventuality arise, such as the one we are discussing. Has the Minister sought to expedite the provision of the suits which he quite correctly ordered in June of this year? In the context of the risks from nuclear contamination, will he clarify the input the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, is having into providing advices on what type of additional equipment may be required to ensure we are properly organised to deal with any such risk should it arise? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The emergency plan for nuclear fall-out is handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and the Department of Public Enterprise. The emergency plan itself is very advanced and has been on trial. Experiments have been carried out for several years and, obviously, like everything else, can be improved. We, in the Department of Defence, are very much involved in that area as well, particularly because of our 6,000 units in the Civil Defence organisation who have Gratz meters and Radiac <Col N="967" /> survey monitoring capacities which enable us to monitor low and high level fall out. Co-operation not only between the Departments of Defence and Public Enterprise, but across the Departments is an aim I have in leading the emergency operation.</P>

The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Departments, is currently in discussions with the owners of a building in Roscrea. I understand these discussions are ongoing. It is anticipated that the transfer will take place next year. Of the 30 staff serving in the Civil Defence branch, one has indicated a willingness to transfer to Roscrea. I am confident that, prior to relocation, the required number of suitably trained and qualified staff will be in place. In this regard, more than 100 civil servants serving in other Departments have indicated a desire to transfer to my Department for the purpose of working in the Civil Defence branch in Roscrea.</P>

Does he agree that Civil Defence has always been of substantial importance but that the work which must now be done in this area has assumed a greater importance and priority as a result of the atrocities committed on 11 September and the current international situation? Will the Minister acknowledge that the only considerations for transferring the Civil Defence school from Dublin to Roscrea are local party political considerations of his own and that this move is not in the national interest, that it is ill-advised and foolish at this time and will result in experienced staff involved in this area leaving it at a time in which their services are very badly needed in the interests of this State?</P>

Fine Gael has traditionally been totally against decentralisation. In its last administration, it said there would not be any further decentralisation. This Government has a different view.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 20 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the White Paper on Defence, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. A tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and a decision can be expected shortly. The question of acquiring interceptor aircraft for the Air Corps was not included in this programme. In light, however, of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, I am having the question of acquiring training aircraft with interceptor capability examined.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have a number of RBS 70 anti-aircraft radar guided missiles. In addition, the purchase of a number of 40mm air defence guns together with radar is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I initiated the equipment programme for the Air Corps, I sought to set priorities with which the Air Corps was in agreement. The advice at that time was that we should concentrate on the medium lift helicopters for search and rescue. In light of what has taken place, I will do my best to bring forward the programme for the training aircraft. Since the Fougas went down, we need training aircraft for the Air Corps and the additional element of whether it should be interceptor has to be considered. The military authorities are examining this in conjunction with the Air Corps. I expect to receive a recommendation from them soon. The Deputy can take it that the next phase of equipment for the Air Corps will be the training aircraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knowingly or unknowingly misinterpreted my question. We are not talking about small bits of funding. The funding has increased over the past few years but on no great scale relative to other Departments. However, does the Minister envisage a massive increase in defence funding in the next year or will it be the standard percentage increase that happens across all Departments? Does he plan to revisit the Government's policy of downsizing the numbers in the Defence Forces? I am asking about a major change in policy. I acknowledge the increases mentioned by the Minister but is a major increase envisaged?</P>

      <P>In light of the new circumstances has the Minister any intention or proposals to conduct a reappraisal of the White Paper on Defence, particularly with a view to ascertaining whether the membership of the Defence Forces is adequate at 10,000 should a major emergency arise such as that previously discussed by the House, or is he of the view that there is nothing in the White Paper which requires reappraisal?</P>

      <P>I was glad that the White Paper found favour among a number of organisations <Col N="971" /> and associations in the Defence Forces. Without going into detail, it has created certainty. There were reviews and examinations over a long period of time. That time is past and there is now a ten year cycle during which there is a steadfast position. The White Paper has consolidated that in such a way that making dramatic changes at this time would not help. We have made every conceivable effort to maintain recruitment. We are just about able to reach our numbers and, given the competition for jobs, that position is likely to continue. We are able to do it, however, so there does not appear to be any scope for reappraisal in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain, in the context of the new office of emergency planning, what authority the office will exercise given it has only two civilian and two military personnel attached to it? What authority can it exercise to resolve demarcation lines and difficulties between Departments who have varied functions should an emergency arise? Does the Minister have concerns that the fragmented responsibilities for responding to emergencies, which rest variously with local authorities, health boards, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Defence, will result in a lack of co-ordination in responding to an emergency? If there is a dispute between Departments, who has the ultimate authority to intervene and ensure that speedy decisions are made and are made in a manner that is effective and achieves the desired results?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no experience so far in the office of emergency planning that would lead me to a view that anything like that might arise. We have got the height of co-operation from each of the Departments and agencies. We want to maintain that and improve it where we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate what happened <Col N="973" /> has triggered a determination to ensure that the best possible system is put in place. A great deal of work is taking place and a great deal more needs to be done to make sure that is in place. There is no room for wasting time dealing with disputes.</P>
    <P>The line Departments are responsible for themselves. I will not encroach on them. When we come to the stage of having everything in place I hope the public will have the fullest possible confidence that a global effort is being made in Ireland based on our resources to put the best foot forward. That is my approach to this matter.</P>

      <P>This office has only four people. Does it have a monitoring function? Should something go wrong in the provision of services, does the office have a role in contacting the relevant Departments, health boards or hospitals to ensure that where matters have not been dealt with properly the same mistake will not be made again? For example, four employees of Independent Newspapers went to the Mater Hospital yesterday because there was an anthrax scare. Does the Minister believe it was appropriate that for a while they were not admitted to the hospital but kept in a taxi and seen by staff outside the hospital? It seemed there was complete confusion as to how to deal with them. What steps have been taken, or does the office have a role in taking any steps, to ensure that should a similar difficulty arise again that another hospital would not behave in such an inappropriate manner in dealing with the people who come to it requiring assistance?</P>

In terms of the staff in my office, I can call on expertise, depending on where the problem or threat arises and who the experts are, to help manage and support the line Department in dealing with these situations. We have done an enormous amount of work in this area that involved a major commitment from a large number of people, but that is not to say we have everything in place.</P>

Is he in a position to confirm today's report that this document is unlikely to see the light of day and fall through people's letter boxes until January or February 2002?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I issued a protocol for dealing with a suspected anthrax attack or an anthrax attack in Ireland prepared by an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of the Virus Reference Laboratory. This committee was established at my request to develop a contingency plan which would be activated in the unlikely event of a biological attack. I considered this necessary in light of the events of 11 September in the United States.</P>
      <P>The committee met on four occasions to date. While work on the detailed plan is progressing, a specific protocol to deal with a potential anthrax attack has been prepared at my request and was communicated to the media yesterday in light of the recent anthrax scares in the United States and developments there.</P>
      <P>Prior to the launch of this protocol I met members of the committee as well as members of the Garda, fire services and Defence Forces. During this meeting the roles of the various bodies were clearly defined and agreed. In addition, I spoke with my counterpart, the Minister for Health, in the United Kingdom, to make sure our people here would have access to the committees in place in the United Kingdom and that best knowledge, expertise, plans and so forth could be shared.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He confirmed that our protocol is similar to that being put in place in the United Kingdom and offered the use of facilities there. The protocol deals with procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack, including patient treatment and management and post-exposure guidelines. Guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax are included in the protocol. If a suspicious package or letter is received, the advice is to place the package in a plastic bag or other sealed container in order to prevent leakage. The room and premises should then be evacuated and the Garda contacted immediately. As the first line of contact, the Garda will assess the situation and contact emer<Col N="976" /> gency services, such as directors of public health or the Army, as deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>I instructed that the protocol and guidelines be placed on my Department's website, www.doh.ie and I arranged for a copy to be sent to each Member of the House today. I am advised that the latter process has commenced. Yesterday, the protocol was issued to the fire service, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the directors of public health in each health board area. The dissemination of the protocol has continued today.</P>
    <P>In relation to treatment in the event of exposure to anthrax, the Irish Medicines Board has confirmed to me that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin have been secured to treat patients in the event of exposure. In response to my request, the Irish Medicines Board has confirmed that it can also source quantities of the smallpox vaccine. I have arranged for the Public Health Laboratory in Cherry Orchard Hospital to receive both clinical and environmental samples. The clinical samples will be dealt with in Cherry Orchard, while the environmental samples will be forwarded to the United Kingdom for analysis.</P>
    <P>A freefone information help line has been established by the Eastern Regional Health Authority to respond to the concerns of individuals within its functional area. The Garda has indicated that hoax calls will be dealt with severely. A meeting of European Union Health Ministers has been called for next week to put together a co-ordinated EU response to these issues. I take this opportunity to reassure the public that the risk of an anthrax attack in Ireland is low. The guidelines are being issued, in the first instance, as a precaution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the key objective is that fear must not be allowed to win? There is a strong perception that the Government and the agencies are not prepared for this. The area surrounding the post office was not sealed off yesterday during the anthrax scare in Enniscorthy. The Garda presence was low-key and people were able to talk to workers through the windows of the sorting office. Does the Minister believe that is acceptable? Does he believe it is acceptable that although the alarm was raised at 7.45 a.m. neither the South-Eastern Health Board nor the Garda knew what to do at 11 o'clock? Does this not contradict the Taoiseach's remarks in the House that a scheme is in place to tackle an attack if one occurs? While the risk of contamination from an infected person to another individual is quite low, I wish to know whether the Garda have been issued with protective clothing. If so, when it was distributed? Is there a specific trained team in each Garda division to deal with suspect packages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is reported to have happened in Enniscorthy does not accord with the protocol, which was issued yesterday. Likewise, what is reported to have happened in the offices of the <Col N="977" /><i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday is not in accordance with the protocol.</P>
      <P>Following the terrible atrocities in the United States, I said this country was unprepared for a biological or chemical terrorist attack and that a specific response mechanism was not in place. I established an expert committee, chaired by Professor Bill Hall whose expertise is in the spread of infectious disease and viruses and agents of the type that could be used in a biological war. The committee has been working quietly in recent weeks to put together the bones of a plan, which consists of much more than the protocol that was issued yesterday. A broader manual which addresses other agents that may be used, has been prepared to be distributed to personnel in accident and emergency departments and other areas of medicine.</P>
      <P>My information is that there have been 2,500 anthrax scares in the United States in recent days, including genuine false alarms and hoaxes. In my conversation with the British Health Secretary yesterday, it emerged that a similar process is developing in the United Kingdom. While the protocol was ready, I deemed it important to cut short the deliberations of the committee so that clear directions should be given to all concerned. The protocol reflects best practice, which is important. The committee took on board the protocols which are being used in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Did Deputy Naughten ask any further questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Army and the Garda are operationally responsible in emergency situations, such as an anthrax scare. They have indicated to me that they have the capabilities to deal with such an emergency. The first task of the Garda Síochána is to seal off a site and to ensure that access is blocked to the package and the room where it was found until the Army comes to take it away. The protocol deals with the importance of decontaminating the site and individuals who were there. The package must be taken away in an appropriate way, with proper protection, to the Public Health Laboratory in Cherry Orchard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees with me that while the circumstances under discussion are of low probability but high risk, a similar description can be applied to the events of 11 September. Does he agree that, in the public eye, there has been gross ineptitude and a lack of decision making and proper planning in the Government's handing of the possibility of an anthrax attack or an attack on Sellafield? Five weeks have passed since 11 September and two weeks have gone since the first anthrax attack in the United States. What does the Minister mean when he says there are enough antibiotics in the country? Is he referring to a sufficient supply if a limited number of people contract anthrax or is <Col N="978" /> he referring to a certain percentage of the population? Can he indicate what training has been carried out to ensure that professionals in hospitals and in the emergency services are able to deal with an event of this type? Have rehearsals formed part of the training? Have measures been put in place to ensure that professionals will be able to deal with an attack? </P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister has been in contact with the Ministry of Health, as while we are not in the direct line of a possible attack, we could suffer as a secondary focus for an attack. Is this country self-sufficient in terms of the testing of samples? I note from newspaper reports that samples were sent to the United Kingdom for testing. As I recall, this was also the case during the foot and mouth disease crisis. Surely we must be satisfied that we are self-sufficient. If there was an attack in Britain, a circumstance we have to consider as a result of global terrorism, would we be self-sufficient to deal with it? As well as having a joint plan with the United Kingdom, can we stand alone if that country is under attack and the facilities there on which we depend are unavailable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government's response, especially in terms of biological and chemical risks, has been inept. Public perceptions are one thing, but prior to 11 September, I do not think anyone envisaged the horrendous attacks that are taking place in the United States, where killer viruses have been sent to people <i>via</i> the postal service or in packages. I do not honestly think people in this country were focused on the possibility of such an attack in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I read yesterday that a Commissioner acknowledged to an EU body that the EU needs to build on its existing communicable diseases network. He made the point that the surveillance network Europe wide needs to be developed in terms of looking for bio-terrorist attacks and that its early warning and response system needed to be significantly upgraded to provide the type of co-ordinated cover that members states now need. There is an acknowledgement on the Commissioner's part that, across Europe, there is a need to upgrade early response mechanisms.</P>
      <P>In terms of the analysis of samples, the public health laboratory in Cherry Orchard can analyse clinical samples, such as nasal swabs. Regarding the incidents yesterday, approximately 28 clinical samples have been analysed by the laboratory in Cherry Orchard and the preliminary analysis is that all of them are negative. Full and final results are awaited, but that is the preliminary indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental samples must go to the United Kingdom. The Government's view, which was shared by the chairman of the committee, is that Ireland did not have a high grade laboratory to analyse such samples. It was decided more than a year ago to invest in such a facility in the virus reference laboratory and this work is under way. Unfortunately, the capital works there will not be completed for another 15 months. Work has <Col N="979" /> started and money was allocated more than a year ago to bring the facility up to world class standard.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the situation at the public health laboratory in Cherry Orchard is being examined in terms of whether a facility can be brought forward there that, in time, would allow the analysis of environmental samples to be undertaken. At present, such samples are sent abroad to the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>There were existing supplies of antibiotics in hospitals that could be used for the treatment of anthrax. Additional supplies have been secured; 150,000 doses will arrive in the morning and 1.6 million doses are due to be delivered next week. I have been assured by the Irish Medicines Board and public health personnel that these supplies are more than adequate for our needs.</P>
      <P>If one was reading the newspapers, there was some concern about whether it would be possible to obtain a vaccine for smallpox. The Irish Medicines Board has searched the globe for a particular vaccine. It has placed an order for a quantity of stock of smallpox vaccine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the supply of iodine tablets disintegrated. Will he tell the House when fresh stock of such tablets will be available to meet the security needs of the State?</P>
      <P>The protocol to which the Minister referred mentions that fire and ambulance service decontamination units should carry out decontamination of exposed individuals on site, using mobile units. Is the Minister aware that in 1985, the number of call outs for ambulances in Dublin was just over 28,000. In 1998, the year for which the most recent statistics are available, the number was more than 84,000 and it is probably approximately 90,000 today. However, there are still only 11 ambulance units operated by the fire service in Dublin. Given the protocol pertaining to the use of ambulances, they only deal with one incident at a time. Therefore, any major catastrophe, even a bus crash, would tie up the entire ambulance fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that before recent concerns, senior management wrote to the health board, stating that the situation was critical and that there was a need for additional fire services. One source told me that the service should be doubled or tripled &ndash; I have no way of measuring what is required. However, from copies of correspondence that I have seen, management is most concerned that the situation is critical and more ambulances are needed for Dublin. I presume this pertains throughout the country. How does the Minister intend the ambulance service to carry out the protocol he mentioned in the case of an <Col N="980" /> emergency given that there are only 11 ambulances for Dublin despite the explosion in the number of call outs for ambulances? There is an increased number of tourists and the population has increased. There are more building sites and many more cars on the road. The service cannot cope at present so what does the Minister intend to do?</P>

      <P>A decontamination unit is a particular type of shower unit that is brought to a site. They worked well yesterday in St. Andrew's school and the eastern region has three mobile decontamination units that can be brought to particular sites. They are used to provide shower facilities for people who may have been exposed to a suspicious package.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point that, in an emergency, strain is put on existing services. By definition, that is what an emergency involves. Resources that are not usually called on are put into action and people are put under greater strain to meet existing services and requirements that may arise in the context of an emergency. This is why it is so important to send out a strong message about hoax calls. I went through the logistics yesterday of what was involved in terms of Army, Garda, ambulance and fire services personnel. I was acutely aware that any incident would draw on many of the resources of our emergency personnel. This is what happens in emergencies. One of the issues we are endeavouring to address is a reduction in the number of unnecessary calls on the services.</P>

It is only in the past week that we have responded to that potential, based on the anthrax threats in the United States and more recently in Ireland.

It was formed in the aftermath of the statement of the World Health Organisation's director general, Dr. Brundtland, which called on countries around the world to review the potential of bio-terrorist attacks. The committee is examining a variety of potential agents. It has pointed out that a viral haemorrhagic plan is already in place to deal with outbreaks of ebola and other agents. That plan was completed in advance of 11 September. A pandemic influenza plan is available in final draft form. The committee is also examining the potential for the spread of a plague, botulism, small pox, anthrax and other diseases and is devising a manual to cover these issues for emergency personnel, particularly those in the health services.</P>

To do so they must examine the room containing the suspicious package. Has protective clothing been issued to the Garda? When was the clothing distributed? Is there a specific trained team in every Garda division to deal with such an incident? While the risk of the spread of disease from one individual to another is minimal, if it became known that a person who was contaminated was in a specific hospital, there would be a panic in the hospital. Are there isolation units within the ERHA and the various health boards to address such a scenario? The ERHA's free helpline is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The majority of people who work leave their homes before 9 a.m. and do not return until after 5 p.m. If they encounter a suspect parcel who do they ring?</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch chun seans a fháil an t-ábhar seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in a presentation to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The onset of winter in Afghanistan is only four weeks away. The harsh winter climate combined with three years of drought could take an appalling toll on a population already at the limit of its endurance. UNICEF has indicated that up to 100,000 more children could die during the course of the winter in addition to the 300,000 who die each year largely of preventable causes. We cannot allow millions of <Col N="984" /> Afghans to suffer further. Such a scenario would be an affront to our basic humanity.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter to give the Minister for Foreign Affairs an opportunity following yesterday's general Council meeting to make a statement on how the balance of humanitarian demand and military action is being viewed. The only way to get sufficient aid to the Afghan people, one million to one and a half million of whom have been displaced since the commencement of military activity, is through the establishment of secure aid corridors. I cannot envisage how one can begin to negotiate their establishment without indicating a cessation of military bombing, which has led to other questions being raised.</P>
    <P>UN Resolution 1333, which has been ignored by the Taliban, called for the handing over of Osama bin Laden and three strategies were suggested. The first was to hand him over to a country in which he had been indicted, the second was to hand him over to a country which would extradite him to a country in which he had been indicted for crimes and the third was to hand him over to a neutral country. The Minister of State stated yesterday one could not take seriously the Taliban's response or changed attitude towards such a resolution.</P>
    <P>This is most serious. The reality is that through Taliban representation in Pakistan it is possible to establish whether that resolution might be complied with now. If so, it would fit securely with the procedures of international law. The alleged perpetrator would be handed over to be tried in accordance with the international legal system following the production of satisfactory evidence. The individual would be brought to justice and this would relieve the pressure on the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty which begins to arise in relation to Resolution 1368 of 12 September this year. The Minister correctly told us the conditions attached to the resolution which includes proportionality, respect for international law and the protection of civilians. However, neither the proportionality nor the protection of civilians condition in the resolution will be able to handle situations in which civilian and aid targets are casualties of the bombing. This raises the question as to how one can suggest that aid can happen after certain military achievements have been made. That has the great disadvantage of militarising the aid project and the humanitarian relief and making the assistance of people at risk through deepened famine within three weeks a consequence of military achievement.</P>
    <P>I am grateful this matter has been raised. Half the food of the World Relief Programme has apparently been seized by the Taliban. The 1,000 tonnes of food which is getting through is only about half of what is needed. Some 1.7 million people were being fed before the emergence of casualties. I cannot understand how we can avoid a catastrophe if we do not restore diplomacy over the military options. The bombing should cease, secure aid corridors should be established and <Col N="985" /> relief should be brought to the people in the small window of opportunity we have before the deep snows happen. I would like to hear the Minister's suggestions as to how he might advance such a proposition at the Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy for allowing me the opportunity to put on the record of the House as quickly as possible the up-to-date position. Everyone in this House is deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. This concern is also shared throughout the international community and every effort is being made at all levels to respond to their plight. The people of Afghanistan have been the victims of over two decades of violence and of the extremism of the Taliban regime. A generation of Afghans have known little else but conflict, poverty, malnourishment and human rights abuses. From the moment we took up our position on the UN Security Council last January, Ireland has sought to highlight the humanitarian dimension of the situation in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>We all know the desperate plight of the Afghan people did not begin on 11 September or 7 October. The Taliban regime had been obstructing the efforts of the international community to respond to the humanitarian plight of the people of Afghanistan for a considerable period of time and there were reports as recent as yesterday of the Taliban confiscating UN aid. Although the suffering of the people of Afghanistan did not begin on 11 September, it is the determined goal of the international community that this crisis will bring an end to their misery and provide a new beginning for the people of Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>I will outline briefly the actions that are being taken by the international community. Each week since taking up the Presidency of the Security Council, Ireland has convened consultations on Afghanistan where we have underlined the urgent need to focus on the humanitarian concerns of the Afghan people. The Security Council is taking a comprehensive approach to Afghanistan, which includes addressing political, economic, humanitarian and human rights.</P>
      <P>Secretary General Kofi Annan has appointed a special representative for Afghanistan, Ambassador Brahimi. He has a long and distinguished career in the service of the UN and has overall authority for UN humanitarian and political efforts in Afghanistan. I had a long telephone conversation with him last night. He will be active in encouraging the emergence of a fully representative, multi-ethnic and broad based Government and will initiate preparations for the development of plans for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. At Ireland's request, Ambassador Brahimi briefed the Security Council on Tuesday, 16 October, on his contacts to date. I had a valuable discussion last evening with him which enabled me to set out our concerns. I understand the Ambassador will be visiting the region shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> During the Security Council consultations, Ireland highlighted the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and commended the work of humanitarian organisations in the region, including Irish NGOs whom I met this morning. We urged Pakistan and Iran to reopen their borders to enable cross-border deliveries of aid and to facilitate preparations for an influx of refugees. We stressed the need for the international community to provide host countries with immediate financial support.</P>
    <P>UN agencies are currently delivering an estimated 1,000 metric tonnes into Afghanistan each day, but at least twice as much is needed. I received a telephone call from Ambassador Ryan before I came into the debate. As a result of our discussions with the Irish NGOs this morning he has been in direct contact with the Secretary General and the humanitarian co-ordinator's office, Ms McCaskey. He pointed out the concerns raised with us, which are being articulated here this evening.</P>
    <P>In our role as Presidency of the Security Council, we will convene further consultation on Afghanistan in the coming days. We are reviewing the situation on a daily basis with our permanent representative, Ambassador Ryan, and our team in New York, as well as with our other embassies, including Washington. I will be updating our guidance to the mission in New York following my meeting with NGOs this morning and the debate in this House. I will also be in further early contact with the key international players, including Ambassador Brahimi. I will be travelling to New York next week where I will meet the UN officials responsible for the co-ordination of humanitarian operations in Afghanistan. Mr. Oshima from OCHA should be back from Iran and Pakistan at that stage. There are also personnel from there going to the region, including people from the World Food Programme and the UNHCR. They will go to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan because we need to get those three countries involved in the humanitarian effort.</P>
    <P>Ireland believes the role of the UN is critical to the ultimate successful resolution of the situation in Afghanistan. That country cannot be allowed to remain a failed state where continuing internal conflicts breed illegal activities and provide a safe haven for terrorists. The UN Security Council has been endeavouring for several years to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan. The objective is an Afghanistan with a truly representative Government at peace with its neighbours. As Presidency of the Security Council for the rest of this month, for the remainder of our term until the end of 2002 and beyond, Ireland will remain closely involved in the efforts to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I attended a special meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday where the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was top of our agenda. We made it clear that emergency humanitarian aid in Afghanistan is an absolute <Col N="987" /> priority of the Union which undertook to mobilise without delay aid amounting to more than 320 million. Some 25 million was released to enable the Commission to respond to the most urgent humanitarian needs and it will keep the mobilisation and convoying of aid under regular examination. In my discussion with Ambassador Brahimi last night he acknowledged that the pledges in aggregate terms are sufficient. There is a need to get that money into the UN system quickly. In my discussions with Ms McCaskey a couple of weeks ago when I was in New York at the start of our Presidency we talked about the fact that between one-third and 40% of that money must get into the system in order to start a proper mobilised campaign. I have taken up with the Ambassador the need to ensure that this happens as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>At our meeting yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers also expressed our concern at the difficulties of access. We appealed to the countries in the region to facilitate by all means possible the humanitarian operations and we agreed on a number of points to guide the Union's future policy on Afghanistan, which I will discuss at a later date.</P>
    <P>This morning I met representatives of Goal, Trócaire, Christian Aid Ireland, Concern and Oxfam to discuss with them the ongoing humanitarian crisis and their assessment of the situation on the ground. During my discussions with the agencies this morning, we reviewed the current problems of access and delivery of aid. There are currently a number of aid delivery routes being operated by the World Food Programme and other international agencies. I was told this evening in my telephone discussion with the Ambassador that while the central highlands and the mountainous areas will be a serious difficulty, the prospect of providing land and air supplies throughout the rest of the country is under active consideration. We also agreed this morning as a result of our discussions that it is vital to ensure secure and safe access for food convoys over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work on a national level, through the UN and with our EU partners, to do all that is humanly possible to draw attention to and respond to the emergency humanitarian crisis and to the medium and long-term needs of the Afghan people. The Government is of the clear view that as any military campaign is pursued against the Al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban regime that willingly shelters it, a visible strategy must be put in place to address the humanitarian needs of the innocent people of Afghanistan. I am available to the House to report on progress in that matter in the days and weeks ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of a response from the Government on the Western Development <Col N="988" /> Commission's report, &ldquo;State of the West&rdquo;, is proof that it has failed miserably to provide the infrastructural development necessary to give the western region a reasonable chance of providing employment for its people. The report made two key recommendations. The first related to reaching the western region. The Western Development Commission recommended the establishment of a western regional road infrastructure consultative group chaired by a senior official in the National Roads Authority and comprising officials from the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Forfás and the Western Development Commission.</P>
      <P>Their second key recommendation was powering and connecting the western region. The Western Development Commission recommended the establishment of a high level strategic working group on power and telecommunications in the western region. It said both these groups should be set up by September 2001 and should have reported their findings, together with a costed development schedule, by February 2002. That has not happened and, obviously, it will not happen.</P>
      <P>According to the Western Development Commission, the finance currently being provided for</P>
      <P>the western region through the national development plan would need to be increased by an extra £750 million to provide the type of road, rail and telecommunications infrastructure that would allow the region to compete on an equal basis with the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has introduced the Clár programme with money being taken from the existing national development programme. His Department will provide £20 million over a two year period but it is a far cry from the £750 million deemed necessary by the Western Development Commission. Also in the Clár programme, the Minister is establishing another level of administration, whereas there are already numerous bodies in the region that could administer that money.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also stated that he is carrying out other initiatives about which nobody else seems to be aware. No one has been informed about these initiatives. I do not know when they will be implemented &ndash; perhaps it will be during the hours of darkness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with regret that I learned of the imminent resignation of Mr. Liam Scollan, the chief executive of the Western Development Commission. Mr. Scollan has worked tirelessly on behalf of the commission and the people of the western region. He has produced many fine documents and has outlined in great detail the steps necessary to develop the region. All that is missing now is the political will to implement the recommendations of the Western Development Commission. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Mr. Scollan's departure has been brought about by a deep-seated sense of frustration and <Col N="989" /> despair at the inertia that has gripped this Government. It has failed to provide the necessary funding for the radical programme of initiatives set out in the Western Development Commission's &ldquo;State of the West&rdquo; report. I hope, when Mr. Scollan makes public his views on his resignation, he will outline in great detail the reasons he has felt it necessary to resign.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister of State with responsibility for rural and western development, issued a statement last week welcoming the &ldquo;State of the West&rdquo; report. He pointed out that it is a very useful document as it outlines in detail the work that needs to be done to level the development playing pitch and to ensure that the west achieves its full potential. The report makes three key recommendations: one concerning roads, one on power and telecommunications, and one in relation to an investment programme in towns.</P>
      <P>The Clár initiative, recently launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, focuses on may of the areas and issues highlighted in the report, as well as on the further prioritisation of spending under the national development plan. This is proof of the Government's commitment to the issue of rural and western regeneration. In his statement, Deputy Ó Cuív fully accepted the need for a strategic response to the provision of infrastructure. In that regard, as part of Clár, and in response to the report, he is re-establishing the interdepartmental committee on rural development. Urgent work is now under way to ensure that the objectives of the &ldquo;State of the West&rdquo; report are implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív also accepts the need to address the third recommendation, namely, to invest in town infrastructure. As part of the Clár initiative, £20 million has been made available to underpin the success of the programme. A portion of that money, along with finance from other statutory agencies, will be used to progress this objective.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív met the chief executive and another senior staff member of the commission on 9 October when he explained in detail his approach to the report's recommendations. In its report, the Western Development Commission has clearly stated the agenda and the present baseline position. The performance of the Government and the Clár programme now have a tangible target against which to be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the chief executive of the commission, Mr. Scollan, has decided to take a career move. Ar mo shon féin agus ar son an Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív, I thank Mr. Scollan for his efforts and commitment on behalf of western <Col N="990" /> development over the past four years, and wish him every success in his new career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent months we have seen yet more headlines concerning problems in the health services. This week we saw headlines that would frighten any pregnant woman, such as: &ldquo;Maternity services collapsing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Critical talks on midwife crisis&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Midwifery in crisis&rdquo;. Conflicting advice has been offered. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has made suggestions concerning the care of pregnant women, which differ from what the Minister for Health and Children is saying. We have also had warnings from the masters of the Dublin maternity hospitals saying they cannot cope with the numbers of pregnant women.</P>
      <P>It is clear that maternity services around the country are near to breakdown point because of the huge number of vacancies both at midwife and consultant level. The Irish Nurses Organisation has called on the Government to take emergency measures to resolve the crisis. It has also called for urgent talks on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister should outline what co-ordinated action is being taken to provide some reassurance for pregnant women. The maternity hospitals require guidelines in order to advise where pregnant women can have their babies. Women should not be left wondering whether they will be able to give birth at the hospital they are booked into.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about this matter several months ago and it is interesting now to re-read his reply. He stated:</P>
      <P>My Department is advised by the authority that it is not aware of particular resourcing difficulties affecting the Dublin maternity hospitals.</P>
      <P>Everyone else knew there was a difficulty of resources in those hospitals for quite some time, so what happened to planning? Why was the Minister not aware of the matter? Does he not take any responsibility for the long-term planning of the health services? He talks a great deal about health strategy, yet a few months ago he said he was not aware of any crisis in the Dublin maternity hospitals. Everyone knows they have been in a state of crisis for quite some time. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about this crisis which is affecting hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the nurses, doctors and other staff in the maternity hospitals. We all recognise the pressures under which they are working. They do not need to read about that sort of uncertainty in the newspapers, or hear of it from the broadcasting media. The crisis cannot remain unresolved for very much longer because <Col N="991" /> it puts too much pressure on already pressurised staff.</P>
    <P>Moving pregnant women from pillar to post is unacceptable and we know well that it will not solve the midwifery crisis. Telling mothers not to have their babies in Dublin hospitals if they are from outside the region is not the answer to solving the growing crisis caused by the falling number of midwives in Dublin. The Minister must take responsibility for this matter and cannot shift the blame as he has tried to do. In recent months, I have tabled numerous questions about the crisis in maternity units, but each time he responds by saying the Eastern Regional Health Authority will solve it.</P>
    <P>This week, some crisis meetings are finally being held. The policy has failed and something must happen to change it. The ERHA has apparently suggested that the shortage of midwives can be addressed by preventing mothers who do not reside in Dublin from giving birth in Dublin hospitals. This measure has failed for the past 18 months because women residing outside Dublin may still give birth in Dublin if a consultant in their region refers them to a Dublin hospital on clinical grounds.</P>
    <P>The master of one Dublin maternity hospital, Dr. Keane, said they had tried this policy but it had not worked for the past 18 months. Why should it work now? The suggestion appears to be flawed. Conflicting messages are unacceptable, particularly in this area. The Minister should be able to clarify the situation and provide some hope that it can be resolved. It has also been suggested that asylum seekers who are resident outside Dublin should not be permitted to give birth in Dublin hospitals. If this plan is not workable for female citizens of the State who continue to come to Dublin maternity hospitals to give birth, why should it be any different for asylum seekers? If they continue to come to Dublin why should it be different for asylum seekers?</P>
    <P>Sending pregnant women from pillar to post is not the way to run a modern, professional health service. We have reports from Limerick, Cavan and Monaghan of problems in maternity units. There is no clarity in the policy regarding local maternity units. If the Minister of State is going to tell women to stay outside Dublin while, at the same time, maternity units are being closed, what are women to do? This is a contradictory situation.</P>

      <P>Waiting lists are not the answer in this instance. We need clarity on the policy direction, but there is no such clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must take charge of the situation regarding staffing and infrastructure without delay. There are serious problems regarding the disparity between the salaries of public health nurses and midwives. This issue must be addressed to stop midwives leaving the profession <Col N="992" /> and moving, for example, to public health posts. One can understand the reason people do so, but if a package of measures can be introduced to support midwives to stay in the Dublin hospitals where there are extra costs and difficulties, then we can begin to find a way forward.</P>
    <P>Perhaps further higher education grants should be offered to those who would work on a temporary basis in this area while furthering their education. A range of options are available and I look forward to the Minister of State's reply. I am not surprised the Minister, Deputy Martin, has again stayed out of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Martin, I welcome the opportunity to address the House concerning the service pressures in the three Dublin maternity hospitals and apologise for his absence.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepts that obstetric services at the Dublin maternity hospitals are under pressure. We all pay tribute to those who work in the service. A number of factors have been identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority as contributing to this. The number of births in the eastern region has increased in recent years from 20,646 in 1996 to 22,813 in 2000, with a further increase expected in 2001. This includes a high number of asylum seekers availing of obstetric services in the eastern region. It is expected that there will be about 3,000 births to asylum seekers in Dublin in 2001.</P>
      <P>A significant contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the eastern region. Approximately 10% of activity in the Dublin maternity hospitals concerns persons resident outside of the eastern region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the woman's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds. The ERHA acknowledges that, in some cases, there may be exceptions and discussions are ongoing about this issue. The ERHA is also contacting other health boards with a view to facilitating women to access maternity services in their local areas in keeping with a policy of regional self-sufficiency. However, services will continue to be provided to patients living outside the region who require access to specialised obstetric services.</P>
      <P>The Minister wishes to set the record straight regarding the extent of the midwifery shortages in the Dublin area. Media reports of 110 midwifery posts vacant in the three Dublin maternity hospitals are incorrect. Information received by my Department on Monday indicates that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is actually 54 posts when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses that have been employed by the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already undertaken a number of initiatives to recruit and retain midwives. The salaries of student midwives have been enhanced <Col N="993" /> and their college fees are now paid in full. This is in return for a commitment on the part of the students to work as midwives for a period of two years following qualification.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage midwives who have left the workforce to come back into the public health system, the Minister has provided funding for the payment of salaries to them while they are undertaking back-to-practice courses. Previously, not only did participants in such courses not receive a salary, but they had to pay course fees. Fees have been abolished and the salary paid takes account of previous service as a midwife.</P>
    <P>I would also mention that a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February last. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis. This new scheme was designed to introduce greater flexibility in working arrangements for nurses and midwives with family responsibilities and other commitments. A primary objective is to facilitate the retention of staff for whom full-time work is not a realistic option. These initiatives have been welcomed by the nursing unions as innovative measures to attract nurses and midwives who are out of the system, and to retain those who are already working in the public health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the Dublin maternity hospitals in the recruitment and retention of midwives. This forum includes representatives of the three Dublin maternity hospitals, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the nursing unions. It will hold its first meeting next Friday and has been asked to report back to the Minister as a matter of urgency. I assure the House that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality obstetric service for the eastern region will continue to be of the utmost priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hanafin is an all-round Minister and I wish to make this case to her as a compassionate and caring Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue involves the case of a separated <Col N="994" /> woman. When her separation was complete and the family home sold and the spoils divided equally, this woman had no visible means of support, was in poor health and, last April, had to apply for the one parent family allowance. I am familiar with the procedures involved, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, as I have been a Minister of State on more than one occasion. However, I am concerned that, in an economy which is, and has been, allegedly rampant for some time, this unfortunate woman who has two children applied last April for a payment to which she is undoubtedly entitled yet her case has not been resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the reason was that the deciding officer had asked for information regarding the proceeds from the sale of this woman's house. The sale of her house should have nothing to do with this matter. She has to live somewhere and hopes to buy a home to replace that which was lost through the separation at some stage. With no disrespect to deciding officers, a compassionate view should be taken of a case such as this. If this woman had retained the family home after the separation she would have been entitled to her payment without any calculation of means derived from the sale of the property. It is ironic, unjust and unfair that this kind of situation should exist.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue with the Minister last May and June and this matter is still going on. Last June I was informed that the woman was in receipt of supplementary welfare from the health board, but this information was incorrect at that time. I am sure the Minister's office did not wish to mislead me or the House, but the information was wrong and that should not have been the case. The Department and the supplementary health services are linked by computer so there should be no such problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, would be willing to take up this case as it is a just cause. Having been in her position on a number of occasions, and having had to do the same thing, I ask her to take up this issue.</P>
    <P>A deciding officer's view is not sacrosanct. The Minister has the power to challenge the deciding officer's assertion regarding the proceeds of the sale of this woman's house. If any comparison is needed, I remind the Minister and any other Minister who wishes to listen, that a deciding officer once made a decision regarding entitlement to a social welfare benefit which ultimately cost the State more than £300 million. I urge the Minister of State to bring this just cause to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to this motion on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who is unavoidably absent on Government business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the determination of entitlement under the statutory one parent family payment scheme or, for that matter, <Col N="995" /> entitlement under any other statutory social welfare scheme, is not a function for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of an appeal, for appeals officers appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>There is a statutory obligation on all claimants for one parent family payment to satisfy and continue to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to the payment. The conditions are that a claimant must have the main care and charge of at least one child, must not be cohabiting, must not have gross earnings in excess of £230.76 per week, must satisfy a means test and must make efforts to seek maintenance from the other parent of the child. The well established maintenance obligation and means testing structures, in particular, reflect the general policy of the scheme that, in so far as possible, one parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners rather than have to rely on social welfare support. In determining entitlement the deciding officer, or appeals officer as the case may be, must be satisfied that all the conditions are satisfied, including the requirement to make efforts to seek maintenance.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by Deputy Durkan, the person concerned applied for the one parent family payment in April 2001. Following the initial investigation of her situation by a local officer of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the person concerned was asked in <Col N="996" /> July 2001 to provide the following information: a copy of the lease agreement for her current dwelling; confirmation from her accountant of the date she ceased self-employment; confirmation of how she disposed of a balance of money received from sale of property and documentary evidence of her efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse. These issues were considered by the deciding officer to be directly relevant to the person's eligibility for payment.</P>
    <P>On 20 July 2001, Deputy Durkan phoned the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and stated that the person concerned was hospitalised following a heart attack. In light of this, a formal decision was not made on the claim at that stage. Under the circumstances, the deciding officer felt it best to give the person concerned an extended chance to obtain the documentation. However, to date, three months later, none of the documentation requested has been received nor has the claimant made any contact with the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The new Civil Defence Bill has been included in the list of priority legislation to be published during the current Dáil session. Detailed consultations with stakeholders have taken place in recent months and drafting is at an advanced stage. I am confident that the Bill will be enacted early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The new Civil Defence Bill will be developmental in nature. It will provide a fresh start for the organisation and a positive way forward following on the experiences gained in the Towards 2000 Programme, which gave the organisation more of a community support focus, and on the policies to develop Civil Defence into a high quality second line emergency service as set out in the White Paper on Defence published in February of last year.</P>
      <P>Under the National Plan for Nuclear Accidents, which is currently under review, the role of the Department of Defence is to arrange with local authorities to have an effective Civil Defence organisation trained to be in a position to respond to requests for assistance from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and other front-line emergency services to monitor radiation levels; collect samples of soil, vegetation and water for analysis and to provide assistance in the implementation of control measures in the event of a nuclear accident or incident. The Department is also represented on the emergency response co-ordinating committee under the plan.</P>
      <P>In the event of a chemical or biological accident or attack the Civil Defence would respond within its capabilities to requests for assistance from front line emergency services such as the gardaí, fire services or health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in the light of <Col N="998" /> the recent horrific events in the United States and the wider threat from global terrorism and arising from a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted here, the Government recently established an Office of Emergency Planning in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>That office will take the lead role in emergency planning to meet such new threats, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies, and will also have an oversight role in relation to planning for peacetime emergencies in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements.</P>
    <P>While it is not envisaged at this stage that the existing response arrangements for Civil Defence as already outlined will alter considerably as a result of these developments, the organisation will nonetheless remain ready and willing to respond to requests for assistance that may emerge from the ongoing review of emergency planning. This will involve a continuing review of the training and equipment requirements of the organisation as a support to the front line emergency services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 24, 61 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 have changed the context in which planning for various types of emergencies must now take place.</P>
      <P>In my replies to earlier questions I have outlined details on the establishment by the Government of an Office of Emergency Planning in my Department. That office will take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies including the Defence Forces and Civil Defence.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September an urgent review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergencies was undertaken by the military authorities and this review is currently in progress. It includes, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment; contact with other State agencies was renewed or undertaken; operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, etc., were re-assessed; guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were re-assessed; ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search were re-assessed and a review of equipment in terms of the need for air defence was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical, NBC, equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Ordnance Corps. The question of <Col N="1000" /> additional requirements arising from the events of 11 September is being examined by the Ordnance Corps and any proposals in this regard for new or additional NBC equipment will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment which meets their current requirements. In particular, there is approximately 1,800 nuclear, biological and chemical, NBC, suits available to the Defence Forces at present. An order for an additional 4,000 NBC suits was placed in July 2001 with a delivery date in December 2001-January 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these.</P>
    <P>With regard to Civil Defence, the White Paper on Defence committed the Government to providing the necessary infrastructure and training to enable Civil Defence to continue to develop its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality second line emergency service. The organisation is equipped with a range of equipment for use in emergencies including radiac survey instruments for monitoring high-level radiation and graetz meters for monitoring both high-level and low-level radiation. While Civil Defence does not have any specific equipment to deal with a chemical or biological attack, the organisation would assist, at the request of the relevant first line emergency services in the implementation of any control measures, the dissemination of information to the public or the provision of welfare assistance that may be required.</P>

      <P>As was stated by An Taoiseach in the immediate aftermath of the recent terrorist attacks against America, the prospect of Irish military involvement in the response made to those attacks does not arise. I can confirm that no offer of military assistance by Ireland has been made, or is under consideration, in relation to the military activities which are currently under way against the Taliban authorities. Also, I am informed that no requests for such assistance have been received from any quarter, including those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recall that deployment abroad of contingents of Irish military personnel occurs only by way of Government decision, subject to a UN mandate being in place and approval by Dáil Éireann, as required by relevant Irish legislation. Under Article 28.3.1 of the Constitution, war <Col N="1001" /> shall not be declared and Ireland shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 43, 57 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have had formal policies and procedures on sexual harassment and bullying in place since February 1996. These procedures are outlined in an administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships available to all members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Lectures and briefings in this area have continued over the years as an integral element of the training syllabus on recruit, cadet and career courses, and in addition on those occasions when troops are formed up for overseas training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early this year, the Defence Forces commenced a re-examination of their procedures to bring them into line with the best state-of-the-art practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector. In April, the section in the administrative instruction which deals with the procedures concerning allegations of bullying was revised to reflect this. The Report of the Government Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, published in March of this year, <Col N="1002" /> requires all public and private organisations to reassess their policies. The Defence Forces will actively participate in this review and re-assessment exercise.</P>
    <P>While reports in the media, relating to the content of an academic thesis, suggested that there was widespread sexual harassment, it should be emphasised that all incidents of sexual harassment brought to the attention of the military authorities are always thoroughly and properly investigated.</P>
    <P>Additional procedures are being put in place by the chief of staff to address this issue. Each barracks will have a female liaison officer, known and available to all females in barracks, for the processing of any matters which female personnel may not wish to bring forward through the normal chain of command.</P>
    <P>In addition, each formation commander will arrange Women's Days on a periodic basis to cover issues such as interpersonal relationships, women's health issues and other matters pertaining specifically to females.</P>
    <P>An internal information campaign of posters, and a simplified booklet, to convey in user friendly terms the essential message of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships are being initiated. Briefings and open discussions with mixed gender attendance are to be conducted by formation commanders on the content of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships until all personnel have attended. These briefings are to continue on a periodic basis. I am satisfied the military authorities are quite properly emphasising again the serious nature of this subject for all personnel, throughout the Defence Forces. The chief of staff has instructed that briefings and open discussions on the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships be conducted with all recruits in training. The chief of staff has emphasised that these briefings and discussions should not be seen as a box ticking exercise but given sufficient time and openness. The importance of establishing the proper environment for recruits and inculcating the values of respect, decency, and fair play cannot be over emphasised. The chief of staff has stated that commanders at all levels should bear in mind that it is a command responsibility to ensure that the military environment is free from any form of sexual harassment and bullying. He has further stated that any failure by a commander to ensure that such is the case, or to deal adequately with complaints of sexual harassment or bullying, would be considered a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The chief of staff has established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. Her task is to deter<Col N="1003" /> mine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She has been joined by two other civilian experts, who previously worked with her on the original Government task force, and by senior military personnel, including the Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; support &ndash; and a senior female Defence Force officer. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group will now proceed to carry out a study of the subject throughout the Defence Forces and produce a report by March 2002. A full time researcher, who holds a doctorate in occupational psychology, is working with Dr. Doyle.</P>
    <P>The commitment to military service makes unusual, irregular and at times, stressful and life threatening demands on members of the Defence Forces. Military personnel are subject to a code of discipline that involves restrictions on their personal liberty and rights. Military training must be tough and uncompromising to prepare personnel to face the most difficult of situations. The Defence Forces fully recognise, however, that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a general licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 48 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of doctors and nurses in the Defence Forces in the past five years are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Corps organises the provision of medical care within the Defence Forces. This service incorporates the following elements: a planning and advisory function aimed at ensur<Col N="1004" /> ing the Defence Forces maintain the necessary human and material resources to meet any unexpected eventuality from the medical point of view; a training function, aimed at ensuring the skills identified as being required to carry out all elements of the Medical Corps function are maintained and that the Corps will have the ability to perform foreseeable tasks; the provision of a medical service in peacetime, including a service to peacekeeping operations in which the Defence Forces participate; and preparedness of a medical service in the eventuality of hostilities.</P>
    <P>There are currently 27 medical officers, five dentists and four pharmacists in the Medical Corps and 38 nurses in the Army Nursing Service.</P>
    <P>Day to day medical care of personnel must take precedence. Due to the numbers of medical officers, resources are provided for the planning and advisory function, and the training function, on an &ldquo;as available basis&rdquo;. Within the existing constraints of available qualified personnel, the corps is, however, increasing its capacity to support personnel on peace support duties overseas by the purchase of equipment and training.</P>
    <P>Personnel are referred to civilian facilities where necessary to maintain the required level of medical services.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Medical Corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan in November 1998, was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed.</P>
    <P>At present, in addition to St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, three Military Medical Facilities, MMF, are located at the headquarters of each of the Field Medical Companies in Cork and Athlone and at Medical Detachment Supply and Services Unit in the Curragh. They have associated infirmaries for the care of &ldquo;living-in&rdquo; personnel &ndash; largely recruits and other training course students &ndash; who may become injured or ill. There are appointments for a physician at each MMF. There are currently X-ray, pharmacy and screening audiometry facilities at each MMF and physiotherapy facilities at MMF Cork and Curragh.</P>
    <P>Nurses of the Army Nursing Service have taken up new appointments as members of occupational care teams in the Air Corps and Naval Service and it is planned that more nurses will be offered similar appointments in the larger barracks throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Medical equipment is the subject of a continuing replacement and upgrading programme. Financial provision was made this year for the purchase of new field medical equipment, to support future peacekeeping missions.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy to Cork County Council, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, for £767,000 or 973,889, has been completed. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000 or 380,921 all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million or 8,888,167. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.  </P>
      <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 or 761, 843 and sale contracts have recently been signed. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities to complete the sale are progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig a comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of this property. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year, <Col N="1007" /> for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. I understand the matter was on the agenda of a recent meeting of the council and that no objection was raised to the adoption of the plan. A final decision on the matter is expected in the near future. Arrangements to put this property on the market are currently in train.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In relation to the remainder of this site I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties, including the local authority.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on the 14 June 2001. Two bids were received one of which was from Dublin Corporation. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following: 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for £2.5 million, 3,174,345; 6.39 acres known as Susan's Field, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork to Cork Corporation for £1.2 million, or 1.523,686; 3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick Corporation for £915,000 or 1,161,810; 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for £550,000 or 698,356; 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for £215,000 or 272,994 to assist with the construction of the Kildare by-pass and married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare to residents, which will realise £3 million or 3,809,214 approximately. To date £647,050 or 821,584 has been received.</P>
    <P>The disposal of ten acres beside Renmore Barracks, Galway will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to sell approximately 150 acres at Gormanston camp. However, the military camp of 57 acres will not be sold. It is too early to estimate the likely proceeds from this sale as the preliminary planning is still in progress.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, many of the properties are destined for disposal to local authorities in recognition of the increased needs for building lands being experienced by those authorities. A number of smaller surplus properties are also being sold to various individuals at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> In addition to the foregoing properties which are surplus to requirements and in the context of the White Paper on Defence and the management of resources in the best possible way, the military authorities have been asked to identify any additional properties considered surplus to requirements. This process is ongoing.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding. It is expected that up to £100 million or 126,973,808 will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised from the sale of the six barracks earmarked for disposal in 1998, and those additional surplus properties since identified, will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The barrack reinvestment programme was initiated by my Department in 1999, to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works, for the purpose of providing modern living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces. The special programme is centred mainly on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork. The total cost of this programme, which will be completed in 2003, is estimated at £45 million or 57.1 million.</P>
    <P>Details of expenditure, project costs and progress to date, are shown in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The costs to my Department associated with the disposal of surplus military property since July 1998 is £1.578 million or 2.004 million.</P>
    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers the cost of security at Magee Barracks, Kildare is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy has been sold to Cork County Council and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of these properties.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £1,022,000 or 1,297,672. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £165,000 or 209,507 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>Legal services are provided for the Department by the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 6 on 21 June 2001, I have decided to dispose of some land at Gormanston Aerodrome to fund equipment purchases for the Defence Forces. The precise area to be put on the market will be determined shortly but the military camp comprising approximately 57 acres will be retained. The modalities and timing of the sale are under consideration.</P>
      <P>The future use of the lands being sold will be a matter for the purchaser in consultation with the local planning authority. It is not envisaged that the sale of the lands will affect the infantry firing range at Ben Head. However, the development of the current aerodrome lands may require the integration of the Air Corps firing range with the firing range at Ben Head. The provision of resources for civilian aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> The current strength, male and female of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are detailed in the tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition, the chief of staff has discretion to have 250 recruits in training at any given time, over and above this figure of 10,500.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2001 General Service Recruiting Campaign in March 2001 which was followed by national and local media advertising.</P>
    <P>Where the need arises, competitions are organised to recruit specialist personnel by direct entry, where required. Competitions have been advertised in recent years for medical officers, band instrumentalists, marine engineer officers, naval service watchkeeping officers, electrical artificers, Army engineer officers and radio radar technicians.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain a policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. This will also help to achieve a balanced age profile in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Two air traffic control officers were commissioned from the ranks in 1998. In 1999 two non-commissioned officers were commissioned as electrical engineer officers in the Naval Service. Three non-commissioned personnel were commissioned for the information technology area in 2000. In September, 2001 eight non-commissioned officers were commissioned as watchkeeping officers in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to suggest that it is easy for the PDF to compete with the levels of remuneration and conditions now readily available within the private sector to those people with the required skills and experience. The recent tightening of the labour market is also a further factor to note.</P>
    <P>As one might reasonably expect, members of the Permanent Defence Force, across all ranks, take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity. While this trend would also apply to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general PDF situation. The PDF pension schemes are among the most generous within the public service. For instance, an enlisted man or non-commissioned officer can retire with an immediate pension and retirement lump sum after some 21 years service, often implying a real potential for retirement at about age 40.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the case of commissioned officers, a pension is payable, along with a lump <Col N="1012" /> sum after the completion of 12 years military service. For example, an officer, such as an army captain or commandant, may retire from the PDF in his or her late 30s and immediately receive a military pension along with a retirement lump sum.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. This always applied across a wide range of traditional trades, such as electrical work and vehicle mechanics. Nowadays, however, military skills training is as likely to encompass well recognised courses of training as electronics and communications technicians and also qualifications in computer software and information technology. Many military personnel, in all ranks, are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and to post-graduate degree level in such readily marketable specialisms. Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector.</P>
    <P>The majority, about 75%, of officer retirements are currently voluntary in that they are not compulsory determined by the reaching of a prescribed retirement age by the incumbent. Relatively few officers would stay in the PDF for the maximum period possible, that is, to their prescribed retirement age in rank. However, the positive features of turnover within officer ranks, and the consequential flow of promotions, must also be actively borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are not yet generally experiencing any difficulties in open public recruitment in that there are more than sufficient numbers of suitably qualified and motivated young people presenting for all levels of recruitment, including general service enlistment. It will be recalled that the present Government initiated an ongoing programme of rolling continuous general service recruitment and enlistment which continued very successfully with the year 2000 programme of general recruitment and this year has also proved to be successful. The Defence Forces continue to offer a range of attractive, stimulating and quite unique careers to motivated and capable young people.</P>
    <P>In particular, the prestigious annual cadetship competition continues to draw a large applicant pool of well educated and academically talented school leavers, as clearly evidenced by the leaving certificate results of this year's applicants. There were 645 eligible individual applicants for this year's cadetship competition which resulted in the following numbers of successful applicants being appointed: Naval Service 6; Air Corps 77; Army-Equitation School 51.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 46, 50, 88 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a tender competition which was con<Col N="1014" /> ducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
    <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
    <P>The full production run on the APCs is well under way. A total of 17 APCs will have been delivered to the Curragh Camp by the end of this month. The balance of 23 APCs will be delivered by the end of January or beginning of February next year &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations. Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace with a view to the first overseas deployment of the APCs to Eritrea with UNMEE.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, the appearance of cracks in the hulls of three APCs was noticed in the Curragh Camp. The issue was dealt with as a warranty item under the guarantee given by Mowag under the contract. Detailed discussions took place between Mowag and the Department on the cracks and expert investigations were put in train to determine their exact cause. I am advised that these cracks are not entirely unusual because of the type of manufacturing process involved in the production of the steel hulls of the APCs.</P>
    <P>As part of the investigations which are still ongoing, a range of remedial actions have been taken to deal with the issues raised as a result of the appearance of the cracks and the cracks on the three APCs are now being repaired. The repairs will not affect the integrity of the ballistic protection afforded by the APCs. An extended warranty has been agreed with Mowag to cover the Department against the possibility of the appearance of cracks in any of the 40 APCs to be delivered under the contract.</P>
    <P>The questions of the supply of an additional 20 APCs has been raised with Mowag and detailed negotiations are due to commence with the company, tomorrow, Friday, 19 October 2001.</P>

      <P>The Air Corps operate two Casa aircraft for maritime fishery patrol purposes. These aircraft which were manufactured by Casa, now a constituent of the new European Consortium EADS, were acquired in 1994.</P>
      <P>A request was received in January 2001 from EADS-CASA for one of the two Air Corps Casa maritime patrol aircraft to participate in a visit to the US Coastguard during the period 17 February to 4 March 2001. The US Coastguard was considering the purchase of a number of similar aircraft to those which are in service in the Air Corps. As there were considerable training benefits to be derived by the Air Corps from such a visit and since sales of the maritime patrol version of the Casa aircraft to the US Coastguard would greatly increase the fleet size of such aircraft and give rise to a greater availability of spares, etc., with subsequent benefits to all operators world-wide, including the Air Corps, I agreed to the proposed visit on the basis that EADS-CASA would reimburse the Department of Defence for all costs and arrange full indemnification for both crew and aircraft.</P>
      <P>The cost of the visit amounted to £113,300 and full reimbursement has been received from EADS-CASA. Maritime patrol cover was provided for the duration of the visit by the second Air Corps Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</P>

    <P>Following the publication of the report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department in relation to the implemen<Col N="1016" /> tation of the recommendations contained in the report. In this regard I put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The eighth meeting of a working group charged with overseeing the process took place on Thursday, 13 September 2001 in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well a representative from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed. In this regard, I am pleased to say very substantial progress is being made in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. This group is scheduled to meet again on Thursday, 1 November 2001 and will continue to meet as necessary until all the safety recommendations set out in the report are implemented. It will be appreciated that safety of flying operations is an ongoing organic process requiring continuing attention.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations was that an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps should be commissioned. This was done and I received the final report of the consultants involved in July 2001. This report was examined by both my Department and the military authorities, following which the Air Corps was tasked to take immediate steps towards implementing the recommendations. In a report, submitted by the Air Corps flight safety officer last month, the Air Corps has outlined progress to date on implementing certain of the recommendations contained in the safety audit and the further action required. To further advance the implementation of the recommendations of the safety audit, a working group comprising members of the Defence Forces and an official of my Department will oversee the consideration and implementation of the safety issues addressed in the safety audit.</P>
    <P>A further key recommendation contained in the Air Accident Investigation Unit report was the establishment of an Air Safety Office in the Air Corps and this was acted on straight away. The Air Safety Office is an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure. A full-time flight safety officer of lieutenant colonel rank and an officer of captain rank have been appointed by the GOC Air Corps to the office. The flight safety officer reports directly to the GOC Air Corps. A programme of specialist training and courses to equip the flight safety officer for his post has been under way since the end of 2000. The findings of the independent air operations safety audit will be a primary focus of the Flight Safety Office.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I take all safety issues very seriously and the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. I have emphasised to the military authorities that safety standards in equip<Col N="1017" /> ment, facilities and procedures are of the utmost importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment and procedures where necessary.</P>

      <P>In the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the Civil Defence branch of my Department to Roscrea, County Tipperary. The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Departments, is currently in discussions with the owners of a building in Roscrea. I understand these discussions are ongoing. It is anticipated that the transfer will take place next year. Of the 30 staff serving in the Civil Defence branch, one has indicated a willingness to transfer to Roscrea. I am confident that, prior to relocation, the required number of suitably trained and qualified staff will be in place. In this regard, more than 100 civil servants serving in other Departments have indicated a desire to transfer to my Department for the purpose of working in the Civil Defence branch in Roscrea.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to technician pay and the occupations which attract such pay are prescribed in the Defence Forces regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technician pay is payable to soldiers who are members of the technician class, who are employed on the duties of their trade or occupation and who are filling vacancies in the establishments of their units for their particular occu<Col N="1018" /> pations. The technician class consists of personnel possessing qualifications in specified trades or occupations.</P>
    <P>Instances can occasionally arise where an individual is employed on the duties of his or her trade or occupation but is not filling a post in their unit's establishment for that particular occupation and thus is not entitled to receive technician pay. This can occur, for example, where an individual wishes to remain at a particular location where no such establishment post is available. However, as a general rule, the policy is that people should not be employed in duties of their trade or occupation unless they are filling vacancies in the establishments of their units for their particular occupations.</P>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.</P>
    <P>In signing up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PDFORRA agreed to participate in the first ever public service benchmarking process which is reviewing all aspects of the pay of non-commissioned personnel in the Defence Forces by reference to pay and jobs across the economy. This review will, of course, encompass technician pay. The benchmarking process is ongoing and the benchmarking body's report is due by June 2002.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my Department finalised a package of outstanding issues which included increases in the rates of technician pay for 17 occupations in the Defence Forces. This has benefited some 500 personnel at an approximate cost of £500,000 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my role as Minister for Defence is concerned the criteria for the use of EU capabilities to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks have their basis in the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and have been <Col N="1019" /> elaborated in the conclusions of successive European Councils since Cologne.</P>
    <P>A decision by the EU to undertake a humanitarian or crisis management task would be taken by the Council of the European Union, which would have the responsibility and overall direction for any EU-led humanitarian or crisis management operation &ndash; Petersberg tasks. In the context of the objective of achieving the EU Headline Goal &ndash; otherwise known as the Rapid Reaction Force &ndash; by 2003, the EU has not yet reached the state of preparedness to undertake a Petersberg task.</P>
    <P>The voluntary nature of participation by EU member states in any Petersberg task is a key principle in the development of European security and defence policy. A decision for any EU member state to participate in a particular EU-led Petersberg operation will be taken by that member state on a sovereign basis, in accordance with their internal procedures. Participation in any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, will be considered on a case by case basis and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the EU Council.</P>
    <P>Planning work is ongoing in relation to developing the capabilities required to meet the headline goal by the target date of 2003. A capabilities improvement conference is scheduled to take place on 19-20 November 2001 to review progress to date and to address any shortfalls which have been identified.</P>
    <P>While certain informal figures have been used for planning purposes, no formal geographic limit has been established for the deployment of EU crisis management capabilities. There have been no specific decisions taken by the EU on the points raised by the Deputy in relation to the geographical scope of the so-called Rapid Reaction Force.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provision of information to citizens regarding possible deployment of EU crisis management capabilities is generally regarded by member states as being primarily a matter for national governments. In Ireland's case, the Government has made considerable efforts to facilitate thorough and factually-based debate on Ireland's participation in the development of European security and defence policy. It is intended that every effort should be made to keep people informed of ongoing developments in this area in the period ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>By 16 October 2001 a total of 15,991 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Some 255 claims have been the subject of court awards with a further 9,437 being disposed of through out-of-court settlements. A further 418 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. Some 5,881 claims were outstanding on 16 October 2001.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the leading Army hearing loss case of Hanley, which was delivered in December 1999, my Department in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme, ESS, for dealing with the outstanding Army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis during the year 2000 and 1,099 claims were settled by way of direct negotiations between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Chief State Solicitor's office and my Department.</P>
      <P>Given the success of the pilot scheme, my Department expanded the ESS in January of this year. In this regard, five firms of liability loss adjusters have been engaged in order to expand the capacity of the scheme and to augment the resources of the Chief State Solicitor's office in conducting settlement negotiations.</P>
      <P>The scheme has continued to operate successfully and the current position is that by 16 October 2001, a further 1,840 claims had been resolved, while I understand that settlements have been agreed with plaintiffs' solicitors in a further 220 cases. In addition, negotiations are ongoing in a further 1,590 claims.</P>
      <P>In this regard, it is the policy of my Department to resolve the majority of outstanding claims under the scheme. The scheme has now reached a stage where many hundreds of plaintiffs have had their claims resolved at fair levels of compensation, with significant savings to the Exchequer in court costs. While some claims will continue to be listed for hearing in court, I am hopeful that the early settlement scheme will continue to operate successfully and that the vast majority of the outstanding claims will be resolved in this way.</P>

      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure the country has the Defence Forces it needs to meet the roles laid down by Government and that the Defence Forces continues to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That is the overall objective of the White Paper and I can assure the House that implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively.</P>
      <P>The chief of staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help us to achieve the following broad goals: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the prep<Col N="1022" /> aration of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The chief of staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Arising from the special study of the Air Corps and the Naval Service undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, implementation plans for both services are now in place, including new organisation structures.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. I am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the future development of the reserve can be built.</P>
    <P>Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. To facilitate this, I published the report of the steering group last year and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan. That process continues and I envisage that the implementation of change will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service. I have given the House the details of the programme which is being funded from payroll savings and from the sales of surplus property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The question of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review.</P>
      <P>Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangement System &ndash; UNSAS. As I have indicated to the House previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under this system. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>There exists a Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Peacekeeping, under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs whose function, <i>inter alia</i>, is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this area and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with developments in international peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>On 15 June 2001, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a Guard and Administration Company of about 150 Defence Forces personnel to serve with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, with effect from December 2001, for a minimum period of 12 months. Government approval has been given for the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE. Dáil approval for the dispatch of the contingent will be sought shortly.</P>
      <P>In response to a separate request from the UN, two members of the Defence Forces were deployed to the mission in June 2001 to take up staff appointments in UNMEE Force HQ. Following recent requests from the UN, I have agreed that six more members of the Defence Forces take up staff appointments in UNMEE Force HQ in November 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, on which the FCÁ is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the steering group, which I set up to undertake a study of the reserve and which reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCÁ and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces Training Centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCÁ organisation is its country-wide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. <Col N="1027" /> Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the Reserve is that members of the FCÁ should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions by other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in Brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces Training Centre the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the Reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established it will form part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 May 1999 during an operation in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda Air Support Unit, GASU, helicopter which is piloted by Air Corps person<Col N="1028" /> nel inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
      <P>To facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU.</P>
      <P>Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
      <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through their Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place with the military authorities and the Air Corps and it was decided to attempt to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter. The tender documentation was prepared and on 27 September 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used AS 355N helicopter to the Department of Defence issued to a total of 15 companies. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The result of the tender competition indicated that there were very few AS 355N helicopters available on the open market. Six responses were received some of which offered different helicopter types which could not be considered. Essentially, the valid tenders from three companies related to the same, one only, AS 355N helicopter which was available in the Philippines. Having considered the responses and the various factors involved, the option to look further into the possible purchase of this particular helicopter was not taken up by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All options for the provision of night flying training of Air Corps pilots for the GASU are under active consideration in my Department but the prospect of obtaining a second hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given our <Col N="1029" /> experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I recently indicated to the House, the Government's response to the Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was announced by the Minister for Finance on 28 September 2001. The Government has decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and intends to establish the working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, to be made within six months of this decision. Parallel structures &ndash; subject to the same timeframe and remit &ndash; will be established in the case of members of the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces. Arrangements will also be made to facilitate pensioner group rep<Col N="1030" /> resentation in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of reckoning military service allowance, MSA, in the calculation of the pensions of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the position is that arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces  &ndash; the Gleeson Commission &ndash; the allowance &ndash; which had been introduced in 1979 &ndash; was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. As I have previously indicated to the House, this approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including MSA and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report. The commission, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised in the context of the Government's consideration of the commission's final report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the House earlier today in reply to a priority question, the dastardly deeds in the <Col N="1032" /> United States on 11 September 2001 have highlighted new security risks for the entire world. While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces there is no reason to believe Ireland is a direct target. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken.</P>
      <P>In this regard mutual assistance and co-operation is maintained between the Irish security services and those of other countries to ensure effective flows of relevant intelligence. It will be appreciated that, in the interests of security, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific measures being undertaken to guard against or to counter such terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the security committee which was convened on the evening of the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, members of the Cabinet were briefed on the security precautions which had been put in place immediately arising from those attacks. A high level contact group was set up to monitor developments and emergency services were asked to ensure their arrangements were fully up to date. Since then the Security Committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group continues to meet on a regular basis. In the aftermath of the terrorist events of 11 September, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, NCASC, which is chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise and which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, civil and military representatives from my Department, has convened seven special meetings to date, the first of which took place on the day following the events in the US. At those meetings, the NCASC has been reviewing existing aviation security procedures for Irish aviation in the light of the current security situation, has strengthened existing procedures and is examining specific security proposals.</P>
      <P>As regards the handling of a hijacked aircraft, procedures have been agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, for the exchange of relevant information between member states.</P>
      <P>At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation. In support of the emergency planning authorities in updating their emergency plans it was arranged that the contact group would seek to identify specific additional threats which needed to be taken on board in revised emergency plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unprecedented attacks on the US have clearly changed the context in which emergency planning must take place. Accordingly, a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has taken place, following which the Government has decided to set up an Office of Emergency Planning in my Department. That office will take the lead role in emergency <Col N="1033" /> planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism.</P>

      <Quest>the equipment available to members of the Defence Forces to enable them to take such action as is appropriate in the context of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack and the fallout from such attack affecting this State; and if he is satisfied the equipment furnished to the Defence Forces meets all the needs of the Defence Forces should such circumstances arise.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces would play an integral role in the context of any possible nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threat in Ireland. The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with any NBC threats identified from time to time.</P>
      <P>A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Ordnance Corps. The question of additional requirements arising from the events of 11 September is being examined by the Ordnance Corps and any proposals in this regard for new or additional NBC equipment will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment which meets their current requirements. In particular, there is a total of approximately 1,800 NBC suits available to the Defence Forces at present. An order for an additional 4,000 NBC suits was placed in July 2001 with a delivery date in December 2001-January 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these.</P>
      <P>In the current climate, there is understandable concern and anxiety among all members of our society. However, it is important to emphasise that there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target for international terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>The most important defence against any attack is of course external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. To this end all the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are being deployed and all that can be done is being done in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department is the designated managing authorities for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. My Department is also responsible for a number of measures under the regional operational programmes. Measures in the operational programmes are administered by the State-agencies under the aegis of my Department. Expenditure broken down at county level is not available.</P>
      <P>Under the productive sector operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The allocation of spending in the BMW region by these agencies in 2000 was 158 million and of this 8.2milllion was spent. The allocation for spending in 2001 is 203.7 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 21.2 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
      <P>While expenditure, under the productive sector operational programme has been less than forecast expenditure by the development agencies in the BMW region is on target. There are a number of reasons for this. There was a considerable delay in a number of measures in obtaining State aid approval from the European Commission. Also with new schemes there is an inevitable time-lag from the launch of schemes to the receipt and evaluation of proposals and the incurring of expenditure. In addition expenditure was still continuing in 2000 in respect of commitment made up to the end of 1999 under the Industry Operational Programme 1994-99. It is anticipated that the level of expenditure under the programme will increase over the next two years.</P>
      <P>Under the employment and human resources development operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are FÁS and Enterprise Ireland. The allocation for spending in the BMW region under the operational programme by these agencies in 2000 was 247.69 million and of this 220.11 million was spent. The allocation for spending in 2001 is 242.63 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 116.5 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the regional operational programmes the county enterprise boards are responsible for implementing the measure. The allocation for spending in the BMW region in the two operational programmes in 2000 was 11.1 million and of this 10.8 million was spent. The allocation for <Col N="1035" /> spending in 2001 is 10.8 million of which 7.7 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the existing arrangement for State assistance for inventors with regards to the development of inventions from the initial stage right through to bringing the invention to the marketplace are fair and sufficient.</P>
      <P>The investment proposal submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, seeking £1 million for an inventors fund and which was subsequently referred to me for consideration, was examined in detail by my Department.</P>
      <P>The outcome of that examination was that my Department found no reason to deviate from any aspect of settled policy in this area, particularly in relation to the requirement that no State Agency can allocate funds for any proposal without first familiarising itself with details of the proposal in order to evaluate its prospects of commercial success.</P>
      <P>As one of the foundations on which this investment proposal is based requires just such as a departure from policy, I regret to say that I cannot support this proposal. However, I am satisfied that given the vast increase in funds to science and technology under the national development plan, there is ample assistance and encouragement in this area.</P>

      <P>In the period from 1 January 2001 to date, 14,036 proposed redundancies were notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 1991. A breakdown of the locations of these redundancies is provided in appendix 1, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to job creation for the current year, the information requested by the Deputy is not yet available. The Forfás annual employment survey is carried out in November of each year. This survey will give details of all jobs created <Col N="1036" /> and lost in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards assisted companies for the period 1 November 2000 to 31 October 2001. The preliminary figures for this survey will not be available until year end. In my reply to a Parliamentary Question No 141 of the 10 October 2001, on the subject of revised targets for job creation, I responded as follows.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, both agencies remained optimistic about this year's performance, forecasting 21,000 new jobs and a net employment increase of 11,000. However, we are all aware of the unforeseen factors which have arisen, namely foot and mouth, the escalation of difficulties in the IT industry and most recently the tragic events in the US. These factors have combined to significantly moderate the agencies' expectations for the current year. While Forfás expects overall job creation to remain strong at about 19,500, the net employment increase has been revised significantly downwards to 3,400, the bulk of this adjustment being due to increased job losses in foreign owned firms particularly those based in the US.</P>
    <P>While any deterioration in these figures is disappointing, the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. I am confident that we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms. To this end, the Government is continuing to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment, and encouraging companies to move up the value chain.</P>

However, in the past 12 months it is estimated that the insurance section in this Department handled the following number <Col N="1038" /> of queries: written, 200; telephone, 2,000; and e-mail, 40. The majority of representations relate to complaints regarding increases in personal insurance premiums, especially for motor insurance.</P>
      <P>There is a customer complaints direct response service in operation which offers a quality and speedy service and redirects queries for information to relevant bodies or organisations. For example, some are referred to the Irish Insurance Federation or to the relevant insurance company, which might be the subject of the complaint.

      <P>The Dunmanway inter-agency task force was established in response to the announced closure of the facility with effect from 11 February 2000 with the loss of 113 jobs. The task force is chaired by IDA Ireland and comprises representatives from Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the county enterprise board and the county manager for west Cork. The factory was purchased by O'Flynn Construction on 31 August 2000. This company has developed major office parks such as the university technology park in Cork and the Eastgate Business Park at Little Island. O'Flynn Construction have collaborated with IDA Ireland in the production of a colour brochure to advertise the factory which is being marketed for a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of visits to the facility but, so far, only one of the companies has shown some interest in the factory. However, efforts are continuing to be made to secure a tenant. The task force is now completing its final report which is expected to be submitted to me in November, 2001.</P>

    <P>*1 Indicative figures only</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this time and within the time available to provide a breakdown on a BMW county basis of expenditure to date by my Department under the NDP. My Department is at present rolling out the installation of an NDP computerised reporting system which will, among other matters, provide details of expenditure on a county basis. In any event much expenditure, such as that on marketing, training and RTDI, can only be attributed indicatively on a regional and county basis. I have, however, arranged, in respect of the fishery harbours and coast protection programmes, for details, on a BMW county basis, of actual public expenditure in 2000 and the 2001 approved programmes to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The investment under the NDP is without precedent in terms of its ambition, scope and level of resources. Many of the programmes in the marine and natural resources sectors provide a unique opportunity to promote balanced regional development given their peripheral and rural location. This is reflected in the fact that more than 65% of proposed public investment in these sectors under the NDP will be targeted at the BMW region.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at present to provide a breakdown of the expenditure to date on a county by county basis. However, overall to the end of June, 2001, almost £64.20 million, 81.51 million, has been spent on public transport projects in the BMW region under the above programme. These projects are being implemented by CIE, with Iarnród Éireann being responsible for development of the rail infrastructure, rolling stock and services, and Bus Éireann developing regional bus services.</P>
      <P>The main objectives are to upgrade the mainline rail infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities to improve the safety of the network, increase the physical capacity of the railway to cater for growing passenger demand and also to improve the quality, speed and reliability of services. These objectives will be achieved through mainline rail investment in safety and renewal; regional bus improvements; accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities; and ongoing fleet replacement and re-equipment by Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>The NDP monitoring committee established by my Department which includes representatives from the CIE Group and the Department of Finance, is responsible for overseeing progress, both financial and physical, of the public transport projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of £8 million, 10.12 million &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; has been allocated to assist with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the four regional airports in the BMW region at Carrickfin in Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Knock. There has been no expenditure to date of this amount. However, my Department <Col N="1042" /> is currently examining and assessing the projects which have been submitted for support under the NDP by the four regional airport authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Aside from the funds provided for under the NDP, my Department also provides support for marketing activities and for safety and security measures at the regional airports. Over the two year period, 2000-01, a sum of £1.845 million, 2.343 million, was allocated under the scheme to the four airports in the BMW region as follows: Donegal Airport, £300,000 &ndash; 380,921; Galway Airport, £325,000 &ndash; 412,665; Sligo Airport, £300,000 &ndash; 380,921; and Knock Airport, £920,000 &ndash; 1,168,159. In addition, my Department supports the operation of public service obligation, PSO, air services on the routes connecting the regional airports in Donegal, Sligo, Knock and Galway with Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under the sustainable energy priority within the framework of the national development plan, £61.49 million, 78.08 million, is earmarked for investment in the BMW region. My Department has overall responsibility for the administration of this funding and the Irish Energy Centre, IEC, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the main conduit for implementing this priority. To date there has been no expenditure incurred in the BMW region. However, the IEC has recently finalised details of a three year work programme which will prioritise spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in the different regions.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £19 million, 24.1 million, has been made for communications infrastructure initiatives in the BMW region under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006. No expenditure has been made to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence set out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. In addition to the <Col N="1043" /> £180 million which has been invested on equipment since I was appointed Minister in 1997, the White Paper involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over the next decade. This year alone the provision is about £107 million. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    <P>Substantial programmes of investment are taking place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows.</P>
    <P>A total of 17 of the new fleet of 40 Mowag armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, will have been delivered by the end of this month to the Curragh Camp. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January-February of next year almost two years ahead of previous expectations. Negotiations will take place with Mowag this week with regard to the provision of an additional 20 APCs.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment on new vehicles for the Army with more than £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles &ndash; deployed to KFOR &ndash; and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4x4's, and three quarter tonne trucks.</P>
    <P>More than £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces has commenced.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and a decision can be expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The second new ship for the Naval Service, <i>LE Niamh</i>, which is a sister ship of <i>LE Róisín</i> was commissioned into the Naval Service last month. As with <i>LE Róisín</i>, the new ship cost more than £20 million and will be a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the ordnance corps. The question of additional requirements arising from the events of 11 September is being examined by the ordnance corps <Col N="1044" /> and any proposals in this regard for new or additional NBC equipment will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment which meets their current requirements. In particular, there is approximately 1,800 nuclear, biological and chemical, NBC, suits available to the Defence Forces at present. An order for an additional 4,000 NBC suits was placed in July 2001 with a delivery date in December 2001-January 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these.</P>

      <P>The strength of the FCA as at 30 June 2001, the latest date for which figures have been compiled, was 12,920 &ndash; of whom 3,068 were female personnel. Recruitment to the FCA is ongoing and continuous at local level to replace wastage. A recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces, which will commence shortly, will include recruitment to the Reserve Defence Forces. Recruitment of new members is facilitated by visits to secondary schools on a regular basis, by local advertising and by active community involvement and profile generally. The Defence Forces are concerned at all times to recruit active committed young people with a view to keeping strengths at appropriate levels and introducing young people to the Defence Forces and encouraging their natural interest. Some may subsequently become interested in going on for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force. The military authorities advise that there are no details readily available on the age profile of the second line reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force, including the FCA will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. The combined Army reserve, comprising integrated and reserve brigade elements, will total some 11,948 personnel. A thorough, com<Col N="1045" /> prehensive and in depth study of the reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then chief of staff, and latterly by the steering group itself. I formally launched the steering group report in November 2000. I am advised by the military authorities that a board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. I must emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>
    <P>In advance of the completion of the plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations the total sum allocated for the training of the second line reserve &ndash; FCA and An Slua Muirí &ndash; was increased by an additional £1.6 million from £5.7 million in 2000 to £7.3 million in 2001. This figure provided for an increase in the number of man days from the level of 84,000 in 2000 to 94,000 approximately in 2001, allocated approximately between 75,000 days annual training and approximately 18,000 for 14 day full-time courses of instruction for officer and NCO technical training.</P>

Significant investment has taken place in the last four years on new vehicles for the Defence Forces such as specialist transport cargo vehicles deployed to KFOR and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4x4s and three quarter tonne trucks. The ages of the vehicles range from the early 1980s &ndash; a minority &ndash; to 2001.

      <P>As I previously indicated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question, a comprehensive integrated area action plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. I understand the matter was on the agenda of a recent meeting of the council and no objection was raised to the adoption of the plan. A final decision on the matter is expected in the near future.</P>

In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £165,000, 209,507, in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is taking place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context for such emergency planning. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from international terrorism. In those circumstances the Government decided on 2 October 2001 to set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>The new office is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved and exercising an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The existing lead role of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue.</P>
      <P>I established the Office of Emergency Planning on 4 October, 2001. The office, which includes four senior staff both civil and military with additional support staff to be assigned as required, will be located in the Department's head office in Dublin. The operation of similar bodies in other jurisdictions is also being looked at to benefit from best international practice. I will make regular reports to the Cabinet and the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to the work of the new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is in place an extensive framework of peacetime emergency plans, it is now clear that the basis on which emergency planning is currently carried out needs to be reviewed to take into account the possibility, however remote, of chemical and biological or other attacks on this State and its people or on neighbouring countries <Col N="1049" /> which could indirectly impact on this State. This process of review is continuing.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the activation of major emergency plans have not changed in light of the Governments decision to set up the office of emergency planning. The responsibility for specific emergency planning functions and response arrangements will remain with the relevant Departments and agencies, as heretofore. Response planning for major emergencies is carried out at local authority, health board or Garda division level and inputs from my Department, including the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, are factored into these plans.</P>
    <P>My Department will assist the development of the continuous process of threat assessment being conducted by Government. The high level contact group, established in the wake of the events of 11 September, will in future be convened by the Department of Defence to support the office of emergency planning.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target for international terrorist attacks. It is prudent that the situation is kept under constant review in light of any escalation in international terrorism. However, the most important defence against any attack is, of course, vigilance leading to detection of potential terrorists and prevention of their activities by the security forces. The Garda Commissioner and the chief of staff of the Defence Forces have assured me that all necessary resources are being deployed to this end.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all Departments and agencies through the high level contact group and the office of emergency planning. The Defence Forces are ready to provide any assistance required of them.</P>

      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, 380,921, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million, 8,888,167. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>

      <P>Since my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 199 raised by the Deputy on 15 May 2001, I have attended one meeting which has been held at ministerial level in the context of European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. This informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers was held in Brussels from 11 to 12 October 2001. The meeting, an informal event, was not a decision-making forum. Matters discussed centred on ESDP in general and in particular on progress made to date on making the EU crisis management capability operational to fulfil the Helsinki headline goal by 2003. I have not had discussions with my European Union colleagues in the context of Partnership for Peace, PfP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence set out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. In addition to the £180 million which has been invested on equipment since I was appointed Minister in 1997, the White Paper involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over the next decade. This year alone the provision is about £107 million. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take <Col N="1051" /> place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows.</P>
    <P>A total of 17 of the new fleet of 40 Mowag armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, will have been delivered by the end of this month to the Curragh Camp. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January-February of next year almost two years ahead of previous expectations. Negotiations will take place with Mowag this week with regard to the provision of an additional 20 APCs.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment on new vehicles for the Army with more than £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles &ndash; deployed to KFOR &ndash; and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4x4's, and three quarter tonne trucks.</P>
    <P>More than £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million in the next three years is under way. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces has commenced.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and a decision can be expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The second new ship for the Naval Service, <i>LE Niamh</i>, which is a sister ship of <i>LE Róisín</i> was commissioned into the Naval Service last month. As with <i>LE Róisín</i>, the new ship cost more than £20 million and will be a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles.</P>
    <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It ensures that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will have the most modern of equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <P>My Department can accept that the circumstances under which farmers in the Cooley peninsula had to destock as a result of the foot and mouth situation, were exceptional and consequently the 70% usage rule will be waived for those farmers for the years 2002 and 2003.

    <P>A sum of £1,819.30, 2,310.03, in 2000 extensification premium grants was paid on 28 May 2001.

Euro compensation top-up amounting to £47.60, 60.44, is still due on these 35 animals and will be paid shortly. Taking the amalga<Col N="1055" /> mated herd position into account, an additional sum of £1,120.14, 1,422.28, is due to the jointly registered herdowners in 2000 extensification premium. The sum payable is based on 21 other male animals that had already qualified for payment under the 2000 special beef premium scheme. This payment can also be expected shortly. A 40% balance of 2000 suckler cow premium amounting to £1,333.42, 1,693.09, along with a 2000 extensification premium payment based on 21 suckler cows and amounting to £1,120.14, 1,422.28, will also be paid shortly.</P>
    <P>Separate herd numbers have since been restored to each party. Each party has separately applied for grants under the 2001 ewe premium scheme, the 2001 area based compensatory allowances scheme and the 2001 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes. The first instalment of 2001 ewe premium, which amounted to £1,600.95, 2,032.79, issued to the person named on 4 October 2001. Payment of the second instalment is scheduled to commence in the coming days. In regard to the 2001 area based compensatory allowances scheme, because of the amalgamated herd position of the two herds a stocking density for 2000 is not readily available from livestock scheme records for the person named. His case is currently being examined against CMMS records for 2001, and on confirmation that the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare is reached, payment should issue in due course. Payment of an 80% advance of the 2001 special beef premium and the suckler cow premium is scheduled to commence within the next week or so.</P>

The amount paid was recently recouped from the 2001 area based compensatory payments scheme which has allowed full processing of the first and second instalments of the 2001 ewe premium to be completed. Payment of these instalments without penalty will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on one beef cow and three other animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme and one cow under the 2000 suckler cow scheme. His application was received on 20 June 2001 and was accepted on proof of a certificate of posting. When his application was being processed three of the animals applied on were not registered with the national calf birth registration service and the person named was written to by my Department on 10 October 2001 requesting that the animals be registered. The animals will have to be registered before the application can be processed further. No area aid application was received from the person named for the year 2001 and consequently no disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme payment can be made for 2001.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on one animal under the 2001 suckler cow scheme and his 80% entitlement under the scheme will issue before the end of October. Farmers who fail to submit an area aid application may be paid premium payments on up to 15 livestock units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of national chicken kill carried out by the company named for the past six years are as follows: 1996 &ndash; 17%; 1997 &ndash; 16.1%; 1998 &ndash; 16.2 %; 1999 &ndash; 16.1%; 2000 &ndash; 15.3%; and 2001 to July &ndash; 13.7%.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of the company concerned, which is now in voluntary liquidation, various realignments took place within the industry. Surplus broilers were, to a large extent, dealt with by increased production on the part of other processors. Major efforts were also made by the industry to accommodate other producers who were affected by this company closure.</P>
      <P>The question of finance is purely a commercial decision for any prospective purchaser of the plant. My Department has responsibility for monitoring the safety of meat produced in registered premises, for the protection of the consumer and to ensure that the legal food safety standards are fully met and maintained and is not involved in the financing of processing plants. Enterprise Ireland is the State agency responsible for the possible provision of any State funding to this sector and for the application of the conditions attaching to any such funding.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in previous replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 78 on 5 April 2001 and No. 157 on 23 May 2001, payment of slaughter premium was delayed because the person named had not furnished the documentary evidence requested from him to establish that the animals were in his herd for two months prior to slaughter. Documentation has now been obtained confirming the presence of the animals in the herd for at least two months prior to the slaughter date. Accordingly, payment will issue to the person named in mid-November.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applications that my Department has received under the two early retirement schemes is set out in the first table below. That table also shows the numbers approved and the numbers refused.</P>
      <P>The most common reasons for refusing applications are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) the retiring farmer did not qualify under the age criteria;</P>
      <P>(ii) the transferee did not qualify under the age criteria;</P>
      <P>(iii) title to the pension lands, or, in the previous scheme, to the enlargement lands, was not established;</P>
      <P>(iv) incomplete or invalid documentation was submitted.</P>
      <P>The second table below contains information on the number of cases which were appealed to my Department and also those which were appealed to the Ombudsman, together with the number in which the Ombudsman recommended that my Department change its decisions.</P>
      <P>The third table shows the number of cases in each scheme in which queries were raised, and the number in which pensions have been suspended. It is not possible to quantify the number of queries raised under the old scheme, but the majority of applications involved a significant amount of interaction between the Department and the applicant or their agent. It was for this reason that the onus in the new scheme is on both the applicant and their agent to ensure that the application is in order before submitting it to the Department for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of a pension is suspended when a participant is found to be non-compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme &ndash; for example if a retired farmer is found to be still farming, or a transferee is not farming the enlarged holding. In other cases as listed below participants are requested to submit evidence <Col N="1059" /> within a given time period to my Department to prove that they are compliant with the scheme rules. Failure to submit such evidence within the specified period results in suspension of the pension.</P>
    <P>(i) The regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension which becomes payable. While the onus is on participants in the scheme to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old age pension, participants are now advised three months in advance of their 66th birthday that they must apply to the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension and notify my Department of that Department's decision. If no response is received from applicants before their 66th birthday, payment of the early retirement pension is suspended pending confirmation of their entitlement to the old age pension.</P>
    <P>(ii) Pension declaration forms are issued to every participant in the scheme each year. Participants must sign this form and have their signature witnessed. In signing the form the participant is declaring &ldquo;that I am entitled to receive payment of a pension under the above-mentioned scheme and that since I was granted the pension under the scheme I have not engaged in commercial farming activities and that all the conditions of the scheme continue to be met.&rdquo; Payment of pension is suspended if the signed declaration is not returned within 28 days.</P>
    <P>(iii) Legal documentation in respect of lands leased, purchased, transferred or sold or a replacement transferee must be submitted to my Department as evidence of compliance. Payment of the pension is suspended if relevant documentation has not been received within four <Col N="1060" /> months of the initial request. The pension remains suspended until the required documentation is submitted and approved by the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>As regards the extension of leases, there are currently five pensions suspended, one each in Cavan, Cork, Louth and two in Meath, that are awaiting approval on extension of leases. My Department endeavours to process the renewal of leases as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been implemented to simplify the application process. Revised procedures have been introduced which allows for the suspension of the processing of an application if there are minor errors or omissions that can be corrected. Applicants are given up to ten days to rectify the errors, while their date of application is unaffected. This new procedure should overcome many of the early problems with the scheme. The scheme is currently being reviewed to see if it can be clarified further, though my Department must always have regard to its responsibilities as a payment agency responsible for the correct administration of EU-funded measures.</P>
    <P>In relation to the average length of time between application and payment, the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers lays down the timescale within which valid applications for the early retirement pension must be brought to scheduling for payment stage. For valid applications, i.e. those that meet the eligibility requirements, a period of ten weeks is allowed where there is no pre-payment check to be completed and twelve weeks in cases selected for pre-payment inspection. A further six weeks is allowed for payment of pension following approval. The Department has met its commitments under the protocol in relation to all applications received to date. The average time taken to process an application is 62 days, well within the protocol timescale.</P>

      <P>It was necessary to suspend payment of the early retirement pension to the person named from July 2001 because legal documentation relating to the renewal of a lease had not been received. The required documentation has now been received and monthly payments will resume at the end of November, with arrears payable from 1 July 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has put down a similar question to other Ministers and their responses will indicate NDP expenditure in the areas for which each Minister is responsible. As Minister for Finance, my Department is responsible for the direct allocation and spending of funds under the technical assistance operational programme and also the peace programme. The amount spent on each of these programmes is not currently available at county levels. Therefore the amounts I will give are for the BMW region.</P>
      <P>The NDP-CSF Technical Assistance Operational Programme 2000-2006 makes a total allocation in 2000 and 2001 of 1.6 million. This technical assistance operational programme has spent 0.16 million from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2001 in the BMW region. It should be acknowledged that spending on technical assistance traditionally accelerates as the programme progresses.</P>
      <P>The NDP-CSF technical assistance allocation is based on the financial plan. As the measures under the technical assistance operational programme support the NDP-CSF on a national basis, the breakdown of expenditure is calculated according to the regional allocations in the Berlin profile.</P>
      <P>My Department is also responsible for the allocation and spending of funds for the peace II operational programme. The peace II programme was only agreed with the European Commission this year therefore no spending has occurred on this programme to date. Spending is anticipated to begin very soon now that matters have been resolved. Currently there is ongoing expenditure under the peace I programme for the 1994-99 national development plan.</P>

      <P>The building in question, while owned by the Office of Public Works, is currently being used as sub-depot by the national monuments and historic properties section of Dúchas. It is intended to vacate the present building and to relocate this sub-depot at a new site in the Cashel area in the near future.</P>
      <P>The future use of the vacated building will be evaluated in the light of our various customer Departments' accommodation needs. If it transpires that there is no demand for the building from any of our customer Departments, consideration will be given to its disposal in accordance with normal practice.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide funding directly to any organisations such as the Irish Seal Sanctuary. While the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has primary responsibility for dealing with wildlife, I understand that they see their responsibility as conservation of wildlife. I am informed that as the work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary does not impact significantly on overall seal numbers and is primarily of a welfare nature, involving the rehabilitation of individual seals, it does not come within that remit.</P>
      <P>I am aware that submissions for grant aid have been made by the Irish Seal Sanctuary on a number of occasions. At present the various pre-budget submissions are being considered; it is not the practice to divulge any of the detailed content of the budget in advance. Hence it is not possible to give specific commitments on the provision of funding for any particular organisation prior to budget day.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have noted the case made on behalf of the Irish Seal Sanctuary and it will be considered along with the many other pre-budget requests I have received.</P>

      <P>The position is that, subject to the exclusion of a <i>de minimis</i> amount, tax relief at the marginal rate is available in respect of family expenditure on privately obtained speech therapy in respect of dependant children.</P>
      <P>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief in respect of certain non-routine unreimbursable health expenses incurred in a tax year. In the current short tax &ldquo;year&rdquo; the first £74 &ndash; 94 &ndash; of health expenses in the case of a single person, or £148 &ndash; 188 &ndash; in the case of a married couple or family, is excluded from the scope of the relief. From 1 January 2002 the first 125 &ndash; £98 &ndash; in the case of a single person, or 250 &ndash; £196 &ndash; in the case of a married couple or family, are excluded from the scope of the relief. The relief can be claimed on a MED 1 form and is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;health expenses&rdquo; was extended with effect from 6 April 2001 by the Finance Act, 2001, to include the cost of speech and language therapy carried out by a speech and language therapist in respect of a dependant child <Col N="1066" /> of the claimant. A dependent child is (1) a child of the taxpayer, or a child in the custody of the taxpayer and maintained at the taxpayer's own expense, who (a) is under the age of 18 years, or (b) if over the age of 18 years, is receiving full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment, or (2) a child in respect of whom the taxpayer is receiving an incapacitated child tax credit.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Speech and language therapist&rdquo; means a person approved for the purposes of section 469 by the Minister for Health and Children in accordance with guidelines set down by that Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. I have no plans to change the current arrangements at this stage.</P>

Where there is a disposal of a section 23 property there is a charge to capital gains tax on any gain arising by reference to the cost of acquisition and the proceeds of disposal. The current rate of tax is 20%. There are no specific exemptions or reliefs in respect of a gain arising on a section 23 property.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is replying to that part of the Deputy's question in relation to the matter of payments of pensions made through the banks.</P>
      <P>On the question of ATM charges, the position is as follows: there is a £5 stamp duty charge on ATM cards. This charge was introduced in 1992 at a rate of £2 per cash card and was increased to the current rate in 1996. The duty is payable by a bank or building society in respect of each cash card which is valid during their accounting period. ATM cards are exempt from stamp duty where: (i) a card has not been used during the accounting period; and (ii) where in the case of any card issued in respect of a deposit account the average daily balance did not exceed £10.</P>
      <P>This charge to stamp duty is levied on the financial institutions &ndash; and not on the individual &ndash; in respect of each valid ATM card account maintained by them. However, the institutions are entitled to, and usually do, pass on this stamp duty charge to the account holder. The yield for the year 2000 from this charge was £9.11 million. I do not propose at present to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <P>Having made inquiries of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has advised that the human assisted reproduction unit in the Rotunda Hospital does not categorise patients according to nationality and therefore does not have information on the number of non-nationals who have applied for or are receiving IVF treatment. Furthermore, IVF is available to women with children, in cases where there is secondary infertility. The Western Health Board has advised that, in relation to University College Hospital Galway, there are approximately one to two inquiries per day for the fertility clinic and there are currently ten new patients booking places in the fertility clinic from the population of non-nationals seeking asylum. The board has also advised that this treatment is made available to women with children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that obstetric services at the Dublin maternity hospitals are under pressure. A number of factors have been identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; as contributing to this.</P>
      <P>The number of births in the eastern region has increased in recent years from 20,646 births in 1996 to 22,813 in the year 2000 with a further increase expected in 2001. This includes a high number of asylum seekers availing of obstetric services in the eastern region. It is expected that there will be about 3,000 births relating to asylum seekers in Dublin in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the eastern region. Approximately 10% of activity in the Dublin maternity hospitals relates to persons resident outside of the eastern region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin <Col N="1070" /> maternity hospitals that referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the women's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds. The ERHA acknowledges that in some cases there may be exceptions and are in discussions with the three maternity hospitals surrounding this issue. The ERHA is also contacting other health boards with a view to facilitating women to access maternity services in their local areas in keeping with a policy of regional self-sufficiency. However, services will continue to be provided to patients living outside the region who require access to specialised obstetric services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the discharge of patients, I have been informed by the ERHA that the average length of stay in the three Dublin maternity hospitals ranges from 3.26 days to 4.54 days.</P>
    <P>I wish to set the record straight in relation to the extent of the midwifery shortages in the Dublin area. Media reports of 110 midwifery posts vacant in the three Dublin maternity hospitals are incorrect. Information received by my Department on Monday indicates that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is actually 54 posts, when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses that have been employed by the hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the Dublin maternity hospitals in relation to the recruitment and retention of midwifes. This forum includes representatives of the three Dublin maternity hospitals, my Department, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the nursing unions. It will hold its first meeting on 19 October, and has been asked to report back to me as a matter of urgency. This forum will build on a number of initiatives already taken to recruit and retain midwives.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality obstetric service for the Eastern Region will continue to be of the upmost priority.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. I add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number, location and cost of kidney dialysis machines is not routinely collected by my Department. However, I have requested the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to collate the information and forward it to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to outline to the Deputy the policy position in relation to the wider development of renal services. I have identified renal services as one of the main acute hospital priorities for development. In this regard, I was pleased to provide additional funding of over £9 million &ndash; 11.43 million &ndash; over the past two years to increase capacity in this area. The prin<Col N="1073" /> ciples underpinning this investment are to ensure that haemo-dialysis is available on a regionally self-sufficient basis so that patients do not have to travel long distances to avail of it and to ensure an equitable availability of treatment choice for patients irrespective of their geographical location.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for further development of this important service. As a consequence, I will shortly be establishing a group to formulate a national strategy for renal services and to develop a framework for future service delivery which will build on the current investment programme.</P>

      <P>Under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, the terms of reference of a tribunal can only be amended where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation with the Attorney General on behalf of the relevant Minister, or where the tribunal itself has requested the amendment. At my request, the Attorney General initiated a statutory consultation process with the chairperson. On 16 October the chairperson furnished a detailed response to the Attorney General in which she states that she does not believe that it would be correct for her to consent to the suggested amendment of the terms of reference of the tribunal. I met with representatives of the society earlier today to brief them on the chairperson's response and I am now considering the situation in the light of that response. I have placed copies of the relevant correspondence in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members.</P>

      <P>The medical schools of the three constituent universities of the National University of Ireland in Dublin, Cork and Galway, Trinity College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland provide undergraduate medical training. There were 509 graduates from the five schools in 1999, the latest year for which such statistical information is readily available, broken down as follows: RCSI 149; TCD 82; NUIG 69; UCC 87 and UCD 122.</P>

      <P>The question of reviewing the quota arrangement is under consideration. In this context, the Deputy may be aware the Government decided, in April this year, to establish a national task force on medical manpower.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that parents are well informed about the health and medical treatment of their children. Parental consent is required for treatment. Clear communication with parents and guardians is a measure of good practice and in so far as it is in the interests of the child, parents should have ready access to records.</P>
      <P>Within statute, the general position is that access to the health record of a child must be in the best interests of the child. Parents have a qualified right of access in so far as that is the case. The Freedom of Information and Data Protection Acts create rights of access and also protect the privacy of the child.</P>
      <P>When parents seek such access under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, hospitals will grant it in accordance with the provisions of that Act. There are regulations and guidelines relating to access by parents and these are available on the website of the Information Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Where parents seek such access under the Data Protection Act, 1988, although there is no right of access, the data controller may release records to a parent as a person acting on behalf of or with the consent of the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act applies to all records held by health boards and public hospitals. The Data Protection Act applies to electronic records held by all hospitals, public and private.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71, as amended by Regulation (EC) 2000/83, is the co-ordinating regulation covering the referral of patients abroad for benefits in kind, including hospital treatment. This regulation requires that patients seeking hospital treatment in an EU member state other than their own, seek prior authorisation from their competent institution &ndash; in the ERHA or relevant health board in Ireland's case &ndash; prior to receiving this treatment. The most recent European Court of Justice rulings have not changed this position in that they reaffirm the necessity for a person seeking hospital treatment abroad to seek prior authorisation from the ERHA or relevant health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the European Court of Justice has ruled that due to the specific nature of hospital services member states should not be precluded from restricting the free movement of patients for the receipt of health care where such restrictions can be objectively justified. Three <Col N="1077" /> objective criteria set out by the European Court of Justice are: the &lsquo;risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system'; &lsquo;the objective of maintaining a balanced medical and hospital service open to all'; and &lsquo;the maintenance of treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory'.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the court has ruled that the granting of an authorisation must be subject to the treatment being regarded as &lsquo;normal' in the professional circles concerned and to the person's medical condition requiring that treatment. In that regard, authorisation cannot be refused on the grounds of the treatment not being &lsquo;normal' where it is considered that the treatment is tried and tested by international science. In addition, authorisation can only be refused on the grounds of lack of medical necessity where similar or equally effective treatment can be obtained without undue delay in the person's member state.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that a scheme of prior authorisation must be based &lsquo;on objective, non-discretionary criteria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities' discretion, so that it is not used arbitrarily'. The Department issued directions some time ago outlining the objective criteria which health boards must consider prior to referring patients abroad for treatment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the public orthodontic services, I have taken a number of steps to improve their delivery. Structural changes are being introduced and include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash;  is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the health boards are recruiting additional staff and engaging the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>The impact of this initiative will be carefully monitored to determine what other measures are required to increase the number of patients in treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120, £150 &ndash; 114.28, 152.37, 190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase, and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. Accordingly, the relevant regulations which provide the statutory basis for the use of bus lanes generally limit their use to buses and, in the case of with flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis using with flow bus lanes. Taxis are allowed to utilise that exemption only in the course of business. Following representations from parties representing hackney interests and other private hire operators, my Department undertook to review the regulations in question in consultation with an Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin Corporation. This review will be completed shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which his Department can justify putting a value of £40 per week on savings of £10,000 in respect of applicants for a non-contributory old age pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24695/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for old age (non-contributory) pension purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever the capital was moved from one investment option into another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a review undertaken by my Department, I made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital which came into effect from October of that year. This new method applies to <Col N="1084" /> all social assistance schemes other than supplementary welfare allowance. Up to October 2000, the first £2,000 (2,539.48) of capital was disregarded, the next £20,000 (25,394.76) was assessed at 7.5% and the balance was assessed at 15%.</P>
    <P>Under the new method the first £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 &ndash; of capital is disregarded; capital between £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 and £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; is assessed on the basis of £1 &ndash; 1.27 &ndash; weekly means for each £1,000 &ndash; 1,269.74 &ndash; of capital; capital between £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; and £30,000 &ndash; 38,092.14 &ndash; is assessed on the basis of £2 &ndash; 2.54 &ndash; weekly means for each £1,000 &ndash; 1,269.74 &ndash; of capital; and capital above £30,000 &ndash; 38,092.14 &ndash; is assessed on the basis of £4 &ndash; 5.08 &ndash; weekly means for each £1,000 &ndash; 1,269.74 &ndash; of capital.</P>
    <P>The revised arrangements introduced in 2000 considerably benefited both single and married old age non-contributory pensioners, by up to £22 &ndash; 27.93 &ndash; per week in the case of single pensioners and £33 &ndash; 41.90 &ndash; per week in the case of married pensioners.</P>
    <P>Currently, assuming that persons have no other means, a single pensioner with capital of up to £16,999 &ndash; 21,584.28 &ndash; will qualify for a full pension while single pensioners with capital of up to £47,999 &ndash; 60,946.16 &ndash; will qualify for a minimum pension. The equivalent figures for married pensioners are £33,999 &ndash; 43,169.83 &ndash; and £94,999 &ndash; 120,623.85 &ndash; respectively.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring in particular to the rate of assessment of capital in excess of £31,000 &ndash; 39,361.88. This must be seen in the context of the capital assessment arrangements as a whole and the total amount of capital which such a pensioner has. The new system continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons are compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Acts since 1988. They are eligible for the following social welfare benefits: widow's-widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory pension and old age contributory pension. Contributions payable by self-employed persons class S do not reckon for any short-term benefits under the Social Welfare Acts nor do they reckon for invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> The social insurance contributions payable by self-employed persons do not include any element in respect of short-term benefits or invalidity pension. An extension in the range of benefits payable to self-employed persons would involve, as a consequence, an appreciable increase in the rate of contributions payable.</P>
    <P>The issue of extending cover for invalidity pension was considered in 1993 by the then National Pensions Board which did not recommend extension of invalidity cover to the self-employed at that time. My Department has recently met with representative groups of certain self-employed persons to consider their submissions in this regard. Any such proposal would have financial implications for both the persons concerned and the social insurance fund.</P>

    <P>The figures do not incorporate the allocation and expenditure under the NDP of the national parks and wildlife service &ndash; NPWS &ndash; of my Department. It was not possible to break down the figures by county in the time available. However, I have instructed that the breakdown be provided and I will arrange for the material to be sent to the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>Note 2</P>
    <P>In the case of Waterways Ireland, it is not possible to allocate plant and machinery by county as this equipment is used on an inter-county basis as the work demands. The amount spent  &ndash; £70,000 &ndash; is not included in the overall totals provided.</P>

      <P>An Coimisiún le Rincí Gaelacha does not receive funding from my Department. I understand that An Coimisiún comes under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Conradh na Gaeilge is one of eight voluntary Irish language organisations in respect of which funding responsibility was transferred from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency of An Foras Teanga, the North-South language body, under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>I understand from Foras na Gaeilge that:</P>
      <P>(1) the board of Foras na Gaeilge has authorised funding for Conradh na Gaeilge as follows:</P>
      <P>2000:Core funding £202,000</P>

      <P>As I stated in that reply, the threat of major terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, and there is a heightened state of security awareness, particularly in relation to vital strategic locations. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be counter-productive for me to give details of the specific security arrangements in place.</P>

    <P>In addition, an amount of activity under this measure will have national application. This includes support for the national framework committee to develop family friendly initiatives at the level of the enterprise. Individual projects in the BMW Region have yet to be identified under this strand and under the strand for gender proofing of personnel policies.</P>
    <P>Expenditure to date on the measure in the BMW region is £69,432 &ndash; 88,160. It is anticipated that expenditure in all areas of the measure <Col N="1089" /> will increase in the second half of 2001 as the projects commence activity.</P>
    <P>Under the employment and human resources operational programme, 2000-2006, the NDP gender equality unit has been allocated funding of 5.36 million. Most of the expenditure incurred under this measure relates to staffing costs which arise in the Southern and Eastern Region. However, to date, 18,500 has been spent in the BMW region, 16,500 in Roscommon and 2,000 in Offaly.</P>
    <P>On the crime prevention measure, the funding allocated to prisons services training for the BMW region for the period 2000-01 was £2.58 million, 3.27 million. A total of £88,372 &ndash; 110,000 &ndash; has been spent to date all of which was incurred in the Midlands Prison, County Laois. The full roll-out of the prisoner training programme throughout the region is under way.</P>
    <P>The funding allocated to probation and welfare for the BMW region for the year 2000-01 was £425,000 &ndash; 540,000. The funding does not have a strict county allocation as it is intended to support the re-integration of ex-offenders and others as needs arise. A total expenditure of £178,950 &ndash; 227,000 &ndash; has been incurred to date in supporting individuals into employment and further education and training throughout the region and in providing residential treatment services in counties Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo and Galway.</P>
    <P>The expenditure allocated at county level to date under the Garda youth diversion programme is set out in the following table. A further allocation may occur in respect of these projects during 200,1 subject to submission of detailed accounts.</P>

      <P>The person in question was originally admitted to the State as a visitor. Following her marriage to an Irish national in October 2000, she was granted permission to remain on that basis until November 2001. This does not amount to &ldquo;permanent residency&rdquo;, but it is open to her to apply for a renewal of the permission to remain and the standard procedure would be for the permission to be renewed for a further five years initially.</P>
      <P>As a matter of policy, persons who have permission to remain in the State as the spouse of an Irish national are exempt from the requirements specified in Irish immigration law in relation to work permits and business permission. There are, however, no provisions in Irish immigration law specifying the educational entitlements of such a person at a private third level educational establishment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the second annual public private partnership-private finance initiative global summit took place at the Burlington Hotel between 10 and 12 October 2001. The summit attracted a number of protesters. In this regard, I am informed that during the course of the evening a number of protesters attempted to force their way into the hotel where the conference was being held.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that gardaí on duty at the hotel were subjected to both verbal and physical abuse which included the throwing of eggs, flour, paint, cans of beans and placards. A supermarket trolley was repeatedly pushed into gardaí while they attempted to prevent the protesters from entering the hotel. Garda reinforcements arrived and succeeded in moving the protesters away from the entrance to the hotel.</P>
      <P>I understand that the protesters were asked on a number of occasions to desist and leave the area peacefully. These requests were ignored and the protesters again made their way to the front of the hotel where they engaged in a sit down protest. A garda was struck on the head by one of the protesters with a flagpole and received a cut over his eye. The gardaí, fearing an escalation of unruly behaviour and concerned for the safety of people inside the hotel, began to forcibly remove people from the front entrance of the hotel and were forced to draw their batons because of continuous resistance by the protesters. I am informed by the Garda authorities that this was an operational decision taken in the light of the prevailing circumstances at the time. In the circumstances I am not aware of any grounds which would warrant my ordering a further investigation into this matter.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 protesters were arrested for public order offences during the incident, one of whom was in possession of a video camera. This video camera is being retained by the Garda for evidential purposes, and I am assured that it will be returned to its owner when investigations have been concluded.</P>

In 1997, 107 current or former asylum applicants were granted permission to remain on the basis of their parentage of an Irish citizen. Figures are not available for the number of persons other than current or former asylum seekers granted permission to remain on this basis in 1997.</P>

    <P>I should state that, while the amount collected, as set out in the tabular statement, is principally moneys collected in respect of on the spot speeding fines, I have also been informed by Garda authorities that it is not possible to differentiate between money collected for fines on the spot for speeding and for other offences. Additional money would have been collected through the courts in respect of fines on the spot cases which were the subject of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in relation to the amount collected in respect of 2001 to date, fines imposed recently are still in the process of being collected. A true total for the amount collected for the year 2001 to date will not emerge until early next year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Border Midland and Western region was designated in 1999 as an Objective One region. In general, programmes in the education sector are delivered on a national basis. My Department has provided provisional expenditure returns in respect of all measures, funded under the national development plan, for both regions, to the respective operational programme managing authorities. The provisional expenditure returns in respect of the BMW region, for all programmes funded under the 2000-06 NDP, are as follows: </P>
      <P Just="Center">January-December 2000 &ndash; £138.3 million &ndash; 175.7 million;</P>
      <P Just="Center">January-June 2001 &ndash; £80.9 million &ndash; 102.7 million.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific information requested by the Deputy on expenditure at county level, due to the wide range of programmes in the education sector it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested. However, if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific programme, I will be happy to obtain the information for her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Capitation grants constitute the main form of Government funding for primary schools with a standard capitation grant of £75.50 &ndash; 95.87 &ndash; applying in the last school year. Capitation funding is intended to contribute to the cost of such items as heating, lighting, cleaning, general upkeep and teaching aids required in schools. This payment is made in respect of all children enrolled in ordinary classes in a school and would include any special needs children who are enrolled on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from £278.50 &ndash; 353.62 &ndash; to £451.50 &ndash; 573.29 &ndash; per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. Children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools would generally have a level of special need which renders them unable to attend ordinary national schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>The difference in the level of capitation funding attracted by pupils attending special schools or special classes and those attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis arises from the reduced number of pupils involved in each special classroom situation.</P>
      <P>The number of children per classroom in special schools and special classes will be significantly lower than the number in an ordinary national school classroom. However, the general operating costs arising in both circumstances, in terms of light, heating, etc., will not be reduced because of the lesser number of pupils in attendance. As a consequence, the level of funding attracted by each child attending a special class needs to be correspondingly greater than the norm in order to meet the standard operating costs which will continue to be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> For example, a special class for children with a mild general learning disability will cater for a maximum of 11 children. Such a classroom would give rise to the same ongoing operating costs as an ordinary classroom in a national school which would cater for a significantly higher number of pupils. It is necessary therefore that the special class children attract a correspondingly higher rate of capitation funding in order to meet the costs involved. In the case of children with special needs, attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis, such additional capitation costs would not apply.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between arrangements relating to the funding of schools' ongoing operating costs and funding requirements that might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires special equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment.</P>
    <P>I also assure the Deputy that my Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised equipment for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system.</P>
    <P>Should the school referred to by the Deputy wish to apply for additional funding for special equipment such an application should be made through its local inspector.</P>

      <P>The medical schools of the three constituent universities of the National University of Ireland at Dublin, Cork and Galway, Trinity College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland provide undergraduate medical training. There were 509 graduates from the five schools in 1999, the latest year for which such statistical information is readily available, broken down as follows: RCSI 149; TCD 82; NUIG 69; UCC 87 and UCD 122.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the announcement of two new medical schools in the UK. In relation to our medical schools, the annual intake to undergraduate medical programmes is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980-81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The question of reviewing the quota arrangement is under consideration. In this context, the Deputy may be aware the Government decided, in April of this year, to establish a national task force on medical manpower. One of the three project groups, which will report to the steering group of the task force will specifically deal with medical education and training. This project group will look at developing structures for medical education, training and flexible working arrangements in the most effective and efficient way possible.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which he will allocate community employment funding to primary and secondary schools; if this funding may be used for additional support staff other than secretarial and caretaking; if schools which already have a secretary and caretaker under the 1978-1979 scheme will receive funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>Schools which already have the services of a full-time secretary or caretaker employed under my Department's 1978-79 scheme are not eligible for additional funding towards ancillary services as outlined above as the total cost of these posts is met by my Department. However, schools that share the services of a secretary or caretaker under the above scheme are being written to by my Department with proposals to allocate the services of the shared secretary or caretaker to one school and to assist the other school by means of the ancillary services grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allo<Col N="1107" /> cated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 &ndash; 25.40 &ndash; per pupil to £50 &ndash; 63.49 &ndash; per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil next September. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 &ndash; 5,078.96 &ndash; to £14,000 &ndash; 17,776.33 &ndash; per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 &ndash; to £35,000 &ndash; 44,440.83 &ndash; each year. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash; per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to maximum of £19,250 &ndash; 24,442.46 &ndash; per school, they will, under this new scheme, also receive £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil bringing their combined total for a 500 pupil school to £54,250 &ndash; 68,883.30 &ndash; per year.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade <Col N="1108" /> and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>I initially proposed the establishment of a commission on education and learning earlier this year and work is now at an advanced stage within my Department on draft terms of reference for the commission. These will cover a wide range of issues, including legal and management structures, developments in education and learning, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation, support systems for schools and teachers and lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>I will consult shortly with the education partners on the terms of reference, composition and timescale of the commission. It is my intention that the commission would be established once these consultations are completed and I will announce the chairperson and members of the commission at that time, as well as the timeframe for the completion of the commission's report.</P>
