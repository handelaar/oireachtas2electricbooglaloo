      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. Regarding the first topic, I have received notices from Deputies Jim Higgins, Naughten, Stanton and Sargent.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the further industrial action tomorrow by Aer Lingus clerical staff which for the second weekend in succession will again ground virtually all Aer Lingus flights; the major inconvenience for up to 20,000 passengers; the failure of the industrial relations machinery to resolve this dispute; the damage being caused to the reputation and economy of both the company and the country; and the urgent need for an all out effort by the Government to find a solution to this dispute.</P>

      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent economic importance, namely, the ongoing industrial relations problems in Aer Lingus and the decision by the company's clerical staff to threaten further industrial action which will not only have a detrimental effect on the company but seriously damage our tourism sector, especially in light of the recent crisis facing the sector due to the foot and mouth disease and the severe adverse impact such industrial unrest would have on the planned investment by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to promote Ireland abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an urgent and important matter of public interest requiring immediate consideration, namely, the <Col N="2" /> strike at Aer Lingus which is to begin at midnight tonight and which will ground all Aer Lingus planes for 24 hours and which will seriously inconvenience the travelling public.</P>

      <P>I request, under Standing Order 31, that the business of Dáil Éireann be adjourned to hear how the Government needs to engage with the union and management at Aer Lingus, given the history of low wages borne by Aer Lingus operatives and the huge disruption being visited upon over 20,000 passengers in the run-up to Easter as a result of ongoing industrial action in the company.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 26a shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceeding on the resumed Report and Final Stages of <Col N="3" /> No. 49 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes or 11.30 a.m., whichever is the sooner, by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Education and Science; (3) Second and Remaining Stages of No. 6 shall be taken today; and (i) the proceedings on Second Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; Members may share time; a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes and (ii) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Public Enterprise; (4) questions shall be taken today at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. I can read the proposal. However, there is a tradition that we can ask for clarity on the Order of Business before we agree to a motion because the Government's intention will determine whether we can agree to the schedule as published. Will the Minister indicate whether a guillotine will be applied next week to the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001? If, as I now understand, there is to be no guillotine will the supporting legislation I requested yesterday be published before Second Stage is concluded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inappropriate that Second Stage of the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, should be taken without the Government first publishing in draft the additional legislation the proposal envisages would be enacted should the referendum be successful. Will the Minister indicate if it is intended to publish the legislation in draft before commencement of next Tuesday's debate? If not, I suggest that Second Stage of the Bill should not commence until the draft legislation accompanying it is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware of a Supreme Court decision yesterday which finds that the Government is seriously in error in not providing Irish language versions of legislation to the public. The judgment states that if a Bill is signed by the President in one official language it must be immediately made available in the other. Has the Minister taken this into account in proposing the Order of Business? Does he consider that the implications of this judgment will require versions of Bills in both official languages to be put before the House? Has the Government considered whether this judgment will inhibit the House from doing business over the coming weeks until the appropriate translation provisions are put in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education and Science is present because he represents a north-side constituency close to Dublin Airport. There will be chaos again at the airport tomorrow. All Aer Lingus flights will be strike bound for 24 hours. The other main airports in Cork and Shannon will also be affected. This is the second weekend that travel plans made by tens of thousands of citizens will have to be cancelled. Aer Lingus will lose £3 million on a 24 day strike and the image of the company will be further blemished. In addition, the tourism industry, which is so adversely affected by the foot and mouth disease crisis, will be further damaged by this action.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if the Cabinet or a Cabinet sub-committee has discussed the regular cancellation of Aer Lingus flights? Will he indicate if there is any possibility that it will intervene to ensure that this dispute is resolved as we go into the main tourism season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The second day of the Aer Lingus dispute threatens 20,000 passengers and a very fragile tourism industry. It is part of a pattern of industrial disputes. An even more ominous dispute is looming in the ESB and Guinness workers are on notice to strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of industrial disputes, does the Government have a programme for defusing situations or must we jump from strike to strike, crippling our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by the two Leaders on behalf of both parties. It is a very serious situation and it will cause serious disruption to passengers and to Aer Lingus. I assure the Deputies that every effort is being made to resolve the dispute. The Labour Court met with Aer Lingus and SIPTU on Thursday, 29 March, following an initial intervention by the PFF implementation body. The purpose of the meeting was to establish the main issues in dispute between the parties concerned. However, no progress was made in those discussions and SIPTU was not prepared to call off its planned strike.</P>
      <P>Talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission took place on Monday, 2 April. Despite five hours of talks, no progress was made. Aer Lingus and SIPTU have agree to refer the matter back to the Labour Court. The Labour Court intervention would require the cancellation of the planned action on Friday and in this regard the national implementation body met with the senior representatives from SIPTU on the night of Tuesday, 3 April. Arising from that meeting, a informal meeting took place yesterday evening between SIPTU and the group chief executive of Aer Lingus. However no progress was made and as a result the planned industrial action for Friday seems likely to proceed.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to both sides to go to the Labour Court, suspend the action and have the matters resolved through the aegis of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister appreciates the enormous disruption this is causing at a personal level. I am aware of a young person who, during the last strike, travelled from Australia to a family funeral and could not get out of London for a whole day. That is just one example of the disruption which is being caused. Is the Minister aware that there seems to be a series of rolling disputes in Aer Lingus? Would it not be better if the industrial relations machinery of the State could be used to get an overall solution rather than taking the disputes <i>seriatem</i> at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position is that there is urgent activity taking place. The Labour Court is making its industrial relations facilities available. Unless we work through the industrial <Col N="7" /> relations procedures we will not get a solution. I appreciate the issues raised by the Deputy. The difficulties are very severe and it is causing great distress to a great number of people. The machinery is in place and I would appeal to those involved on both sides to use it and to set aside the dispute while the matter is resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to outline the Government response, if any, to the refusal of the major banks to cash cheques over the counter in branches. Would he accept that many elderly people, students and people on social welfare do not have bank accounts and, indeed, many workers do not have a current account, a deposit account or an account with a credit union? Would he accept that this is an unacceptable imposition on the community in the light of the banks' responsibilities? Will he ensure that the State, which has considerable muscle in relation to its own accounts, seeks to have this situation reversed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the view of the Minister that some of the banks are trying to force people to open bank accounts to increase business? In view of the recommendations of Mr. Phil Flynn's report on the post office being on the verge of bankruptcy, would the Minister give a commitment that the Government will ensure that post offices will be allowed to provide banking services, particularly to those people who do not do business in the main banks at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious situation, especially for people who do not use the electronic funds transfer system. Obviously increasing numbers are doing that and it would appear to be an effort to streamline the position from the banks' point of view. It is important that the banks take into account the fact that they work within the country as part of the community and as part of our society. I would certainly hope that they would take that into account in the arrangements which they are proposing at present because it would appear, as the Deputies have said, that they will create a considerable amount of difficulty for that percentage of people who have not adopted that system to date.</P>
      <P>Efforts have been made through the banks to ensure that, for instance, the payments through the Paymaster General will be recognised and accepted, but in effect this seems to have broken down. There was some agreement about it but it seems to have been set aside at this stage.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue. It is a matter on which everybody concerned, be they involved in commercial activity or government, should make their views clearly known to the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is entirely unacceptable that the major banks, who make profits of £1 billion in this economy and <Col N="8" /> who should be more responsible after the findings of the DIRT inquiry, have a debt to this society? Will he, on behalf of the Government, assure the House that the economic might of the accounts in the control of the Government and Government agencies will be used as leverage to reverse this anti-social decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with the banks to ensure that its cheques are cashed. Of course there are many things happening in the marketplace where supermarkets are cashing many of the cheques. However, I accept it is a serious matter.</P>

      <P>I proposed originally that we would delete the <i>ex parte </i>requirement because it seems wrong that a teacher could be struck off without even being informed of an application being made to the High Court. On Committee Stage the Minister said there would be difficulties with that. If the teacher concerned was abroad there might be difficulty in serving notice to the teacher and that would hold up proceedings. I do not accept that, because legal proceedings can be served on people at their last address and abroad if necessary. To compromise I am willing to remove that and leave it that the hearing would take place unnoticed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's concerns but believe this Bill provides ample protection for the teacher. Section 42 provides that the registered teacher be provided with a copy of the application for inquiry and be invited to make a submission in writing to the investigating committee. The decision of the investigating committee will be forwarded in writing to the registered teacher as well as any subsequent decision of the disciplinary committee. In this way the teacher will be fully informed and aware of the procedures that will be used by the Teaching Council, and in <Col N="16" /> particular the disciplinary committee, in taking any action. It is not therefore necessary to once again serve notice on the teacher of its intentions. This would be in the context of a case where unfitness to teach had already been proven and there was a necessity to ensure that the teacher was no longer entitled to remain as a fully registered teacher. All of these procedures are designed to ensure that the matter is concluded as quickly as possible and the rights of all parties are protected throughout. Both the Nurses Act and the Medical Practitioners Act use this provision.</P>

      <P>I accept that action should be taken as quickly as possible but there is the matter of due process. It is a basic right that if an application is being made to the High Court to strike off a teacher that teacher should at least be sent notice of it. It seems extraordinary that an application with such serious implications could be made without the knowledge of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>I would like to know why the Minister is seeking to limit the right of appeal to the Supreme Court. This probably sets a bad precedent.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure that matters are brought to finality by a decision of the High Court. This is necessary to ensure the council does not become embroiled in lengthy court actions that would not change the <Col N="17" /> material decision. Any appeals following the provisions of this section would only be allowed on a point of law and would not be a complete reinvestigation of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a similar provision to provisions in other Acts. Basically it is to have the High Court as the final arbiter.

      <P>It would appear that this would be the first judicial involvement. Any appeal against the decision of the council goes straight to the High Court so it is the first court involved in adjudicating on the issue. It is likely that the stakes will be extraordinarily high in terms of issues to be adjudicated on where someone feels strongly enough to take it to the High Court. If there is a dispute in terms of the facts rather than points of law we should not deny access to the courts. It is a fundamental cornerstone of our democracy that everybody has equal access to the law and stands equal before the law. It is unworthy of the legislation, which is welcome and well constructed in general, that we should seek to stymie any aggrieved party's access to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We have argued the point about consultation since the outset and repeatedly and regrettably the Minister has refused to take it on board, notwithstanding the fact that partnership in education between the Department and its employees, teachers and students and parents and teachers is essential. Trade unions representing teachers are critical players in education and for the Minister to again turn his back on the principle of consultation is regrettable. Such provision is more important in this than in previous sections as there is a backdoor provision for the assignment of additional functions to the Teaching Council. This could be a Pandora's box. I would hate to see it being used as an underhand way of imposing additional functions which have not been agreed with the wide range of parties consulted in the gestation of the Bill. We spoke about the need for consultation in other sections, but it is absolutely essential here. The Minister may well say that the teacher unions have X number of members on the council, but I remind him that he said that once they become members of the council they are not expected to solely wear their teacher's hat, but are obliged to have a broader view on matters before the council. For that reason the partners, in particular the teacher unions which represent all employees, should be consulted about any additional functions to be assigned to the Teaching Council. I urge the Minister to, at least, consult the teacher unions, even if he does not agree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo in part what Deputy Creed said, namely, that the trade unions nominate members of the council. We must remember, however, that the council exists to represent the professional side and will be solely concerned with the qualitative and professional aspects of education, while negotiating on conditions of service, salaries and pensions will continue to be a major concern of the teacher unions. I do not see the reason, therefore, it would be necessary, in this instance, to consult them. The Minister is entitled to confer on the council any additional functions or modify existing functions of the council as he sees fit. As Minister, I have a responsibility to ensure the working of the council continues to develop.</P>
      <P>The section makes provision for the Minister to consult the council prior to making any changes to its functions and its views will be addressed at that point. The teacher unions have representation on the council, not to act as members of the trade union on the board of the council but rather as wider representatives of the teaching profession who through their experience and expertise will enrich the council. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>We teased this issue out on a number of occasions. As matters stand, the Minister would not consider introducing any changes which would have an impact on the conditions of teachers without consulting the teacher unions. <Col N="19" /> There is a reasonably well established partnership between the Department of Education and Science and the teacher unions. The establishment of the council complicates that relationship to some extent. Many issues concerning conditions of employment and professional matters will come within the remit of the council which will have industrial relations implications. One cannot, therefore, isolate matters into professional issues and say that they are ones for the council or industrial relations issues and say that they are ones for the teacher unions. There is a degree of overlap in most issues.</P>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is that the Minister should, on the basis of good practice and courtesy, consult the teacher unions on any changes to the functions of the council. The danger with which we are all concerned is that the council might be used as a way of short circuiting the normal consultation procedures between the Department and the teacher unions. That is the reason we want to specify in the Bill that consulting the council does not remove the responsibility of the Minister to consult with the teacher unions. It is important that we are clear about the new relationships which will develop as soon as the Teaching Council has been established. There has been good consultation in the establishment of the council, but once it is up and running it is important that we maintain consultation with the teacher unions, which is a fair and reasonable proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor his predecessor needs to be reminded of the long gestation of the Bill and the broad consultation which took place in framing it. There is, however, a backdoor mechanism here for the Minister to foist additional responsibilities on the council. There is provision for consultation with the council any other Minister, but not with the trade unions in considering additional functions for the council. We are not saying that agreement has to be reached with the trade unions, but that they should be consulted. It is a matter of common courtesy as much as anything else, and it is particularly important in this section as we are talking about unforeseen additional functions which the council may be asked to take on board. It would be wise for the Minister to agree to consult prior to requesting the council to take on board additional functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the steering committee deals extensively with this matter and makes the point that the Teaching Council will solely be concerned with the qualitative and professional matters within its remit, whereas negotiating on conditions of service, salaries and pensions will continue to be a major concern for teacher unions. The Education Act places an onus on the Minister, where practicable, to consult them. There can be issues, however, on which it would not be prudent to consult them, and the section <Col N="20" /> is framed to cover such circumstances. There is plenty of provision otherwise for consulting the unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a 5% employee shareholding scheme in the ESB without waiting for the passage of legislation to change the status of the company from a statutory corporation to a plc under the Companies Acts. The 5% shareholding for staff of the ESB was provided for in the cost and competitiveness review &ndash; CCR &ndash; agreement between my Department, ESB management and unions. The current Bill will provide the necessary legal basis to allow that commitment to be honoured. The tripartite CCR agreement was designed to prepare the ESB for competition. The agreement was submitted to and approved by the previous Government on 3 April 1996. Over the following three years, the 2000 voluntary staff exits provided for in the agreement were achieved as well as the targeted cost savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB has been setting aside 5% of the company's annual profits for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 for the purpose of the employee sharehold<Col N="21" /> ing scheme. A total of £46.8 million currently stands in a special reserve in the company's balance sheet, to be passed to the trustees of the employee shareholding scheme when it is established shortly.</P>
    <P>At present, ESB management and unions are finalising negotiations on a further major change programme for the company before the electricity market opens fully to competition in 2005. The new round of change derives from the February 2000 tripartite agreement between my Department and ESB management and unions. This sets out a framework for the new electricity industry in a competitive environment. The establishment of the employee shareholding scheme and allocation of shares to staff will be an important element in promoting this new round of change.</P>
    <P>For some time now, the ESB and my Department have been working on a proposal to create &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; shares under existing ESB legislation. The Attorney General recently deemed that proposal to be <i>ultra vires</i> the provisions of section 4 of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1954, as that Act empowers the ESB to issue debentures or stock to the public but only for the purpose of raising borrowings. The Attorney General has advised therefore that the ESB proposal requires amending legislation to render it <i>intra vires</i> existing ESB legislation. The Bill now before the House will authorise the board to create and issue capital stock representing its net assets and permit the allocation of not more than 5% to the staff, the balance going to the Minister for Finance. The allocation to staff would thus fulfil the commitment made in the original 1996 CCR agreement.</P>
    <P>The holders of such stock will enjoy dividend, voting rights and board representation. These rights and obligations will be set out in regulations to be made by the board with prior ministerial consent, such regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for the customary 21 days. The Bill provides that the capital stock created shall carry the right of conversion into ordinary share capital once the ESB is established as a plc. under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The ESB has operated under a break-even mandate since its establishment in 1927. This is enshrined in section 21 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927. Surpluses recorded by the ESB over the years have been ploughed back into the business. I would like to draw the attention of the House to section 8 of the Bill which provides for the repeal of section 21 of the 1927 Act and the effective termination of the board's break-even mandate. This is an important and historic change.</P>
    <P>The repeal of the break-even mandate is now a logical and necessary requirement as the board prepares to transfer 5% of its worth to its workforce. The &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; shares provided for in this Bill will carry the normal entitlement to dividends for both staff and the State. This in turn requires that legal provision be made for profits, out of <Col N="22" /> which dividends would flow, and legal recognition of profit-making by the ESB inevitably requires repeal of the break-even mandate. The continuation of the break-even mandate is, in any event, no longer tenable in a liberalised market where the ESB becomes a player like other players in the market and must be allowed the same level playing field as other commercial players, including the legal right to make a profit. The repeal of the break-even mandate will effectively bring the ESB into the 21st century from a commercial operating perspective.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the 1927 Act specifies that electricity prices are to be set at a level consistent with the achievement of a break-even mandate taking one year with another. The repeal of this provision will not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the ESB in relation to electricity prices. Regulation 31 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 445 of 2000) gives the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation the power to examine electricity charges to franchise customers, in effect, domestic consumers, and the costs underlying such charges and the right to issue directions to the ESB regarding either the nature or amount of any charge or proposed charge.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provision achieves two effects. First, it affords protection to electricity customers against the possibility of excessively high electricity charges. At the same time, it allows the ESB to argue its case before an independent regulator for a reasonable level of charges, including, in particular, a rate of return sufficient to service its borrowings and remunerate its investment programme. The section aims to achieve, through the vehicle of an independent regulator, a proper balance between electricity consumers on the one hand and the rights of the ESB as a commercial player on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The House had a very useful and wide-ranging debate in Private Members' time last week about electricity and energy matters generally. I do not propose to go over again all the ground covered in that debate. However, it might be useful for me to present a short overview of the electricity sector in Ireland at present and ESB's role in it.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, 30% of the electricity market has been opened to competition since 19 February 2000. The milestone tripartite agreement, signed between my Department and ESB management and unions in February of last year, provides for further liberalisation of the market to 40% in 2002 and full market opening in 2005.</P>
    <P>The electricity sector in Ireland continues to experience high growth in demand. The ESB has signed up over 200,000 additional customers over the past five years, while the number of units purchased has gone up by over 30% in the same period. These are the highest rates of growth in the western OECD. I gave the House details last week of the massive investment, totalling over 2 billion, which the ESB and EirGrid will be undertaking over the next five years, to provide the <Col N="23" /> country with an ongoing electricity infrastructure to international standard.</P>
    <P>The tripartite agreement of last year committed the State, among other things, to ongoing shareholder support for the ESB, general shareholder support for the company's international growth strategy, a robust but reasonable transition arrangement for the ESB prior to full opening of the electricity market in 2005, the ESB to retain ownership of the transmission and distribution system, and a public service levy to compensate the ESB for uncompetitive obligations, including the operation of peat stations.</P>
    <P>In return for this, the management and union sides committed themselves to a further major round of change and transformation, the ongoing provision of a modern electricity infrastructure in Ireland and, for that latter purpose, agreement to the use of outside contractors. The rejection earlier this year by ESB network technicians of new work practices and outsourcing was a severe setback. As I said in the House last week, the management and unions in the ESB are working intensively to achieve a turnaround in that situation and their efforts deserve support.</P>
    <P>In the establishment of EirGrid last year, the ESB asked for, and was allowed to retain ownership of the transmission assets. The company is also the owner of the country's distribution network. Under the tripartite agreement, responsibility for the physical upgrading, maintenance and extension of these networks falls squarely on the ESB and the onus for delivery of the new investment programme also rests with the company. I should make clear to the House that the outsourcing arrangement poses no threat to ESB workers. The investment programme is of a scale sufficient to keep all ESB network staff, as well as outside contractors, fully employed for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I have provided Deputies with a list of the key milestones since 1996 in legislation concerning the ESB. I commend the Bill to the House and I am happy to participate in the debate on it.</P>

        <b>:</b> While I welcome the Bill I am at a total loss as to the reason a simple Bill, which commands support from all sides of the House, has taken so long to prepare and publish. The delay in bringing forward the legislation giving the 5% shareholding to ESB employees has been one of the main bones of contention in blocking plans for redundancies at the midland power stations. The concept of giving a share in the ownership of companies, whether public or private, is supported by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the Fine Gael Private Members' motion last week, speakers were rightly loud in their praise of the contribution of ESB workers to the welfare of the company from its inception to the present day. However, calling workers stakeholders does not make them stakeholders. The most effective and tangible way to encourage active participation by employees, the <Col N="24" /> way to get the best from them, is to make them shareholders in the company. Partnership has been one of the success stories of the ESB over the years. Giving an ownership stake to employees helps to develop the partnership approach even further. It also helps to create a collective determination to improve the company's customer service, its quality and its commercial success. I hope the ESB will build further on this partnership approach based on trust, mutual respect and common interest.</P>
    <P>Never did such a company need such a spirit to imbue it as the ESB does. The present time is one of enormous change and challenge for the company. Its monopolistic position in the electricity market is being dismantled. This has been eroded by the opening up of 28% of the market since February 2000. It will be dismantled further with the arrival of full liberalisation by 2005. At a time when the ESB needs to be at its most organised, alert, competitive and confident, it is far from fighting fit.</P>
    <P>There is huge uncertainty. The issue of privatisation was badly handled by company management. The push by management for the ESB to be floated despite the unions calling for that to be delayed was ill-judged. The unions argued convincingly that the ESB is a long way from ready for the markets, and they questioned the quality of the management The board also took the view that the company is not ready for the markets.</P>
    <P>Apart from the readiness of the company for privatisation, privatising such a key component of the country's national infrastructure is a serious issue. This must be resolved by the Government and, as owner of the company, it should set out its stall. Is the Government considering privatisation of the ESB? Is that issue off the agenda or only off it in the short-term? Are we talking about full privatisation or part-privatisation?</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that much of the enthusiasm for privatisation and deregulation of key utilities has waned. One notes the comments which emanated from Stockholm last week on the privatisation disaster in California which has resulted in the residents of Silicon Valley having to resort to candles, torches and diesel generators. This has increased anxiety and scepticism. It is asked whether there is a danger that companies which have embraced the liberalised market could well decide to pull out for a variety of reasons such as insolvency, market changes, change of ownership or richer pickings elsewhere. This would leave consumers literally in the dark.</P>
    <P>What protection will there be if such a situation arises? The Government needs to carry out a major re-evaluation of the electricity situation. There are lingering memories of the disaster for shareholders of the Eircom flotation where shares were over-priced, over-pushed and over-sold. What was learned from the Eircom saga? </P>
    <P>Another area of uncertainty is the decision by the company to reduce numbers by 2,000 before June 2001. The impact on the company will be <Col N="25" /> huge in that almost 25% of the total workforce of 8,500 are to be let go in a £300 million deal. In the light of the possible power crisis, caused by question marks over power generation and definite deficiencies in the grid, surely these employees should be retained as part of an emergency programme to upgrade the transmission system within a two year timeframe. The Minister has spoken about the £2 billion plan for the upgrading of the national grid. How can that investment be delivered if the company lets 2,000, or 25%, of its core staff go? That issue is relevant in view of the fact that the ESB insisted on retaining ownership of the grid while at the same time management of the system comes under the remit of the CER.</P>
    <P>A further cloud of uncertainty hangs over the company. The dual threat of industrial action from SIPTU and the ESB Officers Association is very serious. Both unions are seeking a 28% pay increase on top of the terms of the PPF. All indications are that unless the issue is resolved major power cuts may occur in Easter week. All tried and trusted industrial relations procedures have failed to reach agreement. Unless a compromise is found, blackouts seem inevitable.</P>
    <P>This is extremely serious. Widespread power cuts on top of the foot and mouth crisis, the major fall-off in jobs in the computer and technology area and the layoffs in tourism would have a crippling effect on an economy which is quickly degenerating from a gallop to a crawl. Strikes involving power cuts will send a shiver down the spine of IDA Ireland as it attempts to attract foreign investors.</P>
    <P>The past two years have seen a worrying trend develop. One of the foundations of the Celtic tiger success was the stable industrial relations climate that this country offered and could almost guarantee. That stability is no longer there. We are witnessing the dismemberment of the partnership process. Ironically, the major problem is not in the private sector but in the public service and semi-State sector. In Aer Lingus, every group within the company has engaged in industrial action in the past six months. While it was assumed that overall settlements were in place, phase two action has begun, with clerical staff closing the company last Friday and they intend to do so again tomorrow.</P>
    <P>At Iarnród Éireann, a locomotive drivers' strike last summer paralysed mainline services and brought havoc to the economy of the regions. It now looks as if there may be a replay of that dispute with ILDA set to withdraw labour if new rosters are introduced. The Garda, nurses and teachers have been on strike and it is clear that the national implementation body put together over four months ago to defend the PPF is ineffectual. From an ESB perspective we need a re-organisation and a re-energising. Unless the company gets its act together quickly it will not meet the necessary challenges, let alone avail of the opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House. In general terms I welcome it. The Bill arises from a decision made in 1994 in the cost and competitive review process in the ESB, whereby employees of the ESB were entitled to a 5% shareholding in their own company. That was part of the deal. It is important that this part of the deal be enforced because the long delay in doing so has had an adverse effect on industrial relations within the ESB. The Government was required to deliver this part of the deal. It was seen by the trade unions as a measure of bad faith that it was not delivered in good time. A delay from 1994 to 2001 could not be seen as good time.</P>
      <P>A number of things is attendant on a Government decision to legislate for the 5% shareholding. One, which was referred to by the Minister, is an agreement on outsourcing. Of the follow-on agreements which were required, one was partly achieved and others were left in abeyance because of lack of action on the shareholding agreement. This has created a feeling in the ESB that the Government will not deliver its side of the bargain. The employees have delivered their side of the agreement in large measure and management has done its share. The agreement by the Opposition to deal with this legislation with minimal debate and probably without a division is a measure of our concern that this matter should be dealt with now.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister was waiting in hope &ndash; or perhaps hopelessly &ndash; for agreement on some form of privatisation. There is no chance of that occurring. The only people remaining who are now in favour of privatisation are senior management in the ESB. The Minister is not in favour of it, despite her protestations to the contrary. Senior managers are in favour of privatisation because they suffer from the Alfie Kane syndrome, a disease senior managers get when they see millions of pounds of public money being transferred into their wallets. This is a cute disease with all sorts of side effects. People who suffer from it speak of their concern for the greater common good rather than the size of their own wallets. Senior ESB managers are still doing this, despite the fact that the Minister appears to have made a decision to park this issue. I have asked her, rather than merely park it to examine the issue to see if it is the best thing for Ireland Incorporated and the citizens of Ireland to lose control of the company. I do not want the Alfie Kane syndrome to win out. I know of no other pressure being applied to the Minister to proceed with privatisation and I urge her to reject the pressure of senior management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Higgins when he says the ESB is not ready for the market. The company is not ready for privatisation but it is ready to compete. In fact, the ESB is competing so well that the super-generators which were expected to ruin the ESB have been seen off. This may not be entirely a good thing for the consumer, if competition is a good thing. This is a question which <Col N="27" /> might also be re-examined because we have seen the effect of competition in California. The ESB is ready for the market.</P>
    <P>The issue of combined heat and power has been introduced into the Bill. When the Opposition agrees to deal with a Bill quickly it is bad practice for the Government to introduce a new issue at the last minute. We debated CHP at great length and made a decision which may not have been the best one. We may have over-reacted to outside influences and collectively failed to make the best decision. That decision should be reviewed. I am anxious that this important subject is being introduced into the Bill at the last minute. I appreciate the briefing I received on this subject from Mr. John Brown in the Department of Public Enterprise and from the trade unions. I have agreed in principle to what has been suggested in discussions outside the Chamber but I am nervous about rushing this measure. The first time we came to this matter we made a rushed decision which we subsequently changed. It is a pity things were done in such a hurry and I regret that we will not have an opportunity to discuss the matter at leisure on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A strike is threatened in the ESB in a fortnight's time. No one seems to appreciate that unless there is a major intervention and a change of position, the lights will go out, factories will close and Moneypoint power station will close down. The ESB Officers' Association and SIPTU will serve strike notice in about an hour's time to come into effect in two weeks. Only two parties of the three involved are at the negotiating table. The CCR and subsequent agreements were all tripartite agreements between the Minister's Department, ESB management and the unions. However, only two parties are taking part in negotiations and one of those, management, cannot make a decision without reference to the Minister. The Minister is sometimes accused of meddling but in this case she has a duty to be present at these negotiations. She is the shareholder. Major policy issues are involved and more than a wage agreement is at stake. Without her presence management cannot act effectively to negotiate and resolve the matter. I ask the Minister and her departmental staff to act quickly to prevent a close down of industry. Given the foot and mouth disease crisis, the last thing the economy needs is a power strike. I ask unions and management to co-operate with any move the Minister might make to have talks resumed on a tripartite basis. This question should be examined seriously and quickly.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports about the CCR generally include a comment from the new regulator, Mr. Reeves, that he opposed the CCR. Mr. Reeves handled negotiations for two Minister during the entire process and it ill-behoves him to give briefings to journalists indicating the he was opposed to the process, despite the fact that he was negotiating for the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> I wish to put it on the record that it ill behoves Mr. Reeves to take this position. I will be supporting the Bill. I am sorry we do not have more time on the CHP but maybe we can look at that again because it may be necessary to do more than is being provided for today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a 5% employee shareholding scheme in the ESB and to put in place a cost and competitiveness review commitment without waiting for the passage of legislation to change the status of the company from a statutory corporation to a plc under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 2 proposes to authorise the board of the ESB to create capital stock representing its net assets and permit the allocation of not more than 5% to the staff, the balance going to the Government. Section 4 provides that such stock shall be converted to shares if the ESB is, in the future, given a share capital structure by further legislation. Section 8 proposes to repeal the ESB's break-even mandate enshrined in section 21 of the Electricity supply Act, 1927. The repeal of the break-even mandate is now a necessary requirement as the board prepares to transfer 5% of its worth to its workforce. The &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; shares provided for in this Bill will carry the normal entitlement to dividends for both staff and the State. This in turn requires that legal provision be made for profits, out of which dividends would flow, and legal recognition of profit making by the ESB inevitably requires the repeal of the break-even mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small but an important Bill for the future of the ESB. Like Deputy Stagg I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward. On a broader level, many changes have been introduced with regard to the administration of the electricity industry in Ireland. This is primarily as a result of broader deregulation proposals which have been brought forward within the context of the European Union. Only last year a new transitional regime, designed to give the ESB time to prepare for the onset of full competition was put in place. This transitional regime was comprised of a five year internal contract between the ESB's generation arm and its public electricity supplier functions. Any future changes to the ESB will have to be agreed by means of negotiation between the ESB and the unions. It is important <Col N="29" /> for the functioning of greater competition in the marketplace that any changes are brought about in as speedy a timeframe as possible and that a voluntary severance scheme will be a key requirement in delivering such a new programme. Any changes must be brought about with the support and goodwill of the workforce in the ESB.</P>
    <P>Other new changes which are being introduced entail separating the operation of the transmission business from the rest of the ESB into a newly formed independent State owned company. Recognising the advent of competition and progress towards a fully open market entails the need for the ESB to position itself as a significant player in this emerging market. It is recognised that the issue of the ESB's dominance must be addressed by willingly facilitating real and substantive competition while at the same time ensuring that ESB continues to be a viable commercial entity with a significant market share. There are many challenges for the ESB in achieving this and without doubt significant changes will be required. However, all parties recognise this must be done to ensure a vibrant ESB which is the only way of ensuring attractive and secure employment for its staff.</P>
    <P>We now have an electricity competition regulator up and running. The Commission for Electricity Regulation oversees the introduction of competition into the electricity sector and it has taken over from the ESB the function of licensing the generation and supply of electricity. The Commission for Electricity Regulation will achieve part implementation of the EU electricity directive which introduces competition into the electricity market. Recently there has been much discussion on the operation of Ireland's electricity grid. It is now clearer than ever that new power plants will have to enter the Irish electricity market because the Irish electricity grid is working to near full capacity. The ESB, new competitors in the marketplace, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Commission for Electricity Regulation must ensure that viable procedures are put in place to guarantee that the electricity supply in Ireland increases in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Government signed the European Communities internal market electricity regulations in December 2000 which has implemented the remainder of the electricity directive in its entirely. This provides for the establishment of an independent transmission system operator to be known as Eirgrid. The Government has decided to accelerate the liberalisation of the electricity market moving to 40% in 2002 with full market opening in February 2005.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate. I believe the Government is proposing a substantial amendment to the Bill. I am concerned that it may be a case of making it up as one goes along. Why was this amendment not included in the initial Bill which was published only last week? It would have been much better had that amendment been included as part of the <Col N="30" /> Bill. This is not good practice as it does not allow us time to consult or be briefed on it. I ask the Minister to desist from that type of practice in future if possible especially given that we agreed to take the Bill at short notice and to be as helpful as possible in putting it through the House.</P>
      <P>It is probable that the Bill was published as a result of the Fine Gael Private Members' business last week which highlighted the deficiencies in the service. It is amazing that there are threatened strikes in the ESB and in Aer Lingus and there were major strikes in Iarnród Éireann. The one common denominator is the Minister for Public Enterprise. Perhaps we need to look at all these areas to ascertain why these strikes are taking place.</P>
      <P>I am concerned as to the reason the ESB was insistent on retaining Eirgrid and I wonder whether that is the best way to proceed. One of the problems in the ESB is the whole area of transmission. The Minister is aware of my concerns for the Cork region where the ESB has said jobs have been lost and companies have backed off the Cork region because of the transmission difficulties. This problem has been on going for four years and there have been many attempts to resolve it. Yet there is no obvious resolution to the problem. Everywhere the ESB proposes to erect plyons there is vehement opposition so that one wonders whether it is feasible to push ahead with them. I ask the Minister to examine this issue. We all want electricity in the regions but we do not want plyons. That is a major difficulty. The Minister needs to grasp the nettle and solve the problem. I am happy to see CHP coming to the fore because my understanding is that it is more economic and that the gas can be transferred to the site and power can be generated there. The Minister, the Department and the ESB need to examine this method of transmitting power instead of pylons.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, outlined that there were fears regarding a link between power lines and childhood leukaemia. The Minister knows that people become emotional once fears are raised regarding health, particularly children's health. In such circumstances people will block the erection of pylons. It is time the Minister considered the issue of transmission. She should speak to her Cabinet colleagues and recognise that a major policy change in required. Communities will not agree to the erection of pylons. Such pylons are also an environmental blight as they look awful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major issue and, according to the ESB, it has resulted in the loss of many jobs in Cork. This is not the first occasion on which I have raised this matter and I appeal to the Minister to place it at the top of her agenda. The required infrastructure cannot be rolled out unless we can transmit power. However, we cannot transmit power if people will not allow it. People become very emotional about this issue and stand in the way. The Minister has seen what has happened in <Col N="31" /> Cork over the past four years and this issue has to be grasped. However, this has not been done.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the lack of the ESB's generating capacity. We were lucky in that the winter was relatively mild. Much money was spent bringing generators from America. Can the Minister outline how much use was made of the generators? They cost £10 million to hire but what use was made of them? Some have suggested that the generators were hardly used. There are major issues to be addressed in this regard and the Minister needs to take matters in hand for the good of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on her pro active attitude to this issue. I wish to refer to the 5% shareholding for workers and the share options. We should recognise the great contribution ESB workers have made to the economy over the years and the fact that they have brought value and wealth to the company. ESB workers are available around the clock to ensure that supplies are maintained, particularly to industry, health services and other vital facilities. The lack of sufficient electricity supply would be catastrophic.</P>
      <P>Share options give employees a link with the fortunes of a company. However, they are not a panacea for promoting the betterment of a company or for curing its ills. We need to look no further than Eircom in this regard. It is important to recognise that the fundamentals within a company must be right if share option schemes are to be successful. Eircom employees are not thriving and face a falling share price and an uncertain future. This is taking place at a time when directors' salaries and remunerations are causing controversy.</P>
      <P>However, we must recognise that corporate greed applies to only a small number of companies. Glossy brochures often predict the most amazing developments for consumers which may not occur for five years and prices for existing services sometimes increase to pay for minimal decreases in other charges. We should be aware of examples of such developments. California, the most powerful state in the USA, woke up one morning to the news that electricity would be rationed. The Golden State is the home of movies, technology and innovation.</P>

Privatisation does not always work and, in the case of California, investment was sacrificed for shareholder dividends and management remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail system in the UK has also been privatised. Railtrack has, in effect, been rationalised because of gross under-investment in rail and rail <Col N="32" /> safety. UK taxpayers are paying for the failure of privatisation.</P>

      <P>It is alive and well and will thrive in the future. I am not against privatisation or private investment in public utilities. However, privatisation must deliver real value and services to consumers and continue to contribute to the wealth of the nation. That is what we are trying to achieve in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has learned the lessons of electricity black-outs in California, high prices and low pressure in British water services and chaotic and dangerous signals in the UK's rail network. The privatisation of utilities must focus on delivering real value to consumers by giving incentives to the work force. The Minister has recognised this fact in the Bill. Privatisation must also ensure that companies continue to provide good services and value for money. The end users of electricity must be the primary focus, as is reflected in the Bill. Such end users drive the economy and must be protected from investment failures or we will all pay a high price.</P>
      <P>Over the years the ESB provided electricity for homes and industries. Anyone involved in small schemes or who has seen the enormous advances will recognise the company's great commitment. Our commitment to the company is indicated by the proposal to invite workers to participate in share option schemes.</P>
      <P>ESB workers often operated in appalling conditions to ensure that lights kept burning in homes. In so doing they often had to forsake their own firesides and families. Significant industrial developments were made possible by power supplied by the ESB. I commend the Bill and thank the Minister for her pro-active attitude in ensuring that services are delivered for all in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which all Members will accept is important legislation. However, it has taken too long to introduce the Bill. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has the main responsibility for the semi-State sector and the mechanism proposed in the Bill should be used in all semi-State companies, whether or not they are due for privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for employee share option schemes should not only be proposed in the context of privatisation. The Government is promoting share options and profit sharing in private industry. I do not understand why these options should not also apply in the public sector to give employees <Col N="33" /> a shareholding in their companies and a reason to ensure increases in productivity. Such a mechanism might help resolve many of the impending industrial disputes in the semi-State sector such as those in Aer Lingus, the ESB and the threatened dispute in Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>Section 8 repeals section 21 of the 1927 Act and effectively terminates the ESB's break-even mandate. I question the wisdom of this proposal. Investment has to be the priority in the electricity sector. Our infrastructure is creaking and addressing this problem should be our main priority, rather than looking at privatisation. My fear regarding privatisation is that a private company will not invest money in infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that. We see it at the moment with the first company that has been privatised, Eircom. ADSL has now been put on the back burner in Eircom. Eircom recently announced that its high speed ISDN lines will now be at a slower rate, even though they are supposed be high speed because the priority is not to put the infrastructure in place. The priority for Eircom is profit for its shareholders and, sadly, many of those shareholders are not getting too much out of Eircom at the moment. It would be wrong to go down that route in relation to the ESB or Bord Gáis at this point. The priority should be to put the infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about introducing combined heat and power, which is a very welcome proposal and one which I wholeheartedly accept. The problem is, however, that combined heat and power will not be feasible in many parts of the country, including the BMW region, because we do not have the gas supply in the first place to bring this about.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we are to privatise gas. At the moment Bord Gáis is not putting the infrastructure in all parts of the country because it does not believe it is commercially viable to bring it to towns like Roscommon town and other towns in north Roscommon. We are talking about a semi-State company which should put the infrastructure in place now and not in ten years time.</P>
    <P>On the issue of infrastructure, EirGrid will be controlled by one body and owned by another, namely the ESB. Is it the Minister's intention that EirGrid, along with the ESB, will be privatised in time? It is fundamentally important that the basic infrastructure remains in public ownership. I do not agree that it should remain in the control of the ESB. The Competition Authority has strongly criticised the fact that it is remaining within the ownership of the ESB. If we are talking about investing in infrastructure in the years to come, it should remain in public ownership. A prime example of that is Railtrack in the UK which was turned into a private company. Investment has not been put into the infrastructure. Every week there are minor accidents on the rail infrastructure throughout the UK and there have also been some major accidents because investment has not been put into the infrastructure and it has been privatised. We should tread very carefully and <Col N="34" /> slowly in regard to this issue and should make sure we have the proper the infrastructure in place before we talk about privatisation.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister made the point that over the past five years, the number of units purchased through the ESB has been 30%. We can see that demand has been increasing and yet we have not increased the capacity to meet that demand. I hope the Minister will address the issue of capacity in her response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Mr. William McCann, the recently retired chairman of ESB. I had a number of dealings with Billy McCann when he was involved with the former Department of Tourism and Trade. I always found him to be a thorough gentleman and one who was absolutely committed to his duty. I wish him well in his change of career, as I am sure the Minister does.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Public Enterprise, the Minister has the opportunity to make a real and lasting imprint on the future development of this country as we head into the new millennium. Electricity has become something we take for granted and it is only when the well runs dry that one realises the value and importance of the water. I hope that by involvement or instruction, the Minister will head off the forthcoming strike due to take place in the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>I am a very strong supporter of the combined heat and power processes. I saw a number of these working when I was in the trade Department. There is a great deal of ongoing research there on which the Minister needs to follow up. It is something for the future. If the major plants throughout the country were to avail of the opportunity to put in combined heat and power processes by virtue of the gas not only would it give stability in terms of the area itself, but it would allow power to be provided to small towns and villages in the locality. That is very important.</P>
      <P>I note the ESB intends to provide a broadband communications system by way of its overhead transmission network. This is obviously in conjunction with its partnership with Ocean. That is very worthy and will provide a new dimension to the communications competition network we have throughout the country. I noticed in the ESB publication, <i>Electric Mail</i>, of February of this year that the only place not mentioned in the 1,100 kilometre proposal was my own county of Mayo. The ESB intends to do this in two loops, a southern loop and a northern loop. Perhaps the Minister might clarify in her response that the county will be included as part of the proposal to provide broadband combination by way of fibre optic cables being provided on the transmission network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Corrib gas field, which is a major development with more to follow in the years to come, the Minister should take a lead and host, if you like, a public seminar where all of these bodies can come in, state their case and hear Government policy and direction in this <Col N="35" /> area. There is a great deal of confusion about who is doing what and what the impact will be in terms of the environment and the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill. It is worthy to give the workers a share in an enterprise such as this and 5% is 5%, I suppose, and it sets a headline for them. I am a bit concerned at the number of comments from people concerned about privatisation. We have always backed privatisation as being the be-all and end-all. Examples in other countries give us a cause for concern that were the ESB to be fully privatised, the more remote rural areas would be left out in terms of investment in quality of supply and so on. I support the Bill. Perhaps the Minister might deal with my comments in her response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. There is huge concern in Sligo and opposition to the ESB's plans to reinforce its high voltage electricity structure. A planning application has been lodged and permission is being sought to run a 40 mile 220kV line from the existing 220kV station at Flagford to a 220/110kV station at Sooey in east Sligo. I fully support the opposition groups from Riverstown, Ballymote and Sooey which want the ESB to put the cable underground instead of using the proposed 30 metre pylons. They have lodged objections.</P>
      <P>I also contend that the EIS supplied by the ESB does not contain all the information needed by the planning authorities. This has since been confirmed because its application has been invalidated by the senior executive planner in Sligo County Council who said the ESB is required to comment on the observations that the environmental impact statement does not address the following issues: alternative substation sites located west of Belhavel Lough near the R289, coinciding with the preferred route in the previous Flagford proposal of 1993 and the alternative route options based on the 1993 proposal. With respect to underground options, it was asked to supply detailed relative cost estimates, if necessary, on a linear kilometre basis to do a cost an analysis between over ground and underground options. That must be done.</P>
      <P>This application by the ESB has totally ignored the business case. This is not fully explained and relies heavily on information used previously in the planning application. As regards the health concerns, highly selective quotes to suit the case were used, which is wrong. No regard is had to more up-to-date research which could damage the case. The precautionary transfer is not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental and health concerns are totally ignored, as are many aspects of the county development plan. ESBI stresses that it is concerned about the environment, yet it persists with old, discredited solutions when it has demonstrated it can adopt more modern ones. ESBI has shown it has the experience, capability and <Col N="36" /> expertise to put lines underground. The reasons for not doing so are highly selective and do not stand up to close scrutiny. It comes down to cost, yet ESBI has never been asked to produce a proper survey and detailed cost analysis of a project of this nature. There is little about cost in the report which has been thrown out by Sligo County Council planners. I appeal to the Minister to intervene and request the ESB to conduct a cost analysis of this project.</P>
    <P>ESBI is entirely dismissive of alternatives, yet it could be part of the way forward. The line will not add one job to the area whereas alternatives would and there are many of them. ESBI has demonstrated it has the technology to implement them, but has chosen not to do so. Why is there no generating station west of the River Shannon? The time is right for us to take a long, hard look at our position in the west and north west and examine the integrated plan that will bring benefits to the area well into the future. ESBI can help in this respect and thus better serve the common good. It is possible to have sustained development and, at the same time, preserve what is good in the region. It is no longer the time for ESBI to be engaged in quick fix solutions that will need to be addressed again.</P>
    <P>The new line will not add to the generation of power west of the Shannon, as it is purely a transmission line, not a generation line. A total of 4,000 people have signed a petition against it and their voices must be heard. An alternative gas supply is coming to the region. The Minister visited Sligo last week and has decided that there must be a gas supply link to the town. Alternatives must be examined. When the chief planning officer of the county council completely invalidates an application from the ESB, it begs questions given the expertise at its disposal.</P>
    <P>The anti-pylon group in the Ballymote-Sooey-Riverstown area has a strong case. It will be successful because another line between Flagford and Sooey has been proposed. People do not want it as it will carry 220 kV with associated 110 kV developments. I have visited the station at Flagford, County Roscommon, and it is a sight to behold. The people of south Sligo do not want a second Flagford because it will have major consequences. It will have an impact on the cultural heritage of the area. Carrowkeel megalithic bombs, built in 2000 BC, are sited there and the pylons will be in close proximity.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to contact the ESB and return to the drawing board. This application will not be successful because 4,000 people in south Sligo have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and people power will prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, in particular the provision to grant shares to ESB workers. There has been a relaxation of many aspects of policy in regard to the foot and mouth disease outbreak and I ask the Minister to examine an issue which is causing concern among young farmers. The ESB cannot access their properties. <Col N="37" /> A number of farmers in County Limerick have approached me. They have been seeking an electricity connection for the past nine months. Two of them have paid the ESB more than £750 for connection. They have other commitments, including mortgage repayments, but they still do not have an electricity supply. Will the Minister examine whether the restrictions can be relaxed in this regard? I understand discussions have taken place.</P>
      <P>There are two large power stations in my constituency at Tarbert and Moneypoint. The Moneypoint station has been a burning issue for many years. I have no doubt that if Moneypoint made a planning application, even with the new technologies and products available, it would not be granted. A significant mistake was made in the past. A major generating station was constructed which spewed sulphur dioxide into the air. Approximately 50% of Ireland's sulphur dioxide emissions are generated at Moneypoint and as a result of a confluence of winds, they are confined to one area of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>This is not good enough and, although we are excited by the gas find by Enterprise Oil and gas interconnectors abroad, I do not know to what extent the ESB has examined the conversion of the Moneypoint power station to gas supply. I do not know what the cost would be, but it would be minimal relative to the inconvenience caused and the concerns in the area. I am excited by Aughinish Alumina's proposal to build its own power plant in conjunction with outside interests, which will enable it to provide its own generating capacity. That will be an excellent development by the company in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Does the ESB have plans to change Moneypoint power station? I recognise that there is a lack of electricity capacity in the State and concern that the growth of the Celtic tiger may be slowed as a result. We may head in the same direction as California, which, as a result of the large technology base in the state, was unable to attract more industries because it could not guarantee electricity supply.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that there are objections to the promotion of wind energy throughout the State.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Finucane agus tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille. I wish to make three points. The Minister stated without qualification that the ESB has signed up <Col N="38" /> 200,000 additional customers in the past five years and, while the number of units purchased has increased by more than 30% in the same period, this is the highest rate of growth in the OECD. There is no doubt that power demand is rocketing in Ireland and it is an issue that is not being focused on in legislation or Government policy generally. The Irish Energy Bill continues to sit on the back burner while we are in every way blazing a trail to try to catch up with the demand for supply. That is an unbalanced approach. We object to President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol but the USA was expected to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Ireland has been given permission to increase its emissions and it has not managed to adhere to the agreed increases. We will probably be three times above the permitted 13% increase over 1990 levels when it is measured. That will be costly for this country. Let us not simply talk about our moral obligation, we also must discuss the financial implications for the country of not balancing our approach to energy demand by trying to deal with the demand rather than simply serving it.</P>
      <P>According to the Irish Energy Centre, we could save £75 million per year if even current housing stock were effectively insulated. That does not take account of the thousands of new buildings being constructed under basic and flawed building regulations. I accept that this is not the Minister's responsibility but at the Cabinet she must vociferously point out that she is being left to carry the burden of the energy crisis when the Department of the Environment and Local Government has a huge obligation in terms of building regulations and the Department of Finance has a huge obligation in terms of fiscal measures that will change behaviour regarding energy use and provide incentives to ensure that renewable energy continues to be the favoured option for people investing in energy supply.</P>
      <P>That is not happening at present. There is an anxious wait for the pricing of the new AER contracts. We will see what that brings but we are lagging badly behind competitors such as Denmark in that area. That is a reason for collective shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outsourcing of the upgrading network is mentioned in the Bill. This must take greater account of up-to-date international practice. In Australia there are service corridors for underground ducting. We are building roads as never before in this country and service corridors are definitely the preferred option to stringing pylons across farmland from one end of the country to the other. Such options have not been examined because we are locked into old practices. The Swedes have developed an amount of technology in underground ducting as well. That option allows smaller operators, community-based wind farms and smaller generating capacity to feed in. There could be net metering so people could get credit for the energy they produce. Rather than wait for the bill to arrive, they could wheel back the meter as they feed into the network and get <Col N="39" /> credit for it. That type of thing is badly needed to encourage small scale renewable energy development.</P>
    <P>The CHP is favoured in the Bill. I prefer CHP to many of the old polluting methods of generation, such as Moneypoint. However, it should not be allowed to gain equal favour with renewable wind energy. I thought we had established that CHP is favoured over the old polluting technologies but is not as good as renewable energy generation. That hierarchy of preference must be maintained so that renewable wind power, which is vastly underexploited in this country, continues to be favoured for investment in power generation.</P>

      <P>He will do a good job on behalf of the State. It is a well considered appointment.</P>
      <P>I am glad the ESB workers are getting a 5% shareholding in the company, and I compliment the Minister in that regard. The workers have kept the company going since the foundation of the State and I hope the past workers in the company will be rewarded as well for the wonderful work they have done over the years.</P>
      <P>We tend to criticise the ESB in the Dáil and in county councils. However, every year when there are power shortages due to storms or bad weather, the workers are on the front line in that weather. I wish them well. They do a good job. I might not say that about the management of the company but I must acknowledge that the workers have always responded to whatever had to be done in difficult weather.</P>
      <P>I hope a gas power station will be located in Mayo following the gas find off the Mayo coast. The workers of Bellacorick are due to lose their jobs in the next three or four years when the power station is closed. The power station has been there for a long time and it employed a large number of people. Its closure will be a great loss to north Mayo and the county in general with regard to employment. The workers worked hard and gave loyal service to the company. They did a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn all Governments for not putting the necessary funding and infrastructure in place for Bellacorick. The peat is there and the station should have been kept open. However, it was a political decision on the part of our political masters. It will have a bad effect on an area that needs employment. It is wrong that people will <Col N="40" /> be taken out of employment in an area that is so dependent on the power station.</P>
    <P>There is great difficulty at present in relation to gas. There is great concern in the county. The people who are living in the area are anxious to be informed by the Government and the company about what is happening. They also want to be given the information in layman's language. They do not want to be given technical explanations. Technical documentation frightens people. It is not unlike the Bills that are brought before the Dáil. Why they cannot be simplified, I do not know. We seem to talk in two tongues in legislation &ndash; one would need an interpreter to explain what is in a Bill. In some cases it is probably saying nothing but it is also probably a way of hiding what is actually said. It is time to simplify these things. Why must we have to try to figure out what is said in a Bill, as if we were trying to solve a crossword? Why can we not say: &ldquo;This is what we propose to do and these are the changes we are making&rdquo;, and let people judge for themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will discuss the power shortages in north Mayo with the ESB. Whether there is a storm on a winter's day or an ambush of midges on a fine day, the power goes off. The power has been off in north Mayo every week since Christmas. That is wrong. The region affected is Erris, which is as big as County Louth. The ESB staff have been taken out of the area so if the power goes off and one telephones the company, one will get through to somebody in Letterkenny or Dublin who never heard of Pullathomas, Glenamoy or Carrowtigue. It probably takes them a few days to find out where north Mayo is and a few more days to find the staff. In the meantime, the people of north Mayo are suffering. I ask the Minister to take up this matter with the ESB and to urge the company to provide the necessary staff in the area and improve the power supply.</P>
    <P>However, gas is the big issue. There must be a gas power station in the county. The people of Erris must gain from the gas find. It will be a criminal disgrace if that does not happen and if the people living nearest the gas find do not gain from it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the employee share option scheme because it gives an incentive to employees who have worked for companies for a long time. For that reason I support the Bill. I have a difficulty, however, with one aspect of the ESB monopoly, the ESB shops. These have an unfair advantage over their competitors in the electrical and white goods sector, an area in which I have a personal interest and involvement. ESB shops can offer their customers interest free loans through the billing system when they purchase goods. That is an unfair advantage in a very competitive sector. I have no difficulty with the ESB being involved in the white goods or electrical sector, but I have a difficulty with its unfair advantage. When Deputy Molloy was Minister for Energy some years ago he initiated an investigation into this issue, but, although numerous changes were supposed to be made, no changes were made and the ESB's advantage remains. That should be changed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry spoke about the difficulty with the application for an ESB line from Flagford, County Roscommon to County Sligo and said that there were 4,000 objections to bringing the line by pylon across most of County Sligo and parts of counties Leitrim and Roscommon. I raised this issue last week during Fine Gael Private Members' time when business related to the ESB and reiterate my call for an independent body to be established to determine the cost of putting the cable underground. The ESB has a monopoly and states that it would cost eight to ten times more to put the cable underground than it would to use pylons, depending on the topography of the area. Individuals state that it should cost only twice as much, but the ESB disagrees. That is the reason I want an independent company or body established to resolve this situation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome. There is much work to be done, particularly in the north and north west, to bring a proper electricity supply to all areas with which the Minister should deal urgently.</P>

Legislation in this area was promised for some time and the Bill will consolidate the position of the employees of the ESB. As a word of caution, however, we are facing threats of industrial action from many sections of ESB staff and that is not the way in which they should do their business. We are introducing concessions which will make them part of the board and it is unwise of them to use a policy of industrial action. The legislation is welcome and very important for many ESB employees in my constituency, particularly <Col N="42" /> Moneypoint, which employs up to 500 people. I compliment the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the 12 Members who contributed to the debate. There would have been 12 more if we had more time. I thank the Whips, Deputies Stagg, Jim Higgins, Sargent and O'Malley for their help. I went to Deputy Stagg first and asked his advice on getting the Bill through, though it is not a result of the motion tabled last week, but a week earlier. I then spoke to each Whip or main spokesperson and all were agreeable. It was a great act of co-operation, though I wish we had more time also. I met with generosity and wise advice.</P>
      <P>I thank the House also for agreeing to these amendments at such short notice, though it is not the best way to do our business. In recent years we have worked out points in lengthy Committee Stage debates &ndash; none of which I regret &ndash; with better Bills ensuing. This was one occasion, however, on which it was important to get the amendments through. I have asked John Brown and it was 31 March 1996 when the earlier CCR was signed and agreed.</P>
      <P>Members mentioned the 2,000 members of staff, a figure agreed in the pact. It was 2,000 on 31 March 1996 also. Deputy Higgins suggested that 2,000 should not go, but that was worked out and agreed by the various parties to the agreement. Deputy Perry mentioned Sligo County Council, but that is a matter for it. It is not for me to intervene or discuss. That is its business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg mentioned the need to put talk of privatisation to one side. When the board of the ESB wrote to me last autumn stating that it did not want to proceed I accepted what it said, even if my personal opinion is another matter, because obviously it had discussed it. I agree with Deputy Kenny who commended the chairman, who has retired, Mr. Billy McCann. I always found him to be punctilious and agreeable. He was, definitely, on top of his job.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also asked me about the broadband in his area and I will get back to him when I have discussed the matter with the relevant assistant secretary. Deputy Finucane said that foot and mouth disease is holding up connections for some young people who have paid the ESB for power. A protocol has been worked out between the ESB and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's expert committee and work has commenced again. There was a delay for four to five weeks, but that was for the greater good.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton raised the Cork issue. He spoke of the long delay &ndash; five years &ndash; since the Cork issue was first mooted.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that the shares will be converted at a future date when the ESB becomes a public limited company. There is a need to look at the feasibility of giving shares to employees in semi-State companies, whether they be privatised or State owned. Numerous industrial disputes have arisen in many semi-State companies. The Government is promoting profit share and share options in the private sector and there is a need to consider a mechanism to do that in the semi-State sector.</P>
      <P>The company will shed approximately 2,000 staff when privatisation occurs. Will the Minister reconsider this given that prior to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, it took up to three months to get the ESB to connect a young couple to the power grid? That is unacceptable. Representations are being made to us as public representatives to contact the ESB to get electricity connected to houses. It is similar to what happened in the past with telephones. I caution the Minister about the ESB shedding that number of staff when backlogs exist, which have been compounded by the foot and mouth problem.</P>

      <P>Field staff are under-resourced because of the economic boom. The timeframe for connections to houses can be between three and five months. Yesterday I pointed out to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, that in the case of many applications on building sites where there are one or more houses, ESB officials have indicated that price quotations will be provided for the work to be undertaken, yet four or five months can elapse before anything is done. If staff are let go delays will increase.</P>
      <P>No Minister can ensure that an ESB connection can be made from the boot of a car. In the time when telephone installations were subject to lengthy delays connections were made in this way.</P>

      <P>Is it the case that if new legislation is required to deal with the restructuring of the board these legislative provisions will apply? Most employees in the ESB, or at least those in my constituency, want to know how this will affect them in terms of cash on the table. According to the board's figures, the assets of the company are valued at approximately £2 billion. If these arrangements are put in place this valuation may be reduced by half and if that was to be divided among the 9,000 employees each employee would get approximately £10,000. The latest figures from the board indicate that turnover and profits amounted to approximately £200 million but that has been substantially reduced in the past year because of increased oil costs. The company is concerned about this, as was evident from its recent evidence to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the value in cash terms to employees? Are my calculations correct and will it be worth approximately £9,000 or £10,000 to each employee?</P>

      <P>The first word of section 4 is &ldquo;If&rdquo;. That is most unusual. It seems to anticipate something that might happen in the future. The section provides that the board may be constituted as a company &ldquo;if that occurs&rdquo;. I have not come across such vagueness in legislation. If it occurs we will cross the bridge when we come to it. Whey does the Minister consider the words to be necessary?</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly referred to the value of the shares. If we knew the full value of the company it would be possible to calculate a 5% proportion and the likely distribution among the employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has adopted the policy of providing share options in the semi-State sector. It was in our general election manifesto and it is the right way to proceed. Aer Lingus, An Post &ndash; postal legislation will be introduced in the autumn &ndash; the ESB and the former Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, have provided options. Bord na Móna is discussing the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputies Naughten and Farrelly asked me to consider the number of employees to be let go. Under the arrangement agreed a year ago the number was set at 2,096, or 2,000 now. The voluntary severance scheme has been approved. A condition of that VSS is that network people would be retained. The three sides signed up to it. The network people were to be retained and staff leaving would be mainly involved in generation because of the new stations coming on stream. I want to reassure people because constituents come to me about their problems in the same way they go to other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great delay in getting hooked up. Increasingly I find that people who are building houses do not seem to know that they must plan a long time in advance to make contact with their local ESB office to get connected. I am glad that <Col N="45" /> we will reinforce it, that the network people will be in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly asked what would it mean to each employee. KPMG have put an approximate value on the shares. KPMG has told us that the full 5% shareholding would be worth approximately £10,700 to each of the 9,300 employees in the ESB at that date.</P>
    <P>On the question about the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;, my officials tell me that that is out of deference to all of us. The next Bill related to ESB will be to create a plc. One must use the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; because one cannot say that it will be enacted because that will depend on whether the Dáil agrees to enact it. The word &ldquo;if&rdquo; is used in deference to the workings of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>The record of the Government in that regard is very bad. It has introduced systems which denied workers the right to be worker directors and where they could have had worker directors, it excluded them on a number of occasions.

      <P>The other point I want to make is that if the shares are worth £10,700, how soon can the workers sell them? To whom can they sell them? Are they held in trust for the workers? Are they not allowed to sell them? Are they useless? Is it that they will just get a dividend from them? What will they get?

      <P>I will not allow it drift anyway. To return to the point I was making about share options and profit sharing for employees of semi-State companies, I am only reading myself into this brief and therefore perhaps I am duplicating what is already in place. According to my reading of the Bill, these ESB employees will not be able to cash in their shares or get a dividend from their shares unless the ESB becomes a plc. The point I am trying to make is that irrespective of whether a semi-State becomes a plc or remains a semi-State company, the employees should receive a share of the profits or a dividend in respect of those shares in the semi-State company prior to it becoming a plc. The employees should get something out of the semi-State company. Irrespective of what happens in the future and whether it becomes a plc or not, which is up to <Col N="47" /> us in this House to decide. Is there provision at present where the employees of companies like Bord na Móna and the ESB can receive a dividend or share in the profits in the context of their remuneration? That is fundamentally important in the context of the ongoing industrial disputes within these sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are only taking place now about the one in Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>With regard to the generality of semi-State companies, the employees who have shares form a trust called the employee share ownership trust. That trust operates for the employees and that is what they wish to do. That is their business. I will not impose my will on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are of value. If one holds shares to the tune of £10,700, they have a considerable value which is tradable in any language. There is no point in saying &ldquo;It is not of value.&rdquo;  It is not of value in the sense of money in a person's hand but one is the owner of the script of the share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that one cannot dispose of those shares until the company becomes a plc. The tax implications can be considered at that stage. Those employees will not get a dividend from it until the company becomes a plc. Therefore there is no net financial benefit to the employees should the company not become a plc. The point I am trying to make is that there should be an option available at this juncture by which employees would get some dividend from their semi-State company. That is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>By law, the employees could not sell the shares outside in the market but they could sell them in an internal market within the ESB and get a dividend. If an employee of the ESB wished to purchase more shares and another employee wished to sell, they can sell to each other or to a group.</P>
      <P>However, it is a matter for the employee share ownership trust. I certainly would not tell them that they should or should not sell. This is the way the workers want it. We must give them some leeway if they want to do their business that way.</P>
      <P>They set up an employee share ownership trust among themselves and they appoint somebody to the board. One of the worker directors on the board becomes their representative to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>8.&ndash;Schedule 12 to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is amended by the substitution for paragraph 11(3)(<i>c</i>) of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) (i) in a case where the founding company is the Electricity Supply Board and as respects securities acquired by the trustees of the trust on or before 31 December 2001, the person was an employee or a director, as the case may be, <Col N="49" /> of a company within the founding company's group on 1 January 1998, and</P>
    <P>(ii) in any other case, at the relevant time a period of not more than 18 months has elapsed since the person so ceased or the company so ceased, as the case may be.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the 18 month rule. Heretofore, it was thought that when this Bill, or a measure equal to it, was introduced it would contain a provision providing for an 18 month period. Then the issue of the people who signed up on 31 March 1996 evolved. They signed up in the anticipation that they would be able to be participants in a scheme that would be introduced. It would be wrong if we did not place faith in that. It was thought for a while that such a provision would be included in a Finance Bill and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said that was the correct legislation to provide for its introduction. Then the worry was as to when there would be another Finance Bill that would provide for it. That is how this provision ended up in this Bill. It will provide for all those employees who signed the CCR.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>9.&ndash;The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, is amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) in section 14&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) by the deletion in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) of &lsquo;subject to section 28,',</P>
      <P>(ii) by the substitution for paragraph (<i>d</i>) of subsection (1) of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>d</i>) to supply electricity to final customers which in aggregate does not exceed the amount of electricity which is available to the supplier and which is produced using combined heat and power or electricity purchased, in place of such electricity, in accordance with the trading arrangements provided for in regulations to be made by the Commission under section 9(1)(<i>d</i>),',</P>
      <P>(iii) by the deletion of subsection (10),</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) by the deletion of section 28.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is the one Deputy Sargent and others wished to talk about. While we have time to discuss it, I wish we were discussing it in a fully fledged Committee Stage debate. I admire the honesty of Deputy Stagg when he said in June 1999 when dealing with a Bill and we were all worked up by various circumstances that were happening outside the committee room and it seemed to me, and I am sure to others, that external influences were bearing, to a great degree, upon amendments and decisions we were making. We drew in our horns quite a bit and at the time it was the right thing to do. Time has moved on and some of the people involved in those matters have moved on.</P>
      <P>The amendment puts forward a provision for combined heat and power, CHP. The electricity regulation Bill provides for eligible customers and we want to ensure provision for customers, regardless of their eligibility. That is what this amendment is about. It requires the deletion of sections of that earlier Bill. I recommend this amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify further the exact change in arrangements that will follow from the inclusion of this amendment. We need to consider how the provisions of the amendment will impinge on the provision of electricity supply and not only on the combined heat and power sector. I am conscious, as I am sure are other Deputies, of the competitive nature of the power generating business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that the European Commission has adjudicated on the question of State support for renewable energy. It goes beyond the <Col N="51" /> normal reading of State assistance and is more to do with the overall requirement to tackle the level of emission of greenhouse gases, which is critical, and to ensure we are able to have sufficient power without endangering future generations, as it is forecast will be the effect of climate change. I ask Minister how she can fit this amendment into that overall scenario and whether combined heat and power by being more attractive will become the preferred option rather than renewable energy? We do not have pricing of the AER contracts yet, the latest round, but given that there are predictions in that area, can the Minister say how this amendment will fit into the overall categorisation of power generation as among renewable, CHP and the more traditional fossil fuel based generation sector?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment, the inclusion of which would bring about deregulation in the CHP element. That needs to be encouraged and promoted, notwithstanding the point Deputy Sargent made, which is valid. We should go down the road of developing renewable energy. We should consider providing research funding for the renewable energy sector and developing it in relation to biomass, etc. We have thousands of acres of cutaway bog around the country, which could easily be used for that. Some research has been done on the use of rapeseed oil technology as a fuel for cars. I see no reason that technology could not be used to provide combined heat and power &ndash; CHP &ndash; or to provide fuel for other sources. I ask the Minister to look into this. It helps to protect our energy resources and is a crop that we can produce easily. It would be great to have such a cash crop available with the current state of the agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>Combined heat and power is a welcome development. I welcome and support the fact that we are liberalising and deregulating the sector. I contend, however, that it will not have the same required impact throughout the country. It will not have the impact because the main source of fuel for CHP will be gas and gas is only available in certain parts of the country. While the gas pipeline will be developed as far as the west coast and up to Sligo and the north-west, the north midland region will still be left without gas. This is a blackspot area in relation to energy. All across north Roscommon, Longford, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan we have huge problems in relation to electricity supply. Deputies have raised the pylon issue and that is very controversial in north Roscommon, Leitrim and south Sligo. The construction of these pylons would be defunct if we had accessibility to CHP in that part of the country. It should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we spoke on the fundamental issue of infrastructure. Without the basic infrastructure we are going nowhere. Within the BMW region we have a huge infrastructure deficit that needs to be filled. We need the mechanism to distribute <Col N="52" /> gas or electricity. Combined heat and power could fill that void and it would reduce the controversy over pylons. We could have a CHP plant that would provide energy to the whole town of Roscommon, a reasonable sized town. There is one on the quays, in the Temple Bar area, which has been extremely successful. We cannot do that unless the gas and infrastructure are available to us. It would be a lot less controversial than the erection of pylons across the country. I urge the Minister to examine the situation as she is responsible for this area.</P>
    <P>We can talk about bringing industry into the regions but unless we have power we cannot do it. The ideal mechanism for providing that power is CHP and I welcome it. It should be developed but it will not mean anything to the parts of the country that need power and energy supplies because they do not have the fuel to power the plants. It is important that the Minister re-examines the situation and the decisions taken by Bord Gáis Éireann in relation to not supplying gas because it is not commercially viable. It is not commercially viable in almost any part of the BMW region at the moment but it is a major investment that would pay off in the long-term. It was not commercially viable to bring it from Cork to Dublin at the time but it has paid off and the same courage is needed now to provide gas to facilitate CHP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter. Essentially we are talking about using the heat that normally escapes into the atmosphere from a generating station to increase the energy take from burning fossil fuels, usually gas. There is no magic involved. It is a matter of diverting the stack down through the system again to heat water and provide central heating or other heating needs in houses, factories or offices. It is a great idea. It is efficient and gains maximum benefit from the burning of fossil fuels which are scarce and create pollution. The pollution element is minimised by this method so it is important that we do this. It was decided in the Act last year to do it. Then one of the large players in the field wrote a letter explaining how he would abuse the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>He wrote a letter to us, in case it would not be clear, explaining how he would abuse the system we had laid down in the Act. The Minister and the Opposition agreed then to restrict the use of CHP to prevent the abuse of it. Essentially, with the opening of the market &ndash; 28% was being opened at the time &ndash; this player abusing the CHP system would have 100% of the market open to him for his personal advantage so the Minister restricted it. We are not going back to where we were with this amendment but we are going some of the way, and that is right. We may have over-reacted and set down such strong restrictions that CHP was almost eliminated &ndash;<Col N="53" /> there has been very little since. The providers of the base fuel, Bord Gáis Éireann and others, have been campaigning to have some liberalisation so they can go ahead and I welcome the liberalisation proposed by the Minister today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten made a very valid point about the areas that have not got the necessary raw material or fuel to provide CHP. During my tenure I made a decision, against the head of Department, to provide a gas line from north Dublin to Galway, taking in Mullingar, Athlone and Roscommon and all places along the route. The company would provide the gas line and the towns would be put out to tender. The Minister has expanded on that position and I welcome that. With the advent of the gas from north Mayo there would be a further north-south line. It is very important for the area that the base material should be there. Some industries could be set up now in those areas using CHP in the new formula under which it will be available. I welcome that but I wonder are we changing things too quickly now without the normal revision and examination of the old Bill and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Naughten said. Unfortunately the theory seems quite simple in a lot of these matters but the practice can be difficult. We had some experience of that in Moneypoint. In the context of the pressures which will be exerted on the board of the ESB from competitors, the provision of funding for research purposes, to which Deputy Naughten referred, may suffer. I am particularly interested in the provision of research funding to examine the feasibility of wave stations which could generate substantial electricity and where an amount of work has been done. The board of the ESB made an arrangement with a Scottish company for a wave station off west Clare, which would have been the first in Ireland and very widely welcomed. Unfortunately, the Commission withdrew funding of £1 million which made it unprofitable to undertake the project. Wave power should be a very attractive proposition for the generation of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that using our natural gas as a means of generating electricity is very productive. We should get the best possible value for our gas. There is a huge amount of very valuable research being undertaken in Europe, particularly in Germany and France, into finding ways of developing a clean coal technology. There are huge reserves of coal available at relatively moderate prices which will not fluctuate because of troubles in the Middle East or elsewhere. It is a cheap way of generating electricity. The station at Moneypoint, which produces 24% of our electricity supply, is, probably, one of the most efficient stations in Ireland. It would cost between £400 million and £500 million to convert it to gas. It would be very unwise to use our valuable gas resources in this way and constitute very bad economics. Rather than the current proposal to stop the utilisation of coal at Moneypoint, it would be far better to <Col N="54" /> adopt some of the technologies which are emerging to put in place clean coal technology which would substantially reduce emissions and ensure continuity of supply. It would also avoid the dilemma of many countries, such as Germany which, partly because the Greens are in government, does not know whether it is in favour of nuclear power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other things happening in countries all over Europe. In the coal industry there is significant research being undertaken into finding ways in which substantial reductions in emissions can be brought about, which would, in effect, ensure we could continue to utilise coal which is available in abundance throughout the world at very economical prices, thereby guaranteeing continuity of supply. This would ensure we would avoid some of the problems associated with pylons about which Deputy Naughten is so worried. Pylons could be replaced, but is the consumer prepared to pay the cost of putting the lines underground? They are not prepared to pay the enormous costs involved, the dilemma which we face. From an environmental and health point of view, we would all like to see the lines placed underground, but the cost would be astronomical and it would not be feasible, profitable or the correct thing to do. The board of the ESB and others can make an effort through new research into wave energy and clean coal technology which could copperfasten our power supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent inquired about CHP and the opinion of the European Union. EU policy is strongly supportive of CHP on the grounds of security of supply and environmental protection arising from its efficiency. CHP will have the same status as wave, wind, biomass and other forms of energy. Deputy Naughten spoke about the necessity for research funding <Col N="55" /> and welcomed the CHP concept. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment operates a research programme for such schemes. I received such a query some months ago which was dealt with by that Department. The availability of EU funding, mentioned by Deputy Daly, could also be examined. I agree that research into alternatives should be ongoing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten spoke about the BMW region which he said is not benefiting in this context. The region will benefit, however, from the gas coming ashore in north Mayo. Deputy Stagg is correct in saying that the matter was put through Cabinet prior to the change of Government. Bord Gais has a statutory mandate to be viable and not go into debt, but the matter has been discussed and it is clear that, because the Government decision indicated that the lines to the north west, midlands, etc., were to be put in place, arrangements will have to be made to allow this to happen. Having brought the matter to Cabinet I can state categorically that Bord Gais has been informed of the Cabinet decision from which the BMW region will benefit most.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg said that this is an important section and his welcome is somewhat wary. We should have had much more time on Committee Stage to go through these issues, but it is now beneficial and we are doing things not quite in line with the direction towards which we were being guided&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding combined heat and power, will the Minister ask the ESB, in the light of the passing of the Bill, to review the construction of pylons?</P>
      <P>The one closest to me runs from Flagford in north Roscommon to Shranagh in south Sligo. That pylon is a 220kv voltage and will benefit neither north Roscommon nor south Sligo. It is designed to supply power to the north-west, Sligo and Donegal. With combined heat and power and the fact&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle gives me an opportunity I will explain how it <Col N="56" /> relates specifically to the amendment with which we are dealing. Now that the gas is going to service the north-west and that we have opened up combined heat and power, it would be an ideal vehicle to supply electricity to Sligo and the north-west. This power line would then be obsolete. Construction would not need to go ahead because we would have combined heat and power. I believe the same applies in Cork. I ask the Minister to discuss with the ESB the practicality of going ahead with the construction of such pylons because we now have the combined heat and power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her clarification on the implications of the amendment. With the shortcomings in the grid, there is a considerable amount of work to be done before renewable energy can benefit in the same way as CHP, and that is a disadvantage for a start. Unlike other countries, we do not operate a fossil fuel levy. Renewable energy has to operate when the costs of fossil fuel generation are not internalised. Some of us wonder how they will be paid when the Kyoto obligations kick in. They are not being levied where the problem is created.</P>
      <P>We still have a 12.5% VAT rate on renewable energy technology, compared to 5% in the UK. There is a reluctance in the Department of Finance to change that. I do not think there is a level playing pitch. I fear CHP will move into primary position, but I hope I will be proved wrong. Our dependence on fossil fuel, whether it be CHP or any other type of clean coal technology, as Deputy Daly said, will still be a reliance on imported fossil fuel. Ultimately, this puts us in a vulnerable position. We need to plan for the long-term and ensure renewable energy is not jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We should distinguish between renewables and alternatives. We are talking about alternative forms of energy production, the category into which CHP falls. Wind energy and all other renewables fall into the same category. They are alternatives. The EU describes them as alternatives rather than renewables. We should not mix up that.</P>

In case people believe CHP will take the place of everything else, may I tell the House that since 1999 CER has licensed 12 CHP plants. The largest of these are ten megawatts, run by Glanbia and Dairygold for their own use. The remainder are smaller, ranging from two megawatts to six megawatts.

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of Business (Resumed). - Agriculture" RHead="Appeals Bill, 2001 : Second Stage">
    <Title>Order of Business (Resumed). - Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House today. It has already been considered by the Seanad and some useful amendments were made in the Upper House. It is a non-contentious Bill and I was pleased to accept those amendments. The Bill is designed to implement a commitment I gave to the farming community by improving the system for considering appeals. The Bill is a relatively short and straightforward one. Its purpose is to further improve the service my Department provides to its clients by strengthening the rights of recourse available to farmers wishing to challenge decisions made by the Department regarding their entitlement to benefit under any of the direct payment schemes.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware that my Department runs a well established appeals unit which has been considering appeals in relation to the headage and premium schemes since 1995. The purpose of this Bill is to reinforce the independence of that service by putting it on a statutory basis and to widen the range of schemes coming within its remit. I am fully satisfied with the competence and impartiality of the existing appeals unit, but I want to ensure that the service is accepted unequivocally by the farming community as independent of the decision-making process within the Department.</P>
    <P>It was for that purpose that a commitment was included in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to &ldquo;establish on a statutory basis, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an independent, accessible and properly resourced appeals unit whose remit will include all FEOGA schemes paying directly to individual farmers&rdquo;. I have taken the opportunity to include within the scope of the new office not only all these schemes, but also all relevant nationally funded schemes. I am also taking the opportunity to implement an undertaking I have given to the Oireachtas, by making provision for the input of the appeals office into my decision-making on whether to refuse or revoke a certificate of approval under the national beef assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Moving to more recent events, Deputies will recall that when we discussed the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill in this House on 8 March last, following representations from all <Col N="59" /> sides of the House, I gave an undertaking that I would make provision in the Agriculture Appeals Bill for an appeals system for dealers. I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to honour this commitment. Following the signing into law of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, I made a statutory instrument introducing a system for the approval and registration of dealers and their premises. Under this order, dealers must be approved and registered and their premises must be approved by my Department before they can trade in animals or poultry.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the revocation, suspension or refusal to register a person as a dealer if the requirements for approval and registration are not met. As I have stated previously, the aim of these new measures is to bring better order to the operation and regulation of dealers. In particular, it will restrict the activities of so-called &ldquo;rogue dealers&rdquo; which are to the detriment of legitimate trading in animals and poultry. My amendment on Committee Stage will allow the new agriculture appeals office to examine appeals where the Department is proposing to revoke, suspend or refuse a dealer's registration or approval.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will receive this Bill in the spirit in which it is proposed, that is, as a measure to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the appeals process, an objective that is shared by all. This is not a particularly complex Bill and most of its provisions are self-explanatory. I propose to give a short commentary on the main points and to set out the rationale behind them where this would be helpful.</P>
    <P>I have taken particular care to build on the model already laid down in statute in respect of the social welfare appeals office, which has been operating effectively since it was established in 1990. I intend that the agriculture appeals office, with the approval of the Oireachtas, will follow very closely the model laid down by the social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>The independence of the new agriculture appeals office is its crucial aspect. While the staff of the office will be recruited from the general Civil Service and its funding will, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, be provided from within my Department's Vote, this Bill provides that its operational independence will be total. Here again I have been guided by the successful precedent established by the social welfare appeals office, whose organisational status is identical to that now proposed for the agriculture appeals office.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the appointment of appeals officers by the Minister. Their function will be to make determinations on appeals made by affected persons against decisions taken by the Department in respect of the relevant schemes. Affected persons means, of course, farmers who have applied under the relevant schemes &ndash; those schemes are set out in the Schedule to the Act. <Col N="60" /> The Schedule lists 28 schemes and consists of all the direct payment schemes currently in operation, together with their immediate predecessors where there has recently been a substantial change in the structure or name of a scheme. The practical benefit of this provision is that all the direct payment schemes can now be considered by the appeals officers. It has been an undoubted limitation of the current appeals unit within my Department that it can consider only the headage and premium.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to extend that coverage to include such other major schemes as the rural environment protection scheme and the early retirement scheme, as well as the range of smaller schemes, still very important, designed notably to facilitate on-farm investment. The list of schemes can be expected to evolve as the structure of direct payment schemes evolves.</P>
    <P>Appeals officers shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of their functions. This is the core of the Bill. Decisions taken by the office will be binding on the Department. There will be no ministerial or departmental authority to intervene in the decision-making process. Managerial accountability will, however, be preserved by the requirement that the chief appeals officer shall submit an annual report to the Minister and provide such other information as the Minister may require. In this way the Minister can inform himself or herself as to the position in relation to the management, organisation and staffing of the office, and make changes in those areas if he or she considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>Collectively the appeals officers and their support staff will be known as the agriculture appeals office. Again following the practice in respect of the social welfare appeals office, the word &ldquo;office&rdquo; is not built into the Act but will nonetheless be the name of the organisation in its everyday operations and will be the name appearing on the letterhead and so on. The office will be headed up by a chief appeals officer who will be designated by the Minister. The chief appeals officer will be the director of the office. He or she will also have a deputy, again to be designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not go into the details of the appeals procedure, providing instead that, as in the social welfare appeals office, these will be laid down by regulations. These regulations are now almost complete and will be published shortly after the enactment of this Bill on the assumption that the Oireachtas will indeed approve it. Gearing the appeals office up into action will not be delayed for lack of procedural regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill expressly provides, however, for the holding of oral hearings in private and stipulates that an appeals officer, when considering an appeal, may decide the case as if for the first time. That is, he or she is not restricted to considering the grounds on which the original decision was made. The appeals officer will, therefore, be able to take a broad view. Section 8(4) of the Bill provides that the decision on an appeal shall be made <Col N="61" /> as soon as practicable, having regard to any guidelines laid down in this regard by the Minister. It is my strong concern that appeals should be processed as quickly as possible. The guidelines that I will issue in this connection will, therefore, tend towards a short interval for deciding appeals rather than a long one.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I envisage a turnaround period of 12 weeks, which is a reasonably tight interval in the circumstances, but I am reluctant to stipulate a precise deadline for all appeals. Deputies will recognise that cases vary in complexity and it would, I am satisfied, be imprudent to insist that a statutory appeals process should deliver a result within a timetable which would not in all cases be realistic. In preparing the guidelines, my concern will be to minimise the time taken to process an average appeal, while recognising that certain complex cases will take longer.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that, subject to exceptions to which I shall refer, the decision of an appeals officer shall be final and conclusive. The purpose of this provision is to ensure finality in the matter within a reasonable period. The appeals office will be an expert tribunal with statutory responsibility to determine the matters referred to it. By the end of the appeals process, the application will have been considered in depth twice by specialist officers, having been initially considered by the deciding officer whose decision is being appealed, and a presumption of accuracy and reasonableness must attach to the decision emerging from that process.</P>
    <P>Mistakes are of course made and that is the reason for the existence of an appeals mechanism in the first place. Mistakes can also be made in the course of the appeals process itself, but this is very rare. An appellant may nonetheless take the view that the appeals process was vitiated by a mistake of law, or unreasonableness, or lack of fair procedures. In those cases, the appellant may appeal the decision of the appeals officer to the High Court. Provision is also made for internal revision of a decision within the office, either when new evidence comes to light or the director considers that the decision was wrong because of error of fact or of law.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is primarily concerned with direct payment schemes and paying cash entitlements to eligible applicants, I have taken the opportunity to widen the scope and confer on the appeals office functions in relation to the national beef assurance scheme. This scheme operates under the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act, 2000. The core of that Act is the laying down of a requirement on the part of every herdowner wishing to trade in beef that he or she obtain from the Minister a certificate of approval to do so. Where the Minister proposes to refuse such a certificate he or she must give notice to the herdowner of that intention. Section 15(2) of the National Beef Assurance Act provides that the herdowner may, on receipt of such notice, make representations to the Minister within 14 days of the date of issue of the ministerial notification. <Col N="62" /> Section 16(2) of the Act provides for similar giving of notice and right to make representations where the Minister intends to revoke a certificate already issued.</P>
    <P>In the course of the passage of the National Beef Assurance Act through the Dáil I gave a commitment to bring within the remit of the appeals office the question of the refusal or revocation of a certificate of approval. I have come to the view that the best way to ensure the effective input of the appeals office is to provide that any representations which the Minister may receive under section 15(2) or 16(2) of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act must be referred by him or her as soon as may be to the director of the appeals office for advice and that before deciding whether to proceed with the refusal or revocation the Minister must have regard to the director's advice which must be delivered within 28 days.</P>
    <P>Putting in place a statutory appeals mechanism under the Act has the effect of taking all the schemes coming within the ambit of the appeals office out of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. This is the inevitable result of section 5 of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, which precludes the Omudsman from any role in relation to matters in respect of which there is an independent statutory right of appeal. That would be an unsatisfactory outcome, given the valuable functions the Ombudsman performs in protecting the rights of the recipients of public services. For that reason I am making provision for the retention by the Ombudsman of his functions in relation to the relevant schemes. This is achieved by adding appeals officers under the Bill to the First Schedule of the Ombudsman Act, 1980. The appeals officers will thereby become persons whose decisions may be investigated by the Ombudsman in the normal way. Preserving the Ombudsman's role in this way is consistent with my intention, to which the Bill gives expression, that the establishment of the agricultural appeals office will reinforce the rights of recourse available to clients of my Department where they are dissatisfied with the Department's decisions on applications they have made.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning in this connection that the Bill provides that the reasons for the decision made by the appeals officer shall be notified in writing to the appellant. This provision may not be strictly necessary, in that the appellant has the right under section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and, probably, also in common law. Nonetheless, it is useful to state it expressly in the present context to reinforce the openness of the procedures I am seeking the approval of the Oireachtas to enshrine in statute.</P>
    <P>The appeals mechanism I propose in the Bill goes beyond the valuable customer response facilities provided by the Department. It is, probably, worthwhile to refer briefly to this wider context. My Department has been innovative in drawing up and implementing customer services programmes. As well as the customer service action plan, my Department, in conjunction with <Col N="63" /> farming representative organisations, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has agreed a protocol on direct payment schemes. These initiatives are evidence that the Department is committed to providing a professional and client friendly service. Demanding deadlines for making payments have been laid down and, by and large, met. The targets in the current protocol extend beyond rigorous payment deadlines into procedures for the conduct of inspections. This country is acknowledged as being among the European leaders in these respects.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of appeals, the question of the severity of penalties comes to mind. I share what I know is the view of a number of Deputies that some penalties which the Department is required to impose are harsh. On foot of a commitment given in the protocol on direct payments I raised the question of simplification of the CAP, with particular reference to proportionality of penalties, at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. Following from a Council request late last year, the Commission has established a working group representative of all member states, including Ireland, to look at how the CAP arrangements can be simplified. My Department has made a vigorous approach to the Commission, in which it was supported by our UK and French colleagues, arguing that the reasonableness and proportionality of certain penalties be investigated with a view to ensuring farmers are not unduly penalised for relatively minor defaults. A separate working group is being established with the remit of recasting the regulation governing penalties. I am convinced that the overall arrangements can be simplified by making more use of database information in the processing of applications. I do not want to give the impression, however, that it will be an easy task to bring about a change of policy in relation to the proportionality of penalties at European level. The institutions have shown that they are difficult to convince on these issues.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the appeals officers will be appointed and assume their functions and that the director and deputy director will be designated very soon after the enactment of the Bill, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas. I am anxious to give visible and practical effect to the commitment I have given the farming community and get the new office into full swing without delay. I repeat my concern to provide the farming community with an appeals mechanism which will meet its demand for visible independence, wide scheme coverage and prompt attention. To establish that mechanism is the purpose of this Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill and approve of the objectives the Minister has set out for us. I know the farming community will be happy to see arrangements of this kind being put in place. The Bill has been debated in the Seanad where it was examined in some detail. There are, <Col N="64" /> however, some fundamental aspects which still puzzle me on which the Minister has not shed any new light today.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that an appeals system is in place in his Department. The Bill makes this system more formal and gives it a statutory basis, but it still does not bring it outside the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Minister states that he will proceed on the same basis as the social welfare appeals office, except that the agricultural appeals office will not be an office. It will be called an office in the same way that the social welfare appeals office is called an office, but it will not have a separate statutory existence. It will be a collection of people under the aegis of the Department who will perform certain functions.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain his reluctance to establish an office? The people at whom it is directed would like to see a truly independent appeals mechanism. If the Minister wants &ndash; as he says he does &ndash; to have a truly independent appeals mechanism he should establish an independent office, separate from his Department. Let the office be under the aegis of his Department and the Minister be the one who accounts for the Vote and the Accounting Officer in the Minister's Department be the one who accounts for the money, but I cannot understand the reason we do not have a separate office.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he is following the practice of the social welfare appeals office, but he has not explained the reason for this. It is not enough for him to say that he is establishing an office which will not really be an office because that is what was done for social welfare. That is not an explanation. It would be more satisfactory and clearer to the people who will be relying on this structure to have their appeals heard if the office was clearly a separate one.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going to some lengths to make sure the operation of the office is independent, to involve people who will be seen to be independent and to establish a structure which will operate independently. Section 2, however, provides that the Minister may appoint such and so many of his or her officers &ldquo;or other persons holding positions within the Civil Service&rdquo; to be appeals officers for the purpose of the Bill. I am sure the House will approve the Minister's intention to go beyond the confines of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in establishing the appeals mechanism, but I suggest that the Civil Service is not the only repository of wisdom, expertise and knowledge of these issues. I am sure there are people outside the Civil Service who could perform satisfactorily as appeals officers in the structure being established.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister has given any consideration to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago we debated the Agricultural Diseases (Amendment) Act. Under the provisions of that Act the Minister proposes to appoint many authorised officers. Unless my memory is cheating me I do not think the persons <Col N="65" /> to be appointed as authorised officers under the terms of that Act are necessarily limited to people in the Civil Service. I see no reason the Minister should cut himself off from the possibility of finding people outside the Civil Service who could carry out the job required by this Bill. I am not making a special plea for any particular group because I am quite sure the mechanisms that exist in the Civil Service system for making appointments on merit and independently, would be capable of dealing with applicants for this type of job from outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There are a large number of people with qualifications of one kind or another in agriculture that could well be relevant to the kind of work that this office will undertake working in the private sector and in various organisations around the country. I cannot see a good reason for not allowing for the possibility that such people might want to apply for employment in the Agriculture Appeals Office. In terms of its structure I would like to see a formally and statutorily separate office that would have clear distance between it and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and which would be able to draw on a wider pool than the Civil Service for its staff. I do not think any of those things is in conflict with what the Minister is setting out to do. All those things would reinforce what the Minister is seeking to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about his intentions in relation to the turnaround, the speed with which appeals referred to this office will be dealt with. He said in the Seanad and again today that he envisages a period of 12 weeks. He does not want to specify a period because he thinks there may be some cases that could not be dealt with in 12 weeks. He said: &ldquo;It would be imprudent to insist that a statutory appeals process should deliver a result within a timetable which would not in all cases be realistic&rdquo;. I do not accept that. That is most unsatisfactory. During the debate in the Seanad the Minister referred to the fact that in the case of An Bord Pleanála time frames are laid down for dealing with appeals and they are honoured far more in the breach than in the observance. The Minister rightly said that gives rise to frustrations and so on and he does not want that to happen here. He then takes the easy way out; so as not to frustrate people he gives them no target. It would be far better if he decided to avoid frustrating people by setting targets and adhering to them.</P>
    <P>A period of 12 weeks for the kind of issues mentioned here is a long time. This is a period of three months during which people would have to wait for a decision on: cattle headage scheme in more severely handicapped areas, the EU extensification premium scheme, the EU slaughter premium scheme, the EU special beef premium scheme, the EU suckler cow premium scheme, the farm improvement programme and all the schemes listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to note I am not critical of or nasty to anybody, I am merely stating what I <Col N="66" /> believe to be facts. If a person has to wait three months for a decision on the EU extensification premium scheme that can be dramatic. All these schemes can involve substantial sums of money. Given that the Minister said his expectation is that if there is a difficulty with any of these and it ends up in the appeals office he envisages it could take 12 weeks to make a decision, he will visit substantial hardship on some of the people who will be looking to the appeals office to vindicate their rights, because that is what it is for. People will have to wait. I say without any malice, that there are some cases where if decisions were made within 12 weeks it would be a decided improvement on what is happening now. I am not sure if the compensation schemes are included here but no doubt we shall get to that on Committee Stage. There have been cases where animals have been slaughtered under various diseases Acts and regulations and where people have waited longer than 12 weeks for decisions to be made and compensation to be paid. Twelve weeks is a long time, it is a quarter of a year and half a growing season and is a long time in the business of running a farm. I am unhappy with the idea that the Minister will not specify a period of 12 weeks. I know there will be cases that will be complicated and there will be cases where there will be room for argument and various expert witnesses will have to be called and so on but the majority of cases will be more straightforward. The Minister should be more ambitious and envisage a period of less than 12 weeks and should make specific provision for a target period for the determination of appeals and put it into the legislation. It would not be imprudent to do that and would be a substantial comfort for people who are looking at the scheme as a way of vindicating their rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for oral hearings of appeals and that they be held in private. I agree with that provision. During the course of the debate in the Seanad the Minister was asked, and he replied affirmatively, if there would be the possibility for persons whose appeals are being heard to be accompanied at an oral hearing by a person who could be of assistance to them, an adviser of some kind, even perhaps a public representative in the same way as those going before the social welfare appeals office are occasionally accompanied. Not everybody is as good an advocate as he or she might be in his or her own cause. However, that is not provided for in the Bill. I wonder whether it would be wiser to provide specifically in the Bill that those making appeals would have the right to be accompanied by an adviser. The Minister will probably say he is worried about this and that he does not want to get into a situation where people would be accompanied by lawyers, that he wants to keep it out of the hands of lawyers because at the end of the day there is the possibility of an appeal to the High Court. I agree with that. It would be a pity, and the same applies in the social welfare appeals system, if people were accompanied by solicitors. That would put the <Col N="67" /> whole matter into a different framework from what is envisaged. It would be useful to specify in the legislation that persons making appeals would have the right to be accompanied by an adviser. It would do no violence to the intention of the scheme to provide for such a provision in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the explanation of decisions. It is important that an explanation given for a decision is as full as possible. I do not know if we need to be more specific than the provisions in section 10 and we can examine this issue on Committee Stage. However, the more information people are given about decisions the better, whether or not the decisions are favourable or unfavourable. If a decision is unfavourable to the interests of the appellant it is more necessary to provide a detailed explanation so people can be satisfied that the grounds for the decision were sound.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for making regulations. The Minister will use sections 15 and 16 to make regulations which will set out the way in which this procedure will operate. However, section 16 includes a particular form of order and regulation. It provides that such orders and regulations are to be laid before the House and that if a resolution annulling the order is made within the next 21 days on which the House sits, then the order shall be annulled.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows what I will say next. In 20 years in this House I have not ever seen an order annulled or a case in which an order made under this kind of provision was brought before the House. I am not one to accuse Ministers or even this dreadful Government of bad faith. However, this form of order is very handy for the Government. The only way in which an order can be brought before the House is if the Government includes it in the Order of Business. A Government which makes an order will not bring it before the House in case Members wish to annul it. This means the House has no opportunity to review measures taken under such an order.</P>
    <P>I am confirmed in my long-standing prejudice on this issue by S.I. 79/2001 &ndash; The Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001, (Approval and Registration of Dealers and Dealers' Premises) Order, 2001. When we discussed the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, Deputy Penrose and I expressed concern about the content of this order which I will come to in a few minutes. The order was made under a provision such as section 16 of this Bill. It is not by any parliamentary astuteness or concern on the part of the Government for clarity and transparency on these issues that I have the chance to say anything about that statutory instrument. I can do so only because of the happy accident that we are discussing the Agricultural Appeals Bill and because the Minister, to be fair to him, agreed to include the provisions regarding dealers in the scope of the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's amendment in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> Orders to be made under this Bill to give effect to the appeals procedure will cover some areas which will be important for ordinary people just as the statutory instrument is important for people's day-to-day lives. It is not enough to suggest that all orders cannot be brought before the House as they would clog up the Order Paper. I have heard this comment time and again. Every time I raise this issue from the Opposition benches I am told the Minister's advice is that we cannot allow all of these orders to clog up the Order Paper but that the important orders will be brought before the House. However, as a result, important orders such as SI 79/2001 and those in the Bill are made under a passive procedure and the House does not have an opportunity to discuss them.</P>
    <P>As a result we are left with orders such as those regarding dealers and the appeals system, and legislators have to tell people that the Minister and the Department are entitled to take certain measures which we did not ever have a chance to debate in the Houses. This is not good enough. The Minister must amend section 16 on Committee Stage and at least provide that some of the principal orders will have to be debated and passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas before they can be made. This should have been the case with the order concerning dealers. I am not happy with section 16.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not table an amendment on Committee Stage I will do so. I will ride my hobby-horse over every fence the Minister can put up and ask him to accept the good faith of the position I will put forward, which I am sure will be supported by the Labour Party. I hope the Minister will accept that we wish to include this proposal, not because we do not trust those who draft these orders, but because we, as legislators, will have to explain, and perhaps defend, the provisions in the orders.</P>
    <P>Why have disease eradication schemes not been included within the scope of the Bill? Many of these schemes include technical issues but there are other issues and cases which do not require an immediate highly expert and skilled veterinary decision. There are cases when farmers should have an opportunity to argue back because not all decisions made under the various disease eradication schemes are necessarily open and shut cases. We may find that issues which arise under these schemes could properly and legitimately be included within the scope of an appeals system.</P>
    <P>Section 7 concerns additional functions connected to appeals which the Minister may, again by order, confer on the director or appeals officers. What is the reason for this provision? Why does the Minister think he may wish to confer additional functions on these people? He may argue that we may not necessarily know all of the things we may wish to do and that he wishes to leave room for such matters in the future. However, he should try to be as all-embracing as <Col N="69" /> possible when he brings the scheme before the House.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot specify any additional functions why is the section included? If we delete the section and subsequently discover that additional functions are needed, would it not be as easy to bring an appropriate amendment to the legislation before the House? I do not like the idea of giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to make orders adding additional functions under this passive procedure. The Taoiseach seems to have a fondness for signing blank cheques but we should not behave in such a manner as regards legislation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the interesting provision in section 11? Perhaps we can examine this issue on Committee Stage. The section states, &ldquo;An appeals officer may, at any time revise any decision of an appeals officer&rdquo;. Which appeals officer? Will an appeals officer have the right to revise his or her own decisions? Does the Minister envisage that decisions of appeals officers will be scrutinised by a third party? I am in favour of such checks and opinions regarding decisions. While I am really puzzled to find that an appeals officer may revise any decision of an appeals officer without any further specification, I am very happy with section 11(2) under which the director can, at any time, revise any decision of an appeals officer. This is entirely proper and in its proper place in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that persons who remain unhappy with a decision may appeal that decision or a revised decision, as the case may be, to the High Court on any question of law. I may be wrong, but I detect a difference with what the Minister said today. He said that there would be an appeal to the High Court on matters of law, reasonableness and fair procedures. I cannot find the appropriate reference in his speech, but I am sure he will agree that it is there. I was happy to hear him say that there would be an appeal on the basis of points of law, reasonableness and fair procedures. The Bill states baldly, however, that an appeal may be made to the High Court on any question of law, but there is no mention of reasonableness or fair procedures. If the Minister is of the view that reasonableness and fair procedures should be added, I would agree, but the text of the Bill does not ensure they would be covered.</P>
    <P>I note the provision in and intention of section 18 to make sure that the Ombudsman will continue to have jurisdiction to deal with cases that come under the provisions of the Bill. It is, probably, a belt and braces and safety pin operation, but it would be useful if the Bill stated specifically that recourse to the Ombudsman will continue to be open to those who will use the procedure to be established.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of dealers, whom the Minister agreed we should add. It seems that it will, at least, require an addition to the Schedule to the Bill. I emphasise how important it is that we do this. I spent some time looking <Col N="70" /> through the statutory instrument and, although the question of premises, for example, is dealt with in four different places, I cannot find any clear definition of what is expected of people in terms of the premises they are required to have. It is all judged, deemed or found to be adequate and so on. There is no specification or provision for anything measurable. It refers to appropriate facilities of sufficient capacity and which must be easy to clean and disinfect; an appropriate reception area for litter and manure; an appropriate system for collecting wastewater, and making sure that premises are clean and disinfected before use, as may be required by an official veterinarian, but there is nothing concrete or clear on which one can get one's hands and whereby one can say that if one wants to become a dealer, one must conform to the standards laid down. This will create a difficulty.</P>
    <P>There are also provisions for the approval and registration of dealers. A certificate purporting to be signed by a person authorised by the Minister to certify certain matters, without proof of either the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate that he or she is so authorised, shall be evidence unless the contrary is shown. That is a standard provision. I revert to what we said when we discussed the Diseases of Animals Act. I would like authorised persons to have a form of authorisation which identifies them clearly. The Minister agrees with me that a photograph would be useful, but I have not heard of any action being taken.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the statutory instrument for revocation and suspension are draconian. There is a provision under which a licence can be revoked where the Minister is satisfied that the provisions relating to premises and so on will not be complied with by an applicant. It is one thing to establish that they are not being complied with, but I do not know how one will establish that they will not be complied with. That is a draconian measure. There is a provision under which the Minister can revoke a licence without any reference or communication with the person whose licence is being revoked. That being the case, it is essential that we provide in the Bill for the inclusion of this procedure within the scope of the appeals procedure. That, however, is not enough. When we come to review other legislation, I will want to take a closer look at the way in which these provisions are written for dealers.</P>
    <P>We are at the point where we are all very annoyed at the activities of a certain number of individuals who have taken huge risks with the health of our animal population and economy. We cannot, however, tar them all with the same brush. We need a procedure that is fair, open and comprehensible to those involved. We all hope we will soon return to a situation where there can be normal trade in animals and animal products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing time with Deputy Wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I welcome the Minister and this important Bill. I have always been a strong proponent and advocate of a totally independent appeals system for which I have made the case in this House, but everybody did not share my enthusiasm for such a system. Some argued that it should be kept within the confines of the Department. I was amazed by what I considered to be an illogical thought process, but nothing surprises me as regards people's views. I do not know where their logic gets them. I heard people say that I was very eager to rush to an independent system. I would also like to see an independent method of payment of all grants, as distinct from an independent appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments were proposed in the Seanad by my Labour Party colleague, Senator O'Meara. The Minister took some of them on board and the Bill has been strengthened as a result. For a short time I was a member of the SMI group under the chairmanship of the great Deputy Roche during which we looked at the Department. I may be wrong and hope I am not misrepresenting the situation, but I was of the view that there was a reluctance on the part of the Department to have an independent appeals mechanism. I could be wrong and I am prepared to be judged as such. I do not know the reason I thought that, but I used to hear people say that the European Commission might not agree with the putting in place of an independent appeals system which I thought was peculiar. I agree with Deputy Dukes that the office should be totally independent. The office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is totally independent, staffed independently of any Department and a good model, but I will not obstruct the Bill in so far as we have made substantial progress in reaching this stage.</P>
    <P>This is an uncomplicated Bill which is modelled extremely closely on the independent appeals mechanism available under the social welfare code to recipients of social welfare and other such benefits particularly aggrieved by a decision furnished on an application by a servant or agent of the Department. I have no doubt the thrust of the legislation will lead to a significant improvement in the climate for the consideration of appeals by farmers who will feel their rights are greatly enhanced if they wish to challenge decisions made by the Department regarding their entitlement to benefit under any of the schemes administered by it. There has been a major extension in the number of schemes that will be considered by the appeals unit.</P>
    <P>However, I predicate such assumption on the basis that the farming community will be happy and content with the independence of the appeals system that will be put in place. I appreciate there is an appeals unit in the Department which comprises six or seven officials. I know some of them well and I compliment them on their hard work and courtesy to people who ring on a consistent and persistent basis. They work extremely hard and they are very competent. The introduction of <Col N="72" /> the legislation is not a reflection on them but I have always been a strong proponent of the independence or the neamhspláchas of the appeals mechanism. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>While I do not question the impartiality of the unit or the people working in it, nevertheless it was perceived as self-contained or an extension of the Department. It is important that the farming community which avails of the appeals system is fully satisfied that the proposed unit will be completely independent of the decision making process in the Department.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the appeals unit is established on a statutory basis following the passage of the legislation. The unit will have quasi-judicial functions. The legislation implies any administrative decision made on foot of a decision by the deciding officer or the appeals officer must be informed by the principles of natural justice, such as <i>nemo iudex in causa sua, audi alterum parten</i>, a fair hearing to all the parties involved and the right to have untrammelled access to all the documents upon which the original decision was based. Perhaps, as Deputy Dukes said, that may need to be explicitly stated for the sake of clarity.</P>
    <P>The relevant regulations must be strictly applied, as Deputy Dukes said, but this cannot be done if they are so clouded in ambiguity that they are open to several interpretations. The problem is the legislation is not clear and I agree with him that lawyers will be involved. Lawyers should not be on the ground helping people to get what is rightfully theirs in the first instance but they will become involved if there is ambiguity and a lack of clarity. Lawyers are trained to argue ambiguous statements in favour of their clients.</P>
    <P>The unit will be accessible, which is important, and it must be fully resourced. Reasoned decisions must be given, as Deputy Dukes said. It is no use sending one liners to farmers such as &ldquo;Alan Dukes, we do not agree that you are entitled under the scheme to a grant&rdquo;. The unit will have to set out why the decision was made and under which regulations it was reached, otherwise farmers will be able to argue a point of law in the High Court. If the decision is bad because of a lack of clarity or a failure to give the reasons, it will be subject to judicial review for failing to observe the principles of natural justice. This is an important mechanism and that is probably why Deputy Dukes and many Senators argued cogently for the unit to be totally independent. The High Court will review the decision on the basis on the reasons for it and whether natural justice was observed.</P>
    <P>I am glad the opportunity has been taken to widen the original intended scope of this new office to include all schemes, both national and European, which are payable to farmers. During the debates on the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act, 1999, and the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, we, in Opposition, insisted that an appeal would have to lie to this appeals body against the revocation or refusal of <Col N="73" /> licences or certificates applicable under either scheme. It is important that the jurisdiction of the appeals board will also comprehend both schemes within this legislation.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister insist that none of the staff of the appeals office could be recruited from outside the Department? The Minister has amended that provision to cover the wider public service but, as Deputy Dukes said, many people from other walks of life could be equally adept and informed to act as appeals officers. A total of 28 schemes are set out in the schedule under which appeals can be made to the appeals board where the farmer disagrees with the decision furnished in respect of his application.</P>
    <P>This is a major step forward in terms of the scope and extent of the appeals procedure which up to now dealt with the consideration of appeals under the headage and premium schemes. It will be extremely useful in so far as appeals can be lodged under REPS, the early retirement scheme and the other on-farm investment schemes. It is especially important to fully appreciate the independence of the appeals officers in the discharge of their functions and the performance of their duties and their decisions will be fully binding on the Department. The Minister has emphasised their independence but, nevertheless, he could have provided that the board was completely independent of the Department.</P>
    <P>The regulations which lay down the tram lines within which the appeals procedure will operate should be brought before the House so that we might have an opportunity to debate and have an input into same. I reiterate Deputy Duke's comments regarding the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, regulations. They have been introduced but we did not have an opportunity to debate them. It is no use laying them before the House for 21 days until the statutory instrument becomes law and they are foisted on people without any legislative input from Members of the House. That is not a proper way to treat this legislative forum.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the legislation will impinge on farmers' livelihoods because the regulations will set out the steps that must be taken to ensure farmers get what is rightfully theirs at the end of the day. Given our practical experience in the operation of the social welfare appeals mechanism, Members could make useful suggestions and amendments to any regulations which are introduced under section 16.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of the appeals procedure will be the holding of oral hearings which will permit the affected person or persons to give oral evidence <i>viva voce</i>. They will not be constrained to the grounds on which the decision was made. They will be able to expand and extrapolate on same and that will, therefore, broaden the scope of the appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>Section 8(4) provides that the decision on appeal shall be made as soon as practicable. The regulations should specify a period within which the decision should be made. A period of eight <Col N="74" /> weeks would be appropriate. I agree with the Minister that the thrust of the legislation should be to minimise the time taken to process an appeal. Everybody accepts that some appeals are more complex than others but a time limit should be provided.</P>
    <P>That puts the onus on the people hearing the appeal to do it within a defined time period and to give the result. Each appeal will have a significant impact on the appellant concerned. People have appealed because they have been denied something, which they believe to be theirs, due to a different interpretation on the part of the deciding officer. That means money. In an environment where money is critical, particularly in the current farming situation, a rigorous time constraint must be put on the hearing of appeals and the issuing of results.</P>
    <P>In January 2000 a farmer in my constituency made an appeal with regard to his REPS payment. A 100% fine was levied in respect of the removal of a small portion of blackthorn bushes. They had to be removed to ensure his animals would not stray on to his neighbour's lands. If he permitted them to do so, it would have been a serious contravention of the disease control regulations. This is a situation of which even Humpty Dumpty would not be proud. The incongruity and incorrectness of the decision is evident. There were two schemes in conflict. Today, 15 months later, there has not been a decision on the man's appeal. That is scandalous. I raised the issue in the Dáil previously and was told first that the decision would be made in January and, later, that it would be made in February. That shows scant respect for that farmer. He is a bachelor farmer who lives alone on a dry stock farm and is dependent on REPS income to sustain his holding.</P>
    <P>That is the reason this appeals Bill is before the House. I cannot understand why this should be the result of pulling a few blackthorn bushes out and erecting a fence to prevent cattle from entering a water course or going on to a neighbour's land. The man refrained from touching furze adjacent to the bank. I have the details of the case with me. The works were the minimum necessary to comply with the Department's disease prevention regulations, which are more important than the whims of somebody who subjectively says the farmer is not entitled to his grant. That is the type of thing that led to the Dáil debating this Bill.</P>
    <P>Fifteen months later, the man has not received the results of his appeal. That is the reason time constraints must be included in the section. I will not allow anybody to be left hanging in abeyance like my constituent, waiting for a few bob. This man has only 50 or 60 acres of land and this money could be the difference between surviving and not surviving in a rural area. Some people might think I am exaggerating but if they visit parts of Westmeath, they will see it is not exaggeration but fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The National Beef Assurance Act, 2000 provides that every herd owner must have a certificate to participate or trade in the scheme. The Minister can refuse a certificate under section 15(2) or revoke it under section 16(2) of that Act. I note and welcome the Minister's commitment that these decisions will be included under the umbrella of this appeals mechanism. The Ombudsman's function in relation to the schemes is being retained by adding the appeals officers, as designated under the Bill, to the First Schedule of the Ombudsman's Act, 1980. That is important. The decisions of appeals officers might then be open to investigation by the Ombudsman in the usual way.</P>
    <P>My constituent was given a 100% penalty for doing his best under a plan. The severity of the penalties imposed for relatively minor, innocent, innocuous or, at most, negligent errors has been a source of intense dissatisfaction in the farming community. Many of the penalties imposed are unduly harsh and disproportionate. The proportionality of penalties is a fundamental principle of EU law. In the many decisions of the European Court of Justice there is constant emphasis on the fact that proportionality is a fundamental concept. It is like one of the fundamental rights Articles in our Constitution. Losing a full two years' payments for a minor transgression or omission could not be deemed proportionate. I support the Minister's efforts to have this issue resolved.</P>
    <P>Everybody appreciates that premium payments are a significant proportion of farm income. When a deduction is made, therefore, it can be particularly onerous. According to Deputy Dukes, the Bill as drafted does not make the appeals mechanism totally independent of the Department. It must be independent to foster and encourage confidence. This might be achieved by establishing a supervisory or umbrella body to oversee the appeals body. That would reinforce its stand alone nature. Senator Quinn made this proposition in the Seanad. It would ensure the success of the board and that is in all our interests.</P>
    <P>Will the board only examine decisions in a prospective manner or will it deal with matters on a retrospective basis so the case of my constituent could be brought within its remit? If a decision is outstanding for 15 months and is not being attended to, can it be brought to the appeals board or can the board only deal with prospective matters from the passage of the Bill? I would like to bring the case I mentioned before the appeals board and secure a decision on it. I am sure the board would not hold on to the case for 15 months.</P>
    <P>I refer to the disease eradication schemes and the valuation and compensation process and I urge the Minister to bring that within the remit of the board. Why not permit the appeals board to arbitrate in disputes between farmers and the Department, for example, on the valuation of <Col N="76" /> livestock? The culling process has successfully taken place in County Louth. There were plenty of valuers there. Under the disease eradication schemes, stock is compulsorily removed from farms. It is a fairly traumatic experience. That is followed by the tedious process of arguing over the valuations.</P>
    <P>This is particularly the case in the BSE scheme. There is provision for a farmer to bring in an independent valuer but often that involves a major battle with the Department at a vulnerable time. This might be another function for the appeals board. It can be a fundamental dispute. In cases involving the eradication of diseases schemes I would not settle for anything other than a four week time limit for decisions. I can give the example of another farmer in my constituency. His animal was identified with BSE on 6 December. All the animals were taken away on 12 February but he was only paid less than a fortnight ago, after the intercession of the Minister. In that period, the cost to the farmer of the 180 animals, between lost milk and everything else, was more than £20,000 but he did not receive one penny towards it. Need I say more?</P>
    <P>Section 6 enshrines the provision of an independent appeals process but if it is not seen to be independent, it will not work. It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that the framework he establishes is capable of delivering the independence required. He has made a start by extending to the wider public service the pool from which the staff can come. That is a good start. Let us get this process on the road as quickly as possible so nobody will have to wait the length of time some of my constituents have waited for final decisions in relation to what is rightfully theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his approach to the foot and mouth disease crisis. The conservative approach he and his committee have taken in relation to restarting events is the correct one. I am aware that it is hurting many of us, but it has to be done. I congratulate the Minister and with God's help and everyone's assistance we will only have the one case. Having listened to Deputy Penrose, the Minister will not want the first case going to the appeals board to be the Westmeath case. I am sure he will do everything possible in the next few days to get it out of the way before the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the legislation lies in the independence the Minister and the House ensure for it. If one takes the example of the appeals mechanism operating so successfully in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the one aspect highlighted is the independence of the office. On my first visit to one of the hearings I made the fundamental error of referring to all officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I was immediately stopped in my tracks and told that it was an independent office and that the officials dealing with the case were not responsible to that Department, but were totally independent. I hope it will be the <Col N="77" /> same with this appeals mechanism which it is important for the farming community to have. The development of farming has suffered badly in recent years and it is vitally important to have a support mechanism in place for applicants. Those attending hearings should be properly informed about procedures and, as Deputy Dukes said, it is imperative that applicants be allowed to bring someone to speak in support of their applications, be they farmers, members of the IFA or ICMSA or public representatives.</P>
    <P>In all the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs hearings I have attended there has been a cross-section of people present, but farmers may not be in a position to defend their applications given the complexities involved. This cannot be overstressed. A Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs case may just relate to a single payment which does not involve many third parties. In a farming case, the correspondence involved might have to be sought from Brussels. The complications involved for an applicant, no matter how fair an inspector is, might be too much and he or she should have somebody along to give him or her confidence in presenting a case and ensure fair play. That is imperative and I will ask Deputy Penrose to table an amendment to ensure provision is included for the success of the legislation, the reason we are here.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the looseness of sections 10 and 11 which I hope the Minister will tighten on Committee Stage as there are grey areas involved. This is something we do not want, particularly in relation to an appeals mechanism. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but we do not want a situation where an honest person puts his or her case, is told by the deciding officer that payment is due only to be told three or four days later that he or she did not qualify due to some procedure that was not adopted. That has to be sorted out. I agree with Deputy Dukes that something is not right and needs to be straightened out before the Bill passes.</P>
    <P>In many cases one finds publications about such mechanisms are lacking. One often finds people in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who never heard of an oral hearing or assistance for same. When this mechanism is put in place there should be the necessary publicity in the national media and farming journals to ensure the small farmer referred to whom Deputy Penrose referred, as well as the big farmer, is aware of it and how applications can be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the points I have made in relation to sections 10 and 11 as well as to the need for assistance on the day of a hearing. He should take them into account in order that we can discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Ellis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a farmer, I commend the Minister and the Government on their support to the agriculture <Col N="78" /> industry during these difficult times. I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State, officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda, the Army and everyone else involved in fighting the foot and mouth crisis. On a personal note, I thank the Minister's officials for dealing with a situation where culled animals from County Louth were being brought to College Proteins in Nobber, County Meath, a matter about which farmers were very concerned, as was the general public. I thank the officials for their help and assistance over one weekend which enabled me to relay to people in the area that there was no risk to livestock or people.</P>
    <P>The Government has given substantial support to farming which was very necessary due to the variety of unforeseen difficulties which have beset the industry in recent years.</P>
    <P>The work of the farming community is at the root of the country's economic success. The Government's approach to agriculture reflects a strong desire to provide leadership, sensible policies, a regulatory framework and working support to ensure this important industry plays a major role in the economy. Since 1995, the Department's appeals unit has considered appeals on premium and headage payments. The Bill will serve to reinforce the independence of that service. It will be put on a statutory footing and will cater for a wider range of schemes.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of, and can relate to, problems that have arisen. The severity of penalties imposed on the farming community have been very harsh. It is all right when Department officials make mistakes but that is not the case for ordinary farmers. Many bachelor and older farmers never had to complete forms. We all know of cases where bushes or fences have been blown down by the wind but despite the fact that such incidents are beyond the control of farmers, they lose money they are entitled to under the REP scheme. I know of one case where a farmer, anxious to encourage his son to stay in farming, leased a farm for him and got a separate herd number. However, in response to a question on an application form for premium and headage payments he indicated his association with his son's herd, not because of the mixing of cattle but because he was helping him to stay on the land. He was then deprived of his payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened under this and previous Ministers. I know of another case of a farmer who, because he took land in a disadvantaged area for the first time was deprived of his money after completing an application form. Incidents of this kind should not happen. I hope that under the new appeals process those who have made genuine mistakes will not be deprived of their premium or grant payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill affords farmers the right to independent decisions. This means they will be able to <Col N="79" /> challenge decisions made by the Department under the REP schemes. The provisions of the Bill are similar to those governing the social welfare appeals office. The social welfare appeals system has been in operation for over ten years. It is very effective and has the full confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>Modern farming is a business that requires much attention to detail. On many farms the greater part of the income is in the form of subsidies. This requires much paperwork. The older farming generation can have great difficulty in understanding terms and conditions relating to schemes. Numeracy errors, misinterpretation of the regulations and miscalculation will inevitably arise. We are all aware of farmers who have lost subsidies which would have been an essential part of their annual income. The appeals office will deal with these problems on a human basis.</P>
    <P>Farmers applying for payments under the direct payment schemes will be in a position to have their appeals heard by an appeals officer. Every effort will be made to minimise the time taken to assess appeals. Provision is also made in the Bill for the revision of a decision within the office.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and straightforward. It will improve the services offered by the Department and it provides a future right of recourse to farmers who need to challenge decisions under any of the direct payment schemes. The independence of the office is crucial. Decisions taken by it will be binding on the Department. Farmers will be notified in writing by the appeals officers of the reasons any given decision is made.</P>
    <P>While the Bill primarily deals with direct payments to farmers, other functions of the national beef assurance scheme will come within its remit. The Bill will introduce a requirement that every herd owner wishing to trade in beef must obtain a certificate from the Minister. The provision for the retention of the function of the Ombudsman in relation to schemes is another important aspect.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister and his officials to ensure that this new system will work. It is very important, more so now than heretofore, because of the importance of keeping young farmers on the land. We all know how difficult it is for farmers to keep their sons or daughters engaged in agriculture. Last week I was made aware of a planning decision matter involving a farmer's daughter who wished to maintain her involvement in agriculture matters. On application she was refused planning permission. I told the officials involved she was refused because she was a woman. It appears that nowadays women should not be involved in agriculture. I am pleased to note that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has entered the House, although I accept he cannot get involved in planning matters.</P>
    <P>It is very important to keep the sons and daughters of the farming community involved in <Col N="80" /> agriculture. That is why I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strengthening information in recent days on US opposition to the Kyoto Protocol is a matter of deep regret to me. I made my position clear in a statement to this House on the Adjournment on 29 March 2001 and in a press statement I issued on the same day. My concerns about the implications for the necessary international arrangements to tackle the real and growing problem of global climate change are shared by the EU and its member states.</P>
      <P>The strong commitment of EU Heads of State and Government to the Kyoto Protocol as the basis for efficient international action to reduce emissions was also made clear at the meeting in Stockholm of the European Council on 23-24 March 2001.</P>
      <P>Last week I wrote to the US ambassador asking him to convey my position and that of the European Union to his administration. At my request the Irish ambassador in Washington met senior officials at the US State Department to the same end.</P>
      <P>In the light of discussion at the informal meeting of EU Environment Ministers in Sweden last weekend, which I attended, the Swedish Presidency has repeatedly stated that the Kyoto Protocol is still alive and that no individual country has the right to declare a multinational agreement as dead. While the EU Ministers continue to hope that the US will participate in the Kyoto process, the EU intends to maintain its target of ratification of the protocol by 2002, with or without the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will continue to participate constructively in the international negotiations as part of the overall EU position. Within this context I welcome the US intention, working with friends and allies, to develop technologies, market incentives and other creative ways to tackle climate change. This has to inform the final outcome of the US review currently under way and should <Col N="81" /> input to the resumed climate negotiations in July, as the Kyoto Protocol is the only comprehensive basis for achieving these stated US objectives in any realistic timescale.</P>
    <P>It remains essential for Ireland to meet our international climate obligations through intensive implementation of the Government's national climate change strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. We are all disappointed and disillusioned with the announcement by the US last week that it intends to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Listening to the Minister's response, I am conscious of the statements he has made, both here in this Chamber and outside. I also realise that the issue was raised at the weekend in Stockholm.</P>
      <P>There seem to be declarations, statements and hopes, but does the Minister believe that there is any real mechanism whereby the US can be made legally bound by the Kyoto agreement? Was that discussed or is there any framework for going down that avenue?</P>
      <P>If, as it appears, the US can just walk away from the agreement, what will that mean for our strategy which is due to be adopted shortly? Must that be revised? Does the Minister anticipate that, in regard to the agreements on reductions reached in the Kyoto Protocol, the EU basket must now be revised downwards from 8%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way in which the US can be forced to honour the signature it put to the Kyoto Protocol &ndash; that is not the way things are done at international level. Through negotiations, clearly spelling out our position in the EU, talks etc. we and the EU are endeavouring to persuade the US that it should not withdraw from its obligations under this international treaty.</P>
      <P>Among the points we will be putting to the US are that it took almost seven years from the date of the initial talks to get as far as signing the Kyoto Protocol and it was not easy for anybody. The work was continuing and the Deputy will be aware of what happened in The Hague last year when we could not reach consensus on this. That only underlines how difficult the process is. To seek to return to square one, as the US administration of President Bush seems to be talking about, is not realistic. Even close friends and allies of the US have made it clear that they do not think setting aside the Kyoto Protocol is an option. Therefore I hope that the weight of public and international opinion will have some influence on the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of what it would mean if the US pulls out of the Kyoto Protocol and does not agree to participate in it, what the US is saying is that it accepts that climate change is a major problem which must be address but that it will look at addressing it domestically and in a way <Col N="82" /> other than through the Kyoto Protocol. The EU's difficulty in that regard is that there would be no international commitment to reporting regimes or no way of ensuring compliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts by my Department with local authorities it is estimated that needs increased by around 15% between March 1999 and March 2000.</P>
      <P>The next statutory assessment of housing needs is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002 and my Department will shortly establish a working group with key local authority personnel to devise detailed and up-to-date guidelines for local authorities in conducting the next statutory assessment of needs. I intend that these guidelines will be available to local authorities by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given by tackling this need. I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities to expand their housing programmes and to expand overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual programme for the period 2000-03, to assist better forward planning by local authorities and to increase output. This programme provides for 25,000 local authority houses in this four year period. In contrast, in the early 1990s, local authority housing output averaged about 1,000 units per annum.</P>
      <P>The greatly increased targets under the multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the projected almost eightfold increase in voluntary housing output is indicative of the Government's commitment to tackling social housing need. We will do this in a way which is responsive to the volume of needs but also to the range of needs and to the necessity to secure quality social housing provision which contributes to social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are aware that the necessary <Col N="83" /> funding for their housing programme is in place and there is no impediment on this front. For example, capital funding for the provision of local authority housing in 2001 increased by over 44% on the original provision in 2000 and by almost 150% since 1997. There is now strong evidence that local authorities are increasing activity. I believe that the multi-annual housing programme will be implemented successfully and we will achieve targeted output over the four year period of the programme.</P>
    <P>From details of the construction-acquisition programmes submitted by local authorities to my Department, I expect authorities to complete or acquire over 5,000 houses in 2001 and start in excess of 7,000 houses. This is the highest level of activity for many years and is evidence that the multi-annual programme approach is beginning to bear fruit.</P>

What is his Department's estimate of the current number of applicants for local authority housing? Will he accept that the draft housing strategies, which are being prepared by local authorities, show that the number of applicants has increased by about 50% since March 1999, which would put that total number of applicants at closer to 60,000 than 40,000?</P>

I am satisfied that will be achieved, but it is only part of the social housing programme. We have an extensive plan for the expansion of voluntary housing output, also the affordable housing scheme is being taken up at a much greater rate than initially and there is the shared ownership scheme. Those combined will result in an enlarged output of social housing in that area. Part 5 of the Bill is due to come into force, which will give us access to up to 20% of land designated for building for the purpose of social housing, which will help greatly to speed up the implementation of the construction programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department must be the only one that has not been affected <Col N="85" /> by the foot and mouth disease issue. It was brought to my attention that a firm in the private sector had to lay off 12 surveyors involved in site investigation work. It occurred to me that the foot and mouth disease restrictions must also be affecting the Department's work. That was borne out yesterday by the National Roads Authority in its work where it has had to cease all site investigation work. To what extent is the Minister releasing moneys that would otherwise be allocated for that work to other projects to ensure there is not any undue delay in the completion of any projects, be they water works, sewerage schemes or national or minor road construction work under the national development plan? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans currently to change expenditure on any of the programmes in the Department on foot of any effects the foot and mouth disease might have. As the Deputy will be aware, various restrictions have been placed on inspections by officials, contractors and so on, but on the basis of the information available to me it is not possible to quantify the cost incurred in that. It would have some effect on some local authorities. The major expense for the Department and local authorities so far has been the purchase of mats and disinfectants for their offices and the disruption of meetings of local authorities. Louth County Council would have experienced more disruption and expense than most other local authorities. It has staff working extensively on measures to combat the spread of foot and mouth disease. However, the issue of the disease is not adversely affecting the administration&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works have the instructions of the EPA on the disposal of animals. To my knowledge, that disposal is being <Col N="86" /> carried out in the manner prescribed by the EPA. As the Deputy will be aware, most of the animals are being sent for rendering rather than burial. It was only animals suspected of having foot and mouth disease that were buried, and burial was overseen by the local authorities. I understand Louth County Council has between 20 and 24 staff working exclusively on the foot and mouth disease issue. That is including local authority engineers in the water, planning and building areas. They are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The EPA issued guidelines on the burial of animals and it also issued guidelines in the event of the need to burn animals. The council, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or whoever has to undertake the burial of animals must do so in accordance with the principles and guidelines laid down by the EPA.</P>

      <P>The NDP provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion, 1999 prices, over the period 2000-06 in the national road network and sets out a strategic framework for the improvement and maintenance of the network over that period. Five routes were specifically identified in the NDP for development to motorway-high quality dual carriageway along their entire length.</P>
      <P>The NDP also provides that significant improvements will be carried out on other major national primary routes, including the N4 and N5. The NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, is now pursuing the detailed programming of this work and will determine appropriate road types in that context based on the roads needs study, current and projected traffic growth and, when completed, the national spatial strategy. In relation to the N4-N5, I am informed by the NRA that there has been significant improvement of this route in recent years through projects such as the Collooney to Sligo dual carriageway; Mullingar bypass &ndash; dual carriageway; the Curlews bypass; the Longford bypass, and the Lucan-Kilcock motorway. Enhancement of these routes is continuing through projects under construction such as the McNeads Bridge dual carriageway, Drumsna &ndash; Jamestown and Cortober-Lough Key. Projects well advanced in their planning or close to commencement include the Strokestown-Longford scheme, the Ballaghadereen bypass, the Sligo inner relief route and the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway. The value of current and prospective improvement work on the N4-N5 route during the NDP period stands at over £600 million.</P>
      <P>All these improvement works are designed, in accordance with the roads needs study, to deliver a level of service involving average inter-urban speeds of at least 80 kilometres per hour; in practice this level of service will be frequently bettered. The programme is also designed to cater for increasing traffic volumes over the period to 2019.</P>
      <P>While there is no proposal at this stage to amend the provisions of the NDP, the need for the development of new routes to augment those mentioned in the plan, including the N4 and N5, will be kept under review over the period to 2006 and, in particular, in the perspective of the mid-term review of the plan which will take place in 2003. Where the need for a new route is established, funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period with a view to bringing the project to construction within an appropriate timeframe.</P>

      <P>The reason I raise this issue is that there has been much concern about job losses in the west and north west in recent years. The north west region has lost 2,000 jobs. Will money be made available to bring the N4-N5 to <Col N="88" /> dual carriageway standard between Mullingar and Sligo and between Mullingar and Castlebar within the period of the national development plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined for the Deputy the £600 million intended to be spent on the N4 and N5 routes during the period of the plan. I also indicated that this sum is based on road needs and is kept under review. The NRA focus is on planned works and development to ensure an enhanced route in the next five or six years. If further upgrades are necessary in the context of 2003 review, they will be undertaken and money will be made available on the advice of the NRA.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern of the Deputy and people in the north west to ensure they have the best possible roads and rail service. I agree that that is important. My concern, however, is to ensure the NRA is not sidetracked into unnecessary studies. It must be allowed to proceed with the design work in order that construction can start and the £600 million can be spent. That is the focus. The programme will be reviewed in 2003 at which time the regional assembly will have an opportunity to make an input. The NRA is working on what is contained in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I did not receive much information. Does the Minister accept that the CPO system has been a bone of contention and is most unsatisfactory? Does he also accept that the compensation offered is completely inadequate? Is the question of non-viability of farms taken into consideration? When a valuation is made is the potential for development of the lands in question also taken into consideration? If the system of land valuation is to be adjusted, will legislation be required and, if so, when may we expect to see it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the contention that the system is wrong and that people are not adequately compensated. I agree, however, that some procedures within the CPO system could be improved and fasttracked to make it less burdensome for those whose land is being acquired. This is being considered. The system should operate efficiently in order that landowners will not have a CPO hanging over their land indefinitely. The decision should be made quickly. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, will be of help in this regard. Fair compensation should also be paid quickly.</P>
      <P>Compensation is composed of a number of elements. I do not accept that people are not getting a fair price. They are getting the market value of the land as decided, in many cases, by an arbitrator who is totally independent. They are entitled to compensation and to have severance taken into consideration. If a farm is being divided &ndash; we are aware of cases where a road runs through a farm and the land either side of it is not viable &ndash; this should be considered. Injurious affection is another aspect taken into account. Also included are accommodation works where the provision of an underpass, roadway or slip road is negotiated by the landowner. Depending on individual circumstances, the market value of the land could account for a smaller proportion of the compensation package than some of the other provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should have the notion that a remote person just decides on a compensatory figure and says that that is what a person will receive. There is a procedure for compensation. I accept what the Deputy said. We can speed up some of the payments and look at some of the issues raised, but I must enter a <i>caveat</i>. The national development plan cannot be compromised by excessive demands from any one sector, whether contractors, farmers or landowners, although I am aware that the Deputy is not suggesting this. I will endeavour to meet the main concern, the level of compensation on offer. There are complaints also about the lack of timely information for farmers <Col N="90" /> and the delay in paying compensation which we hope to address fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the disabled persons grant scheme which is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 and statutory regulations made under the Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing the scheme do not stipulate that authorities obtain a medical report or an occupational therapist's report. However, authorities generally require such reports to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the appli<Col N="91" /> cant are addressed having regard to his or her disability.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the local authority to determine the level of grants in individual cases, the circumstances in which a grant may be paid and to ensure there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
    <P>I have improved the terms and conditions of the scheme on three occasions since 1997 with an effective maximum grant now of £16,000, double what it was in 1997. In the case of a private house, the grant may now cover 90% of the approved cost of the work while the full cost of the works are covered in the case of a local authority house. In December 1998 I also increased the rate of recoupment by my Department to local authorities under the scheme from 50% to 66% of the grant paid.</P>
    <P>I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of the applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that for the most part local authorities are quite flexible. However, the scheme falls down where an occupational therapist's report is required. There are very few occupational therapists, and a report is required in every case, even when a medical assessment is not required. Normally the health board undertakes such reports, but because they do not have sufficient OTs, people are forced to go to the private sector.

There is no statutory requirement for such a report. I am currently preparing a circular which will issue to local auth<Col N="92" /> orities on how they operate the scheme. This will emphasise that local authorities must exercise discretion on whether they require reports from occupational therapists in individual cases. I am asking them to seriously consider this with a view to ensuring the scheme operates in a flexible and efficient manner with minimum delays. The inclusion of a condition requiring a report from an occupational therapist &ndash; occupational therapists are thin on the ground &ndash; can result in unnecessarily long delays before inspection takes place and work is commenced.

Enormous progress has been made by the Government in implementing its wide ranging local government reform programme, including the constitutional recognition <Col N="93" /> for local government, with guaranteed local elections; strategic policy committees which have been established in 33 of the 34 local authorities and which introduce the partnership model to local government where the social partners and sectoral interests sit alongside councillors to formulate, monitor and review local government policy; and the establishment of county and city development boards, led by local government and also representative of local development bodies, State agencies operating locally and the social partners.</P>
      <P>In the case of local authority financing, significant progress has been achieved. A new revenue system, the local government fund, was established in 1999. It was recognised in Better Local Government that there was a need for an equitable and transparent system for the distribution of additional moneys made available through the local government fund, which is currently being put in place on a needs and resources model. A value for money unit has also been established on a statutory basis in my Department. Work is also progressing well on the development of the new financial management system in local authorities based on accrual accounting principles.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives include the one-stop shop initiative, the 21 service indicators and customer action plans which are designed to give improved service to customers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>Substantial progress has been made in putting new management structures in place to modernise human resources policies and strengthen management and staffing capacity. This new structure will provide clearer accountability and responsibility through abolition of the dual administration-technical structures as well as opening up better career prospects in local government. A new accelerated training and education policy focused programme for councillors is now well under way. An induction training programme for new councillors was implemented in the latter part of 1999 following the local elections and seminars on key local government policy issues for SPC and urban chairs were recently completed. A comprehensive policy focused training programme for all councillors will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000 is the next step in the renewal process. It is designed to underpin the ongoing programme of renewal already outlined, introducing a range of reforms to enhance the fundamental democratic nature of local government. The Bill provides a uniform, modern, statutory framework for the local government system, consolidating local government legislation and repealing outdated law and terminology. The Bill is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Before the Local Government Bill is again discussed in the House will the Minister reconsider the partnership model which has been chosen?

There is a view in some local authorities that the more meetings they have, the more business is being done. I take the opposite view. Fewer and more focused meetings, like strategic policy committees, would be more beneficial. It is up to the local authorities to run their own business and get rid of half the committees they have.</P>

      <P>The position on legal actions and complaints being investigated by the European Commission, in regard to environmental matters which fall within the remit of my Department, is as follows: There are two cases currently before the European Court of Justice. The first concerns making waste management plans. Ireland has submitted its defence and requested an oral hearing in this case. The response of the European Court is awaited in this regard. In the second case in relation to statutory obligations primarily on certain private rural water supplies, the Commission has responded to Ireland's defence and Ireland has a further right of reply by 23 May, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four current reasoned opinions under Article 226 of the treaty, concern the establishment of water quality standards for dangerous substances, the protection of water against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, the full implementation of the directive on polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated <Col N="96" /> terphenyls (PCB/PCT), and the placing of biocidal products on the market. Regulations for water quality standards for a range of dangerous substances were made in January, 2001. Specific statutory provision will be made, and nitrate-vulnerable zones will be designated this year in respect of already identified ground waters in five counties. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to address the full implementation of the PCB/PCT directive in the proposed National Hazardous Waste Management Plan, and will engage consultants to assist in the development of an inventory of PCB-contaminated equipment. Consideration is being given by the Department and agencies concerned to arrangements for transposition and implementation of the biocides directive.</P>
    <P>While the Commission recently announced its intention to initiate European Court of Justice proceedings in relation to the control of dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, and the implementation of the PCB/PCT directive, no formal notifications have been received.</P>
    <P>A further eleven complaints are at a preliminary stage of investigation under Articles 226 and 228, and another 16 are the subject of correspondence with the Commission. Details of these are set out in tables which will be sent to the Deputy and circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely regret that once again industrial action will disrupt Aer Lingus services and cause inconvenience for Aer Lingus customers tomorrow. I am also very much aware of the effects of those disputes on the tourism and business sectors of the economy, particularly at the present time, when many businesses have been seriously disrupted by foot and mouth disease restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed one-day stoppage tomorrow by the clerical and operative grades represented by SIPTU, follows on from similar action last Friday which led to the cancellation of almost all Aer Lingus services. On 28 March 2001, the implementation body of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, reviewed this latest dispute. It expressed serious concern at the prospect of industrial action, having regard to the commitment to industrial peace and stability in the PPF, and the likely consequences of the action. The implementation body requested the Labour Court to assist the parties in resolving the issues in dispute. The Labour Court agreed to the request from the implementation body and met Aer Lingus and SIPTU on Thursday, 29 March 2001. I understand the purpose of that meeting <Col N="100" /> was to establish the main issues in the dispute. However, progress was not made. The Labour Court concluded that as SIPTU was not prepared to call off its strike planned for Friday 30 March, it could do nothing further at that stage. Talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission took place between the parties last Monday, 2 April, but despite five hours of talks, no progress was made.</P>
    <P>The national implementation body of the PPF met senior representatives of SIPTU on Tuesday, 3 April. Arising from this meeting a formal meeting took place between SIPTU and the group chief executive of Aer Lingus yesterday, 4 April, at which, I understand, no progress was made and SIPTU announced that it was going ahead with a 24 hour stoppage from midnight tonight. In the circumstances, Aer Lingus had no option, but to suspend the bulk of its operations and advise the public of its position.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus management has negotiated over the past three years with all sections of its workforce, either through direct talks or using the State industrial relations machinery, in relation to claims on pay, pensions and working conditions. Significant progress was made and a number of settlements have been agreed and put in place. In particular, last November and December, following separate ballots, the operative and clerical grades, which are now in dispute, accepted significant improvements in pay and conditions. These settlements followed a lengthy process of direct negotiations and involved assistance from the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the current disputes arise from a parity pay claim lodged by SIPTU on the basis of the recent settlement terms for cabin crew staff which it considers more generous than those negotiated and already accepted by it late last year. Aer Lingus has rejected the claim. The Aer Lingus position is that no group of employees has received significantly higher payments than others in the airline. Each group made its own case, which was dealt with on its merits. The trade unions sought this approach. The company states that it has adopted a consistent approach with all groups and that pay restructuring in all cases stemmed from flexibility and productivity measures relevant to the particular group in the airline.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with what has happened to the talks and the latest planned industrial action. I share the views of the national implementation body that this strike action is not in keeping with the commitment to industrial peace in the PPF. I expect all parties to the PPF to live up to their commitments. This means employers abiding by pay increase proposals and trade unions complying with industrial peace clauses. Significant progress has been made in addressing claims by staff in Aer Lingus. Any <Col N="101" /> remaining concerns could and should be addressed in a manner which does not have serious consequences for the airline's customers, its finances and credibility.</P>
    <P>No commercial company &ndash; Aer Lingus is no exception &ndash; could sustain repeated catch-up claims. The increasing competitive pressure in all its markets, combined with the impact of the pay settlements on its cost base, the general weakening of the aviation market &ndash; particularly to and from the United States &ndash; and the significant impact of the foot and mouth disease restrictions, have resulted in Aer Lingus facing a very serious financial situation for the current year. The continuing impact of industrial action on its operations further compounds those difficulties.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus was just emerging in 1997 from the last major financial crisis and had started to rebuild its position and focus on profitable growth. I appreciate that it was necessary for all involved in the airline to make sacrifices in order that it could be returned to viability. The low pay issue, which can be traced back to that period, has been addressed by the company in the past year with exhaustive use of the State's industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that if sense and restraint are not applied, the airline could rapidly find itself in another financial crisis. As we have seen with the fall-out from the foot and mouth crisis, the airline sector is very vulnerable to external shocks over which we, in Ireland, have no control. I call on all parties in Aer Lingus, management and unions, to rapidly settle all outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the travelling public who will be upset and concerned. It will have to make alternative travel arrangements. This is another bitter blow for it on top of last Friday's strike action.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that she was disappointed at and concerned about the ongoing industrial unrest in Aer Lingus. Does she agree that the ongoing dispute is damaging the credibility of Aer Lingus, causing huge losses &ndash; up to £10 million if the three day strike goes ahead &ndash; and seriously damaging to the potential of the tourism sector to get over the crisis brought about by foot and mouth disease? Has she met either management or the trade unions? Has the Cabinet or a Cabinet sub-committee discussed the dispute in Aer Lingus? What mechanisms are available within her Department to deal with such disputes? What action has she taken since the first strike last Friday and what action does she intend to take? Has she discussed the matter with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who has a £3 million budget which he cannot spend until the issue is resolved?</P>

      <P>I discussed the matter with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, a short time ago. I also spoke <Col N="102" /> to the Taoiseach about the dispute. Within my Department there is a subcommittee called the national implementation body of the PFF, structured at the end of last year, which deals with the trade unions and issues arising from industrial unrest. The labour relations section of my Department also works in this area. I have spoken on two occasions, this week and last week, to the chairman of Aer Lingus who has asked to meet me on Monday evening or Tuesday morning of next week, whichever is most suitable. The Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and direct negotiations between Aer Lingus and the trade unions have all been used to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to enter into direct negotiations. It is not my job to intervene in that way when there are arms of Government suited to that task &ndash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, whose job it is to deal with disputes such as this, a role which they fulfil very well. It is not and never was the remit of an individual Minister to directly negotiate on pay disputes.</P>
      <P>I realise fully that the cost and number of disputes are seriously undermining the credibility of Aer Lingus and that this is reflected in the alarming decrease in the level of advance bookings to which the foot and mouth outbreak and the downturn in the US economy have also contributed.</P>

        <b>:</b> The national implementation body, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have all been used and we have been on the merry-go-round for some time. Is it not the case that when all the existing labour relations machinery has failed, the Minister, as the custodian of the company, has an obligation to intervene and call both sides to her Department to find a solution? The situation cannot continue. In recent months cabin crew, clerical staff, caterers and baggage handlers have all been on strike. Clerical staff are again on strike and we are entering the same merry-go-round. Does this arise from the fact that SIPTU made it perfectly clear to management that it would seek a catch-up adjustment if cabin crew received a larger wage increase and improved conditions? Is it not the case that the company is dealing with each sector on a one by one basis with the result that when one is granted a rise, another wants to catch up? There is a domino effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than getting an interlocking agreement we have a series of one by one negotiations which are not working. This is the cause of the chaos <Col N="103" /> experienced last Friday and which is expected tomorrow, next Thursday and possibly on other days in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the company cannot go on in the present circumstances. I share that point of view. The one by one basis for negotiating is at the request of the trade unions involved. The various categories such as baggage handlers, catering staff, cleaning staff and pilots each requested that they be dealt with on a one by one basis and not as a group of unions acting together. Generally the wishes of individual trade unions are accepted in situations such as this.</P>
      <P>There is no position for me to intervene directly in a wage negotiation between the company and workers. Aer Lingus is a commercial semi-State company. Its remit is established by law. Unions and management have their arrangements for dealing with matters such as this. It would be a recipe for chaos if I were to intervene in a dispute about wages and conditions applying to individual groups in any company. I accept that the present chaos is severely hindering the company and that it would be very difficult for the company to continue to maintain a viable position in the present circumstances.</P>

        <b>:</b> During the disputes which erupted in recent months the country was stunned to learn of the low level of wages in Aer Lingus. Does the Minister agree that the issues at stake in this dispute are not substantial in terms of what it would take for Aer Lingus management to resolve it? Why has no meaningful Government or Labour Court intervention been made to resolve the complaints of Aer Lingus staff? The Minister has agreed that the issues are not substantial.</P>
      <P>Is a secret agenda operating to create the conditions to provoke a strike by giving the workers no other option? Is this being done so that, following the failure to have Aer Lingus as a whole privatised, individual sections such as catering, cargo handling, aircraft cleaning and loading can be hived off and privatised separately? Is this the real agenda and is the Minister party to it?</P>
      <P>My suspicions are underlined by the extraordinary agreement between Aer Lingus and Ryanair to transfer as many of tomorrow's Aer Lingus passengers as possible to Ryanair with the full Aer Lingus fare, which is greater than the Ryanair fare, being paid to Ryanair. Does this decision not mean that the company is intent on absorbing huge costs in order to resist insubstantial claims by workers? </P>

The company is lurching from crisis to crisis.  I have been asked the financial cost of each day's strike. The cost of each day's action is between £2 million and £3 million. Apart from the inconvenience felt tomorrow, the ongoing cost will be a loss of confidence in the company. This could contribute to a downturn in bookings which has already begun to hit the company.</P>

During her period of control and legal ownership of semi-State companies there has been a rash of industrial relations disasters. Passengers have been inconvenienced by disputes in CIE, the ESB will turn off power stations in a fortnight's time and this is the fourth occasion since last October that the Aer Lingus fleet has been grounded. It is the Minister's job to ensure these companies work <Col N="105" /> effectively. The boards of these companies were appointed by her and if they are not doing their job she should sack them. Is the Minister considering any action to reverse the history of disasters in these companies going back over two or three years? It is on her watch that this is occurring. To correct something the Minister may have said in her initial reply &ndash; she said that all the claims granted were about equal. The cabin crew got 17% and those we are dealing with here got 5.5%. Will the Minister agree this group, which was the first to settle, accepted 5.5% on the basis that in the event of any enhanced agreement for other parties they would get equity? They are not looking for equal pay but rather for equity.</P>

      <P>I am aware that their claim is based on the tenet of equity. The clerical staff, with whom Aer Lingus management is in dispute, voted to accept in November 2000. The previous pay scale was £9,000 to £19,000. The new pay scale is £12,000 to £21,000. Those were the amounts they accepted in November. All clerical staff were to receive a lump sum of £500 immediately, a guaranteed minimum increase of £2,000 per annum for all, annual increments would be £529, introduction of long service increments and there were various other conditions attendant upon that claim. The previous pay scale was on 28 points whereas the new scale is on 18 points. There was an average increase of £2,000 per operative from that agreement which was voted upon and accepted in November. The first dispute in this new round was in March. The jumping of a claim which has been settled just four months&mdash;</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for attending to reply to this matter. I hope he will not give the usual answer provided in advance on these occasions. I have a reply which stated that the person did not attend on 28 February 2000. That is correct. He was not notified but that may not be the fault of the Department. However he has attended the following places: Waterford, Rathmines, Clonmel, Rosslare and Bunclody, all for the purpose of hearing tests. He has attended Waterford court but the case was not called. That may be understandable. He again attended Waterford court but it was going on holidays. He was transferred to Dublin for a meeting in January which did not take place. The last appointment in March for Waterford was cancelled because of the foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>This individual spent about ten years in the Army and was subjected to noise from rifles, Gustav machine guns, Bren guns and he served in the Congo with 84 mm tank guns. He has given ten good years of his life to the Army. Two other Army personnel who did not serve one third of that time did not have to go to court but have received phone calls informing them of the amount of money allocated to them. Yet this individual who seems to have undergone enough hearing tests for the whole Army is still waiting to go to court. Why can two individuals who served in the Army for a third of the time he served be informed of their allocation of money through a call from a solicitor? He has been to Waterford court three times and he should have been in a court in Dublin. If the court hearing was cancelled because of a lack of medical evidence on behalf of the State, I do not know where the fault lies. I think he has undergone enough hearing tests that somebody should listen to him. He has served in a situation where most Army personnel have not served for the same length of time in the same firing range. I ask that he be treated with reasonable justice in view of the fact that he knows two others who have not been subjected to the same torture and have not served a third of the time he has served. I ask that he be treated fairly, quickly and justly.</P>

      <P>On 4 June 1996 an initiating letter was received from James Harte and Son, Solicitors, 39 Parliament Street, Kilkenny, on behalf of the individual concerned. On 21 June 1996 the Department wrote to the solicitor asking for personal details, Army number, date of birth, etc., in order to identify the claimant. The solicitor replied on 17 July 1996. The Army records section reported that the individual concerned who had served in the 9th <Col N="108" /> Infantry Battalion was discharged 35 years ago &ldquo;as a result of conviction by the Civil Power&rdquo;, after nine years service in the Permanent Defence Force. There is no record in my Department of the claim having been pursued at that time.</P>
      <P>On 21 February 2000 a statement of claim dated 28 January 1998 was received in my Department through the Offices of the Chief State Solicitor from a different solicitor, Messrs, Peter G. Crean and Company, Solicitors, 24 Court Street, Enniscorthy, on behalf of the individual concerned. Medical reports subsequently received in my Department in July 2000 indicate that the individual concerned had attended an ENT specialist and an audiologist in 1997 as arranged by his own solicitor. Subsequent developments are as stated in my reply to the parliamentary question. The case was set down for Waterford High Court, the choice of the individual concerned. The Chief State Solicitor's Office made arrangements for the individual concerned to attend an audiologist and ENT specialists on behalf of the State on 28 February 2000. He did not attend either appointment.</P>
      <P>The notice for trial was served on 27 May 1999. Initially the case was listed for the High Court sittings in Waterford, 11 and 12 July 2000, but was adjourned because of the lack of medical evidence on behalf of the State due to his non-attendance for earlier medical examination. The individual concerned attended rescheduled appointments with an audiologist and ENT specialist on behalf of the State on 2 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The matter was listed for the sittings of Waterford High Court due to commence for two weeks on 5 March 2001. The sittings were cancelled due to the foot and mouth disease precautions. There was no delay on behalf of my Department at any stage of the proceedings to date. As the matter is still before the courts it would not be proper for me to enter into discussion on any further details but if the individual concerned wishes to participate in the early settlement scheme he should instruct his solicitor to contact the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no joy to raise the issue of non-existent orthodontic services, particularly in the greater Dublin area. My constituency files show that, after housing and the lack of access to hospital care, the level of orthodontic services is one of the issues of most concern to parents and young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rich country and at a time of unprecedented growth it is a scandal that almost 11,500 people are on orthodontic waiting lists in the greater Dublin area. The lists consists of children, youths and, given the length of time many people spend on the lists, young adults. The most dis<Col N="109" /> turbing feature of the figures is that applicants referred by doctors in primary schools in 1995 have not been called for assessment by an orthodontist. This is a crazy situation which must be addressed urgently as it is getting out of hand.</P>
    <P>In 1999 waiting lists in the greater Dublin area were down to about 6,000 people. However, today's figures indicate that 11,231 people are on the category two waiting list for assessment and that 280 people are on the category one list &ndash; the most serious cases. This is a scandal of which the Minister and the Department cannot be proud. The matter must be addressed. I know of a number of cases where young children and youths are assessed, have operations to insert palates but receive no further treatment for 17 months. Thankfully I raised this issue previously and suggested that the private sector be included and some progress has been made.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of an initiative by the Northern Area Health Board to deal with a private and public mix for orthodontic treatment. When will this initiative be announced or introduced? How much will people have to pay for this service? What will be the situation of medical card holders? Will health boards pay for private treatment for people who have been on the waiting list for seven or eight years? If health boards, the State and the Minister are not prepared to meet the requirements of those in need of basic treatment, the services should be provided by the private sector and paid for by the State. Nothing less is acceptable and the figures are an indictment of the Government's inability to deal with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Martin, who is unavoidably absent on business. The provision of orthodontic services in the ERHA is the statutory responsibility of that authority in the first instance. The Minister is, however, unhappy with the length of the lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Department of Health and Children, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will of necessity be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, the Minister asked health boards to develop proposals to <Col N="110" /> make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
    <P>This funding will enable a number of developments to take place. The appointment of two additional consultant orthodontists is currently in train. A third additional consultant orthodontist post has been approved by the Department and the recruitment process is currently under way. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more. Competitions in the three area health boards will be held in April and appointments to follow without delay.</P>
    <P>A total of 12 dental surgery assistants and nine administrative support staff have been approved. Interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and offers of employment have issued. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised. A competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards is also being organised.</P>
    <P>The previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at St. James's Hospital unit has been filled and a similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped. The unit will open as soon as this process is completed. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit will be completed over the next four weeks.</P>
    <P>The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. As part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department also approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate.</P>
    <P>A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group has been examining this proposal and hopes to finalise it in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress and agreement has been reached <Col N="111" /> between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists will commence training in 2001. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised the Minister that improvements in the orthodontic service have already been achieved.</P>
    <P>Category one patients, high priority cases, are currently being called for assessment and assessment of category two patients will follow shortly.</P>
    <P>The impact of these proposals, when fully implemented, will enable treatment for an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence if all staffing requirements are met and waiting times for treatment are to be significantly reduced. The ERHA is striving hard to improve its orthodontic services to an acceptable level and has the Minister's full support in doing so.</P>
    <P>The impact of this initiative on waiting lists will be significant. This initiative combined with the structural changes being introduced will provide a secure basis for the delivery of an efficient and effective orthodontic service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to get the opportunity to ask the Minister what investigations took place in his Department into a situation whereby hundreds of women whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol to prevent miscarriages have suffered serious health problems and the reason the drug continued to be administered in Ireland several years after the drug had been withdrawn for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration there.</P>
      <P>The drug, DES, prescribed to prevent miscarriage, was administered to women in Ireland between 1955 and 1975. Hundreds of Irish women whose mothers were given the drug which guaranteed a healthy pregnancy have developed serious health problems, such as miscarriages, irregular bleeding or infertility. Already more than 100 women have the symptoms but doctors believe this is only a small fraction of the real number of victims as many suffer symptoms but do not realise the cause of those symptoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the drug was discontinued by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in 1971 after mounting evidence proved it was linked to a rare form of gynaecological cancer. More than 10,000 pregnant women in the UK and as many as five million US women are known to have received the drug. In an article in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i> written by Carl O'Brien, we read of horrific cases regarding the effect the drug had on the personal health of the women who took it. Despite all of this, Irish women affected by the drug are not able to get compensation <Col N="112" /> from drug companies because medical records have been destroyed or lost. This excuse of missing records has been heard before in previous medical scandals but the big question here is, where have the records gone? Why was this drug administered here four years after it was ordered to be discontinued by the American FDA following evidence linking it to cancer?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to set up an inquiry to establish how the records have gone missing &ndash; we have seen this before with the three in one and the polio vaccine where records are unavailable or have gone missing &ndash; what companies were selling the drug in Ireland in the years mentioned and the role of the Irish Medicines Board. I do not understand how the drug was allowed to be used in this country years after it had been withdrawn in the US.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it may be difficult for the women affected by the drug to get compensation for their wrecked health but, in the interests of justice, the drug companies should live up to their responsibility towards the hundreds of Irish women whose health has been irreparably damaged by their products. The drug companies must compensate Irish women for the permanent damage to their health. There is a grave responsibility on the Minister and the Department of Health and Children to help these women get justice by getting to the truth of this horrific medical scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children but I assure Deputy Allen that I will communicate his views to him.</P>
      <P>DES is a synthetic non-steroidal hormone which was developed in 1938 by Sir Charles Dodds, Professor of Biochemistry at the University of London. It was used in pregnancy to prevent miscarriages and premature births, particularly in pregnancies complicated by diabetes or toxaemia. In 1971, the development of a rare form of vaginal cancer in the young daughters &ndash; that is, those in their teens or early 20s &ndash; of women who had received DES when pregnant was first noted.</P>
      <P>There is no information available on the level of prescribing in Ireland in the 1940s, 1950s or 1960s. The following were licensed by the National Drugs Advisory Board in 1979: Boestrol tablets for the treatment of malignancy and atrophine vaginitis and Tampovagan Pessary for the treatment of atrophine vaginitis and the management of post-menopausal disorders but this product was withdrawn in 1992 for commercial reasons. Both products were contra-indicated in the case of pregnancy, suspected pregnancy or in patients who may become pregnant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern in this country in relation to DES mainly centred on the lack of awareness among the medical profession as to the benign nature of DES related vaginal adenosis and the danger of <Col N="113" /> unnecessary surgical intervention. The view, therefore, at the time was that the most appropriate way to deal with this matter was to ensure that all the information available was channelled through the medical profession with assistance from the Department of Health, as required. A leaflet on DES was prepared in 1991 by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, in consultation with the health promotion unit of the Department and distributed to the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women met with the Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1990 to discuss the matter. Essentially, the council wished to make contact with the daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, to alert them to the possibility of their having contracted vaginal adenosis and to advise them of the relevant treatment for this condition. A special unit was set up in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2, in 1990 to assess and deal with the matter. The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the unit that approximately one-third of the women, 120, who have been seen at the unit are deemed to have been exposed to the drug. The majority of these were treated with the drug in the 1960s, with only a couple receiving it after 1972. The remainder who attended the unit were anxious to have their anxieties that they may have been exposed to the drug allayed.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Minister for Health, on the invitation of DES ACTION IRELAND, launched the European DES Awareness Week. From information to hand, it appears that all information was channelled through the appropriate medical personnel with a view to ensuring that those women affected by DES would receive appropriate and speedy medical care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this issue is that numerous community organisations in Sligo city have contacted me requesting the Minister to provide a closed circuit television system for Sligo city centre. A couple of weeks ago a high profile person, a member of Westlife, was attacked in Sligo city. This led to numerous media articles highlighting the level of street crime in Sligo and in many other urban areas. Unfortunately, the <i>Sunday Independent </i>ran an article that was deeply hurtful and insulting to the people of Sligo. The article will have done more harm to the image of Sligo city than any other issue. Many people wrote letters of complaint to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the excuse given by the editor was that the article was written for humorous reasons. If a front page article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that devastates a city's image is considered humorous, I suggest that the editor of this <Col N="114" /> newspaper revisit a dictionary to look up the definition of &ldquo;humour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in the level of street crime in Sligo city over the past number of years but in every urban area of its size, crime levels have also increased. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has built his reputation on a policy of zero tolerance. The provision of CCTV is one of the things that can help gardaí fight street crime in urban centres. Statistics show that where they have been erected, the level of street crime has decreased. For a city and county whose clean image attracts tourists to the area, a closed circuit television system would be a tremendous benefit to the Garda in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The majority of crime takes place at weekends in a small section of Sligo city centre where young people congregate after discos outside fast food outlets. It is difficulty for the Garda to deploy enough manpower to maintain control at those times. The advancing of a CCTV scheme would be benefit the Garda in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to provide the necessary funding from his Department for the provision of a CCTV system for Sligo city. I hope I do not receive the same response as last year when the Minister stated a number of areas such as Bray, Cork, Dublin south central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick would be prioritised. Sligo is entitled to such a system and I ask the Minister to provide the necessary money as a matter of urgency to help the Garda and local community fight the increasing level of street crime in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a firm believer in CCTV and its benefits. I have seen CCTV systems at work and I have been very impressed. I can well understand why so many towns and communities are seeking Garda CCTV systems for their respective areas. The systems have many beneficial uses, including a general feel good factor that cannot be underestimated. However, I am also aware that Garda CCTV systems are not a panacea for all ills nor a replacement for gardai on patrol. CCTV is an aid to existing Garda resources and, as such, systems must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that there has been no increase in the number of assaults in Sligo town in the recent past. One highly publicised assault took place on 19 March 2001 and the Garda is following a definite line of inquiry into this assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> CCTV cameras have already been provided in Dublin city centre &ndash; north central and south central &ndash; and in Tralee. The combined cost of the CCTV systems in these areas was in excess of £1.8 million. The installation of a CCTV system in Cork city consisting of 29 cameras is being undertaken and its final cost is likely to be in excess of £800,000. The Deputy may also be aware that I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years, as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. An application for a Garda CCTV system in Sligo town is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>
    <P>As part of the first tranche of the expansion programme, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas &ndash; Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed in the period 2001-02. While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature of the systems and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences.</P>
    <P>I am, however, also conscious that some appli<Col N="116" /> cations for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee, that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV Systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>Certain minimum standards will have to be met to qualify for grant aid and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced soon.</P>
    <P>Sligo has benefited from my Department's budget in recent years. We have been careful to ensure matters such as the courthouse in the town receive attention. I assure the Deputy and his constituents that every consideration will be given to the application by Sligo for a CCTV system.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of a basis for the suggestion that many EU member states are moving away from waste incineration, or of what such a move might entail. It is my understanding that in the period 1997-00, the number and capacity of waste to energy facilities in the EU has increased, with new facilities built or under construction in seven member states.</P>
      <P>This is consistent with the European Commission's projections in the context of its 1998 proposal for a Council directive on the incineration of waste. The Commission expected that the quantities of waste incinerated in the Community would increase due to growth in waste generation, the need to divert waste from landfill and projected increases in generation of sewage sludges due to the implementation of the urban waste water directive.</P>

      <P>The Dublin action plan on homelessness has been finalised and adopted by three of the four Dublin local authorities and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I understand the plan is due to be considered by Fingal County Council at its meeting next Monday. I have been invited by the Homeless Agency to launch the plan and I hope to be able to do this at an early date.</P>
      <P>The plan is impressive and charts a clear range of actions for tackling homelessness in the Dublin area over the next three years. I welcome the measures contained in the plan and will arrange to have copies placed in the Oireachtas Library when it is published. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the local authorities, the Homeless Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the voluntary sector for all the work, which they have put into the preparation of plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aim of the plan is that by 2010, long-<Col N="118" /> term homelessness and the need for people to sleep rough will be eliminated in Dublin. Where homelessness does occur it will be short-term and all people who are homeless will be assisted into housing that is appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out a new integrated delivery system, which will offer a continuum of care for people who are homeless to assist them to progress into long-term housing. It will do this through a partnership approach so that agencies providing services for people who are homeless will work together under the leadership of the Homeless Agency to deliver better results. One very important policy development which emerges from the plan is to ensure that people who do become homeless are assisted into appropriate long-term housing as quickly as possible so that we can move away from homeless persons remaining in emergency accommodation for long periods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1982 report of the Stardust tribunal made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters. All of these recommendations have received full and careful consideration and have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services in the intervening period. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, training, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied these improvements have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these very positive developments in the fire service over the past 20 years, I have recently commissioned a wide ranging strategic review of the service by independent consultants. The objective of the review will be to examine and report on the arrangements to ensure that people, property and the environment are protected from fire and other emergency situations by the provision of quality fire safety and emergency services. The consultant's report will help to develop policy for the future direction of <Col N="119" /> the service and ensure that we can go forward, building on the very real strengths of today.</P>
    <P>Fire and emergency operations plans, which are required under section 26 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, deal with the organisation, equipment, training and other operational matters required for fire and other emergency situations. While 27 authorities have prepared and adopted plans, a further five fire authorities have prepared, but not yet adopted, plans. The remaining fire authority has yet to prepare a plan. My Department recently reminded these authorities of their statutory obligations in this matter.</P>
    <P>Fire and emergency operations plans should not be confused with the major emergency plans which all authorities have prepared, and keep updated. These set out the arrangements for mobilising and co-ordinating the emergency response to any event which causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property on a scale beyond the normal capabilities of the gardaí, local authorities and health services. Local authorities test and update these plans, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>EU legislation regulating noise from specified equipment or sources such as new motor vehicles, outdoor equipment, aircraft etc. is transposed into national law as required. Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities may include objectives in their development plans to secure the reduction or prevention of noise emissions or vibrations, these objectives, in turn, impact on development control decisions.</P>
      <P>Noise emissions from site-specific and infrastructural projects may be regulated by the relevant authorities under planning, including environmental impact assessment legislation and the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the EPA, as appropriate. The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, empowers local authorities to address noise pollution and provides for district court access for any person in relation to noise nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Future national noise policy will be based on a new directive of the European Parliament and Council relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise. At the December 2000 Council of Environment Ministers, political <Col N="120" /> agreement was reached on a Council Common Position on this proposal. The proposal requires, <i>inter alia</i>, the mapping of noise from sources including transport and industry and the drawing up of strategic action plans to manage noise issues and effects. The proposal is now being considered by the European Parliament. Subject to the finalisation of the proposed directive by the Council and Parliament, I have no plans to introduce statutory national noise standards at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, establish a revised regime for taxi licensing. The regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which shall be granted by local licensing authorities. Under the regulations, the granting of taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences continues to be the responsibility of individual local licensing authorities to whom applications for taxi licences are made.</P>
      <P>I am advised that some 2,784 additional taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences had been granted by Dublin Corporation under the new regulations by end March 2001 and that satisfactory increases in licence numbers are also taking place in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued instructions to taxi licensing authorities on 15 February 2001 regarding arrangements for the refund of certain taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licence fees on the basis of the difference between the default fees specified in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 &ndash; £3,000 for an ordinary taxi licence, £100 for a wheelchair accessible taxi licence &ndash; and any higher fee received by a licensing authority prior to 21 November 2000. I understand that at least 320 wheelchair accessible taxi licence fee refunds <Col N="121" /> have been made by Dublin Corporation to date, with a further 340 refunds approved for payment in the near future.</P>
    <P>In line with the allocation of responsibility for taxi licence administration outlined above, further requests for statistical information regarding the granting of taxi licences under the new regulations or the refund of taxi licence fees may be appropriately addressed to the licensing authority concerned. Dublin Corporation, as the major taxi licensing authority in the country, will shortly put in hands a customer service assessment so as to compare current service levels with those obtaining during the last such assessment in 1998 and to identify potential areas for further service improvement.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a rapid improvement of taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons, of taxi service providers and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>

In accordance with section 94 of the Act, planning authorities have until the end of July this year to prepare their housing strategies.

Planning authorities have been urged to complete this process as soon as possible so they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies along with a model housing strategy were issued by my Department in December last. Regional seminars were held in January to give further assistance to them.</P>
      <P>Each county and city manager has reported to my Department setting out the position at the end of January in relation to the preparation of their strategies. All of the authorities expect to complete their strategies by the end-July deadline. Good progress is being made in Dublin where the affordability issue is most pressing. Fingal County Council and Dublin Corporation have published notices to vary their development plans to incorporate the housing strategies for their areas.</P>

      <P>My Department has engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle <Col N="123" /> Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Merchants Association of Ireland, MMAI, and other concerned parties with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on end-of-life vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000, and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
      <P>The directive incorporates a number of significant proposals, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs at no cost to the final holder; ensuring that all collected ELVs are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components; and minimising the use of hazardous materials or substances in vehicles.</P>
      <P>On the invitation of my Department, and in anticipation of the adoption of the directive, an initial proposal for an ELV management system for Ireland was submitted by SIMI in December 1999. Following the formal adoption of the directive in October 2000, and consultation with other interested parties including IMVRA, MMAI, relevant Departments and State agencies, my Department responded to the initial SIMI proposal in November 2000. With a view to progressing the development of a practicable industry-led scheme, my Department convened an initial joint meeting of all relevant stakeholders last month. These interests have been requested to submit a joint proposal for a practicable ELV management scheme as soon as possible and, to this end, my Department will maintain ongoing contact with the parties concerned. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme, and to give effect to Directive 2000/53/EC, at an early date.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy): I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 100 together.</P>
    <P>In the context of the new taxi licensing regime, it has not been practicable to provide for a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, in recognition of the need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi licence has been fixed at £100, with a £5,000 fee for ordinary taxi licences. I have put on record my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated that it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons, of taxi service providers and others, to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the service providers and the general public alike. I am aware of concerns in relation to the current specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi and the quality improvements referred to may include, if appropriate, further revision of the existing specification for wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>

      <P>My Department has no information in relation to the cost of staffing appointments made by local authorities in any year.</P>
      <P>Expenditure arising as a result of additional staffing costs, however arising, is a matter for local authorities in the context of the determination of their annual estimates. The funding of such expenditure is from a variety of sources, including the local government fund and other State grants, rates, fees and charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as part of my reforms of local government, I have greatly increased the allocations to local authorities from the Local Government Fund to support their day-to-day activities. In 2001, I have allocated £436 million in general purpose grants to local authorities, an increase of almost 64% on the initial 1997 allocation. I have also sought to distribute such funds among local authorities in a more equitable manner. The 2001 allocation represents an across the board increase of a minimum of <Col N="125" /> 12.5% over the previous year's allocation to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, in continuing the trend towards equalisation, some local authorities have been given increases in excess of this level on the basis of the needs and resources model. Staffing costs of local authorities is one of the factors taken into account in the model's calculations.</P>

      <P>The 2001 non-national road grants have been allocated from a record provision of more than £319 million, an increase of more than 21% on the initial 2000 allocation of nearly £263 million and an 82% increase on the 1997 grant payment figure of £174.8 million.</P>
      <P>Under the ten year restoration programme for regional and county roads, which is based on an undertaking to restore all non-national roads in county council areas to a good level of service by 2005, grants have increased from £93 million in 1997 to over £162 million in 2001, an increase of 74%.</P>
      <P>The programme is generally on target and is progressing systematically on the basis of priorities identified by local authorities in their multi-annual programmes.</P>
      <P>All local authorities were requested in 1994 to investigate the potential to promote and harness community support for certain non-national road works in their areas and guidelines for this purpose were set out in Circular RW 4/94 from my Department.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have subsequently been reminded each year in the context of the notification of non-national road grant allocations that they should continue to seek such involvement in improvement and maintenance work in suitable non-national roads.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this approach has been valuable in permitting the prioritisation by local communities of certain smaller road works which could not otherwise have been scheduled for early treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 406 of 20 March 2000, the standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 mph. However, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term: the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speeding. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits, such as 20 mph, in built-up areas. Adequate legislative provisions are already in place under section 46 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as substituted by section 33 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, if required, to support this approach.Some interest has been expressed in a number of Parliamentary Questions and by two local authorities in particular, Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in the application of 20 mph speed limits.I intend that the situation will continue to be monitored in line with the above approach.</P>

      <P>I would hope to introduce a Bill along the lines referred to by the Deputy towards the end of this year. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to disclose the details of the legislation, in advance of approval by the Government.</P>
      <P>However, I can inform the House that the proposed legislation will not provide for the registration of builders or contractors. There are two basic reasons for this.</P>
      <P>First, the forum for the construction industry has been unwilling, so far, to amend its draft proposals for the registration of contractors to make the operation of the registration system more independent of contractors. Second, the forum proposes that all public works contracts would only be awarded to registered contractors. Such a restriction could be anti-competitive and I understand that the forum may seek expert legal advice on its acceptability under national and EU law. The restriction could also inhibit entry of non-resident contractors into the Irish market. This would be contrary to the Government strategy of encouraging overseas contractors to augment domestic construction capacity by participating in the delivery of construction projects worth £22 billion contained in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government, has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report published in July 1999 and second progress report published in August 2000, detail progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The second progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. Road deaths decreased by nearly 13% between 1997 and 1999 relative to the strategy target of a 20% minimum reduction by 2002. Serious injuries decreased in the same period by over 15% relative to a similar reduction target of 20% by end 2002.</P>
      <P>The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have also been well met. In particular, progress is ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing. There was also a small increase in the number of road deaths in 2000 over 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which will provide for this and other improvements in enforcement related to road safety matters, was published last week. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national <Col N="129" /> driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy will command the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, more than 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to road accidents are published by the National Roads Authority in their annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report is for 1999 and that report, along with reports relating to previous years, are available in the Oireachtas library. The report for 2000 is not yet available but Garda figures indicate that there were 415 road deaths in 2000 and 98 deaths to end March this year.</P>

      <P>Government proposals for major reforms in the private rented residential sector, announced on 5 January last, took on board the majority of the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. As a first step in putting in place a new regime for the sector, preparations are currently under way for the establishment, initially on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, by autumn 2001, of a private residential tenancies board to deal primarily with disputes between landlords and tenants. While the <i>ad hoc</i> board will not be able to compel landlords to register or to insist that all disputes are referred to it, landlords and tenants will, on a voluntary basis, be in a position to use its dispute resolution services pending the establishment of the board on a statutory basis. The board, in its <i>ad hoc</i> phase, should acquire sufficient experience to inform the process of establishing the statutory board. The interim board will be able to carry out the full range of functions in relation to policy research, providing advice on the sector, <Col N="131" /> developing model leases and good practice guidelines and providing advice and information for landlords, tenants and the general public.</P>
      <P>The drafting of legislation to provide a statutory basis for the establishment of the board and to give statutory effect to the commission's proposals on improved security of tenure, graduated notice to quit periods and rent aspects is under way. Landlord and tenant issues are subject to a highly complex and integrated legislative code which, at present, falls within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In collaboration with that Department, my Department is committed to completing this legislative programme as quickly as possible. However, as the decision of the private rented tenancies board will be final and appealable to the courts only on a point of law, it is essential that the new legislation is comprehensive and legally watertight.</P>
      <P>The issue of supply of private rented residential accommodation was an important element of the terms of reference of the commission. The Finance Act, 2001 which has recently been enacted gives statutory effect to a number of their recommendations on reforms to the tax code aimed at increasing supply. In addition to the reduction in the stamp duty rate for new residential investment properties, provision was also made for income tax relief on rental income in respect of refurbishment capital expenditure as well as interest payments in respect of certain qualifying properties together with rollover relief on capital gains tax in respect of qualifying reinvestment in the sector.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, on 4 January, I wrote to local authority managers about the matter of staff engaging in <Col N="132" /> activities which were incompatible with their official roles. I asked managers to check the position in relation to the local authorities for which they were responsible and to report on the outcome of this exercise within three months. I asked for confirmation at that stage that the managers were now satisfied that no member of staff was currently involved in private activities which were incompatible with his or her official role.</P>
      <P>As of 4 April, I had received reports from all managers. The reports indicate that issues of local authority officials engaging in private practise to varying degrees did come to light, either as a result of this exercise or in the normal course. In all cases, the managers dealt with these matters through disciplinary procedures up to and including suspension. In some cases, officials resigned or took career breaks. The managers, who have primary responsibility for control and direction of staff in the local authorities, have generally stated that the actions that they have taken have left them satisfied that in so far as private practise in breach of Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1984 was engaged in, that this practise has now ceased.</P>
      <P>I have stated in the past, and will repeat here today, that I am very concerned with any activities that undermine public confidence in local authorities in general and the planning system in particular. This exercise was necessary not only to ensure that any malpractice was unearthed and stamped out, but also to protect the reputation of the very many local authority officials who continue to discharge their duties with absolute integrity. I fully expect that each manager will continue to strictly monitor the situation and take strong disciplinary measures against any officials whose actions bring the system into disrepute.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority has assumed <Col N="133" /> direct responsibility for the provision of directional signage and delineation on national roads. Issues arising in this connection may be appropriately addressed to NRA.</P>
    <P>My Department has published the Traffic Signs Manual (1996) as a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage in Ireland. It prescribes the design, formats, dimensions and positioning of all road signs and the standards required to ensure that road users are given messages clearly and in good time. The use of the manual is intended over time to lead to greater uniformity of practice and to the creation of a more consistent approach to signing generally.</P>
    <P>In its role of oversight of the non-national roads programme, my Department issued a circular letter to road authorities in August 1998 emphasising the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage. My Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads, which issued on 5 February 2001, again reminded local authorities of the need to bring their signage on the non-national road network up to the standards of the Traffic Signs Manual. This memorandum also reminded local authorities of the need to provide road signposting so as to assist foreign tourists at points of entry to the country and to remedy any deficiencies in this regard as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment in the non-national road network in recent years. Central funding has increased from £174.8 million in 1997 to £319 million in 2001 &ndash; an increase of 82%. The significantly increased funding being provided to local authorities is intended to meet their ongoing needs in relation to the non-national road network which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of adequate signposting.</P>

      <P>Urgent action is being co-ordinated to improve and manage Dublin transport arrangements. This action is intended to bring major benefits in economic terms, in terms of quality of life and in relation to the environment.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office co-ordinates and monitors the implementation of the Dublin transportation initiative strategy. I am satisfied that satisfactory progress is being made with the implementation of the DTI Strategy, and that significant and important measures are under way to tackle traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The DTO policy document A Platform for Change, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 October 2000, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. This strategy document updates and builds substantially on progress achieved under the Dublin transportation initiative final report approved by the Government in 1995, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999.</P>
      <P>Further work is being completed on the detail of the strategy, including an examination of the various demand management options available with a view to ensuring that the greatly enhanced public transport facilities, which will be provided, will be utilised to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>The total estimated capital cost of the strategy is £14.2 billion and implementation is expected to result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live; increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%; reduce congestion; improve accessibility; and result in significant environmental gains including reductions in energy use and emissions below what they would be otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1994 to 2000, the Dublin Transportation Office paid out grants amounting <Col N="135" /> to £71.5 million on traffic management schemes in the greater Dublin area. This year, an allocation of £26.35 million has been provided to the DTO in respect of traffic management measures. Under the national development plan, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The DTO is currently preparing a new short-term action plan, designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI Strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2003. This plan will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Good progress was made with the implementation of the last short-term action plan, 1998-2000 For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor, QBC, network with six QBCs now in operation and three to be introduced before the end of May 2001; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced; and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line has been completed.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the comprehensive measures proposed in the strategy will contribute substantially to the alleviation of traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area, with consequent positive economic effects. In order to provide a stronger framework for the delivery of this DTO Strategy, and for the co-ordination of wider land use and transport planning and programmes in the greater Dublin area, the Government has today published proposals, in a consultation paper, for a greater Dublin strategic land use and transport authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>European Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976, generally known as the Dangerous Substances Directive, relates to the prevention and reduction of pollution of waters by certain dangerous substances. The directive has been very substantially implemented in Ireland by the Local Govern<Col N="136" /> ment (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation on water quality, waste management and environmental protection generally.</P>
      <P>The 1976 directive generally requires member states to establish an authorisation system in relation to discharges to waters; require that authorisations specify emission limit values in relation to dangerous substances present in the discharges; establish water quality objectives &ndash; standards &ndash; in relation to dangerous substances; prepare and implement pollution reduction programmes in relation to dangerous substances; and prevent any deterioration of water quality.An authorisation or permit system in relation to discharges to waters has been in place in Ireland since 1978 under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and provides for the attachment of conditions, including emission limit values, in relation to discharges. The Acts generally prohibit the discharge, directly or indirectly, of polluting matter to waters other than discharges in relation to which a permit has been granted. All of the emission standards established under the directive have been transposed into Irish law by a series of regulations under the Acts and related legislation. In addition, water quality standards have been established under Irish law in relation to phosphorus and 14 other dangerous substances including certain pesticides, solvents and metals. Successive studies have shown that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication of inland surface waters due to excess inputs of phosphorus, mainly from agricultural sources. A major catchment-based national strategy is in place to combat the eutrophication of rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>The European Commission agrees that phosphorus is the substance of main concern in relation to Irish water quality. The Commission takes the view, however, that Ireland has failed to give full effect to certain aspects of the dangerous substances directive including, for example, to establish water quality standards in relation to all the substances covered by the directive, to prevent an increase in the extent of eutrophication of surface waters subsequent to 1976 when the directive was adopted, to apply the phosphorus standards to all waters and to require authorisation for certain discharges by local authorities from sewers. While no formal notification has been received, the Commission recently indicated its intention to proceed to the European Court of Justice in relation to alleged incomplete implementation of the directive by Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provided substantial responses to Commission in relation to Reasoned Opinions dated 12 June 1997 and 28 July 2000 on implementation of the directive. Further relevant developments of which the Commission has been advised include the making of the Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No. 12 of 2001) giving further effect to Directive 76/464/EEC and complementing earlier Regulations made to specify water quality standards <Col N="137" /> in relation to certain dangerous substances. The Commission was also notified this week of the results of monitoring of waters carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the EPA which confirm that, apart from certain well-known exceptions, dangerous substances are not a problem in Irish waters. The exceptions include, for example, the localised pollution of the River Avoca by metals from mining activities in the past, now ceased, and the more widespread presence of phosphorus and nitrates in waters, mainly from agricultural sources.</P>
    <P>Several member states have experienced difficulties in relation to the dangerous substances directive and have been held by the ECJ, in formal proceedings, to have failed fully to implement it.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to identify, and take, such additional measures as appear to be appropriate to give fullest effect to the terms of the directive. This work will continue in particular in the context of the implementation of the water framework directive which came into effect in December 2000, this incorporates, and will in due course repeal, the dangerous substances directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in the provision of waste water treatment facilities for Cork, Dublin and Dundalk. The treatment works element of the Dundalk sewerage scheme has recently been completed and construction is under way on the treatment plant which forms part of the Dublin main drainage scheme. Work on the Cork plant is expected to commence later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The design of the plants took account of the status of the receiving waters under the urban waste water treatment directive and the findings of the various environmental studies carried out <Col N="138" /> prior to and during the design phase of the projects. Should it be established that a higher level of treatment is required in any of these cases the necessary facilities will be provided. The treatment to be provided will be determined in the light of the particular circumstances pertaining to individual projects. Provision has been made in the design of the Cork and Dublin plants to facilitate the installation of nutrient reduction on a modular basis should this become necessary. The provision of similar facilities in Dundalk is also technically feasible.</P>
    <P>The need for a higher level of treatment, such as nutrient removal, will be considered as part of a current review in my Department in relation to areas which should be designated as sensitive areas for the purposes of urban waste water treatment directive. This review is being assisted by an assessment which was provided to my Department very recently by the EPA in relation to the trophic status of estuarine and coastal waters. A copy of the assessment report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households are in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts by my Department with local authorities it is estimated that needs increased by around 15% between March 1999 and March 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returns made by local authorities to my Department indicate that the total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 2000 was something in excess of 3,200 <Col N="141" /> units. While I am disappointed with this figure, I am encouraged by the fact that at the end of 2000 more than 5,000 local authority houses were under construction. Based on this level of activity I expect authorities to complete or acquire more than 5,000 houses in 2001 and that new starts will exceed 7,000 houses. The number of houses completed under the voluntary housing schemes in 2000 was 951 compared to 579 in 1999. I expect that more than 1,200 units will be provided by the voluntary sector in 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government is addressing the increased need for local authority housing in every way possible. This year capital funding for the local authority housing programme has increased by 44% on the original provision for 2000 and by 150% on the 1997 provision.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met and I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households to be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households. This level of social housing output will impact positively on the number of householders on waiting lists.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 802 on 30 January 2001 as to the measures being taken to implement EU Directive 91/676/EEC, the nitrates directive.</P>
      <P>The areas to be designated as nitrate vulnerable zones in relation to certain groundwaters affected by nitrates pollution from agricultural sources will be determined during the current year following receipt of the recommendations of local authorities as to the areas to be designated. Local authorities will be assisted in this regard by guidelines which were prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland, at the request of my Department, and issued to them last month. A copy of the document Guidelines for the Delineation of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones for Groundwaters Affected by Nitrate Contamination from agricultural sources is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The identification of other waters affected by nitrate pollution will be assisted by an assessment carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency, at the request of my Department, of the trophic status of estuarine and coastal waters. Recently I received a report of this assessment from the EPA and have placed a copy of the report &ndash; An Assessment of the Trophic Status of Estuaries and Bays &ndash; in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>While the Comptroller and Auditor General's report found, in general, that expenditure under the scheme represented good value for money when set against the potential alternative of having to provide for badly housed elderly people in residential care, it found certain shortcomings such as a need to introduce a system of formal needs analysis to identify the full extent and nature of the problem of elderly people living in sub-standard accommodation, a need to assess the value of local initiatives in order to apply the <Col N="143" /> best approaches while retaining the schemes strengths such as its flexibility and the necessity to introduce strategic planning at local and national level.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, which administers the scheme under the aegis of my Department, has been arranged for 20 April to consider the appropriate follow-up to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. A series of meetings are also being arranged between officials of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. These meetings will discuss the overall operation of the scheme, identify and agree best practice, and formulate strategies and procedures to ensure that boards will be better placed to identify and respond to cases of elderly persons who are at risk due to inadequate housing conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their staffing to ensure that the planning systems do not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting people to fill these additional posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments, that is county councils and county borough corporations, carried out on 31 January 2001 found that the overall number of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to <Col N="144" /> 1,090, which compared favourably with a figure of 1,066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999.</P>
    <P>In relation to professional planners specifically, the January survey found that there was a total of 394 authorised posts for professional planners, 66 of which were vacant at that time. This means that the total number of serving professional planners was 328. This compares positively with the results of the October 2000 survey which reported 301 serving professional planners in the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to An Bord Pleanála, in July 2000 I approved an increase of 29 additional staff, nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff, which brought An Bord Pleanála's authorised staff complement to 134, excluding board members. Recruitment of these additional staff is ongoing. I am also aware of plans by the board to engage private planning consultants to assist in dealing with the large number of appeals on hand.</P>
    <P>In June 2000 I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 mf7&gt;2 to 40 mf7&gt;2. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas and to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September 2000 new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued. In this regard my Department, along with a number of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, has participated in the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign and other recruitment initiatives over the past few months to source professional planners on a contract basis. As a result of this 27 qualified planners have been placed on a panel from which planning positions in the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála can be filled on a contract basis. The Local Government Management Services Board is now managing this process and extending it to target other construction professionals such as engineers, architects and quantity surveyors.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Due to the scale and complexity of the Act, and the need to make regulations that would give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date I have made two commencement orders bringing a number of parts of the Act into force on 1 November 2000 and 1 January 2001. These include many of the priority measures contained in the Act such as Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land and Part XX which amends the Roads Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>The commencement orders for the development control provisions of the Act will be made in tandem with the necessary regulations, some of which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Work on these regulations is now at an advanced stage and I propose to submit a draft for approval before the end of the month, bringing into operation the following parts: Part I, which includes the exempted development provisions; Part III on control of development; Part IV in relation to architectural heritage; Part VI on An Bord Pleanála; Part VII regarding disclosure of interests; Part VIII on enforcement; Part X which covers environmental impact assessment; Part XI in relation to development by State and local authorities; Part XII on compensation; Part XIII on amenities; Part XVII dealing with financial provisions; Part XVIII which sets out several miscellaneous provisions; and Part XIX which sets out the standard provisions relating to commencement, repeals and continuance.</P>
      <P>Following the implementation of these regulations, I intend to bring forward proposals later in the year for the implementation of the few remaining provisions of the Act, which includes development on the foreshore and the control of quarries.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment <Col N="146" /> of some £21 billion, which is the 1999 figure, in infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006 and sets out a strategic framework for the development of economic and social infrastructure throughout the country over the same period. This framework has been further elaborated in the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, which provides for major improvements in national roads, public transport, water and waste water infrastructure, sustainable energy, social housing and health facilities. Further investment in infrastructure, including non-national roads, rural water, waste management and urban and village development, is provided for through the operational programmes for the border, midlands and western region and for the southern and eastern region.</P>
      <P>Progress in implementing infrastructural investment under the NDP is being closely monitored on a continuing basis. Work is well under way in implementing agencies, including my Department, local authorities, the National Roads Authority, CIE and the health boards, on the detailed programming and/or roll-out of the work required and in the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructural projects. Every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country, including in the midlands area. Expenditure on infrastructure programmes in 2000 was in line with the targets contained in the NDP.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made on the mandate given by the Government to my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy, which will translate the overall approach to regional development contained in the national development plan into a more detailed framework for spatial development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Following an initial round of public consultation last year, my Department completed and published a report on the scope of the strategy, setting out the issues and challenges it needed to address and a work programme to ensure its delivery by the end of this year. This was followed by a period of extensive research during which a wide range of issues relating <i>inter alia</i> to population and labour force projections, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, factors driving the location of enterprise, quality of life issues, infrastructure and environmental protection were analysed and assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Based on that information my Department is currently preparing a series of spatial policy papers setting out the most realistic choices and opportunities open to us to promote new patterns of development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the spatial policy papers will be published during May. Their publication will be followed over the rest of May and June by an intense period of consultation with regional and local interests, the social partners, sustainable development partners and other representative groups. Following that, and taking account of the responses and views received during the consultation phase, the proposals for inclusion in the strategy will be further developed with a view to having the strategy submitted to the Government for approval in late Autumn and published by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and are fixed for the life of the loan. The costs of reducing the fixed rates on these loans would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a significant concession. Borrowers with building society-bank fixed rate mortgages on the other hand are obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more in the event of early redemption.</P>
      <P>A survey of local authorities, carried out by my Department last year, indicated that the average amount outstanding on individual fixed rate loans was less than £5,200. In the past five years the amount outstanding to the local loans fund in fixed interest rate loans has reduced significantly, from some £500 million to £135 million currently. This indicates that many borrowers have availed of the concessionary terms for redemption. Many of the loans outstanding would be at interest rates of less than 12%.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently finalising discussions with the Department of Education and Science aimed at transferring the community employment funding equivalent to FÁS expenditure on school schemes to that Department. The transfer of CE funding will provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for schools support services over the past year. It will provide for a uniform and equitable system of funding for schools services which will, <Col N="149" /> thereafter, be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>CE projects providing schools services which include secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants, will have participant levels reduced as a direct result of mainstreaming as it will no longer be possible for schools to avail of the CE programme to provide these services. Participants currently working in schools will be allowed to finish their CE contracts and schools will have the flexibility to employ staff based on the identified needs of the individual schools, including retention of persons currently providing ancillary services. My Department intends that every effort will be made to ensure that this proposal will produce positive outcomes for CE participants and for the education sector in general.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the PPF, consultations on the final proposals for the mainstreaming of CE schools services are taking place with the social partners through the standing committee on the labour market.

      <P>The company, which has been in Ennis since 1962, announced the closure of its Irish manufacturing operation on 28 March 2001. The closure will be effective from the end of May 2001 with the loss of 85 jobs out of the current employment level of 87 jobs. The remaining two employees are sales representatives who will continue to service the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The company stated that the decision to close is a direct result of a non-competitive cost base in Ireland compared to more cost effective production within the group's other facilities in Malta and China. An additional factor is the impact generated by low cost competitors in a competitive worldwide market place.</P>
      <P>Lower cost economies have a certain labour cost advantage over Ireland and other European countries. Many of the recently announced major job losses in overseas owned plants in Ireland arose from restructuring, with activities at the lower end of the value added chain being phased out as they become uneconomic to carry out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland's strategy is to encourage Irish subsidiaries of global companies to move up the <Col N="150" /> value added chain into higher skilled and better paid jobs, thus enhancing their international competitiveness and employment.

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to either. Insurers normally make decisions about whether they are prepared to quote for a particular risk, and, if so, at what premium level based on their <Col N="151" /> underwriting experience or assessment of that risk in the market.</P>
      <P>We are aware that many insurers regard the risks associated with motorcyclists and young drivers as being difficult to quote. It was because of my concerns in relation to the difficulties experienced by young drivers that I established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998. This body is continuing its work and is expected to issue a final report by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the availability of insurance for motorcyclists, there is only one head office company which writes such insurance in Ireland and there is a broker offering an alternative on the market. The EU single market for insurance grants access to the Irish insurance market to all authorised insurance companies within the EU. This allows larger numbers of insurers to compete on the Irish market thereby giving Irish consumers a choice of quotations from the insurance companies competing on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Investigations of possible anti-competitive activity in the economy is a matter for the Competition Authority. Complainants may also take a case in the courts under the Competition Acts or make a complaint to the director of competition enforcement at the authority.</P>

These regulations give effect to EU labelling rules of a general nature and they are applicable to all foodstuffs. The rules are designed to inform and protect consumers in the EU by ensuring that they have the information necessary to make informed choices about the products they purchase and that this information is provided in such a manner as to facilitate trade between member states.</P>
      <P>The regulations require certain specific information to be provided on the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs, including the name of the product, the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller of the product established within the EU, the list of ingredients, the net quantity and the date of minimum durability. Foodstuffs which are pre-packaged on a retail premises for direct sale to a consumer are exempt from many of the provisions of the regulations.</P>

    <P>The regulations do not contain a legal requirement for the packaging of poultry, or any other foodstuff, to be marked with an indication of the country of origin of the product. The only circumstances in which origin marking is required is if the absence of such information would be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff, for example, through pictorial representations such as a map or a flag. It should be noted that origin in this context is taken to be the place in which the product last underwent a substantial <Col N="153" /> change.

      <P>The Government's forestry policy as set out in growing for the Future &ndash; A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland is to increase Ireland's forest cover from its present level of 9% of land area to 17% of land area by 2030. However this strategy was prepared prior to the Kyoto Protocol. My Department is now working to ensure that the issues associated with carbon sequestration are fully taken into account in the implementation of the strategy. The National Climate Change Strategy for Ireland recognises the significant benefits from forestry in terms of meeting Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The increased possibilities for forestry under the new rural environment protection scheme, REPS, will <Col N="154" /> also deliver additional environmental benefits. A change in land use arising from the conversion of agricultural land from animal production to forestry ensures double dividend; a reduction in CH4 and N2O emissions and additional sequestration of carbon.</P>
      <P>On species selection it is recognised that conifers are well suited as a carbon sink.</P>
      <P>The National Climate Change Strategy also indicated that research would be undertaken to maximise the sequestration potential of forestry. In that context, Coford, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, the research agency funded by my Department, has recently approved in principle a project on carbon sequestration in Irish forest ecosystems. The overall objective of this project is to provide data to determine carbon budgets, spanning the entire life cycle of the major forest type in Ireland, namely, Sitka Spruce. This important research project will ultimately contribute to a better understanding of the carbon sequestration capacity of Irish forests.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a road freight carrier's licence applicants must satisfy the EU criterion of professional competence. This criterion is satisfied by the applicant for a licence holding a certificate of professional competence, CPC. Where the applicant is a partnership or company the criterion is satisfied by either a partner or director in the business holding the CPC.</P>
      <P>Where the applicant is not the holder of this qualification he or she may employ a transport manager who holds the qualification to manage his or her business. Persons employed as transport managers must be available to continuously and effectively manage the applicant's road transport business. In addition they are not allowed to hold any other employment outside the road transport business.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions to the above rule are: where the person employed as a transport manager is the spouse-partner of the applicant. In such cases the transport manager can hold employment outside the road transport business and be designated as transport manager; where an applicant for a licence is sitting the next available CPC examination a transport manager can be designated on a temporary basis to allow the applicant to qualify for the CPC.</P>

      <P>The person named is an applicant under the national scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution. A final inspection of the investment works found that they had been carried out in accordance with my Department's specifications. Before payment can be made it will be necessary for the person named to submit a farm nutrient management plan which is a condition of the scheme. The farm nutrient management plan involves soil sampling which then must be analysed by a competent agency such as Teagasc. I understand that soil samples were taken by Teagasc, however, as a precautionary measure during the current foot and mouth alert no soil analysis can be carried out in any Teagasc laboratory. Teagasc are keeping the position under review and I understand that they will be guided by the expert group under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, Dean of Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD. I appreciate the difficulty which the delay is causing for the applicant but, in the circumstances, there is no alternative.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to introduce a comprehensive national identification system for sheep, involving the individual identification of all sheep by tagging, from next May, and my Department is currently working towards this objective. In the course of advancing this work discussions on the details of the system have been held with the various relevant representative organisations.</P>
      <P>Under the system, sheep will be tagged and details of all sheep on farms and of all sheep movements will be fully recorded. Processors will be required to link the individual sheep tag number to the number of the finished carcass. Ireland will thus, for the first time, have full traceability for all sheep, on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Sheepmeat Forum which reported in October 1999. In designing the new system, my Department has also taken full account of current and prospective requirements at EU level in relation to Sheep identification.</P>
      <P>I have consistently stated that I attach great importance to ensuring that this particular project is completed by May. Deficiencies in this area are no longer acceptable and I expect the co-operation of all concerned in ensuring that the full traceability system, based on tagging and encompassing producers, marts, processors and others can be put in place within this timescale.</P>

      <P>There is a tax incentive for energy production under section 486B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This is a scheme which I introduced in the Finance Act, 1998. It applies to solar power, wind power, hydro power and biomass projects approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, or £7.5 million for a single project, whichever is the lesser. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an Order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recent Finance Bill debate in the Seanad, I indicated that if there is a good case for a State subsidy for renewable energy, then it needs to be considered in the context of the <Col N="161" /> Government's energy and environmental policies rather than in the context of a major tax avoidance loophole, such as the limited partnership investment route. This limited partnership mechanism was used by the wind energy sector as well as other sectors prior to the closure of this tax avoidance loophole in the 2000 Finance Act. Furthermore, I indicated that I would consider looking at additional appropriate incentive structures for the renewable energy sector in the context of next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The position is that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes. This means that the social welfare pension is combined with any other income a person might have for tax purposes. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of other income that a recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case referred to by the Deputy, the taxpayer's pensions are liable to income tax. The tax on both pensions is deducted from her health board pension.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Admittance to a private nursing home is a private arrangement between the patient and the owner of the nursing home. My Department has no function in relation to the level of fees changed. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90 per week, £120 per week and £150 per week, in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. These rates are payable following the increase in the rates by 25% with effect from 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The rate to be paid in making such an arrangement is a matter for determination between the private nursing home owner and the health board. However, the application of these provisions is to be considered by the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>
      <P>Under the winter initiative I was pleased to provide funding of £13.736 million for the contracting of private nursing home beds by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. The allocation to each agency was as follows:</P>

    <P>The contracting of these beds allows for earlier discharge of patients from the acute hospitals for convalescence purposes. Typically patients admitted to private nursing homes will require short-<Col N="165" /> term care in a more appropriate setting prior to discharge home, thereby freeing up acute hospital beds for more acute medical and surgical admissions. My Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that 761 private nursing home beds have been contracted up to 2 April in response to demand. I am satisfied that that the initiative has helped to alleviate some of the pressures which are normally experienced in the acute hospital sector over the winter period.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable <Col N="166" /> nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As health boards have been advised, all aspects of the report are being fully examined in my Department and it is the intention to remain in contact with the health boards on this issue. No direction, on the lines as suggested by the Deputy, has been issued by my Department.</P>

      <P>At 1 January 2001 it is estimated that some 345,000 provisional licences were current. This compares to an estimated 380,000 provisional licences current at 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety, 1998 &ndash; 2000, acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing to road safety, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of the measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to attain this longer-term goal, the short-term priority is to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. A record 165,000 applications were dealt with in 2000. Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 115 testers compared to 66 in 1998. <Col N="167" /> Together with productivity agreements, Saturday and evening working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 100,000 tests to about 210,000 car tests annually.

      <P>Under Directive 74/483, bull bars and other exterior projections to motor vehicles are covered by an EU wide type approval arrangement. Provided a manufacturer has obtained type approval under this arrangement, it is not open to a member state to take action at national level to prohibit the sale or fitment of bull bars.</P>
      <P>At present, the European Commission is developing proposals for safer vehicle fronts, with particular reference to increased pedestrian safety.

    <P>
      <Col N="169" />
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy): My Department's most recent house price data &ndash; for the December quarter 2000 &ndash; reveal that house price increases in Dublin were showing signs of further moderation. New and secondhand house prices rose by 12.5% and 10.8% respectively between the last quarter of 1999 and the last quarter of 2000, significantly down on the increases on the comparable 1998/1999 period of the order of 23%. The average price of a new house in Dublin was £174,622 last year, while the average secondhand price was £194,559. Typical first time buyer prices are well below the overall average house prices. Indicative figures from my Department's house purchase survey suggest that new house price bought by first time buyers averaged £151,500 in Dublin in 2000, while the average secondhand price stood at £153,000.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the Government's policy on housing is to maximise the supply of housing to meet the rising demand. We have introduced a wide range of measures, most recently in the policy document, Action on Housing &ndash; June 2000 &ndash; to increase the supply of housing and serviced land through fast tracking of developments and targeted investment in key infrastructural projects, to discourage speculative property investment and strengthen the position of first time purchasers, to increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet rising housing needs, and to improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply.</P>
    <P>The Government have also introduced targeted measures to improve affordability, especially for first-time buyers, through measures to increase significantly the overall supply of houses, and the provision of a suitable mix of houses (including affordable houses) in residential developments; revised stamp duty thresholds and rates to ease the burden on first time purchasers, improve their position in relation to existing owner occupiers and investors, measures to discourage speculative demand, especially at the lower end of the market and significant improvements to the eligibility criteria under the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government is committing substantial additional resources to housing and housing related infrastructural development, over and above that which has been committed in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These further measures provide a comprehensive and coherent response to growing housing need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently almost all agricultural waste is spread on agricultural land. Landspreading is likely to continue as the dominant management route for the majority of such wastes, and is the most appropriate management option when carried out with due care, and in suitable soil conditions, to meet the nutrient requirements of the soil and crops. Guidelines for this purpose have been issued jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Primary responsibility for protecting water against pollution arising from the landspreading of agricultural waste lies with the person carrying on the landspreading activity. It is an offence under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, directly or indirectly.</P>
      <P>Alternative options to landspreading may need to be developed for certain areas where there is a shortage of suitable spreadlands or where soil nutrients are already high. Anaerobic digestion is one alternative management option in such areas, and its potential is being considered by local authorities as part of the development of waste management plans under the Waste Management Act, 1996. The EPA has commissioned a study to evaluate the feasibility of applying centralised anaerobic digestion for the treatment of organic wastes and wastewaters in sensitive catchments. Its results will inform implementation of relevant waste management plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility among public authorities for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. The EPA exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities. The EPA has <Col N="171" /> other relevant powers and duties in the context of licensing and other functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Local authorities maintain a high level of activity under the water pollution legislation, by way of investigations, inspections, the service of advice, prevention and warning notices and the initiation of prosecutions. Some 10,000 or more such actions per annum are typically taken. In addition, bye-laws have been made by a number of local authorities since 1999 to protect water quality against pollution from agricultural activities and I understand that the making of such bye-laws is under consideration by other authorities. Major catchment-based water quality management projects are being pursued by local authorities in relation to the Loughs Derg and Ree, Lough Leane and the Rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. In these projects, there is a high emphasis on measures to deal with agricultural pollution. My Department is actively promoting the establishment by all local authorities of more broadly based river basin management projects to address all sources of pollution in all inland and coastal waters including groundwaters, in the context of implementation of the water framework directive which came into force in December 2000.</P>
    <P>Significant new environmental protection controls are being applied to certain intensive agricultural activities under the EPA's IPC licensing system which has been progressively extended in recent years to apply to intensive pig-rearing and poultry rearing installations.</P>
    <P>I indicated in July 2000 that certain groundwaters have been identified as being affected by pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. Work is under way by local authorities to delineate the drainage areas which contribute to this pollution. This work is being assisted by guidelines prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland, at the request of my Department, and recently issued to local authorities. I intend during the current year to designate the appropriate areas as nitrate vulnerable zones &ndash; NVZs &ndash; and to require that special action programmes be implemented in these areas to protect water quality. The primary emphasis will be on securing better management of manures and slurries. A recent report by the EPA on the trophic status of estuaries and bays, also at the request of my Department, will be used in the ongoing identification of waters affected by nitrates pollution and future designation of the relevant catchments as NVZs.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 123 and 124 of the 22 February 2001, details of the most recent national inventory of zoned serviced land, based on returns from individual local authorities, were published in the September quarter 2000 housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. The results show that the position in relation to the stock of serviced building land is encouraging and is set to improve significantly going forward. In Dublin and the mid-east regions the supply of zoned and serviced land currently exceeds 3,250 hectares providing sufficient land for over 92,000 housing units. This includes all serviced sites of more than 0.5 hectare, including any brownfield sites, in the areas of the local authorities concerned. In addition, almost 3,760 units had been granted permission at the end of June 2000 in Dublin and the mid &ndash; east regions on sites of less than 0.5 hectare.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 131 of 22 February 2001.</P>
      <P>The current information available to me comprises the monthly air pollution monitoring returns from Kildare County Council up to January 2001; &ldquo;Ambient Air Quality in County Kildare, annual report 1999/2000&rdquo; prepared by the Environmental Health Officer's Service of the South Western Area Health Board; and the EPA report Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1999. A copy of the latter, together with an errata list prepared by the EPA in relation to data capture at monitoring stations in, <i>inter alia</i>, County Kildare, is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The foregoing publications include data on smoke and sulphur dioxide (SOf7&gt;2) for Celbridge, Leixlip, Naas and Newbridge. I have no data for Clane, Kilcock or Maynooth, nor in relation to any other pollutants in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>The EPA Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report, 1999, now indicates that the levels of both smoke and SOf7&gt;2 recorded at the Kildare monitoring stations with the required 75% of possible daily mean values &ndash; all stations for smoke, Celbridge and Naas for SOf7&gt;2 &ndash; were low and fully in compliance with national and EU air quality standards. The EPA has also provided me with an assessment of the potential for hydrogen fluoride pollution in Leixlip. Based on information to hand, EPA has indicated general satisfaction with air quality in Leixlip. The EPA Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report, 1999, provides information on monitoring equipment. The reply to Question No. 131 of 22 February 2001 provides additional information on equipment in Leixlip.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of its obligations to implement environmental monitoring programmes, the EPA published the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme &ndash; A Discussion Document &ndash; in August 2000. This has been circulated by the EPA for comment, primarily to local authorities, and made available on request. It provides further information on air pollution monitoring equipment in use currently and on that required for reporting under forthcoming EU directives. A copy will be provided to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are required to prepare an assessment of water services needs every five years. The main purpose of the assessments is to develop an overall strategic investment plan for each area for the medium to long-term and to set out a programme of works to meet identified needs. The most recent assessments carried out by authorities relate to the periods 2000-2006 and 2007-2118. The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, published by my Department in July 2000, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in strengthening vehicle emissions standards, most recently under the EU auto oil programme. Mandatory 1993 exhaust emission standards in the case of all petrol engined vehicles and certain light diesel engined goods vehicles were most recently amended with effect from 1 January 2001. In the case of heavy goods and passenger vehicles mandatory 1994 emission standards became more stringent with effect from 1 October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct time line comparison of the standards is not possible in all cases because of differences in the way in which they were specified initially in certain EU directives. In the case of petrol and <Col N="176" /> small diesel engines the following are the reductions in emissions from new vehicles, based on improved type approval requirements, between 1993 and 2001:</P>
    <P>CO emissions from petrol engines:27%</P>
    <P>CO emissions from small diesel engines:80%</P>
    <P>Combined HC and NOx from small diesel engines:50%</P>
    <P>Particulate matter from small diesels:72%</P>
    <P>The current type approval requirements in force for new large diesel engines provide for reductions in emissions of 18% for carbon monoxide, 11% for hydrocarbons, 22% for nitrogen oxides and 62% for particulate matter compared with the 1994 requirements.</P>
    <P>Data on total national road transport emissions are disaggregated in the national emission inventories from 1990-1998 contained in Table D-5 of the EPA report &ldquo;Emissions to Air 1990-1998&rdquo;, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. The 1999 national emissions inventories prepared by the agency have been provided to the UN Economic Commission for Europe, and a copy will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>It should also be noted that all of these escapes took place during prison escorts. It is the nature of such escorts that, despite the most stringent precautions, there will always be an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison.</P>
    <P>Following recent escapes, the Director General of the Prisons Service set up an expert review group to examine the circumstances of each escape and to review escorting procedures and the equipment used in such escorts. The areas examined include transport arrangements, staff training, the profiling of prisoners, searching procedures, the use of handcuffs and batons and the situation in relation to key holders. This group, whose members include the head of operations in the Irish Prisons Service and two senior prison governors, has completed the initial phase of its review and new guidelines will shortly issue to all prison governors. The review group will continue to examine other issues which require longer term actions which may involve other agencies, including the Courts Service and the Garda.</P>

    <P>Since I took office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure. In all more than 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way.</P>
    <P>For the first time in 25 years, we can accommodate almost all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. I qualify this statement only by reference to the female prison population where we currently have higher than anticipated committal numbers and for whom extra spaces will be provided shortly.</P>
    <P>The overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has, as a result of this Government's building programme to date, been reduced from 19% in 1997 to a current figure of about 6%. Almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. Those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances.</P>
    <P>The impact of this cut in unplanned temporary releases on the level of indictable crime in this jurisdiction is clear and irrefutable. The whole architecture of community sanctions depends on the custodial places being available to ensure that the sanction of last resort can be applied to offenders if they do not avail of the non-custodial options open to them.</P>

      <P>On 30 March 2001 there were 360 prisoners serving sentences for sexual <Col N="181" /> offences. As I have explained to the House on previous occasions there are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. These are as follows: individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service, the multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork, Arbour Hill and the Curragh, the intensive offence focused group work programme which has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh earlier this year and the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category.</P>
      <P>There are 18 prisoners currently engaged in the intensive offence focused group work programmes that take place in Arbour Hill and the Curragh Place of Detention. The number of prisoners who attended the thinking skills programme last year was 39.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above. The number of offenders undergoing one to one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. This counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling. Such a service is primarily provided by the probation and welfare service and the psychology service in my Department. Psychiatric services are also provided.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that it is not possible to compel sex offenders in custody to undergo treatment. Furthermore, I am advised that it would not be desirable to do so. The successful completion of any treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals. Otherwise, the key elements of the programme concerned with challenging the offender to take responsibility for his offending behaviour will not succeed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has been given responsi<Col N="184" /> bility for leading the development of child care service provision over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, I announced details of the Government's £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care which included a £1 million allocation to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the provision of employment grants of up to £5,000, through the city or county enterprise boards, to private child care providers who take on a new child care worker. This funding measure has been in operation by the 35 city and county enterprise boards throughout the country since early 2001. I have been advised by the Tànaiste, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that information to hand indicates that £101,975 in grant aid has been approved to 18 child care providers by ten enterprise boards throughout the country. These grants have the potential to create 35 full-time and three part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Apart from the £1 million allocation as part of the anti-inflationary package for child care during 2000 under the two regional operational programmes operated by the 35 city and county enterprise boards, £368,022 in grant aid both capital and employment grants was approved for 48 grants to child care providers by 20 enterprise boards. These grants have the potential to create 104 full-time and ten part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>While there is no staffing grant scheme for private child care providers under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme operated by my Department, such providers may apply under the programme for capital grants of up £40,000 to establish or expand a child care facility. To date, capital grants totalling £2.6 million have been approved for 113 private child care providers. Furthermore, child care providers may be able to avail of a capital allowance, which can be used to write off for tax purposes the costs of constructing, refurbishing or extending premises for use as a child care facility.</P>

      <P>Section 15(1)(a) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, requires that the Minister must be satisfied that an applicant is of full age before granting an application for naturalisation. Section 16 of the Act empowers the Minister to waive that condition where the application is made by a parent on behalf of a minor child and where he or she is acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations, or where he or she is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of a minor child.</P>
      <P>As the child covered in the Deputy's question does not come within the ambit of any of the foregoing provisions, the application in question was not accepted. However, the applications of the parents have been accepted. When these applications have been processed and if a certificate of naturalisation is granted to either or both parents, it will be open to the successful applicant(s) to make an application on behalf of the child. Alternatively, it will be open to the child to apply for naturalisation upon the attainment of full age.</P>
      <P>Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time at present is approximately two years.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of non-completion at third level is a complex one which has been a matter of concern for some time and a number of studies have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority recently published a report which was undertaken on their behalf by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, entitled A Study of Non-Completion in Undergraduate University Courses. The report found an overall completion rate of 83% for all first-time entrants to university undergraduate courses, in the 1992/93 academic year.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that a tracking mechanism is required to monitor third level students' progress from entry through their course work and through transfer to other courses and institutions. It notes that such a mechanism should provide for the identification of students who depart form third level education. The report also concludes that although some institutions already have good tracking systems in place, there is a need to develop an inter-institutional tracking system. Preliminary steps are already under way to establish tracking mechanisms. The Higher Education Authority is developing an Oracle based data system to store detailed student related data with a view to facilitating the identification of cases where students fail to progress to the next year of a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends that a comprehensive research study be undertaken to examine a range of issues relating to completion in the universities. The Higher Education Authority is currently pursuing this matter and I understand that this <Col N="188" /> study will include ascertaining the views of students.</P>
    <P>The HEA, under a series of initiatives aimed at boosting retention rates, currently funds a range of activities, including an investigation of the processes for dealing with student withdrawal, quantitative analysis of the reasons for student withdrawal, the development of a formalised tutoring/mentoring system, study skills programme, counselling for first years, development of a mathematics learning centre and an information pack for schools.</P>
    <P>At my Department's request the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology also commissioned the Education Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study of non-completion on the Institutes' courses. The first part of the ERC study comprises a quantitative analysis of first time entrants to the institutes of technology over a four-year period commencing in 1995 and shows an overall non-completion rate of 42.6% across the sector.</P>
    <P>The second part of the study, which is currently under way, focuses on a qualitative analysis of students who leave the institutes' courses without graduating. This will provide a valuable basis for the further development of student tracking systems and the range of measures adopted by the institutes to improve completion rates.</P>
    <P>In addition three institutes, Carlow Dundalk and Tralee, have carried out a study, which investigated first year students' perceptions on attrition and their reasons for not completing. This study has been published and has informed a number of initiatives being developed across the sector.</P>
    <P>The range of measures operating in different institutes includes additional supports to students identified as being at risk of dropping out. Attention is also being given to improving course materials and other information given to students. Institutes are also working on improving course delivery methods.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology conducted a similar study into non-completion on its courses. The results of the Dublin Institute of Technology study, which have been received by my Department, indicate an overall non-completion rate of 39.46% for the 1994 cohort of its first year full time students. It is understood from Dublin Institute of Technology that its research also includes a qualitative study of a cohort of first year full time undergraduate students and the reasons for attrition from courses.</P>

      <P>In the Labour Court clarification on 29 March 2001, it was acknowledged that a major effect of the ASTI dispute has been the loss of teaching time by all students in the affected schools. Both parties were strongly of the view that measures were needed to ensure that students affected by the dispute were not put at an ongoing disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other students and steps should be taken to ensure that the current year's school programme would be completed for all students.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Labour Court recommended that funding be provided for this purpose and that any teacher involved in the dispute, who is certified by the school as having contributed in full to the completion of the school programme, be paid the sum of £1,750.</P>
      <P>ASTI has agreed to put the terms of the Labour Court's recommendation and clarification to a ballot of its members. I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome to the ballot and that the school programme will be completed for all students.</P>
      <P>The examination process cannot be used as a basis for compensation for loss of tuition time. The integrity of the examination process is based on the preparation of test instruments based on syllabi and marking schemes devised for each test instrument and refined based on their application to samples of scripts prior to finalising the marking scheme. The same marking scheme is then applied to all scripts in a particular subject.</P>
