      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The communications unit provides a comprehensive information service to Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
      <P>The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible staff roster of three working shifts. The unit has a staff of seven civil servants, six of whom are on secondment from other Departments. Throughout the day the unit provides Ministers and their Departments with news updates and transcripts ensuring that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. The expected expenditure for the unit for 2001 is approximately £55,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the work being done by this unit is political in nature and it is being done on behalf of Fianna Fáil. The Information Commissioner established that when he refused to reveal information about its activities when we filed an application in 1999. He stated quite clearly that the political exception was being used because this was political work and the information could not be released to the public. I put <Col N="470" /> it to the Taoiseach that this is a disgraceful abuse of taxpayers' money. As in the so-called public information campaigns in which Ministers have taken part, taxpayers' money is being abused to promote the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered this question on several occasions. It is obvious that I will not convince Deputy Noonan of the truth and, therefore, I will not try to do so. The unit has no dealings with the Fianna Fáil press office; it deals only with the press offices of the various Departments. The unit also has no dealings with Government backbenchers and those who work in the unit would probably not know where to find the Fianna Fáil press office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Commissioner decided that the unit's work is political. The unit is totally funded from taxpayers' money and because its work is political in nature, the unit is serving the political interests of Fianna Fáil Ministers and Ministers of State. This is a gross abuse of taxpayers' money. I ask the Taoiseach, between now and the next general election, to have the grace to stand this unit down, in so far as it is engaged in political activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If providing transcripts of what has been said in the public domain and passing these on to public servants, Ministers and Ministers of State is political in nature, it must be accepted as such. The Deputy stated that the work of the unit is Fianna Fáil oriented. If he wishes to visit the unit after Question Time he is welcome to do so. I assure him the unit's work is not political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Information Commissioner decide it is political?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the unit first opened some years ago, a person worked there who was a member of Fianna Fáil staff. The individual in question prepared some documents and presentations which were similar to previous work they had done. They could have been and were classified as being political in nature. However, that was some years ago. At present, the unit is staffed by ordinary civil servants whose work saves the State and the taxpayer a considerable amount of money. If the unit did not exist, we would be obliged to pay top dollar for transcripts to be produced elsewhere. The work done by the unit is extremely useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard the Information Commissioner as an independent arbiter with regard to whether matters pertaining to Government business are either administrative or political in nature? If he accepts that the commissioner is independent, he should accept his conclusion. Do the costs that the Taoiseach listed in his reply include the full cost of the salaries of all those working in the information unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="471" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the first question when I said that was initially the view of the Information Commissioner. I accepted that at the time, but it no longer applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the commissioner changed his view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure his view has changed because questions have been answered since under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. That was one particular instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not be ridiculous. He should not mislead the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not misleading the House. I will not listen to glib throwaway comments across the floor. They are out of order. Let us be clear about this. This section is totally staffed by civil servants. They do the job once handed out around the town at top prices to various communications companies. Excessive prices were charged for tapes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan should remember that period, and the Finlay report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the lies that the Taoiseach told?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We stopped that nonsense. Now these matters are handled in an up-front and transparent way. The costs I gave are those of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify whether the costs the Taoiseach gave relate to the direct costs on the Vote for his Department? Does the answer that he gave to the House include the full cost of the salaries of the others in the unit who may be included in the Votes for other Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £110,000 or £120,000, I am told. Excuse me, that figure relates to the saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the costs. In the reply the Taoiseach gave at the end of March he only gave the cost of staff from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me that question, and I answered him. I said that was for my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach cannot find the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the Taoiseach could send it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a list of the staff in the Department. I have not got the list of costs available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of brevity, it can be sent to me. The unit is monitoring statements in the public domain, collating them, copying them and circulating them to the relevant Ministers when problems arise in the implementation of policy. This is now being done in-house rather than being contracted out to external agencies. Is it the Taoiseach's intention that this service will continue through a general election campaign or will the unit, because it is deemed to be political by the Information Commissioner, be stood down once the election is called?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The unit is working for the GIS. It is giving information not only to Ministers and Ministers of State, but to all sections. During an election campaign, people will not&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not quote. However, if I were to quote, I would say that the communications unit provides a comprehensive information service for Ministers and their Departments on Government policy and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to its implementation. What else does one need during an election campaign, but precisely that service? The unit is political. Will it be used during the course of an election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ministers are around, then the Departments will get the same information during the election campaign. It would be going to their Departments and the secretaries general anyway. There is no intrigue. The information is in the newspapers and the media. If there is an issue of importance, the press office in a Department is communicated with. This is not rocket science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite his ambiguity and refusal to read out what is in his brief, I put it to the Taoiseach that part of the work of this unit is to <Col N="473" /> monitor statements and speeches by Members of the House opposed to the Government and that it is transferring this information to Departments in order that Ministers and their press staff are in a better position to deal with political charges put to them by the Opposition. That is political and the reason the Information Commissioner&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As per normal procedure in the House, I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a fact and that the reason the Information Commissioner deemed this to be political is it is political and there is no other description of this work other than political. Will the Taoiseach at least have the grace to stand down this unit as we go into, and through, the election campaign?</P>

Will he confirm that that is part of their duties? Will he also confirm that it is the reason the Information Commissioner deemed their work to be political?</P>

      <P>First, I reject the Deputy's outrageous allegation that I had a figure in my brief, when I did not. He has still not withdrawn that allegation, but I expect him to do so during this series of questions. I read somewhere that he is a decent man. If he is, he will do so. Second, he is wrong because the staff concerned do not monitor the speeches of anybody in opposition or in Government. They take what is in the public domain, whether it be from radio, television or the press, and present a synopsis. If asked by a Department to give a report of an interview with a member of the Government, or anybody else, they can provide the tape, but they do not monitor speeches.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate what loss there is in his Department and across Departments to the private sector and if there is difficulty getting professional civil servants to serve in his Department?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The work the Civil Service Commission has done over the past year or two and the effort put into this area by the former Secretary to the Government to improve the system and the turnaround has worked effectively. Perhaps there is not as much movement in the clerical area as there was in the past. The number of vacancies in my Department is small. There are still high numbers in the Chief State Solicitor's office, but that is mainly following the agreement with IMPACT and others. That will change when it and the DPP's office moves after Christmas when they will be involved in an active recruitment to fill those extra posts. A survey was done by the Civil Service Commission and it showed that the retention levels in most grades in the Civil Service are good. It indicates there is no marked difficulty with retention across most grades. Where turnover occurs, it tends to be concentrated at clerical level. This is not altogether unexpected in the current jobs market where young people want to take their chances and get different job experiences where there are opportunities for them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the retention survey, a report on marketing and retention in the Civil Service was agreed with the SMI implementation group and Secretaries General and a programme has been developed. The recommendations of the work programme are categorised in short, medium and long-term goals. The implementation of the short-term recommendations is now under way and the implementation group of the Secretaries General will oversee the implementation in the medium and long-term. The report highlights the areas in which efforts need to be concentrated to recruit people, particularly in the marketing of jobs and the management and care of people. It is difficult in some professional areas, particularly the legal area, but most of the other areas are not having great difficulty filling posts. There is still a turnover in some of the areas where people move on quickly when opportunities arise. It has improved. A number of things have been implemented by the Civil Service Commission <Col N="479" /> and by the Civil Service to try to maintain people in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The eCabinet Project was initiated by Government last year. Following a competitive tender process, PricewaterhouseCoopers were retained last December to undertake phase one of the project &ndash; which is the feasibility study.</P>
      <P>Their task is to identify how modern information and communications technologies might be beneficially applied to the Cabinet process. Specifically, they have been asked to focus on particular aspects of the Cabinet process. These are: electronic distribution and management of Cabinet papers; use of technologies in direct support of Cabinet meetings; use of technologies to improve presentation of complex issues at Cabinet; and creation of new information resources.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made. The consultants have articulated a model for eCabinet setting out how they would propose it would work and the benefits it would deliver. Consultations have taken place with key stakeholders and presentations have been made to the Cabinet and to Secretaries General. Briefings have been offered to the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour parties. The consultants' report is nearing completion. The current focus for the consultants and the officials concerned is on the options for implementation, which of course will determine the eventual costs of the project. Once this has been addressed the final report will issue. I would envisage that the report will be finalised and go to Government this month. Thereafter, depending on the recommendations in the report, we envisage going to market for the implementation phase. All going well, we hope to be in a position to initiate a pilot scheme involving the Cabinet Secretariat and one or more Departments by early 2003.</P>
      <P>Numerous benefits have been identified. These include efficiencies which will be gained from electronic dissemination of documentation, improvements in presentation and content of memoranda, clearer presentation of information, quicker and more efficient workflows and of course substantial savings in paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost to date of consultancy on this phase of the project &ndash; which is being funded from the Government's Information Society Fund &ndash; is £91,930, inclusive of VAT. Given the numerous <Col N="480" /> components and various possible permutations for the model and different possible approaches to its implementation as well as the security requirements of the project, it will not be possible to indicate the likely costs for the implementation phase until this element of the study, currently in progress, has been finalised.</P>

      <P>The company was retained by the Department of the Taoiseach to assist with a project to reform and modernise its financial management function. The company assisted in carrying out a thorough business analysis of the Department's financial processes and recommended a strategy for implementation of the new Management Information Framework in the Department.</P>
      <P>Specific services provided included identification and explanation of key financial issues and formulation of a strategy for the implementation of the new Generic Model, including recommendations for improvements in financial management processes and the identification of resource requirements, timescale and cost of implementation.</P>
      <P>The amount paid was based on the tender price proposed by the firm in response to the Department's invitation to tender for the contract. Cost was based on the provision of a total of 48 person days. The cost was calculated on the basis of a rate per day for each consultant and was inclusive of discount, VAT and expenses. It included a significant discount on normal rates.</P>
      <P>This consultancy has brought a number of benefits to the Department including expertise in carrying out a number of functions.</P>
      <P>The main output was an implementation strategy for reform of the financial management function of the Department. This included detailed planning for tasks, timeframe, resource and project management requirements. This strategy forms the basis of the subsequent phases of the reform implementation process, which are currently being implemented by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has an amount of expertise in this area but this arose from Delivering Better Government. It was for a Generic Model for an improved financial management system, wider financial management process for planning resource allocation, programme evaluation, management control, including budgeting, day to day financial reporting, assessing performance and demonstrating value for money. Implementation of the model was based on changing from the old system where there were no accruals to a system of cash based accounting. I do not know if it was a question of nobody being available but I do not think anybody from the Department of Finance was doing this work. The Department was seeking to redesign, in two phases, its old financial process which was a straight write down system. It sought to engage a financial accountant to assist in the implementation of the work through the Department, design the implementation of management reports and examine the performance of value for money assistance. This was to help the management and budget systems in the Department. That is why this company was asked to assist with this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has two Bills awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil, the Statute Law Restatement Bill and the Interpretation Bill. It is hoped to progress these Bills through the Houses in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other item on my Department's legislative programme for this year is the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill. A draft Bill has been received from the parliamentary counsel and it is intended to have it considered shortly by Government and subsequently <Col N="482" /> published. The Bill, listed on the Government's legislation programme as legislation expected to be published this session, will combine the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the recently established National Centre for Partnership and Performance under a new statutory office. This will ensure close co-operation and co-ordination between these bodies given their complementary mandates in support of the partnership process at national, local and enterprise levels.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the preparation of this legislation, the arrangements for the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office on a non-statutory basis are progressing, including the recruitment for the post of chief officer. The executive chairperson, the director and the council of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance have been appointed and I officially launched the centre on 22 October. I am satisfied that it will be possible for the National Economic and Social Development Office and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance to function effectively on an interim basis pending enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain the delay in the introduction of this legislation? Last February he said it was imminent and in July he said its drafting was virtually completed. It is necessary to put this new body on a statutory basis, notwithstanding the progress that has been made. Why is this legislation so far behind schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept I told Deputy Quinn that a long time ago. He will recall it was initially delayed because of the involvement of the National Centre for Partnership. During the summer when I told the Deputy it was being drafted other priorities pushed it down the scale, but it is now ready. It is not holding up matters on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, but I would like it to be enacted because the new centre and new office are opening up, the staff are in place and its enactment would tidy up this area. It will bring NESF and NCPP together. It would be better if the new office was set up on a statutory basis. I will try to ensure this legislation goes through as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As always, there is an enormous amount of legislation in one form or another. Even though the parliamentary counsel's office recently got a number of extra staff and also got extra staff three years ago, the drafting process can be quite slow on some legislation. As I said previously, we have endeavoured to get Departments to either have their own expertise or, in the case of more specialised Bills, to use outside services to keep the legislative programme moving.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have agreed the composition of a new Information Society Commission, and will be announcing its membership very shortly.</P>
      <P>In its final report at the end of last year the outgoing commission made a range of recommendations to Government in terms of taking the information society agenda forward. Building on these recommendations, the Government decided last June to implement a range of measures to give further impetus to the development of the information society.</P>
      <P>Among the measures instituted is the establishment of a Cabinet committee on the information society to address the wide range of issues involved. The Government has also established an e-strategy group of secretaries general to drive the process forward and ensure information society issues receive the highest priority in the relevant Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress continues to be made in implementing the information society action plan, and this work is supported by the Government's information <Col N="484" /> society fund. This is providing funding of over 147 million, £116 million, to support action plan initiatives for the period 2000-02.</P>
    <P>Work has already commenced on preparation of a second action plan to take the work forward. The Information Society Commission will have an important contribution to make in shaping the plan and advising the Government generally on priorities in the plan. It is expected that the second action plan will be published early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the new structures now in place will greatly enhance ongoing formulation and implementation of policy on a wide range of issues that increasingly cut across traditional departmental boundaries. The new commission will have a key role in shaping the public policy framework for the evolving information society in Ireland. Like its predecessor, it will act as an independent advisory body, reporting directly to me, and draw on high level representation from the business community, the social partners and Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there has not been an Information Society Commission or a commissioner for almost 12 months is indicative of delay on the part of Government, which is somewhat less than acceptable. Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's comments about a further action plan, what is needed to ensure we bridge the digital divide is a co-ordinating body under the stewardship of one Minister. I ask the Taoiseach to give consideration to the appointment of a Minister of State with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the e-commerce regime. Most European states have at least a Minister with specific responsibility for this area. Without a Minister with responsibility for this area or an Information Society Commission, it is no surprise that Ireland has slipped in world ranking from a top ten position to No. 20 in the league table. This delay of almost a year is giving rise to concern on the part of business and enterprise. Does the Taoiseach accept he should act far more hastily in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main point made by the Deputy, I acknowledge that a number of Parliaments have appointed a Minister, Parliamentary Secretary or whatever title they use to deal with this particular issue. The first commission finished its work, but issued a long list of recommendations, which I outlined previously, which it believed should be put in place. It also recommended that we should prepare the work necessary for the second report before we actually put a commission in place. Its view was that it had signed off at a particular level and that all these issues should be addressed. That has happened and we now have a work programme for the second commission. I appreciate the work put in by the first commission. It wanted to ensure we signed off on the first action programme and completed the work involved across Departments <Col N="485" /> and agencies, although mainly in the Departments of Public Enterprise, Finance, Education and Science and other Departments. It took some time, perhaps too long, for people to get a handle on this.</P>
      <P>On the question of e-government, I agree with the Deputy and understand there is a question on that matter. An amount of work is being done in the area. It is being driven by a Secretary General in the Government office who is working on the issue and shaping the agenda with outside consultants. Of course, the Department of Public Enterprise is responsible for a certain amount of the work highlighted in the report. The Secretary General in that Department who is, thankfully, quite expert in these areas, has also been driving the agenda. We have followed to the letter of the law the proposals set out by the outgoing Information Society Commission. Its board was a very active group and I hope the new group of people being appointed will act with the same gusto and take the matter forward.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made the point that this area is changing and moving on. There is no doubt this is the case. A number of countries are spending enormous sums of money on it. There is a huge drive for change, broadband connectivity, new services and new ideas. This applies to Ireland as well although it may not be to the same extent in terms of money given the enormous budgets available in other countries. A report published in the past two weeks puts Ireland to the forefront in some aspects of this. The benchmarking is carried out in different ways and in different areas. We show up very well in some areas and not so well in others. The task is to try to achieve as high as we possibly can across all areas and use the substantial sums of money we are allocating for this to the best of our ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the more significant failures of the Government is the failure to roll out the broadband system, that we are at the bottom of the league table of OECD countries and that outside the greater Dublin area there is no access to broadband at competitive prices? In many parts of the country there is no broadband access and in areas such as the mid-west where there is access it is at three times the cost available in Dublin and is not viable. Broadband access is becoming essential for the retention of industry and its promotion in the regions. We have about 18 months to get this matter right. I ask the Taoiseach to take a personal interest in it because the plans the Government adopted three or four years ago are not being put into effect and those committed to rolling out broadband services have withdrawn from their commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs are competitive. Broadband is getting more and more competitive. Prices are being slashed continually around Europe. Global Crossing, one of Europe's biggest operators, is working in this country on our main broadband operation. I am not sure of the precise size of the network as I do not deal with it every day. It has, however, been extended to the regions. The more it is extended, the more competitive it becomes. The argument is that the only way one drives competition is to bring in greater numbers of companies and allow them access to this sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not waffling. I am saying that we have three companies involved in broadband connectivity. One of the biggest in all of Europe is Global Crossing, the company that is driving the process here with another company based in the technology centre on the Naas road. I cannot remember its name. They are both superb, high-tech companies whose main aim is to press broadband here. While they do not have a total network around the country, if the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Public Enterprise, he will discover that broadband connectivity is relatively good in terms of where it was. The reason it is not cheaper is that there is not enough competition in the market. Compe<Col N="487" /> tition only comes when more companies enter, but they cannot be forced to do so. That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a very serious issue and I am not trying to score a political point by bringing it up. It is something in which the Taoiseach should get involved. Broadband access in Ireland is available at a much lower level than in other countries of similar aspirations and industrial development. We are bottom of the league table at this stage. The companies which contracted to roll out the service have withdrawn and if the Tánaiste, who is present in the House, were to check with the IDA &ndash; as I am sure she already has &ndash; she would find that outside the greater Dublin area very significant companies are stating that if they do not have broadband services at competitive prices within two years, their competitive position will be eroded. In the light of this will the Taoiseach take a personal interest in the roll-out of broadband services? It is the most serious emerging lack in our infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the same point, which I do not want to repeat. It referred to the digital divide that has emerged. Is the Taoiseach aware that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Enterprise, to whom he referred last week, advised the Committee of Public Accounts that the current broadband network is 50% under-utilised? We seem to have got it quite badly wrong. If we are to stay competitive, this must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter comes under the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise and I will communicate with the Minister. Two of the top companies in the sector referred to by Deputies have operations here. They have rolled out broadband commercially. The price they originally quoted in the summer of 1999 was undercut in other countries because there are more companies in those markets. During the summer of this year the Minister for Public Enterprise announced a scheme for rolling out broadband to various parts of the country, including areas highlighted by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. I do not know if there are still other areas uncatered for that have been demanding it or if there are capacity issues. That information would have to be sought from the Minister for Public <Col N="488" /> Enterprise. I will look into what Deputy Noonan asked me to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>Sustained growth in the economy over a number of years has created a tight labour market. Consequently, a range of skills and labour shortages have emerged. However, current turbulence in the global economic environment is having an effect on economic output and the openness of our economy means that effect will have domestic repercussions. Our longer term economic growth will continue to be dependent on the level of skills available in the workforce.</P>
      <P>In its recently published third report the expert group on future skills needs highlighted a range of skills needs and projections in IT, construction and the life sciences. In consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have recently reconstituted this group and mandated it to continue to work on these and other skills issues over the next three years. In addition to the areas addressed by the group's third report, priority areas I am highlighting are the following: basic skills, with particular emphasis on literacy, numeracy and communications skills, which are the building blocks of lifelong learning; crafts skills and construction skills in particular, which are fundamental to meeting infrastructural needs; workplace skills and enterprise-led training, which is critical to the competitiveness of firms.</P>
      <P>Addressing these skills needs requires concerted effort and collaboration between education and training. I have just appointed the national training advisory committee, which comprises business and employee representatives, to provide me with high level strategic advice in regard to national training policy and on the priorities to be addressed under the national training fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice and recommendations of these bodies will constitute a valuable input into the development of skills policy and build on the achievements of recent years while forming the <Col N="489" /> basis of a response to emerging challenges and projected needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her reply and establishing the national training unit which is of particular relevance in view of the economic downturn. Over 14,000 people have received redundancy notices since January this year. October this year has the worst record of job losses of that month for almost a decade. I put it to the Tánaiste that the most important aspects of her policy must be upskilling and retraining. Other than appointing boards and instituting reviews what practical steps are envisaged? Will she consider allowing some form of tax credit to business for research and development and to employers in respect of further training?</P>

      <P>We have provided £75 million for an extra 5,400 IT related third level places. An additional 1,500 postgraduate conversion places in IT are being made available. There will be additional training of 700 persons in IT skills <Col N="490" /> through FÁS. The total funding approved was £84.2 million.</P>
      <P>We have introduced a retail traineeship in FÁS and there has been a significant increase in the number of apprenticeships in the construction trades. An additional £5 million for new courses was allocated for this year and the number of apprenticeship places being provided by FÁS and the institutes of technology is at an all-time high. There are a number of other initiatives such as Skill Nets, which have developed a network of upskilling at regional and sectoral level. This has been highly successful.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with Deputy Flanagan about the need to upskill the workforce. Of the £650 million FÁS budget &ndash; with the exception of community employment which consumes just over half the budget &ndash; the bulk of the money is going to upskill people in employment. It is the training of the employed. Notwithstanding what we must do and are doing in relation to upskilling the labour force, there is going to be a fall-off in its growth rate, from 27,000 last year to 12,000 for each of the next few years. In the light of this we are going to have skills shortages that will have to be met from outside the country.</P>

      <P>The latest ERSI report predicts that unemployment will double in the next while.

      <P>We are currently preparing for the fifth budget of this Government, which will be announced a fortnight from tomorrow. The Deputy is conscious that, in every budget we have introduced so far, we have been seeking to give people an incentive to work, reducing substantially the burden of tax on work, and making sure that people who work for a living are appropriately remunerated.

      <P>Redundancy arises where an employee's job ceases to exist and he or she is not replaced. Reasons include rationalisation or reorganisation, not enough work being available, the financial state of the firm, company closure, etc.</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-1991, oblige employers by law to pay redundant employees what is known as a statutory redundancy entitlement. The amount is related to the employee's length of service and his or her normal weekly earnings based upon his or her gross weekly wage, average regular overtime and payment-in-kind, all added together, subject to a ceiling of £400 per week.</P>

While there are no specific proposals to legislate for payments over and above the prescribed amount, the statutory redundancy scheme is kept under continuous review. In that context, correspondence has been recently received from SIPTU and ICTU proposing general improvements to the redundancy payments scheme. These proposals are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State information in his files that will give us the up-to-date position with regard to redundancies this year? Does he accept that the Redundancy Payments Acts as they stand are hopelessly out of date in terms of providing a safety net at some decent level for people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own? He did not address the question on when the sums were last increased other than by referring to the ceiling, but is it not the case that the floor has been the same since 1967, i.e. a half week's pay per year of service plus a week for somebody under 41 years of age? That has long been overtaken by the practice. When the Minister says the proposals are &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo;, does that really mean anything? Does he intend to bring forward reforming legislation?</P>

      <P>There are two questions tabled by Deputies with regard to the figures, one in the name of Deputy Flanagan, which will obviously be available later on. The cumulative total of redundancies notified through my Department to 30 December 2001 was 14,036. This represents a 38.4% increase in the numbers notified to me for the same period last year, which was 10,145.</P>
      <P>The House should also know that, in the past six months, there was an 80% increase in the number of notifications for redundancies. This is a serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I increased the ceiling from £300 to £400 on 1 April. That was obviously an indication by me that there was a need to address this issue. The Deputy has asked me for my views and it is time to look carefully at the question of the amount <Col N="492" /> involved. It is a complex matter. There are many different factors involved, not just with regard to the lump sum, but with regard to the calculation of the lump sum and the question of those who are under or over 41 years of age.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has made its views known on this issue. My view is that this issue needs to be addressed. It is under consideration in that sense. In the normal course of events, these issues are dealt with by consultation with ICTU and IBEC, which is the procedure in this case. Certainly, it is timely to address this issue.</P>

If so, has the Minister of State the approval of his boss, the Tánaiste, who expressed a different view to the House quite recently? She told me she is not in favour of renewing the redundancy legislation. Is the Minister of State in agreement with her? If they are only now consulting on whether they are in agreement, we really are in trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully aware that insurance costs have increased dramatically in the past year. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include High Court decisions that required insurers to strengthen reserves for claims arising in past years and the global impact of the events of 11 September on international insurers and re-insurers. Under EU law, we cannot intervene in matters of pricing or underwriting of insurance.</P>
      <P>Research has shown that insurance premia are high in Ireland because compensation awards are also high. Compensation for loss of income and for medical expenses arising from personal injury is paid for through the private insurance system rather than through the social welfare and health systems, as in other European countries.</P>
      <P>The costs of the delivery of insurance compensation runs at approximately 40% of the total cost of claims. The objective of the proposed Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is to reduce these latter costs so that insurance costs may also be reduced. The implementation group is expected to report at the end of the year on how the PIAB may be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is not set up yet. When does the Minister of State intend to set it up? When does he intend to implement the findings of the working group report on personal injury compensation? Is it true that, for the first time ever, there is now a clause in insurance policies stating that, within the year the premium covers, there can be a review of the premium? This is the first time it has happened. Will the Minister of State confirm whether this is true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal injuries assessment board has the full support of Government. An interdepartmental implementation group is working on that and we expect to receive a report from it by the end of this year on how we can proceed. When we receive this report, Government will take the final decision on how we proceed. We are anxious to have it up and running as quickly <Col N="494" /> as possible and the Government is totally committed to it.</P>
      <P>As regards the personal injuries tribunal or claims about which the Deputy talked, we hope to refer that, through the workplace safety initiative, to the PIAB when it is up and running.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent idea and we are very confident that it will have the full support of this House and the majority of the people because it is there to serve the citizens and to ensure we can deliver compensation to them quickly, efficiently and at a lower cost while not reducing the awards made to them in the normal way. There are many vested interests who do not like the way in which we are going. We hope those vested interests will see the light and that the Deputy will be able to support us in our positive progress on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about a condition that has been inserted in insurance policies and where it is alleged that insurance premia could be increased during the subsequent year for which the premia cover was given. That happened in one company post 11 September where an internal memorandum to managers said it would consider that. It was discussed publicly and as a result, I do not think it has proceeded. We have already spoken about this matter with the Irish Insurance Federation and we know discussions took place in the UK. I expect to discuss the matter again in the next week with the Insurance Federation.</P>

I read in the newspapers that it was proposed. I discussed it with people in the insurance industry and have been assured by all, except one company, that it was not happening in their operations. The other company does not operate out of this country but delivers services into it. We discussed it with the Insurance Federation which I will meet again over the next week. I will raise the matter again with it but I would not like to give any sustainability to this proposal because it is one I do not like and would not like to happen. It is important to recognise and realise, and I hope Deputy Belton hears this&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking fairly loudly because I think the Deputy is being distracted. Post 11 September, international reinsurers notified insurance companies of their proposals to increase reinsurance premia within the year for which the insurance companies had already paid reinsurance premia to them. This created a major tremor in international insurance and reinsurance and is something with which I, as Minister with responsibility for commerce, have to deal.</P>

      <Quest> her proposals for the issue of work permits for non-EU citizens; and if she envisages a reduction in numbers. </Quest>
      <QRef>[28909/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland does not have a formal quota based migration policy with country or sectoral quotas. The admission of non-EEA personnel is largely market-led. The onus is placed on employers to show that no EEA persons were available and willing to do the job. The work permit scheme is unrestricted in terms of the categories or skills of workers for whom applications can be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The number of work permits granted under the scheme has increased substantially in recent years and the number of permits issued in 2001 to date is in excess of 32,000. The working visa/work authorisation scheme has been operating now since June 2000 and in the period up to the end of August, a total of 3,870 permits have been issued for high skilled workers in the IT, construction and nursing professions.</P>
    <P>In light of recent setbacks in the economy and the rising level of domestic unemployment, I am concerned that applications for work permits are continuing to increase &ndash; the average number of applications per week received over the past eight weeks was in excess of 1,200. I will shortly announce modifications to the policy for issuing work permits in order to reflect the changing labour market environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from her reply that the Tánaiste does not wish to debate the modifications at this stage, which I regard as regrettable? When drafting the modifications to the scheme, I ask that the House have the opportunity to discuss them. Perhaps the most important aspect of the scheme is the division between skilled and unskilled. It would not be best practice to have a situation where large numbers of unskilled workers could be displaced by our national workforce having regard to the downturn in the economy. I refer to a quotation attributed to the Tánaiste in which she described the provision of work permits to non-EU citizens as a safety valve for our State. It was most unhelpful in the circumstances. We need a balanced approach having regard to our skills shortage and the requirement in the economy for a level of unskilled workers which is currently being met by the non-EU complement. When will we see the modified regime of which the Tánaiste speaks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Flanagan has suggestions, I would be delighted to hear from him. I mean that genuinely &ndash; I am not being flippant. On the one hand, I want a scheme that is flexible enough to deal with real issues which arise for employers when they literally cannot find employees while on the other hand, I want a scheme which will ensure we place the onus on employers in the first instance to offer jobs to our own nationals. That is my responsibility and that of all of us in the first instance &ndash; to see that our own people have employment.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the 32,000 permits issued so far this year have been to groups of workers, such as farm and meat factory workers and hotel and catering industry workers. A large proportion of them are in what I would call the low skilled or unskilled area. It is important that before we continue to issue work permits on a liberal basis, as we have been doing because of the shortages we were experiencing, we have some way to ensure the employers in question have gone to all possible lengths to find employees in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> I am considering a role for FÁS, which would certify that no Irish person was available for the job, or having some mechanism such as that which would be flexible. I want an opportunity to discuss it with FÁS and officials in my Department and that is why I am not in a position to announce today exactly what we may do. That is the direction in which we are going.</P>
    <P>In relation to a safety valve, I was asked what we would do about rising levels of unemployment. I explained there are in excess of 65,000 foreign workers in this country. A large proportion of them &ndash; perhaps 30,000 or so &ndash; are from other EEA countries and are entitled to be here. Others are here on the basis that no suitable Irish person can be found for the job. As I said &ndash; I will reiterate it &ndash; our priority is to find employment for our own people; if there is an Irish person available to do the job then the employer must recruit that person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste address, briefly, the balance she hopes to achieve between skilled and unskilled workers? I put it to her, regarding the issue of work permits to unskilled non-EU persons coming into this State, that there is a difficulty under the current regime which could well give rise to a perception that it is a form of bonded labour having regard to the bonded link between the employer and the employee and that is giving rise to a problem which must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Flanagan's view. It has been suggested that after a period of, perhaps, three to six months a person should be free to find alternative employment and not have to remain with the employer who brought them into the country. There are real issues involved. In many cases the employers pay air fares, fees and often recruitment companies when recruiting such people. A great deal of these work permits are going not just to the SME sector but to the micro sector and there are real cost issues involved. We must find a balance.</P>
      <P>The working visa arrangement is intended to deal with professionals. Perhaps we should consider extending the categories of professionals covered by that visa. The skills group have identified that we will need an additional 2,500 professionals and about 800 technicians over the next four years. Many of those positions relate to the construction industry. We are also examining the possibility of extending the working visa arrangement to groups such as accountants in the finance area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of establishing task forces to deal with the fall-out from major company closures and job losses has developed over the past six years. The mechanism has been used to ensure a prompt and effective co-ordinated response by State agencies and other interests to the job losses arising with particular emphasis on training and retraining and securing alternative employment opportunities for workers affected. State agencies, local authority, industry and worker interests have generally constituted the membership of the task forces.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing the effectiveness of task forces. My Department has consulted the relevant State agencies about the operation of task forces, including the agency role and the use of task forces as an effective mechanism for dealing with major company closures and job losses. I expect to receive an early submission from my officials on this matter following which decisions will be made.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding for task forces, the State agencies do not generally have a specific current or capital budget line for such purposes in the annual Estimates allocation. State funding requirements, arising from the administrative costs of task forces and the implementation of task force recommendations, are met from the overall Estimates resource allocations to the agencies and other bodies involved. Ring-fenced funding for integrated development packages has not been considered necessary.</P>

      <P>We have, as the Deputy is aware, a very difficult budgetary situation this year. We must seek to strike a balance and deal with priorities. I am concerned about the plethora of bodies which we have on the ground. We have county enterprise boards, county development boards and State agencies. What we seek to do, and must continue to do, is to bring more things together. This could be done under the umbrella of the county development boards which, although in their infancy, are beginning to work extremely well. Co-ordination is important. We are a small country with limited resources and we must co-ordinate how taxpayers' money is spent.</P>

Would she further agree that the <Col N="499" /> enterprise boards, which deal with companies employing one to ten staff, are totally under-funded and that small companies are being left to hang out to dry as a result?

      <P>However, the bulk of the wealth generated here and the exports generating this economy are, in relative terms, the medium to large-scale companies. Industry in this country does extremely well by way of grant aid, supports and a very attractive tax regime. I do not think we fall behind others in the support we give. There are difficulties because of the plethora of bodies and agencies. Perhaps, in the context of future developments, we need to look at how we can better co-ordinate activities to assist small companies. One thing is certain, when one has regimes one will have plenty of companies that want to exploit and use them. There are many examples of where some companies are clearly much better at what I call &ldquo;grant shopping&rdquo; than others. It is a question of having an effective and accessible system that is not over-bureaucratic. That is particularly important for very small companies that do not have huge numbers of people to assist them with applications and so on.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, I am currently reviewing task forces, some of which have been stood down and others which have remained in place because the group recommended they do so to oversee the implementation of recommendations. We do not want a country littered with State bodies of one kind or another because, in addition to the fact that it is a waste of resources, it is very confusing and places a huge burden on the personnel who have to service and work with the various groups. I accept Deputy Perry's point regarding co-ordination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive of the National Equality Authority has not brought to my attention any concerns he may have about the experience of migrant workers in relation to either the recruitment process or the extent to which they understand their rights before taking up employment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Virtually all migrant workers coming to Ireland are recruited through employment agencies of one kind or other. There is anecdotal evidence of some workers being required to pay fees etc., to recruitment agencies or other intermediaries. Irish law requires that the recruitment costs be borne by the employer. While we do seek to influence the behaviour of such companies, clearly Irish legislation cannot apply overseas. Neither are we in a position to dictate the nature of their links with other overseas recruitment agencies.</P>
      <P>I made it clear in the Dáil on 21 March, in response to a parliamentary question, that we need to tighten the legislation on the authorisation and registration of employment agencies and I promised a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business. This review is continuing. I am aware, from reports in the media from time to time and complaints investigated by the Employment Rights section of my Department, that non-EEA workers in this country are not always aware of the rights and protection afforded to them under our legislation. In contacts between my staff and some of the embassies of the countries of origin of our migrant workers they continue to emphasise the array of rights which migrant workers have and copies of booklets produced by my Department, which set out clearly the rights of all workers in Ireland have been handed over.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new format for the work permit application form which has been in use since 1 July sets out in summary form the principal rights to which a worker is entitled to and the declaration which the prospective employee must sign states that he/she has been supplied with a copy of the details of his/her employment rights. In addition, the employer is required to sign a declaration that the full benefit of all relevant Irish employment rights will be applied to the migrant worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to try to overcome the difficulties which can arise with workers who may not understand English my Department has produced and made available a short summary document setting out the main employment rights. This paper has been translated into eight different languages <Col N="501" /> consistent with the principal foreign languages of the migrant workers coming to Ireland. It is also available on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister of State as I have to leave the House soon for another engagement.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister of State mean by saying that these matters have not been brought to his attention? Surely, the Minister is aware that the chief executive of the National Equality Authority is on record stating that 20% of his caseload concerns racially motivated cases. Surely the Minister has read the various stories in the media about the abuse of immigrant workers which are, in many cases, reminiscent of the abuse of Irish emigrants in the 1950s and 1960s. Is the Minister aware of the case of a Romanian worker in Limerick who testified that, as part of the bonded labour contract to which Deputy Flanagan referred, he is committed to staying in a house owned by the employer and that, as a result, the rent which would normally be £700 per month is £2,240 a month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am aware of the chief executive's public statements. I simply made the point that he has not been in touch directly with me. I am aware of the type of cases Deputy Rabbitte has cited, although not necessarily the one he mentioned. Many cases have been brought to our attention by the trade union movement and others. The Deputy may be aware I intervened in the case of Filipino workers in that I contacted their Ambassador and was involved in putting in place a support system for workers from that country. As I outlined in my reply, there were issues surrounding payments made by workers in their own countries. We have dealt with individual cases and groups of workers from certain countries.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the types of measures we have taken which come under the jurisdiction of our legislation. The fundamental review is also taking place. We have also improved the work permit application form. In the absence of the fundamental review, we have undertaken many good measures in updating the legislation and dealing head-on with issues where workers need protection. Workers from abroad or from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, have the same rights in Ireland as Irish workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>FÁS has informed me that, since commencing in 2000, a total of £5.5 million was spent on the Jobs Ireland overseas recruitment programme, representing less than 1% of the annual FÁS budget of £650 million. FÁS has also advised that, in early spring of this year, it conducted a review, together with Irish employers, of its non-EU recruitment programme and decided in light of certain economic signals to suspend the campaign from April. There are no plans to actively recruit individuals from outside the EU-European Economic Area.</P>
      <P>FÁS continues to act as the Irish partner in the EURES network of employment services established by the EU-EEA to facilitate free movement of workers. EURES assists employers to find workers from EU-EEA member states and assists job seekers to find employment in those states. FÁS has been a partner in the network for more than ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that, in effect, FÁS has ceased its overseas programme and that it will not engage further in the type of recruitment abroad by way of seminar in non-EU countries? Does she agree that it is important for FÁS as a training and development agency to revert to first principles and deal with the training and up-skilling of unemployed people in Ireland?</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to two areas where FÁS needs to engage in a pro-active campaign, namely, early school leavers and people with disabilities. These two groups need to be targeted to ensure they can enter mainstream employment in so far as they can.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that alongside employment levels of an unprecedented nature having been obtained in recent years, we still have a real and acute problem with long-term unemployed people? What steps will FÁS take as a priority to deal with this issue rather than empire building abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>FÁS has ceased the Jobs Ireland campaign, other than campaigns it has in Europe, and has done so for very good reasons. Clearly the economic downturn warranted that approach. I had a meeting with senior executives and the director general of FÁS last week at which they informed me that they still have 80,000 vacancies in Ireland. They are constantly trying to source people for those vacancies for employers and there is a need to bring in workers from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that the priority is to help our own people, especially those who do not have skills. Although long-term unemployment has been reduced to 1.2% or fewer than 20,000 people, for as long as that number exists, they must be the priority. The responsibility for <Col N="503" /> training people with disabilities was given recently to FÁS so that it can be mainstreamed. The agency is conscious of that. I recently appointed someone representing that sector to the board of FÁS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I have a breakdown of that figure of 80,000 vacancies? I am very doubtful about it. Given that a number of recruitment agencies are winding down their operations in Ireland because of a lack of demand for their services, will the Minister consider having the overseas budget for FÁS used to assist Irish people who wish to return to Ireland? I hate to say it, but a massive spin has been put on these figures. I doubt there are 80,000 vacancies. Will the Minister give a breakdown of those? Given that 80% of permits granted are to unskilled labourers, who will train them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood what happened. FÁS held jobs fairs in which employers participated and at which prospective employees attended and met employers. Other authorities, such as the Revenue Commissioners, also participated to explain such matters as Irish revenue laws and so on. FÁS did not give commitments in terms of employment. It simply facilitated employers to meet potential employees. Permits were subsequently granted to individuals if they had a job. The contractual arrangement was between the employer and the individual, not between FÁS and the individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in some cases people who came to the fairs may not have found a suitable employer, may have given their CVs to and registered with FÁS which subsequently connected those people with employers, but there was always a connection between the individual and an employer. There was no question of bringing people to Ireland without their having a job and a contract of employment.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> the number of firms registered for the Dignity in the Workplace Charter; and if she will make a statement on the campaign against bullying in the workplace. </Quest>
      <QRef>[28622/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dignity in the Workplace Charter, which I publicly launched on 23 October 2001, originates from a recommendation of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying. The charter has been endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Construction Industry Federation. Each of these organisations supports the charter by promoting its adoption by its constituent members and by facilitating its distribution among its members.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the Dignity in the Workplace Charter is not a statutory requirement on an employer. Therefore, no system is in place whereby employers register for the charter. However, I have been informed by the Health and Safety Authority, which is the central co-ordinating State agency overseeing the implementation of the task force recommendations, that to date it has distributed more than 3,000 copies of the charter. The authority anticipates that a high level of demand for copies of the charter will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the charter is to facilitate the management and staff of any and every employment in the country to make a public commitment to provide a workplace free of bullying and to develop policies and procedures which underpin its principles and objectives. Its real value is that it is as relevant to the large multinational company as it is to the micro-enterprise. It is only one element of the strategy to prevent workplace bullying. The task force report recommended a series of actions that should be taken at both the level of the State and the individual enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal recommendations requiring State action include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency; the introduction of three codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work <Col N="505" /> Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998; and the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying within the HSA.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee, which has already been established, has a key role in co-ordinating and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations relating to the State's role in responding to workplace bullying, including the three codes of practice.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The advisory committee has representation from the main State agencies and bodies dealing with workplace equality, welfare and labour relations issues, in addition to IBEC and the ICTU. In addition, the Health and Safety Authority has set up a bullying response unit to deal with queries from businesses, interested groups and members of the public.</P>
    <P>While the adoption of the charter is an important public commitment by an enterprise to prevent and address workplace bullying, enterprises must also have in place appropriate anti-bullying policies to deal with allegations of workplace bullying. The codes of practice on bullying and harassment being finalised by the Health and Safety Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Equality Authority will greatly assist employers and managers by providing guidance on putting in place such policies. The codes will also be a valuable reference point for the State agencies charged with offering advice and assistance. I expect to be in a position to make a public announcement on these codes before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Workplace bullying will, ultimately, be most effectively prevented by actions taken at enterprise level. With the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the establishment of the bullying response unit within the authority and the development of the three codes of practice, the State will have put in place an appropriate framework and structures to assist enterprises in both preventing and addressing the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister of State said in his reply and on previous occasions, I put it to him that progress on this matter is far too slow, that there is no system in place and that bullying in the workplace is now a widespread problem. He can distribute charters to 3,000 firms throughout the country, but unless sanctions and a scheme with firm targets are introduced, this is doomed to failure. Will he elaborate on the timeframe and targets which apply, in terms of its remit, to the overseeing body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to be able to make a public announcement on these codes before the end of the year. I disagree that the work we have done in this area has not been effective. This is the first occasion on which a Government has tackled the <Col N="506" /> issue. Nobody had been willing to deal with the issue of bullying in the workplace until the Government decided to do so.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, codes of practice are quasi-judicial in nature, admissible as evidence and have been taken into consideration in relevant proceedings. The three codes, about which I hope to make an announcement before the end of the year, will be another important step in the process. We have involved the social partners in dealing with the problem of bullying in the workplace and the survey indicates that a total of 7% of those consulted and currently in the workforce stated that they were bullied in the six months preceding the survey. The incident rate among women is almost twice that which applies to men. The representations I have received show that people are concerned about this serious issue, which we are determined to tackle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function regarding the regulation of air fares within the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>Under the Consumer Information Act 1978, which is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, it is forbidden to publish any advertisement which is false or misleading. With specific reference to advertisements for air fares, consumers have the right to reliable, transparent information about air fares before they buy a ticket. In that connection, at the end of last year, and in response to an investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs, I made an order under the 1978 Act concerning advertisements for air fares. The Consumer Information (Advertisement for Airfares) Order, 2000 &ndash; S.I. No. 468 of 2000 &ndash; which came into force on 1 March 2001, entitles air travellers to comprehensive information as regards the full cost and availability of the fare on offer. The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for enforcement of the order.</P>
      <P>The advertising industry also has its own self-regulatory body, Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland. The ASAI has a code of practice of advertising standards, which provides that an advertisement must be legal, decent, honest and truthful, and should be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society. The ASAI complaints committee considers and deals with complaints from the public by reference to the code of practice.</P>

Does he <Col N="507" /> agree that the gimmicks promoted by airlines to encourage people to return to travelling by air are a cause of major concern to consumers? In some instances, people have been sold one way fares and obliged to pay twice the original amount in order to return home.</P>

I agree with him that this issue needed to be addressed, particularly in terms of the fact that people were not being informed with regard to the full cost of air travel. The order I introduced has dealt with that issue because the total price payable must include all the charges payable in addition to the price of the ticket, with the exception of any charge imposed in respect of a method of payment, for example, a credit card, which, if applicable, must be clearly stated separately. The order is very clear and I would be happy to provide the Deputy with a copy if he does not already possess one. It has only been in place for a number of months, but it was necessary to introduce it because there were people in the industry who were not providing air travellers with the complete picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was tabled to the Tánaiste, but I would be glad to reply on her behalf.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste is very much aware of the jobs situation in Waterford. The closure of Cadena Ireland in Tallow was the subject of an Adjournment debate in the Dáil last month. The full services of the agencies of the Department are available to respond to job losses and, in particular, to find alternative opportunities for workers affected by redundancies. FÁS is playing an important role in both assessing and providing training and retraining for workers and has been very active in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>The strategy Waterford policy, which the Tánaiste announced on 23 February 2001, is aimed at developing Waterford as a dynamic centre for business and industry. All relevant interests are represented and this special focus on Waterford will be a major benefit to all areas of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> During the past five years almost 3,000 jobs were announced in IDA assisted companies in Waterford city and county. Planning permission has also been received for a new 77 acre IDA technology park which will include 200,000 square feet of modern office buildings. One of the key developments this year was the establishment of Nypro Waterford, with Enterprise Ireland support. This company is engaged in manufacturing electromechanical components and will lead to the creation of 400 jobs in the next four years. Enterprise Ireland has also approved £385,000 towards a high-tech community enterprise centre in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is confident that the efforts of the industrial development agencies under her remit, including the county enterprise board and the involvement of local business interests, will see Waterford continue to develop as a county offering excellent job opportunities. Furthermore, the county development board has a very strong focus on economic development in west Waterford. Its ten year strategy is due to be launched early next year. All the development agencies are represented at senior level on the board, with trade unions, employers and elected representatives.</P>
    <P>In effect, the combined actions of the development agencies and the county development board represent the best approach to the immediate and longer term development interests of the area. The establishment of a task force would only duplicate the efforts already being made and undermine the important work being carried out at local level. In the circumstances, the Tánaiste does not propose to establish a task force for west Waterford.</P>

      <P>West Waterford is a separate entity to Waterford city, to which the Minister of State referred quite a lot in his reply. Parts of west Waterford are located up to 50 miles from the city. There is a major unemployment crisis in west Waterford which I would like the Department to establish a task force to address. A total of 400 jobs were lost at Waterford Foods&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for the following reasons. First, it purports, among other things, to refer Committee Stage of the debate on the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution Bill to a committee. That is unprecedented. The precedent regarding debates on amendments to the Constitution is that Committee Stage is taken in plenary session in the House.</P>
      <P>Second, when he introduced the legislation the Taoiseach gave a commitment that there would be a full, open-ended debate without a guillotine, and that all Deputies who wished to contribute would be accommodated. He is now saying, contrary to the commitment he gave which is on the record of the House, that this Bill will be drummed into a committee so it can be debated on a Thursday and Friday when least attention will be paid to it in the House. I object to this proposal for that reason.</P>

      <P>Third, there is a precedent and a commitment to the Opposition that two weeks will pass between the completion of Second Stage of any Bill and Committee Stage. We are faced with a situation in which the Taoiseach and the Government are not only ordering Committee Stage for a committee, but they insist the committee will begin its debate on Thursday. We need time to table amendments, but are being told that our amendments have to be in tomorrow morning. This is unacceptable. It is not only contrary to precedent in debating a referendum Bill, but to precedent in debating any Bill. We raised this matter on several occasions and received assurances from the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making a brief comment. I have stated three reasons I am opposing the Order of Business, but I have a fourth reason which I would like the opportunity to state. Not only is it contrary to precedent that Committee Stage is being taken before the two weeks between Second and Committee Stages have elapsed, which has always been the practice, but we now learn from the Taoiseach's aside that Committee Stage will be guillotined and that rather than having an open-ended Committee Stage debate, the Bill has to pass within seven days of being ordered. The notice given to Fine Gael is that the Bill will be taken this coming Thursday and Friday, and the following Thursday with a view to concluding that day. The arrangement is being put in place by the sponsoring Minister. This is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the fifth time an attempt has been made to amend the Constitution in respect of abortion. This issue has commanded a significant amount of attention and time and aroused much feeling throughout the country. When the Taoiseach proposed this fifth attempt following extensive consultation and debate, and the workings of the special committee, we were promised comprehensive debating time on the floor of this House. In a document circulated by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Attorney General expressed the view that it was envisaged that Committee Stage of the Bill would be taken by the entire House in both Dáil and Seanad so as to allow Members to contribute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has indicated that not all Members will be present on Thursday and Friday, nor will the fourth estate give the debate in a committee room the kind of attention it would give it if it took place on the floor of the House. We all know this to be a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to do two things today. We are asked to curtail Second Stage debate before every Member who wishes to speak has an opportunity to do so. We are also being asked to enact legislation which will enshrine in the Constitution legislation which can never be amended by this House. We can repeal it due to a technical flaw in the Bill, but we cannot amend it. That is a non<Col N="518" /> sense in itself. For this, and many other reasons which could be made on Committee Stage, we wished to hold the debate on the floor of the House. I asked the Taoiseach to adjourn until we got the documentation. According to the information communicated by telephone to the Labour Party's Whips' office, there will be a technical breakdown of sections during the seven days on which Committee Stage will take place.</P>
    <P>Our understanding of this is that, effectively, sections 1 to 3 will have to conclude by a certain time, which is an internal guillotine. Section 4 and so on will have to conclude by a certain time, which is another internal guillotine. For these reasons we are opposed to this proposal about which I am appealing to the Taoiseach. The Tánaiste is undecided as to whether there will be a referendum. While she is looking for consensus, she is not even here to try to get it.</P>

The Green Party objects to it given that not only has the Minister for Health and Children said all Stages would be taken in the Dáil, but that the Attorney General has also expressed this view. It is on the record of the relevant House committee. When the question was put as to where Committee Stage would be taken it was stated by the chairperson that it would be taken on the floor of the Dáil. I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, not to make liars out of all the individuals mentioned. If we are looking for consensus, we should observe the precedent and the view expressed by all those esteemed individuals who all said Committee Stage should be taken in Dáil Éireann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not every day that an elected dictatorship rams through legislation in this House and we should be given some time to protest about it, however meekly. Am I correct in understanding that the procedures in this motion &ndash; I have not seen anything like it in my 25 years here &ndash; are such that no vote of any kind can be taken on any Opposition amendment in the course of Committee Stage? Is that the reason the Taoiseach wants to bury this in the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, the Taoiseach will recall we had difficulties on Finance Bill debates previously when a similar device was put through the House, where at the end of the day, while it was possible to voice vote amendments on Committee Stage, it was not possible to put substantive issues by way of vote. On the face of it, this Second Supplementary Order Paper which was not circulated in time seems to ensure that only section votes can take place and that votes on amendments cannot take place.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business the Taoiseach said this order would ensure that Committee Stage would have to be taken within seven days? Is that seven debating days or seven calendar days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address a point of order to you, Sir, one that I regard as extremely important. I understand, under standing orders of this House, that matters of the Constitution by way of constitutional amendment are taken in a committee of the full House so that all sections of the House and every Member can have his or her views represented. Is it not a fact, Sir, that a committee of this House does not represent all the parties of the House or all the Members and on a constitutional matter there has never been an occasion&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will you let me put the question? If you feel the need to send for the Ceann Comhairle to answer the question, I invite you to do so. I am asking for a ruling on precedent. It is unprecedented for a constitutional amendment not to be debated in the Dáil so that it is the right of every Member and every party to table amendments, voice their opinions and have their vote recorded? Is not that, Sir, the unaltered precedent for every constitutional amendment?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach spoke emphatically when I asked him what the seven days mean. If Deputies listened carefully, they would have noted he said that Committee Stage will start next Thursday and the committee can sit until the following Thursday if it wishes. He said it can sit on Saturday, Sunday and every day until midnight, but effectively he is saying there will not be seven days debate on this Bill in committee. The debate will take place only on Thursday, Friday and the following Thursday. That is three days of debate spread over seven calendar days. That is outrageous. It is a guillotine. This has never happened on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach is attempting to close debate on this Bill in the House.</P>

In explaining that this would provide adequate time to the committee to debate the matter in full, the Taoiseach called on the precedents of the Finance and Social Welfare Bills. There are rolled votes at the end of sections of those Bills where rafts of amendments are not debated, including amendments tabled by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare. The precedent is not that there is adequate time; the precedent proves that usually there is no time for the debate on many amendments. It is because the Opposition is forced to process the Finance Bill within a calendar period of set dates that it agrees to it. There is no such rush in debating this legislation. If the Taoiseach rushes this, he will regret it in February. The Taoiseach rushed the referendum on Nice and he lost it and he will lose this one too if he rams it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Taoiseach agree it was very unfair to use so much public money to seduce people who had no experience of the stock market into using their life savings and borrowing money on the expectation of profit in purchasing these shares? Now that they have lost so much, will the Taoiseach at least acknowledge the lack of wisdom in what the Government has done? Second, the Taoiseach will be aware that persons who buy stocks and shares can, for capital gains purposes, offset a loss against a gain, but small shareholders do not have such an option because most of them never held any other shares and are unlikely to hold shares in the future. Will the Taoiseach consider introducing a measure in the Finance Bill to allow small savers to offset their losses against income tax rather than capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point raised by Deputy Noonan is something that can be examined in the Finance Bill and should be put in that format. It is never nice to see somebody put their investment into an asset, share or bond on which they do not win, but we should also be mindful that many of the small shareholders sold their shares quickly and made a gain. Many of them got in and got out very quickly. When Eircom first came up for sale, I recall clearly that the argument in the public domain, and it was well argued in this House, was that we should not allow all the shares to go to the banks, the investors or the pension funds and that it was the right of the ordinary small saver to have access to those shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the matter I am about to raise was first raised, the Tánaiste took Leaders' questions but she was not briefed at the time and did not appear to be aware of the decision CIE had taken. At a time when 15 of the 20 cyclists who lost their lives over the past six years in this city alone were the victims of heavy goods vehicles trying to make their way through the city, and in light of the decision by CIE to reduce its rail freight traffic by 46%, displacing the approximately 1.25 million tonnes it currently carries, and, assuming freight would be carried on a 40 tonnes truck, that as many as 35,000 additional truck journeys would be made on our roads, and given the current underdeveloped state of our infrastructure and the tragic accident that took place yesterday in Monasterboice the constituency of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, will the Taoiseach agree that this is a retrograde decision by CIE? Since this matter was first raised, and having regard to the desperate number of lives being lost on our roads, particularly involving heavy vehicles, has the Government had time to consider the position of CIE and the decision it took on behalf of the stake holder and shareholder? Has the Taoiseach any comment on whether the Government will reverse this decision so as to return some degree of safety to our roads system until such time as it is fully upgraded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with all the relatives and friends of the bereaved in yesterday's tragic accident at Monasterboice, and with the relatives of all the young people who have been slaughtered on our roads in recent months. Against that background, and taking into account that three out of every four fatalities on our roads involving cyclists over the past six years have involved an articulated truck, and that one out of every five fatalities on our roads involved an articulated truck, will the Taoiseach accept that it is extremely unwise of the Government to endorse the policy of CIE to transfer so much freight from rail on to articulated trucks on a roads structure which is still totally inadequate? To put it bluntly, will the Taoiseach take steps to reverse this decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Quinn and Deputy Noonan in sympathising with the families and relatives of Fiona O'Neill and Dominic Wogan who were killed in the terrible tragedy yesterday, and the four or five families who were bereaved over the weekend as a result of road fatalities. As I understand it, the Department of Public Enterprise has not got a proposal. There <Col N="533" /> have been reports about Irish Rail pulling back on its freight service because it wishes to devote its service to commuting, but the Minister for Public Enterprise has not received any formal proposals from Iarnród Éireann about changes in the future direction of rail freight, so we cannot withdraw a proposal or be condemned for sanctioning a proposal when one has not been put forward in the first place. If it did put forward such a proposal, the points made by Deputy Quinn have been debated by my colleagues. Rather than pulling back totally on freight, there are many innovative ideas that could help to move freight by rail out of the city, which would not only help Iarnród Éireann but reduce the number of heavy trucks in the city. That point has been made, and I am aware that the Dublin Port Authority has been looking at proposals to move some of their heavy vehicles out of the city. This applies equally in other parts of the country, although I am aware the Deputy's fears about cyclists relate to the Dublin area. The position is that Iarnród Éireann has not made any proposals to the Department, the Minister or the Government about changes in rail freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the representative of the shareholders, I ask the Taoiseach, through the Minister for Public Enterprise, to raise this matter directly with the board. We are reliably informed the proposal is before the board and that one of the reasons for this is the necessity for the freight section of CIE to reduce its expenditure. The company's intention to reduce freight along the lines just suggested &ndash; I will not repeat the figures in the interests of brevity &ndash; shows it is, in effect, following what it interprets to be Government policy. It is not acting unilaterally, but in a manner it understands to be Government policy and in compliance with the financial framework within which it must operate. There will be more accidents in the short-term if this freight comes on to our roads.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform himself as to exactly what is happening and take charge of the matter? The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is not capable of doing so. If it is a question of money, will he ensure that, at least for the next couple of years until some sections of the infrastructure are completed, CIE will not be forced to disgorge on to our inadequate road structure lethal cargoes as a result of which people may be killed, as we have tragically seen already? He has the power to do this. On behalf of people, who are still alive, I ask him to do it, please.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the proposals on how Iarnród Éireann could alleviate the dangers of freight on the streets make a great deal of sense. The operators of a considerable number of the heavy vehicles burdened with the job of moving freight into the city would be glad if Iarnród Éireann moved it out. I do not see how it would negatively affect the company's commercial man<Col N="534" /> date to do this. I checked with the Minister what these proposals were about in recent days and will raise the matter again. The proposals may be before the board, but they are certainly not with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy O'Kennedy. This Bill provides for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of human life in pregnancy. Its proposals, which represent the first legislative response to the legal issues remaining unresolved since the X case in 1992, are fair, reasonable and compassionate. The issue of abortion is a sensitive one for society and it is heartening that the response to the proposals to date has been of a measured, mature and thoughtful nature. There has been none of the rancour that characterised the debates in 1983 and 1992.</P>
      <P>It is very important to acknowledge that the law alone cannot deal adequately with the often tragic realities of crisis pregnancy in modern society. On more than 6,500 occasions in the past year alone women giving an Irish address have had abortions in Great Britain. That is about 18 women every single day of the year. Of course many Irish women have made this journey in previous years also. The difficult circumstances faced by these women and the often lonely decision they have made demand sensitive understanding and a compassionate response from us all. We must also strive to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy by every reasonable means at our disposal. The law represents only one part of the picture. Education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways much more important. That is why a comprehensive approach is being adopted on the three different planes of Constitution, legislation and practical caring intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 is to provide that a medical practitioner or any other person will not be obliged to carry out a procedure to which he or she has a conscientious objection, even though it may not constitute abortion under the Bill. <Col N="538" /> Given that the Bill in effect simply provides legal protection for current medical practice, it is not expected that this provision will have any adverse effect on current practices. Section 4 deals with travel and information. The Bill will protect freedom to travel and the right to information in accordance with the existing provisions in the Constitution which were approved by the people in 1992. It also makes clear that a person shall not be restricted from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her conduct there would be an offence under this Bill were it to occur in Ireland. The proposals in this Bill represent a fair and reasonable attempt to resolve the constitutional and legal difficulties that have surrounded the issue of abortion since the judgment in the X case in 1992. They are also the culmination of a lengthy and detailed process of consultation and debate. The time has come to move on from that and attempt to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>A pregnant woman should be entitled to whatever medical treatment she may need, even where this may unavoidably place the survival of her unborn child at risk. Any legal doubt about what is permissible in such circumstances must also be removed so that doctors will be able to continue to provide the necessary treatment in accordance with established medical practice. The Irish health care system has an enviable reputation when it comes to the care of expectant mothers and their children and the proposals in this Bill will protect current practice, not change it. A constitutional provision without legislative backing would run the major risk of subsequently being interpreted by the courts in an unanticipated manner. Therefore, the method the Government has chosen is the best way to ensure that safeguards are put in place which spell out straightforwardly what is and what is not allowed. The provisions can be amended only if the people so decide in a further referendum.</P>
    <P>The proposed Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill spells out clearly and unambiguously what will be permitted under the law and describes the straightforward constitutional provisions which will govern any future amendment of the law. That means the electorate will have a clear understanding of the meaning and effect of the various provisions in advance of a referendum. The amendment is designed to acknowledge that the issue of abortion is one on which the people wish to have the final say while at the same time leaving the matter primarily in the legislative domain. The Bill will also remove any doubt there may be about the legality of treatment doctors might consider necessary where a pregnant woman suffers from certain rare, life-threatening medical conditions. It will provide certainty for doctors who may have feared that some interventions, although accepted medical practice in such circumstances, might have been unlawful.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Second Schedule defines &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill as &ldquo;the <Col N="539" /> intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of the woman&rdquo;. It provides exemption from the definition as abortion of a medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk to the woman's life other than by self-destruction.</P>
    <P>In the course of the hearing of medical evidence by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution it became very clear that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity intervention by doctors to safeguard the mother's life can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn. On reading the testimony of the all-party committee it becomes apparent that while there are differences of language and interpretation amongst members of the medical profession, their approach to the care of pregnant women and their unborn children is essentially the same. Their objective in all cases is to ensure that women receive all the medical care they need while affording maximum protection to the health of the unborn children.</P>
    <P>If the people accept the proposal, the amendment to Article 43 will have effect only if the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas within a period of 180 days, otherwise the amendment in its entirety is nullified. The mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The proposed constitutional changes on this occasion are designed to ensure that the legislation has a sound constitutional basis and that the careful balance it strikes will not be subject to legal challenge from either side of the argument. They are designed to reassure the people that they will be consulted if a change is proposed in the future.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Bill to amend the Constitution will give effect only to the constitutional amendments involved. The only way in which the terms of the legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy can become law or have any effect is through a separate, subsequent decision by the Oireachtas to enact that legislation. While it may never be possible to satisfy every point of view or to devise a solution acceptable to all, the Government has sought, by fostering a reasonable, calm and structured national debate, to develop a consensus on how the issues arising from the X case and C case judgments might finally be resolved.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the Government decided that a Green Paper on abortion would be prepared. This document was published in September 1999 and welcomed by many interested parties as a clear and balanced document, setting out as it did the history of the issues and the different arguments <Col N="540" /> advanced while discussing the principal constitutional and legislative options. The Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, for consideration. The committee embarked on a process of detailed consultation seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper. Over 100,000 submissions were received from individuals and organisations. Subsequently the committee held hearings at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions, including representatives of the medical profession and the churches. The committee's proceedings and its report were published in November 2000 and generally agreed to be fair, balanced and of great value in educating and informing public and political opinion.</P>
    <P>The proposals that the Government has launched give protection to the life of the unborn human. The purpose of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill is to provide for the amendment of the Constitution to state that the proposed Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill, 2001, shall be the law on abortion in the State. The amendment provides for the operation of a mechanism whereby proposed changes to Article 43 of the Constitution and the text of the proposed legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy will be put to the people in a referendum. It will also protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment which doctors consider necessary in the case of rare, life-threatening conditions occurring during pregnancy. The issues have been explored in great depth before the committee. We have listened with open minds to the opinions of the people on the protection of the unborn. We have considered ways and means of advancing in a way that can command the support of all our people. I have consulted my constituents and have no doubt that the Bill, as published, is the best way forward. It is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>I have always believed strongly that the unborn child must be afforded every possible legal protection by our society and its laws. My opinion in this regard has not changed in any way during the years. As one sadly observes the level of abortion in most contemporary cultures throughout the world, a most serious question must be asked of modern day standards and priorities.</P>
    <P>The practice of abortion, to which I am opposed, is an attack on the innocent defenceless human being at a time of great vulnerability. The legislation before the House will give protection to the unborn child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we have to take this legislation in the House at this stage. I do not mean this evening, but at this stage in the experience of our people. Having said that, I am implacably opposed to abortion, like so many other Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I will now explain the reason I regret we have to take these steps to correct what is a totally unacceptable position. It is because of the consequences of the last referendum, the Supreme Court judgment that followed and the fact that, unfortunately, we allowed ourselves to be influenced at the time by zealous people &ndash; perhaps of good intentions &ndash; who wanted to have a constitution somewhere in the world that would actually be, as they saw it, an example of what they wanted to see in every other constitution. Unfortunately, their good intentions have given rise to very major complications, both in law and the Constitution, and not done anything to enhance the position of the unborn or, for that matter, protect the life of the mother to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>I am probably the only one in the House who attended the debates in the House of Commons in 1966. I personally heard David Steele introducing his legislation at the time, the purpose of which, as he stated it, was to clean up and regulate backstreet abortions, by way of bringing them under proper medical control. It was very desirable, as seen by the British public and British parliamentarians. David Steele said on the same night that if he thought that the consequence of his Private Members' Bill would be to introduce abortion on demand, he would withdraw it.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates that when we mortals and legislators think we can tidy up matters that are very fundamental, we sometimes do the very opposite of what we intend to do. I wonder what David Steele's view now is on the intention of the Bill he introduced in a country where there is now, clearly, abortion on demand to the extent that it is also, obviously, having a major impact in Ireland. We are being told that our young women can go to England to avail of this facility, which is not available here.</P>
    <P>My wish is that we could go back to the pre-1992 days when we had a very clear position before a lobby group persuaded the Government to bring forward an extraordinarily complex and unsuitable amendment. The Government and Opposition at the time, on the front benches, clearly indicated the risks of such an extraordinary introduction into our Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right. The position before that year had been very clear. There was a criminal offence created under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, in respect of which people had been prosecuted and convicted. This was in a minority of cases, but the legislation was in place. The people and courts knew the position and could interpret the law as it was. In addition, it has to be said that if someone said, &ldquo;There was no particular provision in the Constitution to protect the rights of the unborn,&rdquo; his or her argument would be entirely fallacious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> It has long been established in our judicial judgments that there are rights &ndash; unenumerated rights &ndash; that are so essential that they precede all judicial decisions. Judicial determinations have to take account of these rights. Examples of such rights are the rights to fresh air and clean water &ndash; rights that do not need to be stated in the Constitution. It is my conviction that the right to life of the unborn was clearly in that category until the zealots arrived and told us that they wanted a special provision.</P>
    <P>What was the consequence of this? The consequence &ndash; which I notice even in this Bill, about which I have reservations &ndash; was that all of us were party to a judicial determination that we had the right to travel. Imagine, in a democratic society, the need to proclaim the right to travel, particularly in this democratic society, where countless millions of our people have exercised it. Who has the right, under any circumstances, to prevent someone travelling outside the jurisdiction? If the totalitarian states of the former communist countries had introduced such an amendment, it would have made some sense in their case, because the right to travel was never available to any citizen, be they pregnant women or anyone else. As a consequence of much nonsense, we introduced the right to travel to our Constitution, a provision about which I still have reservations as it is totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Believe it or not, we have another right, the right to information. Is anyone suggesting that, in a democracy such as ours, there is not the right to information? Do we also have to write it into the Constitution?</P>
    <P>I regret, for the reasons I have just stated, the need to discuss and enact the legislation before us. Having said that, it is about the best that can be done to attempt to correct the mistakes we have made as a consequence of making unnecessary concessions. As I said, I am implacably opposed to abortion. The legal advice given to those who saw their opportunity and their right to create what they saw as an absolutely foolproof legal provision was wrong. I will not listen to any of them now presenting themselves as legal experts, a point to which I will return. Some of them still hold views as to when life begins revolving around definitions of implantation and conception.</P>
    <P>It is very important that what we do is done within our scope and competence. The Bill, imperfect though it is, is about the most perfect instrument we can introduce at this stage to correct what is a very confusing and unsatisfactory situation. Those who now present themselves as medical or legal experts &ndash; some present themselves as both &ndash; are walking on the head of a pin in relation to the distinction between implantation and conception&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is about the best possible attempt, reserving the right of the Oireachtas to give effect, after 180 days, to the constitutional amendment. It is also imperfect, but the best that can be done because of the awful amendment we introduced some time ago. We talk about rights, particularly those of children before birth. The right to life is an absolute right. Each other right we have under our law and Constitution can be regulated and qualified in the legislation we pass. This Bill does that as effectively as it possibly can in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject on which people hold, and in a democracy are entitled to hold, fundamentally divergent positions based on different value systems. It will never be possible to devise legal formulae that reconcile fundamentally different value systems so the key is to be tolerant, to respect the opinions of others but without being afraid to proclaim one's own. In my contribution, I will explain why the Government should accept the Fine Gael amendment, explore some of the suggested defects in this Bill and how they could be put right, explain why it is essential that those who reject the Bill totally be required to table their own alternative proposals and try to deal with how the philosophy of human rights applies to this case &ndash; when does a child become human and when does it acquire human rights.</P>
      <P>The Government may be making a mistake in introducing this Bill so late in the life of this Dáil. It is always easier in a hasty referendum to get people to vote No. People can be persuaded, often wrongly, that if they vote No, nothing changes. This will be very wrong in this case. A No vote in this referendum is likely to change everything and that is why the Taoiseach's strategy is risky. A second No vote to an alteration of the X case judgment would create greater pressure on the Dáil to introduce substantive legislation to permit abortion in the circumstances of the X case, namely where there is a probability of a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother from her own hand. Such legislation would raise many difficulties but these difficulties are not now on the table, are not now being debated and the people are not aware of them. The jurisprudence of the X case allows for abortion to take place at any time up to birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated by a leading psychiatrist, John Sheehan, there is no fail-safe way of saying or testing whether a person will commit suicide. The British Rowlinson inquiry said that to perform an abortion on this psychiatric ground was not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law but put women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion. Psychiatrists would not want to be the blame-takers under such legislation for a political decision or, <Col N="544" /> indeed, for a decision of the people. This is clear from the testimony of Dr. Anthony Clare, quoted earlier in the debate.</P>
    <P>These problems will become very obvious if legislation to implement the terms of the judgment in the X case were tabled but they are invisible now. People are not seeing the whole picture, only the criticisms of the present proposal. That is why there is wisdom in the reasoned amendment put forward by Deputy Gay Mitchell. The three months delay proposed by him would allow those in this House who do not favour the Government's proposals and who want to vote against them the time to come forward with their own proposals. These alternatives could then be rigorously tested in debate alongside the Government's proposals. At the moment, it is only necessary for critics to criticise.</P>
    <P>A big advantage of the Fine Gael approach is that a three months delay would allow the crisis pregnancy agency to be fully operational before the Dáil finishes its work on this Bill and to be making a real impact before the people vote in the referendum. This must be done urgently in any event but it would create a much more positive atmosphere for the decision and it would reduce the risk of misinformation and unanswered questions inducing people who might otherwise like to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The Taoiseach should know by now how difficult it is to get people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in any referendum. He tried to adopt a fairly hands-off approach to Nice and we are only now beginning to experience the problems that has caused for this country.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear Deputy Conor Lenihan say in regard to the referendum on the Bill that in this case politicians should not canvass vigorously or aggressively. That is code for saying that he is not going to canvass at all. If that happens and if others follow him, then there will certainly be a &ldquo;no&rdquo; majority to the Government's proposals. This is another argument for the more deliberate approach suggested by Deputy Gay Mitchell. It will give us time to ensure that the key values issues at stake are not unnecessarily clouded by avoidable technical questions. Many voters are so busy nowadays that they only focus on a referendum question in the last seven days before polling. The scope for scare tactics during that time frame is enormous. That is why maximum public political testing of any Bill and of its opponent's alternatives should take place before the matter is put to the people. The Government is making a mistake and is compounding that mistake today.</P>
    <P>This issue is a difficult one. We are dealing with two lives, the life of the mother and the life of a child in the womb. Both are alive but one is someone we know, someone to whom we can speak, someone for whom we can feel, someone we may love. The other person remains almost an abstraction and we use abstract words like &ldquo;foetus&rdquo; and &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;&ndash; as if all of us in this House were the undead &ndash; to describe this life. Yet it is a life and <Col N="545" /> a life that has human rights, a life with great potential.</P>
    <P>I studied the contributions of all the Members to this debate. Deputy Shatter asked with great sense why nothing had been done in the past four years to make adoption, as an alternative to abortion, more attractive. I agree with him. That could have been addressed by the Government and the Taoiseach in the past four years and it could be addressed in the next three months if Deputy Mitchell's proposal was accepted.</P>
    <P>In many contributions, a tolerance was shown towards speakers with other viewpoints. Deputy O'Sullivan, in particular, said that although she did not share their opinion, she genuinely respected the view of people who feel the threat of suicide could be used by somebody who wanted an abortion for a reason the majority of Irish people would feel inappropriate. Other Deputies, however, suggested that to even hold such a view was &ldquo;not to trust women&rdquo;. The difficulty here is that any law other than one based on the woman being free to chose abortion without any constraint is one which could be attacked on that ground &ndash; of not trusting women. Any abortion law other than one based on abortion on demand would involve professionals, some of whom are likely to be men, making judgments about whether a woman who wants an abortion should be allowed to have one. That problem is not peculiar to this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies said that as a result of this Bill, a woman's life will no longer be equal to that of the foetus. This statement is not correct. In the case of medical risk, the legislation seems, quite rightly, to give priority to the life of the mother over the life of the child in the womb. If a threatened suicide were to be a ground for abortion, there is a possibility that the threat might be fulfilled. If, however, an abortion takes place in those circumstances, there is not a possibility but an absolute certainty that the life of the child in the womb will be ended.</P>
    <P>A concern has been expressed that the Bill will give a blank cheque to the medical profession in ethical matters. I doubt if this is true. The Constitution is read as a whole by the courts and I do not believe that the medical profession could interpret the provision of this Bill in a fashion that runs counter to Article 43.3 which remains in the Constitution and which is merely supplemented by this new article. If this fear of a blank cheque is genuine, then the medical circumstances where a termination is to be permitted could be explicitly listed in the Bill. Any Deputy who has that fear has the obligation to put forward such an amendment. Likewise, if, as some Deputies believe, there are concerns about unregistered medical practitioners conducting abortions under the Bill or about either unduly restrictive or unduly liberal lists of places at which terminations may take place being provided for by ministerial regulation under the Bill, then those concerns too should be addressed by introducing greater certainty by means of amend<Col N="546" /> ments. Those who make those criticisms have an obligation to put forward such amendments.</P>
    <P>Some might say introducing such amendments would introduce too much detail indirectly into the Constitution and would be too inflexible. If that is their view, they cannot at the same time then complain that the proposal is uncertain. In all law-making, there is always a trade off between detail and flexibility. The more detail one has, the less flexibility and the less detail, the more flexibility. It is as simple as that. In any event, the Oireachtas, contrary to the view of some speakers in this debate, has a right to intervene and introduce further amendments to this legislation after it has been adopted by the people. The only restriction is that these amendments would have to be approved by the people in a referendum. Given that we have had a number of constitutional referenda in recent times, that is not an insurmountable obstacle.</P>
    <P>Some argue against the proposal on grounds that it is riddled with uncertainty. Others say that introducing detailed legislation is cumbersome and unnecessary. Although one speaker seemed to adopt both points of view in the course of his speech, both positions simply cannot be true. If we want certainty, we must have detail. If we want detail, we must have legislation. If we want legislation to alter an existing Supreme Court decision, that legislation must amend the Constitution. It is that simple.</P>
    <P>The Government will not withdraw this Bill. Members and each voter will eventually be faced with a decision. It is our job to offer them the best possible one. The Government's guillotine approach is not a good idea. The suggestion made by Deputy Quinn on the Order of Business is a good one and will allow the type of debate needed. Legislation to give effect to the X case is not the way to go. It would leave the life of an unborn child dependant on a subjective judgment taken by a mother in extremely stressful conditions, a judgment which might be bitterly regretted. Such legislation might provide for one, two or three psychiatrists to sign certificates but the only certainty is that when all is done the child will no longer be in the womb, the child will be dead. That is a hard and hurtful thing to say but it is, unfortunately, true. It is a certainty, not a possibility. Such legislation would definitely end one life without necessarily saving the other.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the potential weaknesses of legislation to implement the X case can be remedied by skilled drafting. The fundamentally subjective nature of the suicide risk makes that impossible. This brings me back to human rights considerations. There is a United Nations declaration on human rights. As a nation with a written Constitution, we pride ourselves on the protection we give to human rights and we promote them throughout the world. How does the concept of human rights apply to this Bill? What are the human rights of the mother? Is the child in the womb human? If it is not human, what is it? If it is human, is its human right to life to be pro<Col N="547" /> tected by law or are all its human rights to be entirely dependant on the decision of its mother in all circumstances? This is the core issue. Is a human right something intrinsic or is a human right something that is only granted to someone who can speak up for themselves, someone who can go to court? A child in the womb cannot go to court. That child is entirely dependant on someone else acting on its behalf. I believe human rights are intrinsic and are not dependant on one being able to go to court. I further believe that State involvement in human rights issues is justified precisely because some human rights cannot be left to people taking private legal actions.</P>
    <P>If the State is to be involved in human rights at all, then surely it must protect, above all others, the right to life. Without that right, all other human rights cannot be exercised. That is why I say this issue goes to the heart of our concept of human rights. Furthermore &ndash; and this is important &ndash; the extent to which the State should protect a human right should be greater the less the ability of the person concerned to protect his or her rights. That is common sense. The child in the womb cannot go to court to protect its rights. This brings one on to the next question. Is the child in the womb human and is it therefore entitled to human rights protection? We all know from medical and psychological studies that the child can feel pain. We know that what happens to the child in the womb can influence its future life not only medically but also psychologically. This is already recognised in civil law in all jurisdictions. The victims of thalidomide had their human rights vindicated on the basis of things that happened to them before they were born.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that we are human before we are born. If our Constitution deals with human rights at all, it should extend to those as yet unborn. I do not agree, therefore, with the revisionist assertion that we could have got away in the longer term with having a Constitution that protected the right to life of the born but not the unborn. The courts sooner or later would have been forced to the conclusion that the child in the womb is human and is therefore entitled to constitutional human rights protection, if such exists.</P>
    <P>Some argue it is hypocritical to provide constitutional protection for the unborn life while allowing or even encouraging women to travel freely to Britain thereby dumping our problem on another country. I accept fully that the pressure for abortion here would have been much more intense if Britain were located 600 miles away rather than 60 miles. At the end of the day we must do what we believe is right whether Britain is 60, 600 or 6,000 miles away. That is what self Government is about. Surely no one is suggesting that in order not to be accused of hypocrisy we should copy British law in all matters so that Irish people can travel to Britain to avail of British law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> The Government's proposals deserve to be seriously debated with serious alternatives and amendments put forward. The electorate are too mature, too well educated for politicians to make each-way bets on this issue. To those who will say the Government's proposals must be rejected, I repeat my challenge: come forward with your own proposals; come forward with your own legislation to deal with the difficult cases mentioned &ndash; suicide, rape, incest, poverty, job loss, mental illness and say then how those proposals are reconciled with your concept of human rights, the human rights of women and the child in the womb. The people can, then, begin to make a real judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past four years, the Government has engaged in a long and complex process to consider all sides of the issues related to abortion, medical interventions in the course of pregnancy and the protection of human life. This process was designed to facilitate a full reflection on all aspects of the issue. It served that purpose well.</P>
      <P>It involved the production of a Green Paper, extensive hearings by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on abortion and the production of its comprehensive report, and many months of work by a Cabinet committee examining achievable options for a way forward.</P>
      <P>The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution and the contents of the Protection of Human Life Bill are the culmination of the Government's detailed consideration of all the issues of the past four years. We embarked on the process in a legislative vacuum in respect of current medical practice where the only statute on abortion remained the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. There was also a background of failed constitutional referenda &ndash; the failure of the 1983 referendum to work as its promoters expected and the failure of the proposed and simplistic wording on the substantive issue in 1992. The courts were the only arm of the State making law on the matter.</P>
      <P>It was well past time for the Government and the Oireachtas, to bring forward a workable proposal, a modest step forward that would put a woman's relationship with her doctor at the centre of the issue and ensure legal protection for medical interventions in pregnancy. The process of deliberation was designed to build consensus around as many of the issues as possible. It has proved very valuable in creating the conditions in which this House and the public at large can debate the issues in a fully informed way, calmly and without rancour. By and large that has been the tone of the debate in this House so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats in Government agree to this proposal being put to the Oireachtas and to the public for debate. The deliberative process helped us form our views on a proposition that would be capable of gaining acceptance from the people. We were also very mindful <Col N="549" /> of the developments of the Medical Council in relation to its ethical guidelines particularly its decision last September which brought an additional degree of clarity to these issues for medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>We paid particular attention to the evidence heard at the all-party committee regarding the risk of suicide for women during pregnancy. This arose in the context of whether and how we could legislate effectively for the circumstances of the X case without giving rise to undesired results.</P>
    <P>Psychiatrists who gave evidence to the all-party committee said it was impossible to predict reliably if someone was likely to commit suicide, especially if a pregnant woman was refused an abortion. Professor Anthony Clare said, &ldquo;No such statement can be made with any great safety.&rdquo; Dr. John Sheehan of the Rotunda Hospital said:</P>
    <P>There is no test or in a sense there is no fail safe way of saying the person will or will not commit suicide. It actually doesn't exist.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Well Woman Centre commented in their evidence on the possibility of legislating for the circumstances of the X case, and stated there were &ldquo;immense difficulties involved in defining parameters for such legislation.&rdquo;  They added:</P>
    <P>We are aware that it is almost impossible to define medical criteria which would not in time lead <i>de facto</i> to a liberal abortion regime to which we would be opposed, and we would indicate that some other jurisdictions have found that the only practical way was to define a term limit or a time limit at which abortion should be permitted, and this was a model to point to.</P>
    <P>The logic of their analysis is clear. The question is whether it can be applied in practice, constitutionally or politically, in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that current constitutional provisions preclude any abortion law based on time limits or term of pregnancy. That is the reality of our starting point for amending the law. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has stated, we are not starting with a greenfield site constitutionally. We are governing in the context of the existing Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. Those who want a liberal abortion regime or the many who would permit abortion in the case of rape or incest must recognise that their chosen position requires a constitutional amendment to reverse the 1983 referendum and the provisions of Article 40.3.3º. If they were in government, they would have to assess whether their proposal had any chance of receiving the assent of the people in a referendum. In 1986 the people roundly defeated a proposition to introduce divorce in Ireland. Ten years later a modest and conservative divorce regime was put to the people and narrowly adopted.</P>
    <P>We are not in a greenfield site, constitutionally or politically. We are governing and making law <Col N="550" /> in the context of realities today. This includes the experiences of many thousands of Irish women who have chosen abortion. Their experiences and choices must inform our approach to the issue. We must show sensitivity to women who have chosen and will choose abortion. It is never a choice lightly taken.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of views among the people on these issues and this creates practical political limitations on what will be democratically accepted. This limitation has been seen very clearly in trying to deal with the issue by way of a simple constitutional formula in a referendum. Clearly, the Constitution contemplates scenarios in which the people's sovereignty in law-making should be expressed via referenda rather than wholly through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been against the approach of dealing with the complexities of the abortion issue by way of simple constitutional formulae. I am pleased to say the Government has rejected this approach. The proposal the Government has brought forward is fundamentally legislative with the addition that the people will be allowed give their assent or otherwise to the legislation directly, as many wish to do.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal is a modest, incremental step forward. The Bill places the relationship between a woman and her doctor at the centre of legislation, unlike the existing Offences Against the Person Act and the failed substantive amendment in 1992 and other constitutional formulae that have been proposed. It is a significant advance on current statute law in the area by removing any legal doubts about current medical practice. Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, referred to this in an article he wrote recently for <i>The Irish Times</i>:</P>
    <P>The most obvious benefit in this Bill from a gynaecologist's point of view is that a seriously ill mother can now be offered a termination of pregnancy in this State if it is done to save her life. This is a very rare event and when it was done in the past there was genuine doubt in the minds of practitioners whether they were breaking the law. To know with certainty that recognised medical practice is legal is a considerable comfort for these very unusual cases.</P>
    <P>If I understood his article correctly, this was fundamentally the reason he said he would support the proposal, albeit with reservations.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's proposal a woman will receive all necessary medical treatment indicated by her doctor and agreed by her during pregnancy. Doctors will have more certainty. Women will have more confidence that their doctor-patient relationship cannot be interfered with by third parties seeking to make legal or constitutional points in the absence of clear law on the issues. The Bill also creates legal certainty for the position of the morning after pill and the use of intra-uterine devices. It was not sufficient to regulate the availability of the morning after pill solely by virtue of licensing decisions of the <Col N="551" /> Irish Medicines Board acting in the context of inadequate statute law on the matter.</P>
    <P>Some argue that we should leave things as they are with no change in statute law. This position would accept that the entirety of statute law relating to medical interventions for women in pregnancy, the protection of human life and abortion should be as stated in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861. It is entirely inadequate to leave a 140 year old, 19th century statute stand as the only legislation on these matters. For example, that law includes the penalty of life imprisonment for a woman who has an abortion in Ireland. Political indecision and inertia would continue to leave it as the <i>status quo</i>. Any reasonable person contrasting that law with the proposal the Government has brought forward will recognise that we are proposing a considerable advance in statute law for women and their doctors.</P>
    <P>The proposal envisages a referendum being arranged in order that the people can directly give their assent or otherwise. I have stated in the House before and it remains my view that it would be unwise to proceed finally to a referendum unless sufficiently broad, middle ground support for the proposition is apparent. This proposition has the potential to earn such support if we proceed with a reasonable debate and the issues are well understood by the public.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have called for a mature, calm and reasonable debate on the issue. I am glad to say the debate in the House this year has been much more along these lines than in previous years, especially 1983 and 1992. Unfortunately, there have been exceptions, on both sides. The issue has been deliberately politicised by some. Do they believe they advance the cause of women by this attitude? Does any Deputy believe this behaviour advances the legal position for the doctor-woman medical relationship? Some seem determined to make the issue divisive, despite the public distaste there is for divisiveness and rancour on this issue. I reject this approach which says it is impossible to debate these issues calmly and maturely between people who hold differing views.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that there are many honestly held, differing views about the issues at stake in this debate. There is a wide range of views within my party. I would not have it otherwise. I would not seek to impose uniformity in any area of conscience and it has never been a tradition of the Progressive Democrats to do so. I do not claim that this proposal would be the first choice of all members of my party. This is a difficult issue for many who place a great value on individual freedoms and rights. Deputies from other parties will recognise that there is a diversity of views within their parties. To pretend otherwise would be to fly in the face of the facts of which Members and the public are well aware.</P>
    <P>This proposal represents an advance for women and their medical needs in pregnancy. <Col N="552" /> After four years of consultations, from the Green Paper to the Oireachtas committee, including 110,000 submissions and the valued evidence of the medical profession, we have arrived at a considered and finely balanced compromise. In all the circumstances, political and practical, it was the judgment of the Progressive Democrats in government that this was worth proceeding with in the Oireachtas and in public debate with a view towards a referendum if sufficiently broad middle ground support was generated for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine years ago the current Tánaiste told the House her views and those of her party on abortion. Abortion she said, was:</P>
      <P>the lesser of two evils where a woman's life is at risk, where her health is seriously at risk, or if somebody has been raped or the subject of a sexual crime such as incest. It is also the lesser of two evils where somebody may take their own life. In these limited circumstances &ndash; and they are limited &ndash; the option of terminating a pregnancy should be available to Irish women in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Tánaiste's views as set out nine years ago. They are humane and focus on the person. They are not extreme and represent a liberal mainstream perspective on this difficult issue. I do not know how we have reached a position in which the Tánaiste is prepared to support a referendum to repeal the Supreme Court decision in the X case. I asked the Tánaiste this question on the Order of Business recently and she was unable to answer it. Sadly, her contribution has failed to yield an answer. If the Tánaiste had been genuinely converted to the position being proposed by the Government I would understand. However, I suspect that is not the case.</P>
      <P>What I do know is what the Tánaiste would say if I were in her position proposing this amendment. She would talk of tragedy and betrayals. She would accuse me of being anti-woman. She would accuse me of abandoning any liberal principles I ever held. She would occupy the moral high ground like the Progressive Democrats of old. If our positions were reversed, she would be right. She is guilty, sadly, of all these things.</P>
      <P>It is for the Tánaiste to justify her own position on these matters, but I will say one thing to her. She should not seek to justify what she has done or recover lost ground by playing politics with the timing of this referendum. That genie is unfortunately out of the bottle. Nor should she attempt the hypocrisy of seeking to oppose the referendum that she has deemed appropriate to put before the people. She cannot have it both ways. Nor should she suggest or intimate that consensus should be sought on the issue. She more than anybody else knows that there will be no consensus on a referendum to repeal the X case decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has at least come before the House to make her current position known. I hope that the Taoiseach will also contribute to this debate. He certainly should do so. However, <Col N="553" /> he lacks the Tánaiste's courage and it is clear he will not come before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>The referendum will take place because the Taoiseach wishes it. I suspect it is a political calculation on his part. He was never greatly associated with this issue prior to seeking the highest office in the land. Unlike the Tánaiste, he has no track record of speaking out on this issue because, I suspect, it is too controversial and divisive.</P>
    <P>People being present in the House during debates has been the subject of some comment in the media in recent weeks. I have been the subject of some criticism myself. However, what applies to those of us in Opposition should also apply to the Taoiseach &ndash; the man who instigated this referendum. The Taoiseach's obligation extends further than taking part in this debate. If there is any sincerity in what the Taoiseach is seeking to do here I expect him to campaign hard on the issues involved. If he really believes that &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; is the threat he claims it to be he should make his view clear to the people at every opportunity. Let them tell him how wrong he is.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Taoiseach has no great track record of campaigning as such. Like his party he sat out most of the serious constitutional changes of our generation. His sitting out referendum campaigns extends beyond those campaigns that have defined the liberal and social agenda. The Taoiseach is the only political leader who refuses to campaign effectively on issues not just those chosen by others, but those initiated by himself. He certainly did not campaign with any rigour in favour of the Nice treaty referendum, despite informing us that he had secured a great victory over the French Government during the negotiations. In fact, he is quicker to give interviews after soccer internationals in which the national team has been successful than he is after the defeat of referendum proposals supposedly sponsored by his own Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps matters will be different on this occasion. As the Taoiseach tours the country advocating his referendum, as he must, I hope he will explain to people why he feels it necessary to bully and marginalise the tiny minority of young women such as Miss X and Miss C whose pregnancies led to such personal crises that suicide was a real and persistent threat. However, it could it be that the Taoiseach is so cynical he is satisfied that in merely proposing this referendum he has discharged his political obligations and is in a position to collect his political rewards. For the sake of politics, I hope not.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it the X case and the C case are the net issues in this referendum. They are the only reason the Constitution needs to be amended. Everything else being proposed by the Government, some of which I support, can be done without a referendum.</P>
    <P>Do the people wish to repeal the Supreme Court decision in the X case? Do they wish to reverse a decision they made clearly in the 1992 <Col N="554" /> referendum? Do they accept the diminution in the equal right to life of the woman? Do they accept that we should distinguish in our laws and in our Constitution between the physical and psychological threat to the life of a woman? I do not believe so. The majority of the people will never again see this as a simple yes or no issue. I do not believe they will forget how they felt in 1992.</P>
    <P>Parents, in particular, recall how they felt when they pictured their own daughters in the same position as Miss X and Miss C. They hoped and prayed that they would never find themselves in the same position. They understood implicitly the crises of others. They were parents from all over the country, from rural and urban areas, young and old, of all faiths, church going and non-church going. This is not a so-called &ldquo;Dublin 4&rdquo; issue, it touches every corner of this land and every community. Let us acknowledge that this is an issue that affects women and their rights in particular.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe women will not accept any proposals that accord them less rights than they are currently afforded by the Supreme Court decision in the X case. Women will not accept a constitutional amendment that says they cannot be trusted. They will no longer accept the status of second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste publicly requested a measured debate on the issues involved in this referendum. It is a call I support. However, let there be no confusion &ndash; a measured debate and a search for consensus are not the same thing. One is possible, the other is not. Unfortunately, the message was certainly not heeded by the Taoiseach's own backbenchers. Some have made measured contributions which, while I disagree with, I respect. Others sadly have not. It is not solely Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are responsible. In response to legal criticisms of the Government's proposals from my party, partisan briefing material emanated from the Taoiseach's office. While we are informed that the Taoiseach sought to withdraw the document, it had clearly entered circulation before he was able to do so. Worse was to follow. During the course of this debate, one Fianna Fáil member in particular made scurrilous charges against members of the Fine Gael Party before proceeding to insult Irish women in general. Where the Taoiseach sought to give a lead, some members of his own party have decided not to follow.</P>
    <P>My party's objections to the legal device being used to put this referendum before the people are already clear and in the public domain. We believe we are correct. We believe also that we are correct on the issue of European protocols. We further believe that should this referendum be passed, the new article will clearly impact upon the interpretation of Article 40.3.3. Legally flawed though it is, however, my objection to this referendum is not about legalities. I simply do not believe that the decision in the X case should be reversed. For that reason we will campaign <Col N="555" /> against this referendum, whenever it is put to the people.</P>
    <P>Abortion is a serious issue. It will cause many people to look deep into their hearts and consciences. Those who trouble themselves sufficiently to consider the issue and vote are people who think deeply and have strong, but different views, on the society in which they live. It is possible that people of divergent views will vote against the Government's proposals. They will represent a sizeable majority at the end of the day. However, these people &ndash; and I speak as one of them &ndash; are not &ldquo;zealots&rdquo; as one newspaper unfortunately described them.</P>

      <P>That charge, made in an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> is particularly ironic, given the position adopted by that newspaper in the referendum on precisely the same issue in 1992. I ask that the charge be withdrawn because it is not worthy of those who made it and it is not deserved by those on both sides against whom it was levelled.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not present when we argued about the next stage of this legislation. It will follow a restricted Committee Stage, subject to a guillotine. The Minister might explain why he broke a promise he made earlier in a document that he circulated to Members. It stated that there would be a full debate in this Chamber to enable all Members to articulate their concerns. It was the subject of intense discussion earlier today and it requires a clear justification as to why the Minister broke his word.</P>
      <P>It may well be that this is collective responsibility and that the Cabinet decided that there would be a particularly restrictive manner for taking Committee Stage. Much of the detail in this legislation will not be subject to the kind of scrutiny that is required because many Deputies will not be able to contribute. More importantly, this will be the first constitutional legislation where Committee Stage was not taken on the floor of the House. The record should show why the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Dauphin of the Fianna Fáil party, sought to change precedent in relation to this matter. What had the Minister to hide? What was the Minister afraid of?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>What was he afraid of that he was not prepared to take the debate on the floor of this House? There is no sense of urgency about the legislative programme of this administration. The Minister waltzes in and out of the House to discuss legislation. The House does not sit late and will not come back in January even though the timetable for the House has now been altered <Col N="556" /> and the budget takes place in December. The reason for the delay in not coming back until the end of January was, in the past, to enable the budget preparations to be concluded over the Christmas period. There is no such constraint on us now. If the Taoiseach wanted to give this House the time that he says he wants to give, and not guillotine legislation by shoving it off into a restricted Committee Stage, we could come back on 10 January.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on the Minister to answer on this issue to this House, to the wider public who will read this debate and to the thousands of women whose rights he is restricting and whose access to safety is being stripped away if they are suicidal. The Minister is not forced to do this. If he disagrees, he can choose another course. Does the Minister for Health and Children believe that there is a difference in health terms between physical and psychological health? Surely after two years in office the Minister should realise that the threat to life from a psychiatric illness or psychological condition is as real as a physical one.</P>
      <P>These are questions that women will want the Minister to answer. They will want to ask him and every Fianna Fáil candidate why their sisters and mothers have a reduced right to life as a result of this proposition. There is an alternative course of action, to abandon the referendum and bring in legislation to give effect to the judgment in the X case. That is the position of the Labour Party. We should not need another divisive referendum because we have already spoken on this issue.</P>
      <P>I agree in part with what the Tánaiste has said. However, a referendum of this kind could only be on the basis that on this issue the politicians of all parties cannot be trusted. Any legislative change that we may wish to make that would be enacted in part with this constitutional amendment will have to be subject to the approval of the people by way of plebiscite. The Minister must explain that.</P>
      <P>This is a sad day for Ireland. This is the fifth attempt to deal with this issue. As Deputy O'Kennedy said, the original proposal was wrong-headed in the first instance. The only party still in this House today which opposed it at that time was the Labour Party. It is to Deputy Dick Spring's credit that, in his first weekend as leader of the Labour Party, he opposed that particular proposal. It was that wrong-headed constitutional amendment that has brought us to this position. I appeal to the Minister not to go down in history as the Minister for Health and Children who minimised the safety of the lives of women in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed. I acknowledge that the subject matter is sensitive for many people. The tone of the debate has been marked by a great understanding of the difficulties faced by women with a crisis pregnancy and sympathy for them. However, there is a degree of arrogance <Col N="557" /> in suggesting that we should not go back to the people on this subject. Clearly, as we said when we launched this proposal, there are many views on the issue.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring to bring forward a balanced set of proposals that will command the majority of the middle ground of reasonable opinion. No successive Government has come forward with a set of proposals that are perfect, ideal or meet everyone's particular concerns. However, at the sub-committee there was a strong view that we should go back to the people. Others, including the Labour Party, have a different view. They are entitled to that view but let us not be arrogant by saying that the view that the legislators should not go back to the people is the only one. There are many legislators who believe that, to an extent, this represents unfinished business because of earlier situations in the 1980s and early 1990s when we went to the people. The present legal position is not acceptable. It is not ideal for medical practitioners, women or unborn children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are differences of opinion as to whether we should go back to the people on this issue. A wide range of issues have been raised in the course of the debate. Many of these are grounded in genuine concern about the possible impact of the Government's proposals on the health of women and their unborn children. In other cases, Members have questioned the Government's approach without clearly indicating what approach they would adopt or where they stand on the key issues.</P>
      <P>This Bill, and the mechanisms for which it provides, represent the first legislative response to the legal issues which remain unresolved since the X case in 1992. It will protect best medical practice, while providing for a legislative prohibition on abortion and underpinning such legislation with an amendment to the Constitution. The Government is satisfied, on the basis of all of the expert medical evidence which has been presented and discussed, that there are rare life-threatening conditions or illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which in order to save the woman's life, it may be necessary for doctors to consider taking action in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended. In this legislation, under the proposed Act, a threat of suicide will not constitute a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. There was much debate on this in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will comment briefly on some of the main issues raised on this Stage of the debate. Several Deputies have expressed concern about the ruling out of a threat of suicide as grounds for an abortion. They have suggested that a possible risk to the life of a pregnant woman is measurable and capable of assessment in the same way as a life-threatening physical condition. It has also been <Col N="558" /> suggested that the Government's proposals call into question the professional expertise and judgment of psychiatrists. The evidence heard by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution shows that psychiatrists have highlighted the great difficulty of assessing whether a threat of suicide will actually be carried out. The Government, having considered the testimony and other research in this area, considers that it would not be appropriate to provide for a regime where abortion would be permissible on grounds of threatened suicide.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have asked why the envisaged legislation will protect unborn life only from the time of implantation in the womb rather than from fertilisation. There has been considerable debate outside the House on that issue. In the first place, this legislation is concerned with the protection of human life in the womb and ensuring an effective prohibition on abortion. At the same time the Government wants to ensure that there is no doubt about the legality of a medical procedure necessary to save a woman's life. This is the first legislative proposal to provide specifically for that. Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution will remain in place.</P>
    <P>I recognise that, as a matter of personal conscience, there are people who believe that human life begins as soon as the ovum is fertilised. However, there are difficulties with providing in law for the protection of the unborn from this point. For example, for practical purposes it is not possible to tell at the time of fertilisation that this has occurred and medical research suggests that many fertilised ova do not implant in the womb at all. Medically it is only possible some days after implantation to diagnose that a woman is pregnant. The Bill in essence defines the offence of abortion, and not the issue of the beginning of human life. Therefore, the proposed legislation takes the time of implantation as the point beyond which unborn human life can be protected under the law, as it is from that point that pregnancy can be established as having begun.</P>
    <P>As regards issues such as <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation and embryo research, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction which has been asked to consider and prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining policy in this area. The commission is chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly and has been meeting for the past nine to 12 months. The Government will consider these issues when the commission makes its report.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised concerns about the mechanism for making ministerial orders provided for in section 5 of the Bill. The first point to be made about these orders is that they involve putting in place new arrangements, but with the objective of protecting existing best medical practice. At the moment, a procedure of the type covered by section 1(2) can take place in any location and can be performed by any medical <Col N="559" /> practitioner. The threat to the woman's life may include a threat of self destruction and there are no specific legal requirements regarding what constitutes a reasonable opinion on the part of the doctor concerned. I am not aware that those who expressed concerns about the possible abuse or distortion of the mechanism provided for in the Bill have said that existing arrangements are inadequate and that safeguards are necessary. Nonetheless, in light of the views expressed during this debate, I will consider whether there is scope for improving the parliamentary scrutiny mechanism regarding the making of ministerial orders.</P>
    <P>Concerns that, by introducing safeguards, the way may be opened to a so-called liberal abortion regime, are unfounded. It must be remembered that the key test in any case is whether the medical procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner involved, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of the loss of the woman's life, other than by self-destruction. Furthermore, the medical practitioner must have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable. The constitutional underpinning of the legislation and the requirement that any proposed amendment of it must be put to the people in a further referendum mean that there must be a degree of flexibility to amend the arrangements for the approval of certain places for the purposes of the Act, for example, if at some time in the future, new hospitals are opened or existing hospitals are amalgamated. For practical, routine reasons the ministerial orders make clear and common sense and the provision for parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial orders will provide an additional safeguard.</P>
    <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency which I recently established represents the first serious attempt by any Government to provide comprehensively for women faced with crisis pregnancies in terms of resources and realistic options, advice and guidance.</P>

      <P>A sum of £5 million has been allocated and is included in the Estimates. My understanding is that the orders were laid before the House, but Deputy Mitchell has asked for some opportunity to debate them. I have no difficulty with that request.</P>
      <P>Many people have commented on the nature of this debate. We have been endeavouring to reach a consensus on this issue. The Oireachtas committee put forward three options. The Labour Party has been consistent since then in its opposition to rolling back the judgment in the X case. The committee offered other significant positions that we do nothing and that we move in this direction.</P>
      <P>We will not achieve 100% agreement on this issue. The Labour Party has taken a clear position, as have the Government parties. Fine Gael is not happy with the mechanism which is wishes to contest before getting into the content of the proposal and how to assess it. From the legal work which has been put into this issue, and in my capacity as chairman of the interdepartmental committee, I am satisfied this is well crafted legislation into which much thought has gone and that it stands up to any scrutiny in terms of its legality or constitutionality. Many independent commentators have articulated this view in the media.</P>
      <P>There has been an unprecedented level of debate on this issue in the House. No other legislation has been debated at such length so it is somewhat unfair to suggest that a guillotine has been placed on the Bill. Likewise, the Bill will be debated by the sub-committee on health and children and will have to come back to the House on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the motion. We got a commitment from the Taoiseach that all Stages of the Bill would be taken in plenary session. We know also that the precedent for discussing Bills which involve amendments to the Constitution is that they are taken in plenary session in the House. We also object to the fact that we did not have full information today when the Order of Business was announced by the Taoiseach. A Supplementary Order Paper was subsequently circulated and the information on it was an expansion of the information available when the Taoiseach announced the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the provisions for debate in committee. We not only object to this Bill being referred to the committee but also to the provisions in committee. The Dáil is being asked to agree that Committee Stage will begin on Thursday of this week and that it must conclude at 6 p.m. on Thursday week, 29 November. Late last week on the Order of Business the Taoiseach told me the principal reason he wanted this Bill taken in committee rather than in plenary session in the House was that it might take up to eight days of continual committee work. Deputies' diaries are already full, yet a committee of this House is being asked to confine its debate of this issue to seven calendar days.</P>
      <P>I understand the proposal from the Minister for Health and Children is that the committee will meet on Thursday and Friday of this week and then conclude the following Thursday. The Taoiseach said earlier today on the Order of Business that there is nothing to preclude the committee from meeting for the full seven days until midnight any night. With respect to the House and to the Taoiseach, that is an unreal proposition. The Taoiseach knows the Houses cannot be accessed on Saturday and Sunday, which are two days of the seven days. People, including those serving on this committee, have other arrangements made. The Taoiseach should also be aware that many Members of this House want to exercise the right to attend and speak at the committee, although they are not members of it. They also have arrangements made for Thursday and Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> This is a deliberate proposal by the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to obviate the democratic process in the House to carry out one of its principal functions, to put forward a proposal to amend the Constitution. Any amendment to the Constitution is serious. An amendment to the Constitution on this issue is particularly serious because it is an amendment to Article 40 of the Constitution which is one of the principal Articles that deals with personal rights under the Constitution, particularly the right to life. We often get involved in hyperbole and say that certain issues are a matter of life and death. However, the blunt fact of this proposal is that it is a matter of life and death.</P>
    <P>It is an attempt to re-balance the right to life of a mother and child. That is the nub of this proposal. It is a re-balancing of those rights. We are actually talking about matters of life and death and yet the Taoiseach, once more, breaks a solemn commitment to the House by not taking this Bill in plenary session. It is being put into a committee where Members will be prevented from debating it properly, where only members of the select committee may vote on it and not all groups are represented on the select committee. Contrary to precedent when a constitutional matter was being debated when every effort was made to involve everybody in the House and ensure that the elected representatives of the people had the full right to openly debate an amendment before it was put to the people, on this occasion precedent is being broken once more. This is a disgraceful proposition. We have had guillotine motions before but I have never seen anything like this.</P>
    <P>I will make one final point on procedure. When the Taoiseach was challenged on the Order of Business today, he quoted the precedents of the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. I have carried the Finance Bill on Committee Stage in Opposition for several years with the Taoiseach involved with Ray MacSharry and Deputy Albert Reynolds. I would challenge anybody in this House who sat on that committee to say that it is satisfactory. What happens always is that there is a time motion for the debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and votes are rolled up at the end of every section and the bulk of amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies are not debated at all and if they are debated they are certainly not voted on separately.</P>
    <P>There is always a vote at the end and it is governed by the procedures where the chairman reads out a motion stating that only amendments in the name of the Minister may be put and it will be decided at the end of the section, when the time motion clicks in, by one vote. That is not a precedent which is relevant to an amendment to the Constitution. That is a precedent which is done under time constraints with the very tight calendar of a Finance Bill. In circumstances where the House in one place or other, and the <Col N="566" /> public in one way or other, have been speaking about this issue for the past four and a half years, what is the dirty hurry that involves Committee Stage being drummed through by next Thursday evening? What is this about?</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, in the interests of democracy, because he has always been open to the argument of Opposition when it comes to debate and procedure in the House and has always been generous in the procedures he has put before the House when rational arguments are made to him, to accept the proposal by Deputy Quinn today. Let us come back here in early January. It will not affect procedures or the process of other legislation. Let us come back on 10 January and let us debate this issue for two weeks in plenary session and give an opportunity to everybody. Let us not divide the House unnecessarily on this motion by driving this Bill into a committee where justice will not be done to this amendment and certainly justice will not be done to democracy in this House or outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I ask the Taoiseach to state now that he will ensure that Committee Stage of the Bill will be heard in this Chamber where all Members can participate and have their voices heard. Too many voices have been muffled, unheard and silenced. On the issue of abortion we cannot have the same muzzling of views occurring in the approach being adopted by the Government. I ask the Taoiseach to restore the honour of the Government and ensure the honour of the House by living up to a promise made by the Government that the Committee Stage debate would be held in this Chamber so that all Members could participate. The only way he can restore the honour of the Government, having betrayed the trust of Members and broken a promise to Members, is to ensure that Committee Stage is taken in the Chamber with all Members given the right to participate in our national Parliament.</P>
      <P>What concerns us greatly is that when the Bill was published setting out the proposal for a referendum the Taoiseach said he wanted to find a consensus. Yet when it is clear the Government is running scared, far from finding a consensus it has to confront genuine criticisms and genuine concerns from different quarters all of whom I respect. He is in a position where he is leading a Government that is running scared. That is why there is a guillotine this evening on Second Stage. That is why the Bill is being fast-tracked and coming to Committee Stage this Thursday. The attempt is being made by the Taoiseach to have it put through Committee Stage, against a promise made by the Minister for Health and Children, and completed by the following Thursday. He is trying to bury it in the bowels of this building and trying to ensure the debate is minimised rather than maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> The Second Supplementary Order Paper clearly indicated the Government was trying to ensure Opposition amendments could not be put on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach has back-tracked on that at least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the floor. I will not be silenced by anybody on this issue. I am expressing views on what is being put forward by the Government and I accept the protection you provide so that I can finish my statement. The Labour Party wants to ensure full debate. This is all we are seeking. We recognise this is a constitutional referendum. This is not a small matter of a small Bill that can be processed without any great problem through the House. We would have no difficulty with that. We are not doing this for some obscure reason, we are doing it for the universal reason that the Constitution belongs to everybody. When there is a proposal to change the Constitution, the least we can do is ensure a full debate and ensure the different views on this referendum proposal are recorded so that when the citizens of the State come to make their decision they can see clearly what the views were and that they were recorded in a way that they can have. It may be, given the delays in this House in terms of committees, that we may not have the record of the committee proceedings in time for a referendum.

      <P>I will. The debate we are seeking to have in this Chamber as opposed to a committee made up of a small number of representatives of this House is about life and death. It is not a small matter. It is a matter of life and death that affects young women. There are few women in this Chamber. We are a handful here. We should not be a handful because we make up more than half the population but that is the way things are. I have a bounden duty to ensure the voice of women can be heard and listened to when it comes to a debate of this importance.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Taoiseach's attention to the point made by Deputy Howlin that there are minorities in this Chamber who will not have their views heard if a decision is made to hive the Bill off to a committee. There are Independent Deputies here and small parties. <Col N="568" /> They have articulated the view many times that they do not get a fair share. They will not get any share at all in respect of the debate on Committee Stage if the Government persists on the route of trying to bury discussion and debate on this important matter.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Health and Children was asked a few minutes ago the reason he was breaking his word and not living up to his promise to ensure the debate would be held in the Chamber I suspect he had forgotten he made that promise. I also suspect he had forgotten the Attorney General's written statement that this was what was envisaged. It is important we remind him those were the words of the Attorney General. It was envisaged that Committee Stage would be held in the Chamber and that all Members would be entitled to be involved in that debate, but we are not getting that.</P>
      <P>One of my privileges is that I am a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution. I am not a lawyer. Before I was elected to the House I did not know anything about the law or the Constitution, apart from a superficial knowledge as an outsider to the procedures of the House on which we are commenting. I have, however, learned a great deal about the importance of not unduly interfering with the Constitution and damaging it. Strong legal and constitutional arguments need to be made about what the Government is proposing, quite apart from the rights and wrongs in relation to women. The rights and wrongs in relation to the Constitution must be the subject of Committee Stage, which must be taken in the Chamber to ensure we do no harm, not only to women, but the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am fearful that when it comes to the end of this process we will not have restored the honour of the House because the Taoiseach, in particular, is not willing to maintain the honour of his Government, live up to his promise and commitment and can be seen only as a leader of a Government which is running scared. What else are we to think? A promise was made to us, as parliamentary representatives&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. The Green Party will oppose this motion. I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. When I put the question, &ldquo;where would Committee Stage be taken?&rdquo; to the chairman of that committee, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, he told me clearly that it would be taken on the floor of the House because it was a constitutional amendment. Those were his words which echo those of the Attorney General and the Minister. It is unprecedented that a constitutional amendment would not be debated in the House. I have only been a Member for four and a half years, but those who have been Members longer can tell me this is the case. What we heard this afternoon was typical obfuscation by the Taoiseach who went around the houses. I remember the famous words put to another Deputy in the House about being a waffler, but the real waffler this afternoon was the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is trying to stifle debate and undermine democracy. He is trying to facilitate the Progressive Democrats who are trying to hide on this issue. How can the Tánaiste agree to this undemocratic measure? How can she, as a democrat, a Progressive Democrat, agree to it? Tánaiste, you said&mdash;</P>

      <P>By a remarkable coincidence, tomorrow at 1 p.m. the all-party committee on the Constitution will launch a report. That report will be on the referendum, the issue under discussion. It is agreed by all parties in the House and was prepared under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Lenihan. That agreed report includes the following four sentences:</P>
      <P>The process is important in the case of the Bill to amend the Constitution, the fundamental law of the State. Consequently, measures should be taken to ensure that a Bill to amend the Constitution is fully debated by the Dáil. Given the importance of a constitutional amendment, every Deputy and every Senator should have the opportunity to express his or her views. The Bill, therefore, should be debated in principle and in detail by each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> That is the view of the all-party committee, representing all Members of the House. I ask the Taoiseach the reason is he now rejecting this approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has made the case on this matter and I want to make a few more points. The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 is the title given to the Bill, but as the explanatory memorandum states, if passed by the people, it will come back to the House as the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2002. In other words, it is not intended that this Bill be dealt with until next year. That is a very relevant point.</P>
      <P>The earliest that a constitutional amendment referendum can be held is the spring of next year &ndash; I understand the Taoiseach had pencilled in February or March for that referendum. I do not understand why this matter is being rushed. I said on Second Stage &ndash; I hope my comments will be seen as measured, reasonable, fair and balanced &ndash; that I did not understand why a press conference was hurriedly called and why the Bill was announced with such speed. I do not understand why it is being rushed through this House. I do not understand in particular why we are not taking Committee Stage on the floor of this House. I gave an understanding to all my Fine Gael colleagues that that would be the case.</P>
      <P>I want to make one other practical point. I am trying to draft amendments between the votes in this House and the public engagement I have in another county later this evening so they will be ready before 11 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Fine Gael Front Bench nor my parliamentary party colleagues have seen them. That means that I will have to draft amendments, some of which I might not agree with in total, to take account of the views expressed to me. This is not creating consensus across the floor of the House on some of the contents of the Bill, nor is it giving to Deputies on this side, who have been sympathetic to a reasoned debate, the opportunity to participate in that reasoned debate.</P>
      <P>I forecast that this is the start of the defeat of this Bill when it goes to the people. The people will see this as a sleight of hand. The whole procedure being used here is wrong. It is not right to take the Bill off the floor of the House in this way when an undertaking has been given. It is not right that the Fine Gael Front Bench, the major Opposition party, and the parliamentary party have not seen the amendments to this constitutional Bill, which I am supposed to put down by 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> I have to ask two questions. Is the Taoiseach fearful that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and others will not go up to the lobbies and vote if the Bill is on the floor of the House? Is that the reason for this? There are no Progressive Democrats Deputies in the select committee to which the Bill is being referred? I can only presume it is some reason of that kind. Is there some date in early December by which the Bill has to be passed so that some other body outside this House can pronounce on it once it has passed through the Oireachtas? Why is the Bill being rushed through the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter. I said during Second Stage that we would give this Bill consideration and quiet disquisition. I challenge anybody in this House to say that anything I said on this issue in any debate inside or outside this House was not reasoned and fair, but how can we continue to treat this as reasonable and fair if it is being drummed through the House in this way. This is an unwise day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points. The proposal before the House now is not merely a subversion of democracy but is undermining the solemn constitutional role of this Dáil in considering in detail specific proposals to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House since 1981. I was here for the debates on the 1983 referendum and the debates on the 1992 referendum, and I recall participating in the Committee Stage debates on all the proposals related to this issue. It is the first occasion when a debate on this issue, in the context of a proposal for a constitutional amendment, is sought to be confined by Government to members of a select committee. It is the first time on this issue that has happened.</P>
      <P>There are Members of this House who wish to exercise their constitutional obligations to participate in this debate. There are Members of this House who regard it as their public duty to tease out in detailed form the specific implications of the proposal the Government has brought before the House. Those who will vote outside this House on this proposal, should a referendum take place, are entitled to know of the detail of the debates that take place. Each Deputy in this House is entitled to participate if they wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The room in which the Select Committee on Health and Children will operate will not remotely have the capacity to accommodate the Members of this House from the major parties, the smaller parties and Independents who may wish to participate. I also believe there are Members on the Government side, who are not Ministers or members of the health and children <Col N="573" /> committee, who may wish to participate in that debate and who will have something to offer, in the public interest, in their participation in the debate. In practical terms, this proposal is closing the door on that possibility. The very physical design of the committee rooms will exclude the possibility of any substantial number of Members of this House, who are not members of the health and children committee, participating in the debate should they wish to do so. More importantly, they are excluded from voting on Committee Stage on the basis of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by making two points. First, I listened with interest to the various interviews and read the various articles written by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about the importance of Members of this House acting as legislators and fulfilling their duties as legislators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has sought to make his political reputation on having some commitment to the reform of the workings of this House and to allowing Deputies, as legislators, to play a meaningful role. Did the Minister for the Environment and Local Government go along with this proposal? Is this an example of how the Government believes we should reform the workings of this House to allow its Members on all sides participate as legislators? I do not believe the Government will have credibility in the future when it talks about Dáil reform and the needs in that area.</P>
      <P>Second, if the Progressive Democrats, as a party, was on this side of the House and this proposal came from the Government, the level of moral indignation we would all be subjected to would be so thunderous that it would leave those in the Chamber with serious headaches from which they would have to try to recover. The Progressive Democrats has turned the name of its party on its head, to the regressive democrats. This is a regressive proposal in addressing a serious constitutional issue in respect of which the Progressive Democrats has done a substantial U-turn.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, this is not about ensuring proper debate on the issue. This proposal procedurally is to provide the Progressive Democrats with a hideaway to avoid the embarrassment of confronting amendments that may be proposed to this legislation which would make it very clear that it is now adopting an approach which is the exact opposite to the approach adopted by it in this House in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government has the courage of its convictions that this proposal is all it says it is, it should debate it in the full Chamber of this House, in the glare of publicity, and allow the <Col N="574" /> debate to take place that should take place in a parliamentary democracy with a written Constitution in circumstances where it is proposed to make a fundamental amendment not only to that Constitution but to the manner in which this Parliament does its business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children that the intensity and the quality of the contributions made in all sincerity by this side of the House should not be discounted. Deputy McManus spoke very eloquently on behalf of my party, but everybody else who has spoken on this side of the House was equally eloquent. The Taoiseach cannot see the expressions on the faces of his backbenchers, but I assure him they agree with the sentiments being expressed.</P>
      <P>I want to formally put a proposal to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste as I believe this is a partnership Government. Earlier today I suggested that the Dáil should resume on 10 January. That happens to be a Thursday, which means we could come back on 8 January, or on a date to be agreed by the Whips. The Taoiseach's legislative programme will not be put at risk. We have the time in January to do the things that must be done, listening to what has been said. As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the All-party Committee on the Constitution, the basic document of this Republic, states clearly how we should make changes to this legislation and that it should be done here.</P>
      <P>I realise there are legislative commitments and priorities between now and Christmas that make the idea of having the Bill on the floor of this House for seven or eight days a proposition that would disrupt other issues, but a commitment was given by the Minister for Health and Children in the document he circulated and by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that the debate would be held here. If it cannot be held before Christmas, we will have time after Christmas without disrupting the Government's legislative programme. Will the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach indicate whether they are prepared, at this late stage, to accept this proposal which, I believe, has the support of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;having regard to allegations of misconduct claimed to have been committed by members of the Garda Síochána in County Donegal, the subject of parliamentary questions and a reply thereto by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 13 November 2001;</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging widespread public concern about the matter and being strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any allegations of wrongdoing by its members are investigated thoroughly and that, if such allegations are found to be well-founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings are initiated;</P>
      <P>&ndash;wanting to see the truth of this matter determined and public confidence in the Garda Síochána, in so far as it has been adversely affected, restored;</P>
      <P>&ndash;being of opinion that, in this case, the public interest in a full, public and impartial ventilation and determination of the facts, and a consideration of the issues of public policy arising therefrom, outweighs in importance the customary need to ensure pending or anticipated criminal proceedings are not put at unnecessary risk of frustration;</P>
      <P>hereby resolves as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 (&ldquo;the Acts&rdquo;), to inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
      <P>a)the Garda investigation into the death of Mr. Richie Barron at Raphoe, County Donegal, in October 1996, including the arrest of several members of the McBrearty family and the alleged securing of a confession to murder from Mr. Frank McBrearty junior;</P>
      <P>b)the allegations of serious and concerted harassment and other improprieties made against members of the Garda Síochána by members of the McBrearty family, including the numerous prosecutions of family members, friends and employees;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>c)the Garda request made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 10 October 1997 for an order to <Col N="581" /> exhume the body of the late Richard Barron; the circumstances surrounding the subsequent request made on 16 October 1997 by a member of An Garda Síochána for an exhumation order to be put on hold until further notice and why the Minister did not then make such an order until 3 July 2001, and any inquiries made by or on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the reasons for what occurred in October 1997 and the Minister's failure to inform the Dáil of what occurred in October 1997 until 13 November 2001;</P>
    <P>d)allegations that certain gardaí in County Donegal were involved in &ldquo;hoax&rdquo; finds of bombmaking equipment;</P>
    <P>e)the subsequent investigations into the original Garda investigation arising from the death of Mr. Barron and into related matters including, in particular, the investigation carried out by Mr. Kevin Carty, Assistant Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and the consequent reports furnished to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Director of Public Prosecutions;</P>
    <P>f)the reasons why and the circumstances in which members of the Diver family were arrested and detained under section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the connection between those events and the arson of the telecommunications installation adjacent to their home;</P>
    <P>g)the role of the State, the organs thereof and relevant public bodies and officials in relation to the matters referred to above, and</P>
    <P>h)such other matters as the tribunal reasonably considers it necessary to inquire into and report upon in order fully to understand the circumstances, considerations and motives relating to the matters aforesaid;</P>
    <P>(2) that the tribunal should be requested in particular, in the light of its findings and conclusions, to make whatever broad recommendations it considers appropriate for securing and maintaining the independence and integrity of the Garda Síochána in the disinterested performance of its functions, while at the same time ensuring the accountability of its members within an administrative system of oversight that is impartial and effective and secures the public trust;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> (3) that the tribunal should be requested, to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Acts, to conduct its inquiries in the following manner:</P>
    <P>a)to carry out such preliminary investigations as it thinks fit using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts (including, where appropriate, the power to conduct its proceedings in private), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to those matters;</P>
    <P>b)to inquire fully into all matters referred to above in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist, and to report to the Clerk of the Dáil thereupon;</P>
    <P>c)to direct the production into its custody of all relevant or potentially relevant evidence, including documentary evidence in the possession of public bodies, in order to ensure its preservation for the purposes of its inquiries;</P>
    <P>d)in relation to any matters where the tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the tribunal thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed, and</P>
    <P>e)to report on an interim basis, not later than three months from the date of establishment of the tribunal or the tenth day of any oral hearing, whichever shall first occur, to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the numbers of parties then represented before the tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearing and the work of the tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that time) of the tribunal proceedings; and</P>
    <P>any other matters which the tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> (4) that the person or persons selected to conduct the inquiry should be informed that it is the desire of the House that:</P>
    <P>a)the inquiry should be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it;</P>
    <P>b)any costs incurred by reason of the failure of persons to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the inquiry, including by reason of</P>
    <P>the giving of false or misleading information to the tribunal,</P>
    <P>the raising of an issue before the tribunal, whether by way of allegation, counter-allegation or defence to such an allegation, which is unfounded or irrelevant or is abandoned or not pursued by the party which raised the issue, or</P>
    <P>any conduct in relation to the proceedings of the tribunal or in the course of appearance or representation before it that is unreasonably obstructive, prolix, dilatory or evasive or which otherwise results in the proceedings being needlessly prolonged or in unnecessary costs being incurred,</P>
    <P>should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those persons;</P>
    <P>c)the tribunal should authorise the representation before it by solicitor or counsel of persons claiming an interest in the matters the subject of its inquiry only where and to the extent necessary to protect the legal or constitutional rights of those persons and should both authorise and confine the participation of legal representatives in its public proceedings accordingly;</P>
    <P>d)the tribunal should negotiate arrangements with a television broadcaster in the State, on terms satisfactory to the tribunal, for the live broadcasting of the entirety of its public proceedings;</P>
    <P>(5) that the Clerk of the Dáil should on receipt of any report from the tribunal arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas immediately thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> This motion is circulated on the third supplementary Order Paper in substitution for the one circulated on the earlier Order Paper today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following upon the foundation of the State the Garda Síochána was established by a Fine Gael Government. The Garda has, throughout the history of the State, played a proud and vital role in the protection of our constitutional democracy and the preservation of law and order. Too many members of the Garda Síochána have lost their lives or suffered serious injury in the defence of civil society and protecting the State and all who reside in it from terrorists, subversives, criminal gangs and individuals who have no respect for the law or the institutions of the State. If any of us feels under threat, it is the Garda to which we turn for protection. If any of us is the victim of a criminal act, it is the Garda we expect to bring the alleged offender or offenders before our courts.</P>
      <P>During the past 30 years we have been confronted by a variety of different violent, illegal and subversive organisations and the Garda Síochána, at all levels, has played an heroic role in confronting and bringing to justice those intent on spreading murder and mayhem throughout the country. It has played a role the true value of which has still not been accorded the recognition it deserves.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has also, under the auspices of the United Nations, policed a variety of international trouble spots across the world, where its presence and expertise have acted as a deterrent to inter-communal and inter-ethnic violence. The contribution made by members of the Garda Síochána on international duties has not, to date, been afforded the recognition which it richly deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation to provide for the maintenance and regulation of the Garda Síochána was enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the years immediately following the foundation of the State. While the general direction and control of the Garda, subject to regulations made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, vests in the Garda Commissioner, it is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, who is accountable to the House for the administration and business generally of public services in connection with law, justice, public order and policing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ultimately accountable to the House for the manner in which the Garda Síochána undertakes its duties and has both a constitutional and legislative obligation to ensure at all times it properly fulfils its functions in a manner <Col N="585" /> which shows respect for the constitutional rights of all citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>It is in the public interest that the Garda Síochána is held in high esteem by all of us who reside here and widely regarded as a fundamentally honest body of individuals of the highest integrity. From my contacts with many members of the Garda, at all levels, in over 20 years as a Member of Dáil Éireann and also as justice spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party I am keenly aware of the dedicated commitment of the overwhelming majority of members of an Garda Síochána to the policing of this State and their abiding by highest principles of honesty and integrity. I am also acutely aware of how let down many gardaí feel when any individual member of the force is found to have engaged in wrongdoing or behaviour in conflict with the high principles of duty and service which reflect the actions of the overwhelming majority of the members of the force. When serious allegations of misbehaviour or misconduct are made against members of the Garda Síochána it is of vital importance that such allegations are fully and properly investigated and their credibility determined within a reasonable period of time. Individual gardaí, in properly carrying out their duties, are on occasion subject to false and malicious allegations and it is of crucial importance that no individual member of the force be the subject of any unfounded allegations for any lengthy period. There are also unfortunately occasions when serious allegations of Garda misconduct are honestly made without malicious intent. It is equally in the interests of the individual members of the force against whom such allegations are levied and also in the interests of the force itself that they be fully and properly investigated and determined within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>The Garda investigation into the death of the late Richard Barron in Raphoe on 14 October 1996 has resulted in a substantial number of allegations of Garda misconduct being made against members of the Garda force in Donegal. Many questions have been asked and allegations made and it is not possible to detail all of them in the House this evening &ndash; indeed it may not be appropriate for me to do so. Some, however, must be referred to.</P>
    <P>It now seems clear that following the death of Richard Barron, the original autopsy undertaken was seriously inadequate; the scene at which his body was found was not properly preserved; a murder investigation was undertaken on the assumption that his death resulted from a criminal assault when, in fact, it was the consequence of a hit and run accident; Frank McBrearty Jnr and Mark McConnell were arrested under suspicion of murder and both complain about the interrogation to which they were subjected when in Garda custody; Mark McConnell's wife, Roisín, also alleges that, following her arrest, she <Col N="586" /> was ill-treated and, as a consequence to this day, suffers mental trauma; an admission or confession produced by members of the Garda force alleged to be that of Frank McBrearty Jnr is now widely acknowledged within the Garda force itself to be a false statement or forgery and Frank McBrearty Jnr denies ever having signed it.</P>
    <P>On 10 October 1997, following a Garda application, the coroner for the Donegal area requested the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to order the exhumation of the body of the late Richard Barron. No exhumation order was at that time made as the Garda Síochána subsequently on 16 October 1997 inexplicably informed the Minister's Department to put on hold the application for such order. Despite persistent and regular Dáil questions tabled on the issue and four years of public controversy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform never asked the Garda authorities the reason for the change of mind in 1997 and did not inform the Dáil of the October 1997 application for an exhumation order until Tuesday of last week, 13 November 2001, by which time he had become aware of the Fine Gael Party's knowledge of the matter.</P>
    <P>Following the Garda murder investigation into the death of Richard Barron, papers were forwarded by the gardaí in Donegal to the Director of Public Prosecutions who declined to prosecute anyone under investigation. Following the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finally ordering the exhumation of the body of Richard Barron on 10 July 2001 and a full pathologist's assessment being undertaken on the remains of the deceased, it has been concluded that his injuries are consistent with that of a victim of a hit and run driver.</P>
    <P>Three internal Garda investigations have failed to result in any public answer being given to the allegations made against members of the Garda force and to date no official report has been published about the Donegal events. One Garda investigation however resulted in an announcement from the Garda Commissioner in July 2000 that five members of the force were being moved out of the Donegal area &ldquo;in the interests of the public and in the interests of the force&rdquo;. No explanation has to date been publicly given as to why any such move was either in the interests of the force or in the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>To date, no one has been prosecuted for any act said to have caused the death of Richard Barron. All the matters referred to by me have generated considerable public concern and have been a cause of substantial disquiet and unease within the Garda Síochána. Many members of the force want these matters cleared up and public answers given to the allegations made of Garda misconduct directly relating to the investigation into the death of Richard Barron. Further concern and disquiet have been caused by the bring<Col N="587" /> ing before the local District Court of approximately 165 summonses against Frank McBrearty Snr. relating to the running of his licensed premises in Raphoe.</P>
    <P>It is alleged by the McBrearty family that following the death of Richard Barron and their making complaints about the manner in which individual members of their family were treated by members of the local Garda they became the subject of Garda harassment and false charges were brought against them. It is also alleged by them that a letter signed by Chief Superintendent D.N. Fitzpatrick was circulated to members of the Garda Síochána assigned to the Donegal district which it is alleged encouraged local gardaí to harass and target members of the McBrearty family. This letter date marked 27 February 1998 is entitled &ldquo;Garda Síochána: Chief Superintendent's Office &ndash; Letterkenny Division of Donegal&rdquo; and marked &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; is stated to relate to a &ldquo;Campaign to discredit Gardaí in Donegal Division&rdquo;. It reads:</P>
    <P>I refer to the attempts to discredit gardaí from this division and other members involved in the Barron Investigation.</P>
    <P>There is information to hand which suggests that Frank McBrearty (Senior) from Raphoe, is financing a campaign to discredit Members of the Force. The campaign is being operated mostly by Mr. Billy Flynn, and sometimes trading as Zimmerman &amp; Co. from Enfield, County Meath.</P>
    <P>Members of your District Force and gardaí who assisted in the Investigation into the Richard Barron death should be notified of this matter and directed to report any incidents or unusual contact that may occur either with Mr. McBrearty and his extended family or Mr. Flynn and his employees.</P>
    <P>This document is for Garda use only and is confidential.</P>
    <P>This extraordinary letter appears to be an invitation by the Chief Superintendent to members of the force in Donegal to watch and beset the McBrearty family and also Mr. Flynn.</P>
    <P>It is alleged by the McBrearty family that five members of the Garda Síochána who gave evidence before Raphoe District Court denied the existence of this letter. It is, of course, now publicly known that all charges brought against the McBrearty family in Raphoe District Court are withdrawn and that over 20 civil actions have been commenced by the McBreartys against the gardaí and against the State for the harassment allegedly suffered by them. Proceedings have also in recent days come before the High Court seeking orders that the Commissioner require that five members of the Garda force be investigated for allegedly committing perjury in court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Separate from the death of Richard Barron and issues relating directly to the McBrearty family, there are other disturbing allegations concerning Garda misbehaviour in the Donegal area. The Divers family allege that they have been wrongly treated by members of the Garda, that they have been wrongly arrested in circumstances which give rise to questions being asked and that they have suffered substantially at the hand of local gardaí. It is separately alleged that members of the Garda who were involved in uncovering the whereabouts of IRA arms and explosives identified locations where they would be discovered both on this side of the Border and in Northern Ireland and that particular discoveries were, in fact, made as a consequence of the gardaí themselves organising the planting of arms and explosives and arranging their discovery to advance their Garda careers.</P>
    <P>I am making no judgment on the truthfulness or falsity of any of the allegations made. I am saying, however, that these allegations cast a shadow over the integrity of the Garda force and it is in the vital interests of the State and the Garda Síochána that all of the allegations made be investigated by an independent tribunal and the true position made known. The continuation of the current position is untenable. It undermines the credibility of the Garda force, it casts an unfavourable cloud over members of the force who undertake their duties with great dedication and leaves unanswered serious questions which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In no parliamentary democracy should it be acceptable that allegations of the nature made relating to the McBrearty affair and the other allegations to which I have referred made against serving police officers remain unanswered for over four years. It is clear that internal Garda investigations have proved inadequate to come to terms with these events. The allegations made are a festering sore on the integrity of the gardaí and must be addressed and inquired into in an open and transparent forum.</P>
    <P>On 5 April of this year, I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expressing my concern about the length of time that had elapsed since allegations of Garda misconduct were made concerning various members of the Garda stationed in the Donegal area and his failure to make any detailed statement to the Dáil to clarify the position and the outcome of the internal investigations conducted. I wrote to the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>There are serious issues outstanding relating to Garda accountability, your political responsibility to Dáil Éireann to clarify what actually occurred in Donegal and the outcome of the investigations which must be addressed. I also believe it is unfair to the gardaí who properly undertake their duties in the Donegal <Col N="589" /> area that a cloud continues to hang over the force.</P>
    <P>I am writing to you to ask you to clarify when you believe it is likely you will be in a position to make a full statement to the House on these matters.</P>
    <P>On 25 May 2001, the Minister replied referring &ndash; as he had previously done in reply to countless parliamentary questions &ndash; to the various internal investigations and legal processes under way and the various civil actions brought against the State and the Garda Síochána arising out of the events in Donegal. He also referred to complaints lodged with the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and to the possibility of disciplinary action being brought against members of the force. He stated that he wanted &ldquo;to see the truth of the matter established as soon as possible.&rdquo; The Minister however, proposed taking no new action but asserted that he had &ldquo;at all times endeavoured to provide as much information as possible to the Dáil in relation to the matter in question&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the 23 May last, I asked the Minister during Dáil Question Time whether he was &ldquo;aware that there is a widespread perception that no serious attempt is being made to come to terms with the serious allegations which have been made but that he, his Department and those involved in this matter are engaged in covering up what occurred?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minster angrily rejected as &ldquo;ill-tempered, outrageous and unfounded&rdquo;, such allegation &ldquo;in the strongest terms possible&rdquo; and asserted that &ldquo;there is no question of anyone trying to cover up anything.&rdquo;  It has to be said that the perception of cover-up has been given further credibility by the fact that it was not until Tuesday of last week that the Minister revealed to the Dáil that application had been made to his Department in October 1997 for an exhumation order and that such application had then &ldquo;been put on hold&rdquo; and that these events to this very day were neither questioned nor investigated by him. As the person constitutionally and statutorily accountable to Dáil Éireann for the workings of the Garda, the Minister had an obligation at an early stage to inform the Dáil of what occurred in October 1997 and just as importantly, had an obligation as Minister to seek from the Garda Síochána detailed reasons for members of the force first seeking an exhumation order in the autumn of 1997 and then changing their mind. Moreover, the fact that he was requested by a member of the Garda to put the request for an exhumation order &ldquo;on hold&rdquo;, did not in any way require that he do so. The application for an exhumation order was made pursuant to section 47 of the Coroners Act, 1962, Section 47(1) states:</P>
    <P>Where a Coroner is informed by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector that, in his opinion, the death of any <Col N="590" /> person whose body has been buried in the Coroner's district, may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, the Coroner may request the Minister to order the exhumation of the body by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Coroner was so informed and made the request to the Minister as prescribed under the Act. Following such request being made to the Minister, section 47(2) states:</P>
    <P>On being requested under this section to authorise by order the exhumation of any body, the Minister may, as he thinks proper, either make or refuse to make the order.</P>
    <P>Consequently, once the request is made to the Minister, it is for the Minister and the Minister alone to determine whether to order or to refuse to order an exhumation. At that point, the function of the Garda has ceased and no provision is contained in the Act for such application having been made by a District Coroner to the Minister to be put &ldquo;on hold&rdquo; at the request of the Garda. Not only did the Minister until last week fail to inform the House of the request received by him in October 1997 for an exhumation order, he also did not inform the House that he had failed since October 1997 to properly exercise the statutory function conferred on him by the 1962 Act. He had, in effect, failed to exercise the discretion conferred on him by the Act to either order an exhumation or to refuse to make such order. It remains for the Minister to offer a proper explanation to this House for his failure.</P>
    <P>In September 2000, <i>Magill</i> magazine reported that Superintendent Kevin Lennon prepared an internal Garda report detailing 53 mistakes made by the Garda Síochána in the initial investigation into the death of Richard Barron. The question must also be asked whether the Minister has seen this report and what consideration, if any, he or the Attorney General has given to its contents during the past four years. If the Minister received this report, the question further arises as to whether its contents indicated that he should proceed at an early stage to make the exhumation order requested in 1997 by the coroner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the Dáil last week, announced he was appointing an eminent lawyer &ldquo;to examine all the relevant papers and the progress on these investigations generally with a view to his receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are any measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality, sooner, rather than later.&rdquo; The Minister announced yesterday evening that he is appointing Shane Murphy in this regard. This proposal is essentially one which envisages a senior counsel examining documentation already available to the Minister and his Department. It is not clear whether Mr. Murphy will have available to him all the documentation available to the Garda in respect of the <Col N="591" /> three different internal investigations which have been conducted nor is it clear whether he will have available to him the files submitted by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions and communications from the DPP to the Garda with regard to any such file. It is not clear whether he will have available to him the report of Superintendent Kevin Lennon which details errors committed by the Garda Síochána when investigating the death of Richard Barron, nor is it clear what co-operation, if any, will be afforded to the eminent lawyer by the Garda Commissioner or individual members of the force whose conduct is being questioned. It is absolutely clear that in law, no individual member of the force will be under a legal obligation of any nature to co-operate in the deliberations of the eminent lawyer appointed by the Minister. It is also not clear, what regard, if any, he is to have to any of the complaints made by members of the McBrearty family or the McConnell family or others who allege Garda misconduct in this affair. It seems essentially that the eminent legal person is being appointed for no reason other than to prolong the uncertainty and to give the Minister extra breathing space before making the political decision of whether to support the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Dáil last Tuesday, stated that &ldquo;it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might be implicated in wrongdoing&rdquo;. He also stated that he is &ldquo;strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members is investigated thoroughly and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated.&rdquo; The Minister asserted that he wants &ldquo;to see the truth of this matter determined&rdquo; and he wants to see public confidence in the Garda, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter, restored.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We, on the Opposition side of the House share these aspirations. The McBrearty family publicly announced yesterday that should a tribunal of inquiry be appointed, they are agreeable to deferring the processing of all the civil actions instituted by them arising out of this affair against either the Garda or the State. It is clear the Garda Complaints Board is incapable of addressing within any reasonable period the very substantial allegations made against a small number of members of the Garda force who have been assigned to the Donegal area. It is no longer tenable that the present situation continue. No other European Union democracy would allow allegations of police misconduct such as those levelled against a small number of gardaí in Donegal to fester and remain undetermined and unresolved for more than four years.</P>
    <P>This is not a banana republic. It is a parliamentary democracy which is dependent for the polic<Col N="592" /> ing of this State on the Garda Síochána from whom we expect the highest standards of integrity and adherence to the law. Failure to ensure all of the issues arising out of this affair are addressed within a reasonable time is undermining public confidence in our Garda force and is damaging to the morale of the overwhelming majority of the force who are proud to wear its uniform. It should not be necessary that this House divide on this issue. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Government parties and the Independent Members of this House to express support for the motion before the House tonight to enable a tribunal of inquiry to be established. A vote against this motion by the Government would be an abdication of ministerial and political responsibility and a failure to recognise the responsibility vested in the Government to ensure we have a Garda force whose actions are beyond reproach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I support the motion in the name of the Opposition parties. This is one of the most important and significant motions to come before this House in the lifetime of the current Government. That this motion has been signed by all members of the three main Opposition parties and that it enjoys the support, in Opposition, of the Independent Deputies is a reflection of the deep concern felt across these benches and mirrored on the other side of the House. I have no doubt that, if the Taoiseach and Tánaiste were to allow a free vote at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow, this motion would be passed overwhelmingly. I know because I have had discussions with members of the Minister's party on this matter. One former senior Minister expressed to me his desire, will and wish to support this motion.</P>
      <P>The events which are the subject of this motion have created concerns in County Donegal but their implications extend well beyond the boundaries of that county. What has emerged to date has shaken public confidence in the Garda Síochána to an extent that I have not experienced before. The manner in which Members respond to these serious matters will determine whether irreparable damage is done to the reputation and fine standing of the Garda Síochána and to the maintenance of public confidence in the police force.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that public confidence in effective, efficient and accountable policing is a critical requirement of any democratic society where the rule of law prevails. The police force is the bulwark against crime and disorder. No one likes coming to the attention of the police. We want to be able to rely on it being there. We want it to be secure and know that every citizen can turn to our police when in time of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been exceptionally fortunate with the police force we have had since the foundation of <Col N="593" /> the State. The Garda Síochána has served us well and has shown great courage in facing up to often ruthless paramilitary and criminal gangs, especially when it is remembered that the force is largely an unarmed force. The Garda Síochána has paid a high price in terms of the lives of its members and we owe a debt of gratitude to people like Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Sergeant Andrew Callanan, the two most recent officers to die violently and valiantly in the line of duty. I remember especially Detective Garda Séamus Quaid who was murdered in my constituency of Wexford.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable in any large force of 11,000 members that there would be a minority which is dishonest or corrupt. Again it should be acknowledged that allegations of corruption or improper activities have been few and far between, especially in comparison with our near neighbours in Britain. It is this generally exemplary record that makes the shocking allegations which have emerged in Donegal all the more surprising and of even greater concern. This surprise and concern has been greatly compounded by the failure of the Garda authorities, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister, who is ultimately accountable to the House, to deal with these allegations in anything which approximates to a prompt, effective or efficient manner.</P>
    <P>A double injustice has been done in Donegal. An entirely innocent man, Richard Barron, died in violent circumstances on the night of 14 October 1996, almost certainly, we now believe, the victim of a hit and run driver. An injustice has been done to Mr. Barron's family by the failure to bring anyone to justice for his death. A serious injustice has also been done to the extended McBrearty family by what appears to have been a deliberate attempt to frame one of its members for a murder which did not take place and by what has all the appearances, if we are to accept the allegations on record, of a deliberate campaign of harassment conducted against members of the McBrearty family, its friends and its employees.</P>
    <P>We do not know the full story of what happened. That is why this motion is before the House and why we call for a tribunal of inquiry &ndash; so that the full truth can be established. I can safely say that, if only a fraction of what has been alleged took place, it would still represent probably the most serious case of corruption and improper activity in the history of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the allegations which have emerged in the media or in the limited number of court hearings which have taken place. We have an allegation of a forged statement being attributed to Mr. Frank McBrearty Jnr. confessing to a murder which apparently did not take place. We have had allegations of a garda practis<Col N="594" /> ing the forced signature of Mr. McBrearty and of financial and other inducements being offered to persons, some of a criminal background, to give false evidence against Mr. McBrearty and others. We have had allegations of threatening and intimidating phone calls and that explosives seized by the Garda were relocated by some of its members and &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; to boost their record. We have had allegations that the phones of lawyers involved in work with their clients were tapped.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the truth lies in these matters but I know beyond doubt that they are of such importance that they must be ventilated fully so that we arrive at the truth. We know more than 150 summonses were issued against Mr. Frank McBrearty Snr, his family and members of his staff over a six month period in early 1997 under the Licensing, Road Traffic and Public Order Acts. That is unprecedented. We know this mountain of summonses was withdrawn two years later by the Director of Public Prosecutions without explanation or apology to the McBrearty family or the others involved. How can this just rest unanswered? We know an appeal taken by another nightclub owner in County Donegal who was convicted of allowing his premises to be used for the sale and distribution of drugs was not contested by the DPP, apparently because of the allegations which have been made against gardaí in Donegal. We know it is likely the State will face a substantial compensation claim in this case.</P>
    <P>We know Mr. McBrearty has secured leave from the High Court to take an action to compel the Garda Commissioner to investigate allegations of perjury by five Garda officers arising from denials by them of the existence of a document which directed members in Donegal to pay special attention to the McBrearty family. That document was read into the record by Deputy Shatter. I also have a copy of the document whose existence was denied in court by gardaí. I quote from the report of the court case in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 November:</P>
    <P>Mr. Giblin [senior counsel] said the existence of a Garda divisional circular was denied on six occasions when the McBreartys had applied for it. He said Supt. Lennon had denied its existence but turned out to be one of the authors. It was subsequently proved to exist and was obtained by order of the court. In the course of proceedings five gardaí had on oath denied the existence of the document.</P>
    <P>We know there have been at least three Garda investigations into these allegations and that not one of them has yet been published or come into the public domain. We know that the principal investigation undertaken by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed in July 2000, but that the findings have never been published and that little or no action has been taken on foot of <Col N="595" /> them to date. We know that five years after his death the body of Mr. Barron was exhumed and that the examination by the State pathologist found that his injuries were consistent with a hit and run.</P>
    <P>The net result of all investigations has been the charging of one garda with firearms offences while four men have been charged with minor offences relating to charges of making false statements and wasting Garda time. While there have been a number of transfers out of the Donegal Garda division, we have been informed by the Commissioner, who authorised the moves, that they were not disciplinary measures and there have been reports, but no specific details to suggest that a number of gardaí will face internal disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    <P>Any one of the incidents and allegations I have listed would provide grounds for considering establishing an inquiry. Taken in their totality, these incidents and allegations provide an absolutely compelling case for a full tribunal. The appointment of a lawyer, as the Minister promised in the House last week, to examine the papers relating to these cases is simply a move to provide some answer to the priority questions tabled by Deputy Shatter and I last week and give him some semblance of a fig leaf with which to cover his inaction and dereliction of duty. I have absolutely no doubt about the integrity or commitment of the lawyer appointed, Mr. Shane Murphy, but his role and powers will be limited. Only a full tribunal of inquiry with all the powers available to it under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, will be able to get to the bottom of this murky affair.</P>
    <P>Both the public and the Opposition parties have shown great patience. Earlier this year the Garda Commissioner asked people to be patient. We waited to see if the various Garda investigations would produce results. We waited to see if commitments from both the Minister and the Commissioner that they were determined to see if the whole truth would emerge would come to fruition. However, we are still waiting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly acknowledged that the Opposition parties have been most responsible and restrained in the face of these serious claims and allegations. For example, when Deputy Jim Higgins and I came into possession of startling allegations relating to one of the Garda investigations we did not go rushing to the media or come barging into the House, where the allegations could have been repeated under the protection of absolute privilege. That was not the route we chose to take. On the contrary, we went directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and informed him of our concerns. A senior garda, an assistant commissioner, was appointed to investigate the allegations. It is almost a year and a half since Deputy Higgins <Col N="596" /> and I spoke to the Minister in respect of these matters. We gave full statements at the time, but have heard absolutely nothing from the investigation or the Minister in the interim. Is the Minister in a position to justify what has happened in this instance? A simple net issue was presented to him at the time, but we have not received any results from the third of the inquiries put in place to discover the truth about these matters.</P>
    <P>We have had the Carty inquiry, which reported to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform in the summer of 2000. We have had the inquiry, to which I have just referred, undertaken by Assistant Commissioner Fachtna Murphy, into allegations about that first investigation. According to the Minister's reply to a number of parliamentary questions on 13 November a third inquiry is being undertaken by a chief superintendent to investigate &ldquo;a related matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation.&rdquo; I have no idea to what this latest inquiry relates. We have had no shortage of inquiries, but a great shortage of tangible results.</P>
    <P>All Deputies on the Opposition side of the House are united in their support for the motion. There are two Independent Deputies who represent the county of Donegal and its people. Not just in County Donegal, but all over the country people will be watching to see what will be their attitude to this motion. Up to 82 Members will vote in favour of the motion. Its fate, therefore, will rest in the hands of Deputies Blaney and Gildea during tomorrow night's vote. They have a choice to make. They can make a stand which will help to ensure the truth that their constituents want to see enters the public domain, or they can troop meekly into the lobbies with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. By that action, they can meekly draw a further veil of silence over this whole affair. That will be their choice, that will be their decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;having regard to the allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division engaged in unethical and criminal behaviour;</P>
      <P>&ndash;mindful of the ongoing investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron, and not wishing to prejudice it in any way;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the fact that several civil and criminal proceedings dealing with aspects of this matter are before the courts and are, therefore, <i>sub judice</i>;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;accepting the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is <Col N="597" /> essential for the reputation of the Garda Síochána that any alleged wrongdoing by members are investigated thoroughly and that appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated, where necessary;</P>
    <P>&ndash;noting the action taken by the Garda Commissioner to have the truth of this matter determined and the steps already taken by him to have public confidence in the Garda, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter, restored;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcoming the measures already decided by the Government to create an independent inspectorate for the Garda Síochána and to improve arrangements for the making of complaints against the Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>&ndash;commends the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint an eminent legal person to conduct an independent review of all the relevant papers and the progress on these investigations generally with a view to the Minister receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about the situation in County Donegal and have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments expressed by Deputies opposite in this matter. I also want to see the facts of this matter established, I want to see justice done and I want to see those who have engaged in criminal activities made accountable for their actions. However, I am, as is every other citizen of this Republic, every Member of the House and every Minister in the Government, obliged to act in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that this evening's motion calls for action which is in conflict with the law. The motion refers, somewhat glibly, to the &ldquo;customary need to ensure pending or anticipated criminal proceedings are not put at unnecessary risk of frustration.&rdquo; It also states that in this instance the &ldquo;customary need&rdquo; is outweighed in importance by certain factors. What the Opposition refers to as a mere &ldquo;customary need&rdquo; has been described by the Supreme Court as, not just a constitutional right, but a superior constitutional right.</P>
    <P>Miss Justice Denham of the Supreme Court, in the case of D v The Director of Public Prosecutions, which is reported at 1994, Volume 2 Irish Reports, page 465, stated on page 474 as follows:</P>
    <P>The applicant's right to a fair trial is one of the most fundamental constitutional rights afforded to persons. On a hierarchy of constitutional rights it is a superior right. A court must give some consideration to the com<Col N="598" /> munity's right to have this alleged crime prosecuted in the usual way. However, on the hierarchy of constitutional rights there is no doubt but that the applicant's right to fair procedures is superior to the community's right to prosecute. If there were a real risk that the accused would not receive a fair trial there would be no question of the applicant's right to a fair trial being detrimentally balanced against the community's right to have alleged crimes prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I am under an obligation to ensure that the rights of persons who may face possible criminal prosecutions are respected. I am under an obligation to ensure that the law, as set down by the Supreme Court, is upheld.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Opposition received gravely defective legal advice or if they received correct legal advice and decided not to follow the advice. I am, however, gravely suspicious of its motivation. Any analysis, however cursory, of tribunals of inquiry reveals that the two most successful public inquiries which have reported in recent years were preceded by an investigation by an eminent and qualified person. The work of the McCracken tribunal, which was both speedy and effective, was preceded by an investigation by His Honour Mr. Justice Gerard Buchanan. The work of the Finlay tribunal, which again was speedy and effective, was preceded by an investigation by Ms Miriam Hederman O'Brien.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been three investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast, tribunals which have not been preceded by investigations have tended to be longer.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition wishes to get the truth of the matter in an efficient manner it is clear that the last path which should be followed is the path to an immediate public inquiry. The steps which I propose are steps which, in the past, have been proven to be correct. It is of significance that when members of the Opposition were in government they recognised the validity of the course which I propose. It was members of the Opposition who appointed Mr. Justice Buchanan and Ms Hederman O'Brien to conduct their investigations. Expediency rather than reason now rules the Opposition roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to uphold the law and equally determined to establish the truth of what occurred in Donegal. My amendment makes clear that I too want to improve the standards of accountability in the Garda Síochána and I have published the measures which I intend to take. I have done all I can to progress this matter. I have had an open door when it came to this issue. I have met Opposition spokespersons on justice, I have met Deputies Blaney and Gildea from <Col N="599" /> Donegal and I have answered questions as fully and completely as possible.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is a matter of great concern to me that individual members of the Garda Síochána have been implicated in wrong-doing. In this regard, I am strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrong-doing is investigated thoroughly and that appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings is taken. A desire to establish the facts and to ensure that corrective measures are taken is not the exclusive preserve of one or the other side of the House. It would be unfortunate if this issue was to become a political football. I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>I want to see restoration of public confidence in the Garda in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter. We have an excellent police service and it serves no purpose to have this cloud hanging over the vast majority of the men and women of the Garda Síochána who daily carry out their job, which is often difficult and demanding, in the most exemplary manner. This is a complex matter &ndash; that much cannot be argued. Nobody on either side of the House could say that this is a simple affair that can be remedied or dealt with easily and quickly. The law, a law which protects rights and provides for due process, is not so convenient. The law cannot be shaped or moulded to fit the mood of the time. Rights must be respected. Due process must be protected. These are the fundamental principles which are the foundation of our legal system.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this case has been an issue of concern since matters were raised with the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Owen, in 1997. Concerns about the handling of the investigation into the death of Mr. Barron were first raised in correspondence with my predecessor dated 27 February 1997 from a Member of Seanad Éireann five months after the death of the late Mr. Barron.</P>
    <P>At about 12.45 a.m. on 14 October 1996, the body of Richard &ldquo;Richie&rdquo; Barron was found by a passing motorist on an unlit roadway at Townparks, Raphoe. When the body was found, there was evidence of cuts and associated bleeding on the forehead of the deceased. He was found within half a mile of his home, close to a gateway that gives access to an area of rough ground which is connected to the car park of the licensed premises known as Frankies Nite Club, owned by Frank McBrearty senior. Following the discovery of the body the Garda and the ambulance service were alerted. An ambulance crew attended the scene and removed Richie Barron to Letterkenny General Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Gardaí who arrived at the scene at 1.34 a.m. initially treated the death as resulting from a hit and run traffic accident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> However, I understand that information was given subsequently to the Garda which suggested that Mr. Barron had been murdered and was not the victim of a hit and run accident. A file was prepared and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions early in 1998. I understand that in April 1999, the DPP advised that no prosecutions should be taken on the basis of the file. Even before that communication from the Director of Public Prosecutions, there were concerns within the Garda Síochána about the matter. A number of disturbing events happened, including the issuing by gardaí of a significant number of summonses against a particular publican &ndash; subsequently the summonses were not proceeded with on the instructions of the DPP &ndash; allegations of harassment and of control of alleged arms dumps by members of the Garda, allegations of impropriety by members of the Garda in the conduct of prosecutions and other allegations.</P>
    <P>In February 1999, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner Carty to examine the matter. Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation was extensive, comprehensive and complex. Over 1,000 people were interviewed. While the initial focus was on the investigation into Mr Barron's death, it was broadened to include a number of other issues, including allegations of harassment and allegations that certain gardaí were involved in hoax bomb-making equipment finds. In the course of the investigations a number of people were arrested, including members of the Garda. Notwithstanding the size and complexity of the investigation, Assistant Commissioner Carty was in a position to submit a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions in July 2000.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no function in the prosecution of criminal charges. I am, therefore, neither in a position nor would it be appropriate for me to make inquiries with the Director of Public Prosecutions as to individual cases. I can say, as it is a matter of public record, that six individuals have been charged with criminal offences arising from Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation. The first was charged on 16 March 2001 and five others were charged in June of this year. Most of the charges relate to the making of false statements but one relates to the possession of a firearm. Five of those charged were civilians and one is a Garda detective sergeant. This member is currently suspended from duty. All these matters have yet to be determined by the courts. I understand that there may be further prosecutions.</P>
    <P>One of the most important issues that has to be addressed &ndash; it is a fact that is often overlooked &ndash; is that Mr. Barron died and we still have not established who was responsible for his death. There has been a lot of speculation but that is what it is, speculation. There is no conclusive evidence available as yet on the cause of his <Col N="601" /> death and whether it was criminal or accidental in nature. There is an ongoing Garda investigation into this issue and once again I urge anybody with information to come forward. Two other Garda investigations, other than disciplinary investigations, were initiated relating to Donegal, one conducted by Assistant Commissioner Murphy in response to allegations brought to my notice by two Members of this House, the other by a chief superintendent to investigate a related matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation. Extensive inquiries have been conducted in the Donegal division and elsewhere in the course of the investigation conducted by Assistant Commissioner Murphy. To date, in excess of 100 persons have been interviewed.</P>
    <P>I am advised that during the course of the investigation an issue arose on which it was considered necessary to seek legal advice. This advice has been sought by the Garda authorities and is currently awaited. I am assured by the Garda authorities that when this advice becomes available, every effort will be made to finalise the investigation expeditiously. On 21 July 2000 the commissioner appointed a chief superintendent to conduct a fact-finding investigation into matters raised by a member of the Garda Síochána. Subsequently, the member commenced legal proceedings against the State. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the member did not co-operate with the investigation. The proceedings instituted by the member are now being dealt with by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of Garda discipline, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that in June 2000, a superintendent was appointed in accordance with the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, to investigate the alleged neglect of duty and improper practices on the part of two members in the Donegal division, which arose during the course of the investigation into the death of Richard Barron. I am advised by the Garda authorities that on the advice of their solicitor, the two members in question have declined to co-operate with the investigating officer and arising therefrom, further disciplinary proceedings have commenced.</P>
    <P>Arising out of Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation, a chief superintendent was appointed in March 2001 in accordance with the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, to investigate alleged breaches of discipline against four members of the Garda Síochána. The investigations, which are ongoing, concern alleged breaches of discipline between 1993 and 1996. The question of preferring disciplinary proceedings against the members concerned cannot be considered until the chief superintendents' investigations have concluded.</P>
    <P>As regards the transfer of members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division, the <Col N="602" /> House will be aware that, when the Commissioner received the report of the Assistant Commissioner on the allegations in question, he decided, in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána, to transfer a number of personnel. I support him in taking these necessary measures. A total of nine civil actions have also been instituted.</P>
    <P>I note the Opposition motion refers to the exhumation order. I had hoped that I had dealt with this last week and disabused the House any conspiracy theories. However, given that it has been mentioned again, I take this opportunity to once again set out the facts. Section 47 of the Coroners Act, 1962, provides that where a coroner is informed by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector that, in his opinion, the death of any person whose body has been buried in the coroner's district may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, the coroner may request the Minister to order the exhumation of the body by the Garda.</P>
    <P>A request, in accordance with section 47(2) of the Coroners Act was received from the coroner for Donegal south-east on 27 June 2001, in respect of the late Mr. Barron and an exhumation order issued on 3 July 2001. Prior to this request, on 10 October 1997 the superintendent in charge of the investigation into the death of the late Mr. Barron, forwarded a request from the coroner for an exhumation order, based on a request made by the superintendent to the coroner. The necessary papers &ndash; an exhumation order and other related papers &ndash; were prepared by the staff of the Department to authorise the exhumation. However, on 16 October 1997 the same garda telephoned the Department and asked that his request for an exhumation order be put on hold until further notice.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would have been inappropriate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take any further action regarding the exhumation order request based as it was on the request of the same superintendent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that some people are frustrated with what they see as the delay in having the truth of this matter determined. However, let us be clear about one thing, we intervene with the criminal process at our peril. There are no short cuts in the pursuit of justice and no quick fixes in bringing the guilty to book. We cannot disregard legal principle for political expediency or jeopardise criminal investigations for the benefit of public curiosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised that the Green Party has allied itself to this defective motion. It is often the case that those who shout loudest about their own <Col N="603" /> constitutional rights are the first to seek to suppress the rights of others. It would be commendable if the Green Party had learned the lesson of its past mistakes, but if it did, it would not be the Green Party. It appears to have forgotten the words spoken by Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh in halting a criminal trial, partly because of the distribution of leaflets advertising a rally which was to be addressed by a Deputy from the Green Party.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Green Party of the words of Mr. Justice Haugh. At page 14 of the judgment delivered on 26 June 2000 he states, &ldquo;For similar reasons I also believe that the leaflet captioned &ldquo;Jail the Corrupt Politicians&rdquo; has similar potential for real and substantial prejudice not only because of its contents but also the position and status of those announced as due to speak at the rally concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those of us who are fortunate to have been elected to this House must take care that we do not lend our position or status to enterprises which adversely affect the constitutional rights of others. I accept that Deputies have concerns that the position in Donegal is still unresolved. I share their concerns and I want to see the truth determined. However, I want to see it determined in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I sought the advice of the Attorney General as to what options are open to me to carry out an independent inquiry, be it a sworn inquiry or otherwise. The Attorney General's advice in particular pointed out the very serious difficulties that would arise while civil and criminal proceedings are still pending, and advised that these proceedings should be allowed to run their course. I point out for the sake of completeness that the Attorney General gave this advice without the benefit of seeing the file submitted by the Garda to the DPP.</P>
    <P>The integrity of criminal proceedings instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions must be vindicated, not undermined, by Parliament. We cannot dispense with criminal proceedings because they get in the way of political objectives. Those charged with criminal offences have a right to hear the case against them and a right to defend themselves. The State has a right to pursue these prosecutions. We also cannot disregard the rights of persons to take civil proceedings and have them adjudicated by the courts.</P>
    <P>What of the investigation into the death of Richard Barron? Is this too to be put, and I quote the Opposition's words, &ldquo;at risk of frustration&rdquo;? A man has died and the circumstances in which he died have yet to be ascertained. Nobody has been brought to account for this death. This must not be overlooked, nor must the suffering of his family. The circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned are the subject of an on-going Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> I would now like to turn to the motion put forward by the Opposition. At first glance it may seem to adequately address the issue but, with all due respect, when one looks at the detail it begins to unravel. I say this not to be unkind, nor to find fault for the sake of doing so, but because it is important that we proceed in a careful and correct manner.</P>
    <P>I will address the core proposition, namely, that the public interest in a full and impartial airing and determination of the facts in this case, and consideration of its public policy implications, outweighs in importance what is described as, &ldquo;the customary need to ensure that pending or anticipated criminal proceedings are not put at unnecessary risk or frustration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legal issues which I dealt with earlier, this is a proposition with very far reaching implications. While a proposition should not be condemned on the grounds of its novelty alone, it has to be recognised that acceptance of the proposition would represent a major departure by the State from the way in which wrongdoing by its citizens has always been dealt with &ndash; whether the wrongdoers happen to be public servants, or whether the wrongdoing is civil or criminal in nature.</P>
    <P>It has been the consistent view of my predecessors and of successive Governments, that the right course, where there is wrongdoing, is to allow the criminal process to take its course and, on the civil side, to allow the normal civil law process, including, if necessary, court proceedings to strike the balance between the respective rights of individuals and other bodies and between individuals and the State. This is a system which has served the public well, by and large. As legislators, we would surely need reasons of a most persuasive kind before we could decide simply to sweep it all aside. We would need to ensure there was no adverse impact in terms of the assertion and vindication of the fundamental rights of individuals. It would involve breach of what the Supreme Court recognises as a superior constitutional right.</P>
    <P>If the core proposition of the motion was accepted, by what principle would we then decide that one form of wrongdoing was a matter to be dealt with through what the motion describes as the &ldquo;customary&rdquo; mechanism and another through the newly-proposed mechanism, namely, a public inquiry side by side with live, but incomplete, civil and criminal proceedings? If it is argued that the ultimate arbiter in each instance should be the level of public interest or concern generated, or at least the level of public interest or concern as assessed by this House, then how do we decide, exactly and equitably, to treat other high profile cases that cause very grave public concern, where wrongs of the most serious kind may be the subject of prolonged investigation? How do we ensure as between one citizen and the next, or <Col N="605" /> between one victim and the next, that there is consistency or fairness in the system as a whole, if in one instance a separate mechanism is brought into play at the behest of this House, but, in another, custom and practice is allowed to prevail?</P>
    <P>If it were being asserted that there was no prospect at all that wrongdoing in the Donegal cases, whether civil or criminal, would be addressed through the existing mechanism, then we might be obliged to look at alternatives. However, that is not the case. Persons have already been charged and other cases are being considered by the DPP. Also, civil proceedings have been instituted and those proceedings will need to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is the further fact that if, at the end of the normal civil and criminal processes, a level of public concern remains about this case, there can be a public inquiry. I have made it abundantly clear that I have no objection to that course.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Opposition's motion which need to be commented upon. I am not offering comment on all of the issues that arise, but on the more obvious ones, and I do so not for the sake of being negative or implying any lack of sincerity on the part of the proposers of the motion, but simply to point out that, apart from the weaknesses of its core proposition, there are other matters that should give us all cause for thought.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the need for a &ldquo;full, public and impartial ventilation&rdquo; of the facts. Paragraph (1) proposes that, &ldquo;It is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 (&ldquo;the Acts&rdquo;), to inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, section 3(g) states, &ldquo;The Tribunal can carry out a preliminary investigation and, where appropriate, can conduct its proceedings in private, in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless I am missing something, therefore, it appears that the Opposition is not calling for a public inquiry at this point. It is calling, in the first instance, for a preliminary investigation which can take place behind closed doors. How does this square with the very first proposal in the motion and how will it advance the objective of open and transparent investigation at this point? There is the proposal at paragraph (3)(j) of the motion that&ndash;</P>
    <P>in relation to any matters where the tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a fully public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the tribunal thinks <Col N="606" /> appropriate on the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, exists;</P>
    <P>But what happens if the tribunal determines that the evidence is insufficient or does not exist to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry on the basis of information given to it in private? Will this information, given to it in private, be disclosed and, if so, to whom? What about the evidence that might be given publicly to the tribunal? Evidence given to tribunals is non-admissable in criminal proceedings. Section 5 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, makes that clear. That can hardly be helpful in terms of securing what should be a core objective of the whole exercise, i.e., ensuring that no impediments are put in the way of securing criminal convictions where such are warranted.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, section 2 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997, provides that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court. Are we sure that we want to provide the opportunity to anybody and everybody who might wish to send documentation to the proposed tribunal at this stage, to secure immunities of the kind referred to in respect of that evidence?</P>
    <P>In short, none of the evidence, or anything derived from that evidence, can be used in future proceedings. In other words, the building up of a criminal prosecution would have to start from scratch. I am advised that the same would apply to civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>There must be at least some doubt as to whether the proposers of the motion actually believe themselves that what they are advocating represents the right way forward. Apart from the confusion as to whether a public inquiry is being called for at all &ndash; as distinct from a private investigation behind closed doors, which might or might not lead to a public inquiry &ndash; there is the confusion which has undoubtedly been created by comments attributed to Deputy Howlin in one of today's newspapers. A report in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Labour Justice spokesman, Brendan Howlin, said the Minister's failure to hold an inquiry amounted to dereliction of duty. But the Labour Party deputy leader would not commit to definitely holding an inquiry if his party were in Government after the next election.</P>
    <P>If that is a correct summary of the Deputy's views we need to know it because on any ordinary interpretation what it seems to be saying is that I am in dereliction of my duties for not doing something which he, as a proposer of the motion, is not prepared to commit himself to doing either. If it is a false report, then we need to know that also.</P>

      <P>Part of the reason we are discussing the use of a tribunal to determine what happened in Donegal is that there is no other machinery available to us at this moment to investigate such matters and to do so independently. That is why I have acted where others have not, and published new arrangements which will govern future complaints against the Garda Síochána. The overall purpose is to introduce new independent and transparent procedures which reflect modern conditions in order to maintain and enhance public support for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>We need to have a mechanism to deal with systems failures, to investigate patterns of possible abuse, to deal with how the force operates as a whole, in addition to being able to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of individual members.</P>
      <P>The measures to put the new Garda inspectorate in place have been approved by the Government which has also indicated that work should commence on the preparation of the new legislation that will be required to implement them. I am anxious that this project should be completed as quickly as possible and I have no doubt that when the new measures are in operation they will contribute in a positive and significant way towards strengthening public confidence in the Garda Síochána and how it carries out its many tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new Garda inspectorate will be established which will have the capacity to examine every aspect of Garda operations policy from the point of view of best policing practice. For the purpose of carrying out all of its functions the inspectorate will operate completely independently and its staff will be appointed by and be responsible to the inspectorate. The powers of the inspectorate <Col N="608" /> will be extensive and will enable it to obtain access to relevant material and to have discussions with appropriate parties in conducting its reviews. Moreover, the inspectorate will be in a position to conduct research into relevant matters and to engage specialist expertise. This could be done, for example, through the use of outside resources which could, as necessary, be sought from outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If any of my predecessors had acted as I am now doing and set up such an inspectorate, we would not be discussing this matter now. The inspectorate would be examining the matter. However, where others have talked, I have acted. Given the undoubted complexities of the Donegal situation with its attendant criminal and civil proceedings, what can be done to progress this matter? I have already set out the Attorney General's advice to me. Taking into account the difficulties identified by the Attorney General on the one hand and the need to address current public concerns on the other, I have decided to appoint an eminent legal person to conduct an independent review of all the relevant papers and the progress on these investigations generally with a view to receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I have appointed Mr. Shane Murphy, Senior Counsel, on the nomination of the Chairman of the Bar Council, with the following terms of reference: to conduct an independent review and undertake a thorough examination of the action taken, and of relevant papers held, by the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relevant to allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour, particularly in the context of the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron, and with regard to the finds of bomb-making equipment; to advise, taking into account relevant criminal, civil and disciplinary aspects and mindful of the public interest, whether all appropriate steps have been taken with due diligence and expedition; to advise what further measures, if any, might now be taken to bring those who have engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour to account at the earliest opportunity and to address public concerns; and in this regard, to submit a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This is an unprecedented step and Mr. Murphy will begin his task straightaway. The action I am proposing will achieve the objective without running the risk of jeopardising the civil and criminal proceedings already in being &ndash; a result which would not serve the public interest in this case.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of any advice I may receive as to action that might now be taken to bring the var<Col N="609" /> ious matters to finality, I want to make it clear again that I am not opposed to the idea of a public inquiry in this case. I have made that clear from the outset. Time and time again, I have said that I want the truth of this matter to be determined. The only question &ndash; and it should not be one that divides us in bitter and partisan debate &ndash; is what is the appropriate way of achieving this objective?</P>
    <P>For the reasons set out, I do not believe that this is the appropriate time to establish a tribunal of inquiry. I see nothing to be gained by jeopardising criminal and civil proceedings &ndash; and, indeed, possible Garda disciplinary proceedings &ndash; at this juncture in time. The action I am now taking, which is without precedent, will assure the House and the general public that everything possible is being done to bring closure to the matter. I commend the amendment I have proposed to the House.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party agrees with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law on one matter, that is, where he stated:</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing is investigated thoroughly and appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings taken.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that other colleagues in the House, including Members of the Fine Gael Party, also support that view. I see this motion as an attempt to limit damage to the Garda Síochána in respect of the most serious case of corruption and improper activity in the history of the force, as my colleague Deputy Howlin has described it.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought to recognise the two critical paragraphs in the motion that talk about acknowledging widespread public concern about the matter; being strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any allegations of wrongdoing by its members are investigated thoroughly; that if such allegations are well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated; and wanting to see the truth of this matter determined and public confidence in the Garda Síochána, in so far as it has been adversely affected, restored. The Minister ought to support that kernel of the motion because he was the author of those two paragraphs which were contained in his reply to the House on 13 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's contributions, however, one could not be more disappointed. Even at this late stage, five years after these events originated, the Minister is still procrastin<Col N="610" /> ating, still explaining, still looking for justice and still seeking the truth, but not yet.</P>
    <P>I do not come to this debate with any personal knowledge of the facts. I have briefly met the McBrearty family to exchange courtesies and to sympathise with the plight in which they find themselves. I have read the statement of Mr. Frank McBrearty and documentation on the matter by Mr. William Flynn, to which Deputy Shatter referred. I do not have personal knowledge of the facts, but I share the widespread public concern which is referred to in the motion and borrowed from the Minister's words. The question of wanting to restore confidence in the Garda, which has undoubtedly been damaged, is critical. The motion is about the fundamental nature of our democracy, equality before the law and the answerability of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one would rank the issues in this debate. They are set out in the motion before the House. The systematic oppression of the McBrearty family, including the attempted destruction of their livelihoods and the attempt to frame one of their members for the crime of murder, must be one of the most serious issues to come before the House. The failure to properly investigate in an expeditious and efficient manner what appears to be the unlawful killing of a citizen must also rank highly. The failure of the Garda authorities to deal with the allegations promptly and efficiently must also feature prominently.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the type of forensic detail outlined by Deputies Howlin and Shatter. However, I am dismayed at the apparent inability of the Minister to understand the gravity of the matters at issue. In the normal adversarial course of politics I have exchanged views with the Minister in the House on a number of occasions and he has given his views with interest. Although he is a decent man, he is a feeble Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has not shown a capacity for decisiveness in that Department. He has been captured by the Department and that is evident in the speech he regurgitated tonight. He is a captive of his Department. He finds himself incapable of acknowledging that there might be wrong-doing by any members of the Garda Síochána. He finds that difficult to stomach.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with that view because the profile of this House is older than the profile of the population. We were all reared in a different era when respect for the Garda Síochána was one of the core values of the people. The Minister, like the rest of us, is a product of that. He cannot acknowledge that, notwithstanding what we have seen in recent times, not every member of the Garda Síochána performs to the customary high standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister is indecisive and overly cautious. I cannot believe the bombast and the tendency to <Col N="611" /> trivialise which we saw again tonight, albeit in a ponderous way. I refer by way of illustration to his criticism of the Green Party. It takes a hard neck for the Minister to come in here and seek to indict the Green Party because he says it promoted a leaflet captioned &ldquo;Jail the Corrupt Politicians&rdquo; which represented a real and substantial prospect of prejudicing the trial of the man who first promoted the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. He could just as easily have referred to the Tánaiste whose similar remarks assisted the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, to escape his day of accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>To a far greater degree, as the learned judge said. One would have thought that since the Minister signs everything his officials put in front of him, they would have taken out the red biro and put it through that offensive paragraph. Whatever else the Green Party may be guilty of, to imply that it transgressed, rather than his former party leader in these circumstances, is almost beyond belief.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of concern that if we do not engage in this inquiry the reputation of the Garda Síochána will be damaged. However, there will ultimately be an inquiry. When that inquiry takes place, it will not merely be the damage done to the reputation of the Garda Síochána that will be at issue, but the damage to the reputation of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It appears from his shilly-shallying tonight that the inquiry will come, but not until he is gone. I do not take pleasure in saying that when it comes it will leave his credibility in tatters. The more he delays, procrastinates and agonises, the more damage will be done.</P>
      <P>These are serious issues. I do not know the truth of them one way or the other, but I know that a majority of law-abiding citizens are scandalised by what appears to have been done to the McBrearty family. Yet the Minister makes statements about the fact that the assistant commissioner's investigation was &ldquo;extensive, comprehensive and complex&rdquo;. It was also secret, as all three investigations have been. Nobody has been assured about what is at the heart of this matter. The Minister said that an applicant's right to fair procedures is superior to the community's right to prosecute. What about the rights of the McBrearty family? What about the rights of Richie Barron's family? How does the Minister rank them? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's case against a tribunal of inquiry? I was in the Four Courts to hear advocates on behalf of the Garda Síochána say that they did not believe that the Garda Síochána should be made amenable, answerable or accountable to this House. That is a fantastic <Col N="612" /> proposition. They said they wanted a tribunal of inquiry and that they would accept such a tribunal in the case of Abbeylara. If they are prepared to accept a tribunal of inquiry in the case of Abbeylara, why not accept a tribunal of inquiry in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not answered that question and he has left the impression in his response to the motion, moved by Deputies Shatter and Howlin, that he might yet yield to an inquiry, but it is impossible to understand how his mind is working. To criticise the motion for lack of focus is nonsense. Sadly we have too much experience of tribunals of inquiry. We have learned a great deal since the days of the whitewash that was the beef tribunal. The manner in which we construct the terms of reference, the manner in which the money trail is followed and the manner in which bank accounts are accessed show that a tribunal of inquiry, notwithstanding the fact that many of their procedures are out of date and based on law that precede the founding of the State, is still an instrument that is capable of getting to the truth on fundamental matters of public interest. This is a fundamental matter of public interest and it is imperative that the Minister stops his dilly-dallying, comes in here and announces that such an inquiry will be established with the full support of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this motion. Like Deputy Rabbitte, I cannot go into the same forensic details as my colleague Deputy Shatter, or indeed Deputy Howlin, has done. However, I will give the views I find in Donegal as honestly and as accurately as I can.</P>
      <P>What has become known as the McBrearty affair has been festering in Donegal since the tragic death of the late Richard Barron in Raphoe five years ago. Since then there have been rumours, counter-rumours, accusations and denials, but we should not lose sight of the core issues involved. A highly respected well-known, hard-working industrious man was mysteriously killed. The bereaved family lost a loving husband and father. It is amazing that after so many years the exact cause of death has not yet been established. Initially it was believed that the late Mr. Barron was the victim of a hit and run accident. After some time and without explanation the hit and run theory was dropped and a murder investigation was initiated. The conduct of this investigation and the activities associated with it have caused widespread confusion, uncertainty and questioning throughout Donegal. Rumour and suspicion have taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Barron family has suffered and continue to suffer from the death of Mr. Barron, other Raphoe families have also gone through what can only be described as a terrible ordeal. I refer to the McBrearty and McConnell families, <Col N="613" /> both highly respected families living in Raphoe in Donegal. For some unknown reason they became the focus of the murder investigation. The pursuance of that investigation almost ruined their successful family business as well as inflicting tremendous stress and severe mental anguish on every member of those two families. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the family also disintegrated due to the pursuance of the investigation. Their customers were allegedly intimidated. They were subject to unprecedented surveillance, resulting in the issuing of 160 summonses for alleged breaches of drinking and opening regulations. Their court appearances became regular features of sittings in Donegal and on every occasion the State requested yet another postponement. At the end of all that the charges were mysteriously dropped or withdrawn. Certainly they were put through the wringer, but they have survived.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, this long saga has generated unprecedented confusion and uncertainty throughout the county. The latest chapter in this disturbing tale was the exhumation of the late Mr. Barron's remains. If leads and reports are to be believed, the late Mr. Barron was the victim of a hit and run accident, in other words, the original opinion.</P>
    <P>Can anyone here imagine the ordeal for the Barron family, and the parish priest, who had to be present to witness the exhumation of their father. Playing a central and pivotal role in all this was the Garda Síochána. I have always had the greatest respect for the Garda Síochána and the important work they do. They are often the bulwark between ourselves and anarchy. During the past 30 years the Garda Síochána have had to operate under incredibly difficult circumstances in Donegal, being a Border county. They have often found themselves in life-threatening situations but they have handled such occasions with the skill and experience we have come to expect of them. During my 20 years as a Member I can truthfully say I have found them to be dedicated, professional and fair. However, the conduct of this investigation generates concern, confusion and uncertainty. Many other aspects of the Garda working operations in Donegal are under the microscope as never before. This is the subject of widespread comment, questioning and probing editorials, including today's edition of <i>The Donegal Democrat</i> which states: &ldquo;The morale of the gardaí in Donegal has taken a terrible bashing.&rdquo;  I know from speaking with individual gardaí that they are deeply concerned as to how this has developed. That concern seemingly goes to the higher echelons of the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to do what I seem to do on a regular basis, come into the House to express my sincere sympathy to people who will lose their jobs in County Donegal, particularly in my region of Buncrana. While I am disappointed the Minister is not present to respond, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>The loss of 67 jobs in Buncrana in March 2002 will mean a bleak Christmas for many families. Many young people with mortgages will be added to the hundreds of others whose redundancy packages have run out. Their financial position is affecting local businesses and the urban council, given that the urban council got most of its rates from Fruit of the Loom which has become almost extinct.</P>
      <P>Do we understand the extent of the collateral damage behind these announcements when they run off our tongue &ndash; 67 job losses? Did it make the evening news on RTE? I do not think it did. Did the fact that thousands of people had already lost their jobs in this rural area, which is reliant on a small number of employers and not on a large urban centre where jobs can be replaced within weeks, make the latest news? Seán Dorgan was on television this evening and there was widespread reporting of what he said today. He was talking positively about the situation. He said he sees good prospects over the next few years, including the creation of 50,000 jobs by overseas companies and companies are still recruiting people. He said that he &ldquo;sees important developments still coming.&rdquo; He said that &ldquo;IDA Ireland will secure a number of significant projects in the health care, international services and pharmaceutical sectors over the next six months.&rdquo; That is his job, but what percentage of those jobs, if any, will come to Inishowen? Mr. Dorgan said that new jobs would match the number of jobs lost. Will he ensure in retrospection that is a geographical match? Does he remember what people have experienced in Buncrana, Raphoe, Milford, Moville, Carndonagh, Malin, Fahan and in other places I could mention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister of State's Department and or the IDA where within Inishowen we can expect this good news will affect. I want the IDA, through the Minister of State, to inform me where is worse off than my <Col N="615" /> immediate peninsula in terms of neglect and the lack of imagination exerted to resolve its level of unemployment? I need not go beyond the fact that we have been waiting for more than four years for IDA land to be transferred to county council ownership to let a local development group do what the IDA failed to do in four years, create jobs. This proves the lack of priority given by the IDA to Inishowen.</P>
    <P>Each region may have experienced job losses, but the IDA invariably succeeds in making an announcement for those regions within weeks or months. I want an answer to why I have not heard the IDA's answer to addressing the hundreds of job losses in that region. I do not want an opt out clause about the national development plan and infrastructure. Job creation and infrastructural development must continue for the north west region.</P>
    <P>In respect of Fruit of the Loom in particular, I trust the news &ndash; of which I await confirmation &ndash; of a new owner may bring stability. I welcome the new owner's promise of investment and development in technology and skills, but people should not consider the stabilisation of Fruit of the Loom at the level it is at as a problem solved. People there want to know the bigger picture for the full work force in the immediate, medium and long-term. We were told a few years ago what the medium and the long-term picture would be up to 2006. Under the new ownership what are the immediate, medium and long-term solutions and projections? What will happen the old plant? How many plants will the IDA market? What is the position regarding redundancy, if sought, of the workers currently employed by Fruit of the Loom who will work under the new owners? They are now working seven days a week, instead of six days. Will the workers continue to be on eight hour work shifts? There are many questions regarding the plant, none more pertinent than who owns the machinery. Has it remained in Buncrana or gone to Morocco?</P>
    <P>I could continue <i>ad nauseum</i> posing questions asked of me on a daily basis. My job is to reiterate that the people in that region have suffered long and hard as a result of job losses. The advent of peace on the island should be maximised to benefit that region. The people there feel their situation is bleak, yet the IDA is confident of many new projects coming into the country. I ask that many of those be directed immediately to my area and, if they are not, I will want to know why. We will not accept that we are peripheral and do not have a suitable labour force because we are not peripheral. We have one of the best labour forces in the country.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure in the region is adequate to attract the creation of 12,000 jobs there. Some 4,500 workers in Fruit of Loom were satisfactorily employed by the company for 12 years. If those <Col N="616" /> workers could stay there for that length of time, many other people can do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The background to this is that on 1 November 2001, Berkshire Hathaway, a United States company, announced that it had acquired Fruit of the Loom's apparel business. I understand the deal is likely to be finalised in the first quarter of 2002. It will involve substantial investment in Fruit of the Loom's Buncrana operations.</P>
      <P>However, the first phase of the development will see Fruit of Loom's operations in Ireland being consolidated into one plant. The purpose of this is to get full utilisation of the company's assets and implementation of a 24 hour a day, seven day a week work pattern across all its textile operations.</P>
      <P>The logistics of the consolidation will be that the operation on Shore Road, Buncrana will transfer to Ballymacarry, Buncrana early next year. Unfortunately, the consolidation will necessitate 65 redundancies, but these will be spread over the next 12 months. Employment in Buncrana is now at 565 and this will be reduced to 500. This will be done in full consultation with the unions involved. This process is a programme to reduce costs, but it will also ensure the long-term viability of the Buncrana operation. Employment is expected to increase from 2003 onwards.</P>
      <P>On the broader question of employment in Donegal, since the Donegal Employment Initiative Task Force submitted its report in July 1999, a number of key recommendations have been implemented. These include improved access to the county, upgrading of skills, provision of industrial and enterprise space and investment in tourism, energy and telecommunications. The infrastructural challenges need to be addressed in order to be successful in attracting further industry.</P>
      <P>The actions undertaken to improve access cover roads, airports and harbour facilities. In order to upgrade skills, additional funding of £4.2 million was made available to FÁS in Donegal. FÁS registration and skills analysis have been put in place. Capital investment was also made in the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, enabling the provision of additional courses for the people of Donegal and people elsewhere in the country.</P>
      <P>Industrial and enterprise space has increased throughout County Donegal with the provision of a large number of units for inward investment, community and indigenous enterprise. Civic offices have also been developed as public private partnerships to provide advanced office space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has been boosted in Donegal with the investment of £1 million on branding and ongoing promotional material. Plans for the development <Col N="617" /> of broad band infrastructure in County Donegal will introduce high speed access to the telecommunications market within the county.</P>
    <P>The £5 million economic development fund established by Donegal County Council has been instrumental in leveraging many of the initiatives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Further mechanisms are being established by Donegal County Development Board in association with Donegal County Council to ensure the integrated delivery of the recommendations of the Donegal Employment Initiative Task Force, thereby ensuring that the county is a prime and competitive location for job creation. The county development board is working towards a deadline of the end of this year in this regard.</P>
    <P>Attracting companies from Dublin and the east coast is a priority for Enterprise Ireland. It has supported six such companies to expand into County Donegal over the past two years. Approximately 160 jobs will be created, and I am delighted to be associated with some of those projects. Discussions are ongoing with a number of promoters who are interested in establishing new businesses in Donegal. Through its community enterprise centre programme, Enterprise Ireland has invested approximately £1.25 million in enterprise space in the county.</P>
    <P>A number of IDA assisted projects have been secured in recent times for Donegal. PacifiCare plans to create an additional 160 jobs early next year. This will bring employment up to more than 300 people in this company. Prudential Insurance Company employs 190 people and plans to create an additional 410 jobs over the next two years. Kirchhoff Ireland is expanding its automotive components operation and employment will increase from 50 people to more than 100 people. Interventional Technologies, a subsidiary of Boston Scientific, which employs more than 3,000 people in Ireland, is creating 90 jobs. The Claddagh Group, a US company, is establishing an Internet recruitment facility in Buncrana and this will employ 35 people. The Donegal County Enterprise Board is continuing its successful support for micro-enterprise all over the county.</P>
    <P>I am confident the combined efforts of all the industrial development agencies will see County Donegal continue to develop as a very good location for industrial development in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Keaveney and her colleagues in Donegal that at every possible opportunity the Tánaiste, myself and our colleagues in the various public sector units within the Department servicing the State agencies will renew and impress on the public servants within the State agencies the importance of ensuring that we are able to support indigenous industry and attract foreign direct investment into Donegal as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting the important matter of Ballyclerihan national school on the Adjournment. I thank the Minister of State, who as a neighbour would have a great knowledge of my constituency, for coming in to reply to this matter and I hope, to deliver good news.</P>
      <P>Ballyclerihan is a village within six miles of the larger town of Clonmel and has grown in recent years. Recently, South Tipperary County Council carried out a draft development plan and there are major proposals to develop the village in coming years. A lot of land has been rezoned and there is much excitement about the possibility of developing the village of Clerihan, as we refer to it in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem in terms of some of the infrastructure in the village. I want to refer, in particular, to the local national school which applied for an allocation of two rooms in 1999 and on which some progress was being made. The school was aware that the inspector for the area supported the application. While it initially received a positive response from it, recently there has been a total change in attitude on the part of the Department and the school is concerned that its application has been put on hold. That is the reason I tabled this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>What is the exact position? The need of the school is great. It is currently using a room in the local parish hall. Children have to cross a dangerous road, between Clonmel and Cashel, to get from one part of the school to the other. This is totally unacceptable to the teaching staff and the children attending the school.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will give me a positive response to this request. He was a good friend to County Tipperary in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter concerning the provision of an extension for St. Michael's national school, Ballyclerihan.</P>
      <P>Currently the school has a staffing level of a principal, three mainstream classroom teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a shared resource teacher based in the school. The school's enrolment as at 30 September 2000 was 114 pupils. Its present facilities consist of three permanent classrooms and limited ancillary accommodation. The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the management authorities of the school for an extension consisting of two classrooms, a general purpose room and appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the <Col N="619" /> funds allocated by the Government to the building programmes at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled the Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is our intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress of individual projects, including the one at Ballyclerihan, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes at the conclusion of the forthcoming budgetary process.</P>
    <P>I have some personal knowledge of the situation mentioned by the Deputy. I am aware that the area has been rezoned and is earmarked for rapid expansion. I will certainly bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the appropriate staff in the Department and also directly to the attention of the Minister tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister of State may not need to get up on his feet again. He could give the same answer to me by simply changing the name of the school. I have been listening to that type of answer for the past 12 months by way of Dáil replies. The replies from the Department to parliamentary questions are outrageous. The Minister of State, who has been very vocal on both sides of the House, should direct his Department to give answers to the questions asked, regardless of whether they are good or bad. We do not want the political jargon and the spin. The way they spell it out reminds me of a race meeting. There is no thought given to replies in the Department, and it will not even answer a letter. That is not right and the Minister of State should deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I came here tonight to speak about Ardagh national school, which applied for funding for renovation and development works in June 1999. Two and a half years later, nothing has happened and the condition of the school has deteriorated even further in that time. The school includes a prefab which is over 17 years old and has no toilets or running water. It is understood that prefabs of this age contain asbestos. Children must cross the yard from one part of the school to another in all types of weather to use the public toilets. That is not right.</P>
      <P>This is the year 2001, not 1901. The staff of the school have worked very hard. The principal, Noreen Moore, and the chairman of the board, Archdeacon Francis Lynn, have worked under difficult circumstances. This is a three teacher school. It has a resource teacher and a learning support teacher, as well as a part-time secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> The conditions in the school are unacceptable. I ask the Minister of State to sanction funding for the works at the school, which were at tender stage. The school expected the announcement to be made earlier this year or in June, July, August or September. They thought they would be in the new school by Christmas, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I am aware there have been major cutbacks in the Department, one of the main losers in terms of the cutbacks. It must have engaged in overspending. From the reply I got from the Department last week, it appears the money has been spent on spin doctors and programme managers, not on schools. It is wrong that the children and staff in this school have to work in such terrible conditions. I appeal to the Minister of State to do the decent thing and sanction this extension immediately for the sake of the children, the principal, Noreen Moore, the chairman of the board, Archdeacon Francis Lynn, and the staff. Every day Councillor Eddie Staunton telephones me to ask what is happening.</P>
    <P>For the past four to five years Ministers have been asking for projects on which to spend money. This school has worked under difficult circumstances and I ask the Minister of State to approve this funding.</P>

We have had the problem for a considerable time and I and other Members have raised the difficulties being experienced by the Forensic Science Laboratory in the past by way of parliamentary questions to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came to office on the much abused slogan of zero tolerance. We now know the State forensic laboratory is overburdened <Col N="622" /> with work and there is an increasing backlog of criminal prosecutions and cases awaiting the outcome of essential testing which must be undertaken in the laboratory. A report by Deloitte &amp; Touche eight months ago recognised the need for additional staff. It recommended that 14 extra technical and professional staff be taken on at the laboratories. To date, no staff has been recruited. The position remains that the backlog continues to accumulate. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or his Department somewhat lamely suggest that the problem derives solely from work the laboratory has had to undertake in relation to foot and mouth disease. There were problems in this area prior to the foot and mouth epidemic which hit Great Britain and caused so much concern and worry in this House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain the reason the additional staff recommended by the consultants have not yet been recruited, other recommendations made by Deloitte and Touche have been ignored and, in particular, the Minister, in pursuit of his obligations as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has not obtained sanction from the Minister for Finance to allow the recruitment of staff.</P>
    <P>It is a false economy not to recruit staff in this area. It places at risk the efficient workings of our criminal justice system, unnecessarily delays the bringing of prosecutions through the courts and leaves the victims of crime in a state of uncertainty and concern as to whether the crimes to which they were subject will come before the courts. They are also left worried as to the length of time elapsing between the commission of a crime and the date at which they are called into court to give evidence.</P>
    <P>This must give rise to genuine concern that the delay in undertaking essential laboratory works will ultimately render it impossible to proceed to court on foot of evidence obtained at crime scenes so as to facilitate a successful prosecution being brought against those responsible for criminal acts. The Minister is in dereliction of his duties in allowing matters to develop to the extent that 5,000 criminal cases are now held up due to shortages in the State laboratories. I call on the Minister to address the matter with great urgency and explain to the House the reason for the delay in implementing the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to update the House on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Forensic Science Laboratory plays a very important role in the criminal justice system. The laboratory operates in a supporting role to the Garda Síochána in the forensic evaluation of evidence gathered by the <Col N="623" /> Garda in relation to all types of crimes, including murder, rape, serious assaults and drug seizures.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the workload of the Forensic Science Laboratory has been on the increase in recent years due in no small measure to the success of the Garda Síochána in targeting and prosecuting certain types of crime. This year the increase has been considerable.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage and Garda operations such as Dóchas and Cleanstreet have resulted in significant drug seizures and continue to prove effective in targeting on-street drug dealing. These operations, in addition to the dramatic increase in referrals to the laboratory of suspect cattle ear tags for examination &ndash; about 2,000 to date this year &ndash; have undoubtedly led to an increase in the workload of the Forensic Science Laboratory. The vast majority of cases awaiting examination are those relating to drug seizures.</P>
    <P>A review of the operation, workload and career structure of the laboratory was recently completed by management consultants. In their report the consultants made a number of recommendations, including procedural changes in the laboratory to improve efficiency and the recruitment of additional staff. The question of <Col N="624" /> additional staffing resources for the laboratory to deal with the increase in workload is being discussed by my Department with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The quality of the forensic evaluation and evidence provided by the Forensic Science Laboratory to the courts has always been held in high esteem and it is my intention to take measures to ensure this will continue and that no prosecutions will be dropped or cases collapse due to delays in the processing of evidence by the laboratory.</P>
    <P>During my period in office the Government has increased the resources of the laboratory significantly. For example, the funding for the laboratory has increased from £1.4 million in 1996 to over £2.2 million this year. Staffing levels have also increased. There were 41.5 staff serving in the laboratory in 1996, now there are 50. These increases in staff and resources were achieved to deal with the increases in workload during that period.</P>
    <P>I stress that, in relation to the processing of evidence, the management of the laboratory has instituted a procedure whereby cases in which management is notified that the result is urgently required are expedited.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is under my responsibility that the necessary authorisation is provided which allows non-EEA workers to take up employment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The essence of the work permit scheme is that it is a vacancy driven scheme; the initiative must be taken by the employer to obtain the permit prior to entry into the State by the worker. The application must relate to a specific job and to a named individual. The permits, which are usually issued for one year with the possibility of renewal, are specifically intended to relate to posts that cannot be filled by Irish or other EU-EEA nationals. Employers who apply for work permits are required to establish that it has not been possible, in spite of reasonable efforts being made, for example contacting FÁS, to fill the vacancy from Ireland or other EU-EEA member states. The onus is on employers to satisfy themselves as to the employee's skills, qualifications and suitability. It also means that the employer is actually prepared to take on the person concerned and they are, therefore, less likely to have to seek State benefits.</P>
      <P>To issue a permit directly to an employee would probably mean that the State would have to put in place arrangements to verify the qualifications and suitability of the person applying. This would be like a green card system used for longer-term or permanent immigration elsewhere. This would impose a considerable administrative burden and would certainly be much slower than the current system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot force an employer and employee to stay together but I am concerned to ensure that the most appropriate employee is identified in the first instance. My Department facilitates requests from subsequent employers for a second, new permit when employees move. However, if this should become the norm, the Deputy will appreciate that it could send a signal that an aspiring immigrant should accept any offer simply to get into Ireland as they could then simply walk away from it. The nature of the workforce which <Col N="626" /> might emerge over time from this approach might well differ radically from that desired. However, a balance is desirable and clearly this issue will have to be considered as part of our overall review of policy and practice.</P>

      <P>The potential dangers posed to persons from exposure to asbestos fibres are well recognised and it is essential that workers are protected against the risk of such a situation arising at their place of work.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, impose duties on employers and employees to ensure that the health and safety of workers who may be affected by a work activity are protected. In addition, the removal of asbestos or materials containing asbestos comes within the scope of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 2001.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, comprehensive European Union-derived legislation exists for the protection of workers under the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, as amended in 1993 and 2000. The regulations apply to all work which exposes persons to risks arising from the inhalation of asbestos fibres. The regulations are designed to provide protection to those workers involved in activities which may lead to possible exposure to asbestos fibres. Examples of such activities include removal of asbestos-containing materials, demolition and construction work or maintenance.</P>
      <P>These regulations are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, which is an independent body under the auspices of my Department. To enhance compliance with existing legislation the authority is committed to increasing further asbestos-related inspections during 2002.</P>
      <P>Ireland is involved at a European level in the development of a new asbestos (worker protection) directive. The proposed directive will provide for specific requirements to ensure the protection of high-risk workers against asbestos fibres exposure. In addition, this directive will reduce further the existing exposure limits so as to enhance the protection of workers. Ireland strongly supports and welcomes this proposal which will further assist in the protection of those workers most at risk from exposure to asbestos fibres while performing their work activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The authority is fully committed to providing the fullest protection to our workers against exposure to asbestos and thus reduce the possibility of deleterious health effects developing in our workers in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent closures and job losses in north County Dublin are disappointing and I am aware that it is a distressing and disruptive time for the people who are being made redundant. Recognising that north Dublin is going through a difficult period in terms of job losses, I recently announced the establishment of the north Dublin training and job placement initiative. This initiative will bring together FÁS, the local area partnership, local authority, the county enterprise board and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that people losing their jobs are fully appraised of employment, training and business opportunities.</P>
      <P>However, in spite of a slowdown in inward investment activity, particularly in the ICT sector since early this year, and the further impact of the tragic events of 11 September, the prognosis for the future is healthier than circumstances might suggest. For example, IDA Ireland's pipeline of projects under discussion includes a significant number of new foreign direct investment projects or expansions from clients already located here. Also, although Gateway announced its intention to close its Dublin operation in August with a loss of 900 jobs, the company was immediately contacted by approximately 160 employers, interested in hiring Gateway staff. I understand that the current situation is that the majority of the former employees have now been offered alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Among IDA pipeline projects are, the construction of Bristol Myers Squib facility in Blanchardstown where 430 new jobs are to be created; a $300 million expansion by Lucent at Blanchardstown industrial estate bringing total employment up to 800 people; and an expansion by Sonopress of its reservation facility at Dublin airport bringing its workforce of 1,100 together in one location. IDA Ireland is also involved in industrial property support activities in Dublin, such as initiation of planning on a 120 acre greenfield site at Belcamp adjacent to Clonshaugh industrial estate, extensive site development works at the national digital park, Citywest, and site development works on the South County business park in Leopardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indigenous industry is a major provider of local employment opportunities both direct and <Col N="628" /> indirect. Enterprise Ireland is actively working to ameliorate the effects on local communities of downsizing and company closures by identifying new opportunities for enterprise development and working with new promoters to build viable projects. In addition to providing grant support to companies in Dublin north city and county, Enterprise Ireland has grant aided community enterprise centres in north Dublin at Balbriggan, Darndale, Coolock, Blanchardstown and North King Street.</P>
    <P>At micro-enterprise level, the Fingal County Enterprise Board, which is responsible for local development in north County Dublin, has put in place specific information programmes targeted at the employees of companies who have recently announced redundancies. In common with the other 34 city and county enterprise boards which cover the entire country, Fingal gives assistance for feasibility studies, employment and capital expenditure to enterprises employing ten people or less, as well as actively promoting entrepreneurship through education and training programmes. Enterprise Ireland is a member of the Fingal County Enterprise Board and the Fingal County Enterprise Board evaluation committee. Both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are members of the Fingal County Development Board, which is preparing a draft strategic plan for the Fingal area.</P>

The Department has received preliminary advice from the office of the Attorney General and this suggests there are doubts that &ldquo;gifting schemes&rdquo; come within the definition of pyramid selling schemes as provided for in section 1(1) of the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980. These consultations between my Department and the office of the Attorney General are continuing.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question on 10 October 2001, the Garda has taken the view that such schemes are not covered by the Act of 1980.

      <P>FÁS has extensive experience in retraining workers who are threatened with or affected by redundancy. Its response is based on providing immediate assistance and support to those affected.</P>
      <P>The support provided typically involves engaging in the first instance in intensive interviews with workers to outline the range of supports and services available from FÁS.

      <P>FÁS's existing approach is an effective one.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 174 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment figures for 2001, which are based on the preliminary figures of the Forfás annual employment survey, will not be available until the end of the year. It is very difficult to forecast at this stage what the effect of the current downturn may be on employment numbers. The IDA knows that there are more jobs at risk than normal and this will continue until there are clear <Col N="632" /> signs of a sustained recovery in the US and globally. Nevertheless, employment growth continues in some companies and sectors and the IDA believes it will end 2001 with as many people employed in IDA supported companies as at the end of 2000. This means that the exceptional gains of more than 16,000 jobs in overseas companies last year will be retained.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland considers that, in balancing out jobs created and jobs lost by indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services firms, there should be a small increase, perhaps 1,000 or thereabouts, in the numbers at work in those firms.</P>
    <P>Given the current climate, the development agencies have increased the intensity of their relationships with clients to ensure that the impact of the recent downturn is minimised. Where there have been closures of layoffs, IDA and Enterprise Ireland are working closely with the companies and with FÁS to assist the people involved in finding other employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>However, despite the downturn in world economic activity, world class ICT companies with significant activities in Ireland have assured the IDA of their immense confidence in the country, its positive business environment and the flexibility with which they can operate here. If, as a country, we can maintain our competitiveness and build skills and infrastructure needed for the knowledge economy, Ireland will be well placed to win a disproportionate share of the next wave of their knowledge-intensive investments.</P>
    <P>In this regard, steps taken in recent years will stand to the IDA in competing for new investments. In particular, the Science Foundation Ireland initiatives and programme of research for third level initiative in the research areas and the broadband developments driven by Government have been of special value. Similarly, the range of skills initiatives has been highly effective in persuading potential investors that Ireland can cater better for prospective needs than most other countries.</P>
    <P>The implementation of infrastructural investments under the NDP over the next few years will also be critical. The continued reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax and its assured long-term nature will be a very significant contributor to the attractiveness of Ireland to many new investors in the next few years.</P>

      <P>The issue the Deputy has raised is primarily a day-to-day mat<Col N="633" /> ter for the industrial development agencies. However, I will outline the key responses of the two main agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, to the changing economic environment and the challenges facing their clients.</P>
      <P>Regarding indigenous industry, given the changed market conditions, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging suppliers to diversify into other market segments through the identification of opportunities in the medical devices and healthcare sector. Also, a number of inward buyer missions and supplier days have been organised with new potential customers.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland also continues to work with its clients to increase and diversify their exports with a view to ensuring sustainable employment. The agency is also working in conjunction with my Department to develop a network of venture capital funds. The funds will have a specific emphasis on regional projects and early phase start-ups where there is a serious lack of available funding.</P>
      <P>In the area of foreign direct investment, the IDA believes there are real prospects of winning valuable new investments over the next six to 12 months, but it must also be said that there seems to be an unusual degree of investor uncertainty in the US just now which may be ascribed to the events of 11 September. The health care, pharmaceutical and international services sectors seem to offer the best prospects in the short term.</P>
      <P>Employment growth continues in some companies and sectors and the IDA believes that it will end 2001 with as many people employed in IDA supported companies as at the and of 2000. Where there have been closures or layoffs, it has been made clear to the IDA that, for the most part, these were attributable to sectoral and global difficulties and not to problems inherent in the Irish economy. Steps taken in recent years will stand to the IDA in competing for new investments which will result in sustainable employment. The timely implementation of infrastructural investments under the national development plan in the next few years will also be critical. The continued reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax and its assured long-term nature will be a very significant contributor to the attractiveness of Ireland to many new investors in the next few years.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I assure the Deputy that the IDA is working closely with the companies who have suffered job losses and with FÁS to assist the people involved in finding other employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 114, 120, 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>We are fully aware that insurance costs have increased dramatically during the past year. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include High Court decisions which required insurers to strengthen reserves for claims arising in past years and the global impact of 11 September on international insurers and re-insurers. Under EU law we cannot intervene in matters of pricing or underwriting of insurance.</P>
      <P>Research has shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland because compensation awards are also high. Compensation for loss of income and medical expenses arising from personal injury is paid through the private insurance system rather than through the social welfare and health systems as in other European countries. The costs of the delivery of insurance compensation runs at approximately 40% of the total cost of claims.</P>
      <P>The objective of the proposed Personal Injuries Assessment Board is to reduce these latter costs so that insurance costs may also be reduced. The implementation group is expected to report at the end of the year as to how the PIAB may be put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. It is open to any business to increase their prices if it wants to do so, and changes in prices occur for various reasons and at different times during the trading year. In a competitive environment this is perfectly understandable.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a much better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price control legislation which would require that all price adjustments for all products be approved in advance. The introduction of the euro does not change this fact.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of traders want to behave honourably and fairly during the changeover to the euro. Some unscrupulous traders may seek to use the introduction of the euro as an opportunity to introduce unwarranted price increases. However, the retail market especially is highly competitive and I believe the market will punish those who seek to take advantage of the changeover in this way. Consumers need to realise the power they have if they feel they are not being treated fairly, and that is simply to take their business elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The large numbers of traders who have already signed up to the codes of practice on dual display of prices are entitled to display a special logo approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to carry out the changeover fairly. These traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to demonstrate to their customers that they have made a commitment not to seek unfair advantage from the changeover. I encourage consumers to shop where they see this logo displayed. I also strongly urge retailers who have not yet done so to contact their trade association or the Director of Consumer Affairs without further delay and sign up to one of the codes of practice on dual display of prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 107, 112, 117 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing by an authorised officer appointed by me under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Under section 19, I am empowered to undertake an examination of a company's books and documents where I am of the opinion that there are circumstances suggesting that it is necessary to examine the books and documents with a view to determining whether an inspector should be appointed to conduct an investigation of the company, or where any actual or proposed act or omission of, or on behalf of, the company is unlawful, or for a number of related reasons.</P>
      <P>The companies under examination are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Kentford Securities Limited.</P>
      <P>The examinations of Celtic Helicopters Limited and Kentford Securities Limited are well advanced. I expect to receive the reports on these two companies before the end of this year. I expect to receive reports on the remaining three companies in the first half of 2002.</P>
      <P>The Companies Acts specifically provide that I may not publish the results of investigations without the prior consent in writing of the body which has been subject to examination under section 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, sets out the circumstances in which the information obtained under section 19 may be disclosed. For example, the information may be disclosed where <Col N="637" /> this is necessary for further investigation or for the purposes of a prosecution, for the purpose of taking action to disqualify a person from acting as an officer of a company, for assessing a person's tax liability, in order to assist a tribunal of inquiry or where the information would assist the work of certain specified competent authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that the High Court may appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company on the application of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if the Court is satisfied that there are, <i>inter alia</i>, circumstances suggesting fraud or unlawful activity.</P>
    <P>Three investigations are ongoing under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are National Irish Bank Limited, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
    <P>Following receipt in June 1999 of the report of the authorised officer appointed by me under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, to examine the books of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, I petitioned the High Court for the appointment of inspectors to that company under section 8 of the 1990 Act. The petition, which was heard on 22 September 1999, resulted in the appointment initially of three High Court inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of the company. There are four inspectors undertaking the investigation.</P>
    <P>I understand that the inspectors appointed to both Ansbacher and the NIB companies are likely to report to the High Court either towards the end of this year or early next year.</P>
    <P>The disposition of reports prepared by inspectors appointed by the High Court is a matter for the Court. I earnestly hope that the High Court will order publication of the reports in due course.</P>
    <P>Four inquiries under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, undertaken by authorised officers appointed by me, have been completed to date. The companies concerned were Garuda Limited, the report on which was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in June 1999; Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the report on which led to the appointment of inspectors by the High Court; IIB &ndash; Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited, the report on which was referred to the High Court inspectors investigating Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited; and Faxhill Homes Limited.</P>
    <P>In the case of Faxhill Homes Limited, summary prosecutions were instituted by me against the company and against its directors and auditor. The company and its directors were convicted in May this year of a number of breaches of the Companies Acts. The company was fined £450, 570, with one director fined £250, 317, and the second director being given the benefit of the Probation Act. Costs of £10,000, 12,700, were awarded to the State. In October last, the company's auditor was convicted of three offences and fined £600, 760, with £1,500, 1,900, costs awarded to the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> An investigation was undertaken into Bula Resources (Holdings) plc under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990. The report was published in July 1998 and was also referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Criminal Asses Bureau.</P>
    <P>An investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, into National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited. The report on this was referred to the High Court inspectors investigating the affairs of that company.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department amount to £6.264 million, 7.954 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>Most of this £6.264 million, 7.954 million, derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &ndash; £3.385 million, 4.298 million, in respect of the investigations into the two NIB companies and £1.9 million, 2.4 million, in respect of the investigation into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
    <P>Of the balance, the principal areas of expenditure arose in respect of the investigations of Bula Resources (Holdings) plc &ndash; £204,000, 259,000, Faxhill Homes Limited &ndash; £180,000, 228,553, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited &ndash; £128,000, 162,526, Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (Ilac Centre) Limited &ndash; £239,000, 303,467, and £170,000, 215,855, in respect of the State's portion of the costs of liquidating the group of companies associated with the Clonmannon retirement village.</P>
    <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors have completed their investigations.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990, the High Court may direct that a person convicted on indictment for an offence prosecuted as a result of the investigation or ordered to pay damages may be required to repay some or all of the costs of the investigation. Furthermore, companies dealt with in an inspector's report may be required to defray up to £100,000, 127,000, of the cost of the investigation. This amount is being increased to £250,000, 317,435, under the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>There is no provision at present for the recoupment of costs in respect of section 19 investigations. This is being amended under the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, which provides that the court may, on the application of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, direct that a company subject to examination under section 19 may be liable, to such extent as the court may direct, to repay the director the expenses of and incidental to the examination.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice where a company is being prosecuted for a breach of the Companies Acts to <Col N="639" /> seek the recovery of costs. In the case of Faxhill mentioned previously, costs of £11,500, 14,602, were awarded to the State.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will be formally established on 28 November 2001 with Mr. Paul Appleby as director. The director will replace the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in all respects regarding the enforcement of company law, including the investigation of company law offences, except in regard to the ongoing work of the authorised officer who will continue to carry out his investigations into five companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, that I have referred to previously.</P>

      <P>In July of this year a survey undertaken by the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign indicated that there were still a large number of SMEs which had made few preparations for the euro changeover. A more recent survey undertaken in October of this year indicates a considerably improved situation in the level of preparations by SMEs for the euro currency regime.</P>
      <P>The survey, based on more than 1,000 completed questionnaires, found that, for the economy in general, 81% of firms had either undertaken or are undertaking forward planning activities, while for those firms with 21 to 50 employees the corresponding figure is 96%. For those very small firms of one to ten employees the corresponding figure is approximately 76%.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the improved level of response, the Forfás business awareness campaign will remain active until 1 January 2002, and there are still a number of information meetings programmed for November throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This improved level of preparedness of SMEs as demonstrated by the Forfás survey indicates that the small business community is taking the appropriate action to remedy any previous shortcomings perceived in this regard. I have no doubt that the level of preparedness of the SME sector will continue to improve until the changeover on 1 January 2001.</P>

The State agencies continue to work closely with the companies involved, to address the difficulties arising for them and to assist the people being made redundant in finding other employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Arising from the downturn in the global economy, especially in the US economy, we have seen a slowdown in inward investment activity since early this year, especially in the ICT sector. The tragic events of 11 September exacerbated the situation, especially in areas such as aerospace and tourism services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while it must be said that there seems to be an unusual degree of investor uncertainty in the US just now, the situation is not entirely bleak. The IDA's pipeline of projects under discussion is healthier than circumstances might suggest with a number of significant new projects or expansions from clients already located here. There are good prospects of winning valuable new investments over the next six to 12 months. Also, major investments are proceeding, such as the Wyeth Medica biopharma plant, costing over $1 billion, in Grange Castle, Clondalkin, County Dublin, and agencies are pressing ahead with plans for major business and technology parks in regional centres such as Let<Col N="641" /> terkenny, Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Athlone and Waterford, as well as for further advance factories-offices in other centres.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to forecast at this stage what the effect of the current downturn may be on employment numbers in the next year. We know there are more jobs at risk than normal and this will continue until there are clear signs of a sustained recovered in the US and globally. Nevertheless, employment growth continues in some companies and sectors.</P>
    <P>In recent months, the State development agencies have intensified their relationships with client companies in a concerted effort to find solutions to problems encountered.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that recent closures or layoffs are not, for the most part, attributable to problems inherent in the Irish economy. Key world class ICT companies with significant activities here have assured us of their confidence in the country and its positive business environment. If we can maintain Ireland's competitiveness and continue to address issues such as skills and infrastructure, we will be well positioned not only to take advantage of the recovery in the global economy when it occurs but also to win a disproportionate share of the next wave of knowledge-intensive investments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>EU law does not permit us to intervene in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is due to report to me at the end of this year on a number of issues, including the relationship between the motor insurance premiums charged to particular risk groups, such as young men, and the claims experience of such groups. We will consider urgently the recommendations of the board when they have been received and analysed by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research has shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland because compensation awards are high. Compensation for loss of income and for medical expenses arising from personal injury is paid for through the private insurance system rather than through the social welfare and health systems as in other European countries. Of the <Col N="642" /> total cost of personal injury claims, the costs of delivery of compensation accounts for approximately 40%.</P>
    <P>The objective of the proposed Personal Injuries Assessment Board is to reduce these latter costs so that insurance costs may also be reduced. An implementation group is expected to report at the end of the year as to how the PIAB may be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The principal function of the expert group is to provide expert analysis on existing and forecasted skills needs in the economy. The group is independent in regard to its findings, conclusions and recommendations. The group reports on a periodic basis and regularly updates its analyses of the labour market and associated skills requirements. It has produced three major reports to date. The group's third report, published in July 2001, contains details of progress made on the recommendations contained in previous reports.</P>
      <P>In consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, I have recently issued a new mandate to the group providing for its continued existence for the next three years. Under its new mandate the expert group will continue with its practice of updating its findings in light of prevailing and forecasted conditions. I am providing resources from the national training fund to strengthen the group's analytical capacity in this area.</P>
      <P>I understand that the ten recommendations referred to by the Deputy relate to those made by the group in its third report in respect of the information and communications technology, ICT, sector. It is important to note that the recommendations of the group were framed in the knowledge that there had been a downturn in the IT sector globally, and in the US in particular. However, the recent tragic events of 11 September and their aftermath have clearly created further uncertainty for the IT sector.</P>
      <P>I understand that the expert group intends to review the assumptions underlying its recommendation on IT, having regard to the latest developments. The group also intends review its projections for construction skills in light of the latest developments in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I appointed the new FÁS board for a five year term I was conscious of the general view that current labour market conditions are likely to persist over the medium term. It is also unquestionable that if we are to maintain our economic and employment performance over the longer term, continuous up-skilling of people both in and seeking employment will have to become the norm. I also believe that tackling labour shortages and increasing skill levels is not just an economic challenge, it also presents us with a social opportunity to tackle long-term unemployment and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Government's and FÁS's strategic response to existing and predicted trends should be twofold &ndash; to mobilise labour supply from all available sources, through matching, training and integration and, at the same time, to continuously upgrade the skills and competencies of the workforce and those seeking employment.</P>
      <P>Specific issues which I have asked FÁS to take into account include strengthening the role of the employment service, as the front line in the FÁS strategy towards filling vacancies or referring job seekers to suitable training; increasing female participation where there remains considerable scope; encouraging older people to remain in or re-enter the workforce; eliminating long-term unemployment, which remains the Government's aim; in relation to people with disabilities, FÁS's new role here will seek to provide access to more and better jobs; in relation to youth and low skilled employment, one of the downsides of the recent job creation levels is that it can encourage young people to leave education early and take up low skilled employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked FÁS to review its training services for young people and its links to the education system to address this issue and, in relation to immigration, I have stressed to FÁS that our primary objective must be to secure higher participation rates and to use the present employment opportunities to tackle disadvantage. Our efforts to encourage foreign workers to come here must be targeted at the skills and jobs which cannot be sourced from home and we need to be able to adjust flexibly to changing circumstances. I should add that at a policy level I have been looking at how we can flexibly adjust the work permit scheme to prevailing labour market conditions. I expect to be in a position in the very near future to announce new arrangements for processing and deciding on applications for work permits <Col N="646" /> which will take full account of the changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Any review of future strategy has to take account of the major levels of activity under the community employment programme. Community employment accounts for half of the FÁS budget of £650 million and half of their annual clients. Community employment schemes have made a very positive contribution to the quality of life, not just of those participating on them, but also to the wider communities which benefited from the services provided.</P>
    <P>Participation levels on community employment are gradually being reduced reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. Mainstreaming involves the transfer of community employment funds for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for those services.</P>
    <P>The valuable contribution which active labour market programmes such as community employment make to persons experiencing long-term unemployment and to community services is fully recognised and the labour market needs of these groups will continue to be supported through community employment and other initiatives such as the social economy programme and the job initiative programme for as long as appropriate. However, the dramatic improvement in the levels of long-term unemployment in recent years, and the demand levels for workers in the economy, mean that the pool of potential community employment workers is inexorably diminishing fore very good reasons. Accordingly, essential community services may in future require to be provided by other means.</P>
    <P>In considering eligibility for future participation in community employment I have been very conscious of the particular needs of older participants. This is especially the case in parts of the country where there may not be alternative sources of employment. I was very happy to announce more flexible arrangements for such persons last August.</P>
    <P>There are different challenges facing the labour market in the short and medium term. There are still significant vacancies to be filled in the economy, while the present uncertainty and the threat of increased unemployment means that we will have to engage those losing their jobs so that they can quickly find new ones. With a return to economic growth and employment in the medium term, the challenges will be to mobilise labour supply and to provide the skills to meet the needs of the economy. In both scenarios FÁS has a major input and will be required to operate flexibly to meet the changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>Considerable support has been provided to the timber industry by Enterprise Ireland in relation to research, development and marketing. Over £5 million has been approved for the industry in research and development grants during the last six years. The support is going to projects such as timber drying, process automation, development of timber frame components and manufacturing systems, and, the creation of value added products such as flooring, quality fencing and innovative panel products. As a result, companies are increasing their processing efficiency yields and this, together with the value added products, has helped the industry to become more competitive and market focused. In addition, Enterprise Ireland's London office has been actively involved in developing a strong image for Irish timber. Considerable quantities of sawn timber are exported to the UK.</P>
      <P>COFORD, the national council for forest research and development, is also involved in product development and marketing under the Productive Sector Operational Programme 2000-2006 of the national development plan. COFORD has allocated over £2.3 million to product and process development within the timber processing sector.</P>
      <P>I established the timber industry development group last year to make recommendations for the optimum development of the timber industry and to identify the important economic, marketing, technical and infrastructure issues impacting on the industry. I expect the group will be reporting to me shortly. I am already aware that the need for the industry to become even more market focused and develop more value added products have been identified as two of the major challenges facing the industry in the short term. Enterprise Ireland will work closely with the industry in addressing these challenges.</P>

      <P>To facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from non-EEA countries for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly acute, a working visa and work authorisation scheme was introduced last year. This <Col N="648" /> fast track scheme makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and consulates. Registered nurses are among the categories of professionals which were designated for inclusion under this scheme. The new scheme does not replace the existing work permit scheme, which is still available to employers, but it is a faster alternative. In the period from June 2000 up to the end of August 2001, a total of 1,819 working visas/work authorisations were issued for nurses. I am advised that in general the turnaround time for the issue of a working visa-working authorisation is less than two weeks.</P>

      <P>The Government is pleased at the outcome of the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha last week. The final declaration agreed at the meeting provides for the launch of a new round of multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations across a broad range of trade related issues. The negotiations will begin as soon as possible and are scheduled to conclude by 2005.</P>
      <P>The Government is particularly pleased that the conference paid close attention to the needs and concerns of the developing country members of the WTO and included within the future work programme those issues which developing countries wish to see addressed. I am confident that as the work programme proceeds, that developing countries influence in the multilateral trading environment will develop and intensify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Doha declaration in relation to the TRIPS Agreement and public health was, in my opinion, a particularly fine achievement by the conference and reflects the proper balance in this area between patent protection and legitimate access to medicines. The work programme agreed in the Doha declaration also covers such issues as the operation and mechanisms of the WTO, technical co-operation and capacity building for developing countries, implementation concerns of developing countries, and special and differential treatment for developing countries. The title which is now being used for the new round, &ldquo;The <Col N="650" /> Doha Development Agenda&rdquo;, is well justified and appropriate.</P>

      <P>The importance of older people in the workforce will grow in coming years with the population under 25 set to fall while the numbers in the older age groups are forecast to rise. Given these trends, it is prudent to look at ways of encouraging older people, embracing retired persons and women in the home, who wish to do so, to return to the workforce, as well as assisting older unemployed in their transition to employment.</P>
      <P>Government policy aimed at reducing the overall tax burden on labour, the reform of the tax system, and the individualisation of the standard rate tax band, all serve to increase the incentive to persons returning to work. This policy will act as an incentive for older people to continue working, for women returners and older unemployed to seek and take up a job and for retired persons to return to the workforce, particularly those who may wish to work part-time to supplement their income.</P>
      <P>As part of further initiatives in this area, I am considering a number of matters in the context of both short-term and long-term agendas for action. The type of areas under current consideration are those which focus on initiatives that promote opportunities, match people with vacancies and address the twin issues of training and retraining. FÁS has a role to play here and I will be asking it to examine the further steps that can be taken to afford older persons appropriate opportunities to take up suitable vacancies, and in exploring possibilities to hold discussions with employer organisations about those issues. Longer term issues in the area of pensions, taxation and benefits, and their interaction and impact on the decisions of older workers, will also be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by, and obtainable directly from, the authority. I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 19 construction related fatalities in 2000 while 20 construction related fatal accidents have been reported to date in 2001. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the authority for 2000 is 734. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the Authority for 2001 is 805.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code which is enforced in a proactive manner by the Health and Safety Authority. In this regard, the additional financial and staffing resources, which I have secured for the authority in recent years, are put to particular effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness raising activities. However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in that sector, a continuance of a partnership approach to safety, as embodied by the construction safety partnership, CSP, is crucial. The CSP is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and other relevant Departments-agencies.</P>
      <P>In November 2000, the CSP produced a detailed three year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan includes measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas including the initiation of a safety representatives pilot project which is a highly commendable joint ICTU-CIF project. Other areas of progress include the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, increased inspection by the Health and Safety <Col N="652" /> Authority, the establishment of a Joint ICTU-CIF safety council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities and, most recently, the development of amendments to the construction regulations.</P>
    <P>These legislative amendments, which I have now signed into law, will take effect from 1 January next year. They are extremely significant in that they will introduce, for the first time, the concepts of &ldquo;mandatory safety training&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory safety representation&rdquo; while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. Further amendments to regulations are also being explored under the auspices of the CSP. In addition, legislative proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, are currently being developed at departmental level. Pertinent issues of offences and penalties will be addressed in this context, with a view to strengthening those provisions. A strengthened and updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will of course be of benefit to all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the revised construction regulations, the State continues to play its role in the effort to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector, through the provision of a strong legislative base and the provision of the associated training, advisory, inspection and enforcement services. I am confident that both sides of industry will also continue to respond in a positive manner in fulfilling their particular responsibilities and duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 119 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dignity in the workplace charter, which I publicly launched on 23 October 2001, originates from a recommendation of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying. The charter has been endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Construction Industry Federation. Each of these organisations is supporting <Col N="653" /> the charter by promoting its adoption by their constituent members and by facilitating its distribution amongst their members. This endorsement gives the charter much impact and credibility not least because of the wide spectrum of interests which they collectively represent. The charter is also available for, and equally applicable to, enterprises which are not associated with any of the above organisations.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the dignity in the workplace charter is not a statutory requirement on an employer. There is, therefore, no system in place whereby employers &ldquo;register&rdquo; for the charter. I have, however, been informed by the Health and Safety Authority, which is the central co-ordinating State agency overseeing the implementation of the task force recommendations, that, to date, it has distributed over 3,000 copies of the charter. The authority anticipates that a high level of demand for copies of the charter will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the dignity in the workplace charter is to facilitate the management and the staff of any and every employment in the country to make a public commitment to provide a workplace free of bullying and to develop policies and procedures which underpin the principles and objectives of this charter. The real value of this charter is that it is as relevant to the large multinational company as it is to the micro-enterprise. The charter is only one element of the strategy to prevent workplace bullying. The task force report recommended a series of actions that should be taken at both the level of the State and of the individual enterprise.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations requiring State action include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the introduction of three codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying within the HSA.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee, which has already been established, has a key role in co-ordinating and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations relating to the State's role in responding to workplace bullying, including the three codes of practice. The committee has representation from the main State agencies and bodies dealing with workplace equality, welfare and labour relations issues, as well as IBEC and the ICTU. In addition, the Health and Safety Authority has set up a bullying response unit to deal with queries from businesses, interested groups and members of the public.</P>
    <P>While the adoption of the charter is an important public commitment by an enterprise to prevent and address workplace bullying, enterprises must also have in place appropriate anti-bullying policies to deal with allegations of workplace bullying. The codes of practice on bullying and harassment which are at present <Col N="654" /> being finalised by the Health and Safety Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Equality Authority will greatly assist employers and managers by providing guidance on putting in place such policies. The codes will also be a valuable reference point for the State agencies charged with offering advice and assistance. I expect to be in a position to make a public announcement on these codes before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Workplace bullying will, ultimately, be most effectively prevented by actions taken at enterprise level. With the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the establishment of the bullying response unit within the authority and the development of the three codes of practice, the State will have put in place an appropriate framework and structures to assist enterprises in both preventing and addressing the problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland does not have a formal quota-based migration policy with country or sectoral quotas. The admission of non-EEA personnel is largely market led. The onus is placed on employers to <Col N="655" /> show that no EEA persons were available and willing to do the job. The work permit scheme is unrestricted in terms of the categories or skills of workers to whom applications can be submitted. The number of work permits granted under the scheme has increased substantially in recent years and the number of permits issued in 2001 to date is in excess of 32,000.</P>
    <P>The working visa-work authorisation scheme has been operating now since June 2000 and in the period up to the end of August 2001 a total of 3,870 permits have been issued for high skilled workers in the IT, construction and nursing professions.</P>
    <P>In light of recent setbacks in the economy and the rising level of domestic unemployment I am concerned that applications for work permits are continuing to increase. The average number of applications per week received over the past eight weeks was in excess of 1,200. I will shortly announce modification to the policy for issuing work permits in order to reflect the changing labour market environment.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, was a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities, which were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the company is in liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. The company is also under investigation by the serious fraud office in the UK. The UK does not operate a &ldquo;no failures&rdquo; policy in relation to financial institutions. It has, however, a safety net in the form of the policyholders protection fund to compensate policyholders of failed insurance undertakings who meet certain criteria. The UK authorities have indicated that Irish private policyholders are likely to qualify for protection &ndash; of 90% &ndash; under the UK Policyholder Protection Act. While the UK authorities have undertaken to examine the application of the existing law governing the UK policyholders protection fund to Irish policyholders, it seems unlikely that corporate policyholders will qualify for protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been raised at EU level by Ireland, with proposals that the cross-border consequences of insurance failures should be regulated. While this will not alleviate the problems arising, in the Independent case, it will address similar problems arising in the future. I fully <Col N="656" /> appreciate the difficulties being faced by some policyholders here, and am very concerned that any company would face closure, because of the failure of Independent Insurance Company. However, it would not be acceptable to burden taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <P>Legislation is already in place to control the export of military and dual use items by Irish companies. The Control of Exports Order, 2000, contains the list of military items that require a licence from my Department before they can be exported from Ireland. Exports of dual use goods, that is goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes, are controlled under Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish export control system is implemented in a manner that fully meets Ireland's obligations arising from membership of the EU and other international export control fora. The promotion and protection of human rights is at the heart of Irish foreign policy and, as such, is a significant factor that is taken into account when licence applications are being assessed.

      <P>One of the main strategic goals of my Department is to promote the development of the Irish economy and more particularly to mobilise the necessary labour supply in the quantity and quality needed to secure sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>In recent months my Department has been reviewing policy and practices with regard to economic migration to ensure that in the longer term they continue to meet the needs of the economy in an efficient and effective manner. Our existing policy instruments were put in place at a much earlier stage of our development and are based on a model of very limited, temporary immigration of skilled personnel. The experience of recent years clearly poses questions in relation to this model.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to look at longer term policy approaches and options that we might adopt which would enable us to respond in a structured way to the medium to long-term need for overseas labour in our economy. Issues which have to be considered include the possibility of a move towards a more managed system of economic migration, a much more enhanced role for FÁS in the process and the developments which are happening at EU level such as the proposal for a Council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of paid employment and self-employed economic activities.</P>
      <P>I am as concerned about the quality as about the quantity of recruitment from overseas, given that many of those coming here temporarily may eventually become long-term residents and possibly become citizens. This has been the experience elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The early indications from the review process which is under way are that we need to put our existing arrangements on a more modern legislative basis. I hope to be in a position to outline my proposals for legislation in this area before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Support in the Productive Sector Operational Programme 2000-2006 is provided under a number of priorities which include research, technological development and innovation, RTDI, industry &ndash; indigenous and foreign direct investment &ndash; and marketing. Under these priorities there are a number of measures which are available to manufacturing companies including the textile industry and internationally traded services. Although there are no specific measures in the productive sector operational programme for the textile sector it is, nevertheless, open to companies in that sector to avail of the support measures under the programme. These support measures are available through the agencies of my Department, i.e., Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>The industry programme will provide over the period of the programme 953 million for measures to assist the indigenous industry. Research and development is also a key strategy of the programme where 2 billion will be provided. Also under the marketing programme 177 million will be provided and will focus on increasing the level of exports in the indigenous sector, with an emphasis on SMEs and market diversification, assisting the marketing functions of firms disadvantaged by their peripheral location and assisting sectors that have yet to fully embrace marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of these measures will be examined in the context of the mid-term evaluation of the <Col N="659" /> programme in 2003 when a full review will be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction with the introduction by this Government of a national minimum wage in 2000, the Government authorised an increase in the labour inspectorate to 17 inspectors which equated to almost a 100% increase in personnel. As pointed out in a recent report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers that number has fluctuated in the interim. While the inspectorate was returned to full strength recently that position has now changed in that two officers have just been reassigned on promotion. Arrangements for replacements are in train and I expect the matter will be addressed in the next four weeks.</P>
      <P>The consultants' report to which I refer was completed following an intensive business process re-engineering project across the entire employment rights enforcement section of my Department. The consultants found that it was difficult to determine an appropriate yardstick to define what the appropriate number of inspectors should be. They linked the size of the inspectorate to the Department's level of ambition in relation to conducting targeted investigations and following up on complaints received.</P>
      <P>The level of ambition of the work of the inspectorate will be pursued in the context of the inspectorate's business plan for 2002. The issue of staffing resources will be addressed in this connection. During 2000, 45 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor for prosecution for breaches of employment rights legislation. Some 12 cases were successfully prosecuted in the year leading to convictions and fines and 14 cases were settled-withdrawn without court proceedings. The remaining cases were carried forward as ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since January 2001, 29 further cases have been referred for prosecution and 15 cases were successfully prosecuted in the year leading to convictions and fines including in most instances the awarding of expenses and costs. A further ten <Col N="660" /> cases have been settled-withdrawn including one case which could not proceed as the company was dissolved. In both years the breaches detected came under the Industrial Relations Acts, Organisation of Working Time Act, Protection of Young Persons Employment Act and Payment of Wages Act. In certain cases there were multiple breaches involving several pieces of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is notable also that of the cases referred for prosecution this year four cases concern the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000; these are the first cases to be brought to the court under this recent legislation.</P>

      <P>The search for a new project to locate in the facility in Macroom has been a key priority for the task force since its establishment in August 2001, following the announcement of the decision to close the company.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is targeting the following options to seek a new project: a new greenfield project from overseas, an expansion led project from the existing base of overseas companies in Ireland that may require a new building-location and a detailed retargeting of companies that visited Cork recently. Details of the facility will be sent to these companies to encourage them to include the company's building in their location analyses and urgent follow-up on any location queries generated by the publicity surrounding the closure announcement. The key target sectors are pharmaceuticals-medical devices, international services and information and communications technologies.</P>
      <P>Since the closure was announced, four companies have visited the facility. The brochure produced by the task force, and funded by the company, has been distributed to IDA offices worldwide, IDA project divisions and to target companies worldwide.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Government Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment, CE, are being mainstreamed. Mainstreaming involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for these services. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A FÁS audit of services currently provided under CE has identified in the region of 1,500 to 1,700 places in the area of health and personal <Col N="662" /> social services, which would be suitable for mainstreaming. The Department of Health and Children supports the mainstreaming of these services in view of its potential to create more permanent funding conditions for the delivery of such services in the future. The modalities involved are being actively examined between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and FÁS, and I am hopeful that this mainstreaming process can commence in April 2002.</P>
    <P>The possibility of mainstreaming certain environmental services currently provided under CE is also currently being actively pursued by my Department at present. Some 1,400 CE places providing such services have previously been identified by FÁS for potential mainstreaming. Discussions on the possibility of mainstreaming such services have been initiated between my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and FÁS. Subject to a satisfactory outcome of these discussions, I hope that the mainstreaming of these services can also commence as early as possible in 2002.</P>

      <P>A total of 13,316 redundancies were notified to my Department in 2000. In the first ten months of 2001, a total of 15,764 redundancies were notified. These relate to employees who have actually been notified individually by their employer that they will be made redundant on a certain date.</P>
      <P>As regards anticipated job losses, one indicator of this is the number of collective redundancies notified to my Department under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. These are the numbers of employees that companies have indicated that they propose to make redundant. It should be borne in mind that there is considerable overlap between the figures for collective redundancies and notified redundancies, and a company may not proceed with all collective redundancies notified. A total of approximately 5,200 collective redundancies were notified under the 1977 Act in September and October 2001, including a number of major cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from formal notification procedures <Col N="663" /> under the Protection of Employment Act and the Redundancy Payments Acts, an early warning system is operated through my Department in co-operation with the State development agencies which notify the Department of firms experiencing difficulty.

      <P>We are fully aware that insurance costs have increased dramatically during this past year. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include High Court decisions that required insurers to strengthen reserves, for claims arising in past years and the global impact of 11 September on international insurers and reinsurers. Under EU law, we cannot intervene in matters of pricing or underwriting of insurance.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is due to report to me at the end of this year on a number of matters pertaining to motor insurance, including the reasons for the high cost of motor insurance. Research has shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland because compensation awards are high. Compensation for loss of income and for medical expenses arising from personal injury is paid for through the private insurance system rather than through the social welfare and health systems, as in other European countries.</P>
      <P>Of the total cost of claims, the costs of delivery of compensation runs at approximately 40%. The objective of the proposed personal injuries assessment board is to reduce these latter costs, so that insurance costs may also be reduced. The implementation group is expected to report at the end of the year, as to how the PIAB may be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The OECD Report on Regulatory Reform in Ireland published last spring commented on the many positive aspects of Ireland's regulatory regime but also highlighted areas where progress must be made in eliminating entry restrictions to sectors of economic activity.</P>
      <P>The Government has set up structures to implement the OECD recommendations. The measures include the establishment of a high level group on regulation under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach to oversee implementation of Ireland's response to the OECD report; the preparation of a major national policy statement on regulatory reform; the development of a new mechanism &ndash; regulatory impact assessment &ndash; by which Departments and public bodies will be required to analyse and measure the impacts on society of any regulations being proposed; requesting the Competition Authority to initiate a comprehensive study of the professional services sector; and requesting the Commission on Liquor Licensing to produce further interim reports and acceleration of a review of the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations governing the award of general medical service contracts to pharmacies.</P>
      <P>The high level group has been meeting regularly since the publication of the OECD report. The Competition Authority has undertaken a consultation process for a study of the professions and will be announcing the professions to be examined shortly. In regard to the pub sector the Commission on Liquor Licensing has published an interim report on the off-licence trade.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the first two surveys carried out by the Director of Consumer Affairs under the action plan, 2000-01, to protect consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to the euro was to establish the level of dual pricing taking place in retail outlets and the display of and correct use of the conversion rate and rounding rules.</P>
      <P>The first survey was undertaken during November 2000. Inspectors of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs surveyed 620 premises. In 30% of the premises surveyed there was evidence of at least some dual pricing of products on sale; less than 3% of premises actually displayed the euro conversion rate; 35% had dual priced the total figures on till receipts issued; less than 20% had the euro conversion rate shown on till receipts; 27% of the total premises surveyed had used the conversion rate correctly. The remainder had either not used the rate at all or else had used it incorrectly. The incorrect usage of the rate use was brought to the attention of the retailers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second survey conducted by the director was carried out in May 2001 and was to compare results with the November 2000 survey. A total of 600 premises were surveyed. Results of this survey showed that 41% of premises surveyed showed some evidence of dual pricing &ndash; an increase of just over ten percentage points on the November survey. Some 40% had dual displayed the total figure on the till receipts which was also an improvement on the last survey when the comparable figure was 35%. Although display of the conversion rate on in-store displays continued to be low, 21% of those surveyed had actually shown it on the till receipt. Of those showing dual display of total price on the till receipt, 92% used <Col N="666" /> the conversion and rounding rules correctly. Again, incorrect use of the rounding rules was brought to the attention of retailers concerned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the third survey carried out over three weeks last month was to check compliance by subscribers with the commitments under the national and sectoral codes of practice on dual display of prices. The objective of these codes is to provide for transparency in pricing during the changeover period and to empower consumers with the information they need to make well-informed purchasing decisions. Subscribers to the codes are entitled to display a special logo devised by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to implement the changeover fairly and not to seek financial advantage from the conversion. Almost 1,900 premises were surveyed and the results, which are being compiled at present, will be published later this week.</P>

      <P>Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote core labour standards. In June 1998, Ireland supported the adoption by the International Labour Conference of a declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. This commits the International Labour Organisation's 175 member states to respect the principles inherent in seven core labour standards and to promote their universal application. Ireland has now ratified all of the seven core labour standards.</P>
      <P>The declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work is a clear statement by the ILO of four principles: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.</P>
      <P>Last June, at the 99th Session of the International Labour Conference, which is the supreme body of the ILO, a special plenary session was held to discuss the second global report of the Director General under the follow-up to the ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work, entitled &ldquo;Stopping Forced Labour&rdquo;. Bonded labour is the most common form of forced labour and is a complex issue as it involves both children and women in bonded labour situations in certain parts of the world. This is an issue on which I have maintained a strong, personal interest, since my time as Irish Minister with responsibility for development co-operation some years ago. At the conference in June, Ireland was to the fore in highlighting the issue at the special plenary session. This followed the Lenten campaign earlier this year by Trócaire to raise public awareness of the issue and to push for its eradication. I had previously been presented with almost 40,000 signatures from concerned Irish citizens, urging me to raise this matter. Ireland, with the support of the majority of other EU member states, urged the governing body of the ILO to approve a substantial technical co-operation programme on bonded labour, over the next four years, with a series of clearly identified component elements. The governing body met on Friday, 9 November 2001 to discuss follow-up actions in this area and I look forward to their proposals on the matter. Last September a partnership programme between Ireland Aid and the ILO was successfully concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to bonded labour, we are ready to examine how we can play over time, a meaningful role through the follow-up proposals of the governing body of the ILO and other organisations <Col N="668" /> through, perhaps, a rolling out of this initial partnership programme to areas such as the abolition of bonded and child labour. Finally, the Deputy will wish to be aware that next year's follow-up global report from the Director General of the ILO will be on the &ldquo;Effective Abolition of Child Labour&rdquo;. This report will continue the momentum already generated on these issues.</P>

      <P>On 5 November 2001 I established the North Dublin Training and Job Placement Initiative, which brought together the services of FÁS, the local authority, Enterprise Ireland and Fingal County Enterprise Board. The group held its inaugural meeting on 16 November, and plans to meet again soon to assess employment possibilities and supports in north County Dublin.</P>
      <P>For those employees of companies which recently announced redundancies, Fingal County Enterprise Board has put in place an information programme on small business start-up and business skills.</P>
      <P>The IDA and FÁS are working specifically with the companies concerned to assist the employees affected by redundancy to find other employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The support structures for those who have lost their jobs is primarily the remit of FÁS. However, the development agencies continue to actively promote and bring forward expansion and development projects by existing and incoming enterprises, to north County Dublin. These will yield new employment opportunities in the near future.</P>
      <P>In terms of infrastructure and competitive environment, north County Dublin is one of the best positioned localities for attracting new investment. I am confident this area will continue its strong development and growth.</P>

      <P>Over the past two years IDA Ireland has radically changed its poli<Col N="669" /> cies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions which includes the BMW region. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its HQ project divisions.</P>
      <P>Recently, the IDA announced that additional posts would be transferred to Athlone, which will comprise staff from regions, property, and healthcare divisions bringing the staff complement up to 30. In addition, posts are being transferred to Sligo comprising staff from international services and consumer products divisions bringing the staff complement up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of the Objective One regions which is in line with the new EU state aid limits. Greater focus is put on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> In the Objective One regions IDA Ireland has acquired a number of additional sites and also upgraded many of its site to business park standard. Furthermore, it has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations.</P>
    <P>As a result of the above initiatives, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new greenfield investment projects have been secured for the Objective One regions. This is a strong result in that it came from intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the agency working in close partnership with the local authorities and the third level colleges and universities across the country. Despite the ongoing retrenchment in the US economy, which is the source of a significant proportion of overseas investment, the IDA continues to strive towards maintaining this level of investment in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>In 2001, there were 11 announcements of IDA Ireland assisted projects for the Border, midlands and west region which combined have a job potential of 1,235 jobs at full development. A number of these announcements were also for research and development projects which falls within the IDA's strategy of embedding existing companies in the Irish economy. Details of these projects are appended.</P>

    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also focused its efforts in the BMW region and its regional development strategy for this year to the end of October has seen 12 new high potential start-ups supported by the agency established. This accounted for 25% of total such start-ups countrywide over the period.</P>
    <P>The agency's regional development strategy is built on a four-pillar approach which aims to develop the competitiveness and export potential of existing businesses in the regions, enhance the operating environment for business, support an increased level of new high potential start-ups throughout the country and identify new opportunities for economic development in the region, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin-based companies.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently running a series of seminars around the BMW region aimed specifically at promoting the generation of HPSU &ndash; high potential start ups &ndash; companies. These have been held in the north-east, north-west and west regions to date. The Border regions are also working in partnership with IFI and Ledu to set up a cross-Border programme to promote technology enterprise start-up. High potential start-up companies which have been established in 2001 include Iontas in Moyville, 100 jobs, County Donegal and Zonen Technology Limited, at Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>Identifying new opportunities for economic development in the regions, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin-based companies, is part of Enterprise Ireland's regional development strategy. To highlight this Enterprise Ireland held a special event &ldquo;Into the Regions&rdquo; in June 2001. Over 100 companies attended and the agency is currently following up with companies which expressed an interest in relocating to the regions. Dublin-based compan<Col N="672" /> ies, which have located in part of the BMW region to date this year include: Network 365 Limited in Letterkenny, Mettallocraft Limited in Ballymahon, County Longford, Eurosync Tehnologies in Dundalk and Transwer Limited in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland also works closely with Údaras Na Gaeltachta and the city and county enterprise boards in supporting the establishment of indigenous industries in the BMW region. The city and county enterprise boards have an extensive network throughout the BMW region and have developed a specific expertise in supporting new micro enterprise formation, with very positive results to date.</P>
    <P>Finally, Enterprise Ireland is also funding a substantial number of community enterprise centres throughout the BMW region. Donegal Community Enterprise Centre, Donegal town was officially opened in October 2001 and Westside Community Enterprise Centre was officially opened in Galway city. Sligo Community Enterprise Centre is due to be completed in the first quarter of 2001. In addition to this, a 10,000 sq. ft. community enterprise centre for Moyville was approved funding in 2001.</P>
    <P>Improved access is crucial in establishing both indigenous and overseas investment to the regions and in this context the importance of improved air and road access cannot be over-emphasised. This has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which includes plans to bring our roads, railway and air services up to a standard consistent with a modern economy within the next six years. Availability of high quality telecommunications and energy supplies are also essential. Both Enterprise and IDA Ireland will be keeping in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of the agencies priorities.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my reply to Question No. 97 of 8 May 2001, where my Department is concerned, there are a number of directives which require the provision of statistics by the Central Statistics Office, which comes under my Department's aegis. There is no obligation to transpose these directives into national <Col N="675" /> law. However, statutory instruments have been made under the Statistics Act, 1993, when considered necessary to collect the data needed to ensure compliance with the relevant directive.</P>

      <P>Asylum seekers in general do not have the right to work pending a final decision on their applications. Under the Government decision of 26 July 1999, however, some 3,535 asylum seekers were given the right to work. We do not have information on the number or percentage of these asylum seekers who are in actual employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has advised that, at present, of the 3,535 persons eligible to work, approximately 1,950 &ndash; 55% &ndash; were no longer claiming social welfare payments. FÁS has advised that, to date, some 1,662 persons &ndash; 47% of those eligible to work &ndash; have been placed in employment. However, some of these may have subsequently lost or left such employment. The number currently in training with FÁS is 188, or 5%.</P>

      <P>Right of Place is a support group for people who have suffered as a result of being residents of industrial schools. FÁS has informed me that the group currently has a FÁS community employment project with six participants and a further three participants on the job initiative scheme. This project, which started in 1999, is under the sponsorship of Cork City Vocational Education Committee. The original agreement was for three participants.</P>
      <P>I understand that facilities exist to expand the current numbers to address the additional workload as required. Arrangements are being made at FÁS regional management level to meet with the group to discuss its proposal and to review the implementation of the project to date.</P>
      <P>I also understand that Right of Place hopes to independently sponsor and manage its own project. At present FÁS considers it appropriate that the management of the project should continue under the auspices of the Cork City Vocational Education Committee in view of the positive experience with that arrangement to date.</P>
      <P>FÁS also points out that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children have provided support for different aspects of the services provided by Right of Place. Under agreed arrangements, services which had been provided through FÁS schemes but which are more properly the responsibility of other Departments, for example, classroom assistants and school caretakers, are being mainstreamed, that is, responsibility and funding is being transferred to the Department primarily responsible.</P>

      <P>From the outset of the euro business awareness campaign organised by Forfás, it has been clearly suggested to all business representative associations and to individual business operations by way of published material that no direct financial assistance would be available to businesses in relation to the changeover to the euro. Notwithstanding this, any capital expenditure incurred by individual businesses in connection with the changeover would be allowable for taxation purposes in the normal way. Accordingly, it is not my intention to introduce any form of grant aid for this purpose as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the regulation of the pharmacy sector is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children who has recently commenced a review of the regulations governing pharmacy. The review group has publicly sought submissions in regard to issues relevant to the review.</P>
      <P>The OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland published last spring commented on the many positive aspects of Ireland's regulatory regime, but also highlighted areas where progress must be made in eliminating entry restrictions to sectors of economic activity including the pharmacy sector. The Government has set up structures to implement the OECD's recommendations.</P>
      <P>I hope the review of the regulations governing pharmacy will lead to a satisfactory conclusion in facilitating the appropriate balance to be struck between public health and safety considerations and removing any unnecessary obstacles to competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that there is an upward movement of prices that can be attributable to the introduction of the euro. The latest available information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that consumer prices <Col N="680" /> increased by 0.3% in October. This is lower than the 0.7% increase that was recorded in October 2000. As a result annual inflation in the 12 months to October fell to 4.3%. Food prices fell by 0.1% in October decreasing the annual rate of food inflation to 6.8% from 7.0% in September.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 15,764 redundancies were notified to my Department in the first ten months of this year. The following tables set out the number of redundancies notified for each county in 2001 and the number of redundancies notified in each of the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the recent closures and job losses, and I am aware that it is a distressing and disruptive time for the people who are being made redundant. The State agencies, including IDA, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, are continuing to work closely with the companies involved to address the difficulties arising for them and to assist the people being made redundant in finding other employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the social economy programme will disburse £5.2 million in 2001, considerably less than was allowed in the Revised Estimates in March this year. This is because the uptake of grants under the social economy programme has been slower than anticipated this year. There is a strong pipeline of projects, however, and it is expected that a much greater percentage of the budget allocation for 2002 will be disbursed.</P>
      <P>The budget for the north-west region, that is Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, is £1.253 million for 2001. Budgets are not allocated on a county basis but a regional basis depending on the employment and training needs of the particular region. Each application is considered on its merits and is recommended for approval or otherwise to FÁS by a local working group established for this purpose in each partnership area.</P>
      <P>Under the feasibility grant element of the social economy programme the local working group in County Sligo received 41 expressions of interest, 27 applications for business plan grants and had 20 business applications approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local working group in County Sligo also had eight business plans submitted for approval for full grants, and had four projects approved <Col N="682" /> with 20 jobs proposed with an allocation of £374,640 for the first year of operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1995 Enterprise Ireland, through its investment services directorate, has implemented a policy of forming partnerships with private sector institutions, corporates and other venture capitalists to establish new venture capital funds to invest this funding in Irish SMEs. At the end of 2000 all of this funding was committed to investments.</P>
      <P>Investments made in 2000 by the Enterprise Ireland partnership funds with the private sector were £28.8 million. This represents a 40% growth rate over the previous year, with the significant change that £13.7 million &ndash; 47% &ndash; of the total was in follow-on investments, compared to £5.1 million &ndash; 24% &ndash; in 1999. This is a measure of the continuing need of companies to have access to venture capital at various stages of their growth cycle.</P>
      <P>Highlights to the end of 2000 were as follows: 15 funds fully operational; investments of £28.8 million in 2000 compared to £20.6 million in 1999; investments in 67 companies in 2000 compared to 51 in 1999; investments of £15.1 million in 29 new companies and £13.7 million in 38 follow-on investments in 2000, compared to £15.5 million in 32 new companies and £5.1 million in 19 follow-on investments in 1999.</P>
      <P>The areas of investment included software, communications, multimedia, manufacturing, life sciences and services: 87.1% of the investment in 2000 was in start-up and early stage companies; 71.54% of invested funds in 2000 was in software related products; investments in regionally located projects outside Dublin in 2000 was £8.4 million. The total invested to December 2000 in the regions was £17.7 million, representing 26.6% of invested funds. Employment levels in companies at the time of the initial investment was 1,620 at 31 December 2000, this number has increased to 3,505.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Venture capital investment, both in Ireland and globally, has changed during the year with a new and more basic investment environment emerging. With the slowdown in the world economy, particularly in the US from mid year, Enterprise Ireland expects this to change further as fund managers become more selective on new investments particularly for the seed and early development stage. Furthermore, companies' access to the capital markets has slowed requiring fund <Col N="683" /> managers to continue their support of existing investments, resulting in less finance being available for new seed and early stage companies.</P>
    <P>To ensure that new and early development stage companies continue to have access to capital a new seed and venture capital scheme is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland. The key focus of this funding is to develop the early stage venture capital business nationally with particular focus on the regions and new emerging sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition to working with the venture capital sector to leverage these new funds, Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its client companies on a case by case basis to facilitate their growth in sales and exports. A key element of this is funding assistance by way of ordinary equity, preference shares and non-repayable grants.</P>
    <P>Regarding funding made available by the city and county enterprise boards, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, capital grants up to a level of 50% of the cost of the investment not in excess of £100,000 are available under the local enterprise development sub-programme of the south and east and Border, midlands and west operational programmes.</P>
    <P>The portions of financial assistance in excess of 40% in the BMW region and in excess of 35% in the south and east region are grants in refundable form. Micro-enterprises may also avail of employment grants up to £5,000 when labour shortages can be demonstrated and feasibility grants to a maximum of 60% on the BMW region or 50% in the south and east region, subject to limits of £5,000 and £4,000 respectively.</P>

      <P>To support urban communities suffering from social deprivation and high levels of unemployment, I launched the urban community enterprise centre programme in July 1999. The Government in its budget for 1999 allocated a sum of £13.5 million over the two year period 1999 and 2000 to fund this new programme. A first tranche of £8 million was allocated for the year 1999 and the balance of £5.5 million for the year 2000. This initiative is being administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department. The urban community enterprise centre programme provides financial assistance of up to a maximum of £1 million or 50% of the cost of the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The aim of this programme is to promote community enterprise centres in urban areas where there is above average long-term unemployment and serious deprivation. The centres are aimed at meeting the real needs of communities to grow local enterprise, by facilitating activities leading to the creation of new start-up micro enterprises that may impact on the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed and foster innovative ideas for enterprise creation.</P>
    <P>A total of 24 projects were approved for assistance. One of the successful applications was from Sligo and Enterprise Ireland has provided a total of £360,000 in funding in the form of £330,000 in capital grants and £30,000 management grants towards the construction of a 15,000 sq. ft. enterprise centre on the grounds of Sligo Airport and towards the management of the centre for two years afterwards. The construction of the centre is well under way with all steel structure completed and 50% of the brickwork completed. The centre is due to open in February 2002.</P>
    <P>Under this programme Enterprise Ireland also approved funding of £600,000 towards the cost of building a 25,000 sq. ft enterprise centre in Letterkenny and support towards the appointment of a centre manager. This centre was launched by me on 9 April 2001 and construction has commenced on the project which is on schedule for completion soon. In addition to this, Enterprise Ireland approved £29,400, 50% of expenditure, in July 2000 for a project manager over a two year period.</P>
    <P>The Donegal county enterprise fund was initially approved 50% funding under this programme based on their original costs of £1.3 million. During the planning phase, the DCEF found that there was a significant demand for hi-tech space in Letterkenny and as such have upgraded the facility to include 10,000 sq. ft. quality fully wired workspace. Due to these increased costs, the project has secured additional funds to build the community enterprise centre and work has recently commenced on the building which I officially opened in September 2001.</P>
    <P>Funding under this programme is now fully allocated and no additional funding will be made available under this programme.</P>
    <P>The urban programme was run in parallel with the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centre scheme which was established in 1989 in order to support the development of enterprise centres nationally, providing financial assistance up to a maximum of £100,000 or 25% of the cost of the centre.</P>
    <P>Under the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centre scheme to date, Enterprise Ireland has committed capital grant support to seven enterprise centres located in the north-west region, namely at Convoy, Glenties, Moville, Ballyshannon, Raphoe, Lifford and Taughboyne. Enterprise Ireland, through this programme, has invested a total of £594,325 in enterprise space in these centres. An examination of the programme is currently under way to determine the frame<Col N="685" /> work within which any future possible schemes will operate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the position in relation to a decision adopted by the EU Commission in December 1999 under Article 9 of Directive 92/59/EEC &ndash; General Product Safety &ndash; prohibiting the placing on the market of toys and child care articles intended for mouthing by children under three years of age, made of, or including, parts of soft PVC containing one or more of six identified substances. The decision requires member states to prohibit the placing on the market of these products. This decision remains in force and the Director of Consumer Affairs continues to enforce the prohibition and has kept the trade advised of the prolongation of the ban. When the ban was first introduced the director issued a press release advising consumers and the trade of the Commission initiative. A copy of this press release is available on the ODCA website &ndash; www:odca.ie. A copy of the Commission decision is also available.</P>
      <P>The question of providing for the treatment of these products on a long-term basis is being considered at EU level. This will entail amending Directive 76/769/EEC on the marketing and use of dangerous substances and preparations and Directive 88/378/EEC on the safety of toys.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has powers under the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations, 1997 &ndash; S.I. No. 197 of 1997 and-or the European Communities (Safety of Toys) Regulations, 1990 &ndash; S.I. No. 32 of 1990 to ban certain products. Action can only be taken under the regulations, however, when the director is aware of evidence that the product is dangerous to the health and safety of the consumer, or if it does not meet the essential safety requirements. As there is no scientific evidence that all PVC toys are dangerous there are no plans to ban PVC toys in general. Action under the regulations mentioned must relate to specific items and requires that a direction should be addressed to named individuals or operators. The regulations do not provide for the taking of blanket actions.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that a number of EU member states have national legislation which would allow them to enforce bans under certain circumstances there are no plans to introduce similar legislation here.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited &ndash; IICL &ndash; was a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities, who were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>Following the commencement of the liquidation process in the UK, our first priority was to ensure that alternative cover was available. Irish insurers indicated a willingness to accommodate the policyholders affected. The broker who had placed the business with Independent put alternative arrangements in place.</P>
      <P>Clarification obtained through the UK authorities indicates that private policyholders, including motorcyclists, are, in principle, protected under the UK Policyholder Protection Act subject to the policyholders meeting all of the other requirements of the UK Act. That protection will be limited to 90%, including return of unexpired premiums of up to 90%, provided policies confer rights to a return of premium, on cancellation.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland that, in the case of third party claims arising under policies covering compulsory third party insurance, application may be made to the bureau for the recovery of insurance losses not otherwise recovered as a result of the failure of Independent Insurance.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on trade in services was initiated in January 2000 under Article XIX of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and a large number of proposals have been submitted by the World Trade Organisation members on a wide range of sectors and several horizontal issues, as well as on movement of natural persons.</P>
      <P>The successful fourth ministerial conference in Doha from 9 to 13 November 2001 confirmed the launch of a new trade round. The ministerial declaration on the launch of the new round reaffirms the guidelines and procedures for the negotiations on trade in services adopted by the Council for Trade in Services on 28 March 2001, as the basis for continuing negotiations, with a view to achieving the objectives of the GATS, as stipulated in the Preamble, Article IV and Article XIX of that agreement.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on trade in services is already under way and the ministerial declaration in Doha reaffirms the basis for proceeding.

    <P>In the case of Council Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the framework agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC, the original deadline for implementation was 20 January 2002, but Ireland obtained a deferral from the EU Commission of this implementation date to 20 January 2001 because of special difficulties in implementing the directive. Ireland has not received any formal communication from the EU Commission about non-implementation of Directive 97/81/EC. The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2001, which will transpose Directive 97/81/EC <Col N="688" /> into Irish law, is due to pass Report and Final Stages in the Dáil on 21 November 2001, and to have passed all Stages in the Seanad and be enacted before the end of December 2001.</P>

      <P>With regard to job creation for the current year, the information requested by the Deputy is not yet available. The Forfás annual employment survey is carried out in November of each year. This survey will give details of all jobs created and lost in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and County Enterprise Boards assisted companies for the period 1 November 2000 to 31 October 2001. The preliminary figures for this survey will not be available until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Up to recently, the agencies remained optimistic about this year's performance, forecasting 21,000 new jobs and a net employment increase of 11,000. However, we are all aware of the unforeseen factors which have arisen, namely, foot and mouth, the escalation of difficulties in the IT industry, and most recently the tragic events in the US. These factors have combined to significantly moderate the agencies' expectations for the current year.</P>
      <P>While Forfás expects overall job creation to remain strong at about 19,500, the net employment increase has been revised significantly downwards to 2,400, the bulk of this adjustment being due to increased job losses in foreign owned firms particularly those based in the US.</P>
      <P>While any deterioration in these figures is disappointing, the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. I am confident that we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms. To this end, the Government is continuing to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment and encouraging companies to move up the value chain.</P>

      <P>I am aware from research conducted on behalf of our Department and from various EU publications that insurance costs are higher in Ireland than in other member states.</P>
      <P>The research conducted for our Department has shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland because compensation awards are high. Compensation for loss of income and for medical expenses arising from personal injury is paid for through the private insurance system rather than through the social welfare and health systems, as in other European countries.</P>
      <P>Of the total cost of claims, the costs of delivery of compensation run at approximately 40%. The objective of the proposed personal injuries assessment board is to reduce these latter costs so that insurance costs may also be reduced. The implementation group is expected to report close to the end of the year as to how the personal injury assessment board may be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The European Competitiveness Report 2001, which has just been prepared by the European Commission, shows Ireland in an extremely favourable light in comparison with other member States of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of just three states cited as recording high rates of GDP growth, while scoring very high both in terms of employment growth and labour productivity growth.</P>
      <P>In terms of GDP <i>per capita</i> in EU member States Ireland is ranked second, after Luxembourg, for 2001 and we are, in fact, in first place as regards growth of real GDP in member states ranked according to performance over the period 1995 to 2001.</P>
      <P>We are also in first place as regards both employment growth and labour productivity in member States as shown by the average annual growth of GDP-employed persons in per cent, ranked according to performance over the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition to these macro indicators, the report also points out that Ireland, in common with some of the Nordic countries, is approaching U.S. levels of business investment in ICT as a percentage of GDP, while some of the larger countries have performed less well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with a continuation of our successful policies &ndash; adjusted to take account of changing economic conditions &ndash; we will be in a position to maintain our competitiveness in <Col N="692" /> relation to the rest of the world for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> her plans to change the policy of the IDA which states that 50% of all new industrial jobs will be provided in the Border midland west region. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to change the policy for IDA Ireland which now targets the provision of 50% of all new greenfield jobs in the BMW region. Despite the current economic downturn IDA will continue to pursue that strategy in the Objective One region which includes the Border, midlands and west region. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its headquarters project divisions.</P>
      <P>On 1 September 2001 additional posts were transferred to Athlone, which comprises staff from regions, property and healthcare divisions bringing the staff complement up to 30. In January 2002 additional posts will be transferred to Sligo comprising staff from international services and consumer products divisions bringing the staff complement up to 15. In mid-2002 additional posts will be transferred to Waterford comprising of staff from information and communications technologies and engineering.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions and to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions. Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of Objective One regions which is in line with the new EU State aid limits.</P>
      <P>In the Objective One regions IDA has acquired a number of additional sites and also upgraded many of its sites to business park standard. Furthermore it has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, IDA Ireland will have 95 staff across all of its regional offices and the underlying purpose is to work in close partnership with the other <Col N="693" /> State and local resources to create a drive from within the regions to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; foreign investment rather than the present approach of pushing for it from its Dublin headquarters.</P>

      <P>Infringement procedures from the European <Col N="698" /> Commission involve the issue of a formal notice which in some cases leads to a reasoned opinion. Annex 1 following lists details of formal notices and reasoned opinions received by Ireland since 1 November 1997. Depending on the nature of the reasoned opinion, action in the European Court of Justice may ensue. Annex 2 lists details of European Court of Justice cases that resulted from the infringement procedures listed in Annex 1. Annex 3 lists details of other court action during the past four years, based on infringement procedures undertaken prior to November 1997.</P>

      <P>I met with the Foreign Minister of Colombia, Mr. Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, on 13 November during my recent visit to the United Nations in New York. I had previously met the Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations on 30 October. I raised the concerns of the families of the three Irish citizens currently being detained in Colombia. In particular, I emphasized the importance of ensuring that the men are held in safe and secure accommodation, that they have reasonable living conditions, including the possibility to associate with each other, and that they have adequate access to their legal representatives. I also asked that the case be expedited to the greatest degree possible. Minister de Soto undertook to follow up the concerns which I raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the days prior to a meeting of the European <Col N="711" /> Council, the President of the European Council writes to his counterparts outlining the principal topics for discussion. There is no formal agenda as such. The letter from the Belgian Prime Minister in respect of the European Council in Laeken on 14 and 15 December has not yet been received. Nevertheless, it already seems clear at this stage that the following are likely to be among the main items for discussion.</P>
      <P>The European Council, in its consideration of the follow-up to the 11 September attacks in the United States, will review progress on implementing the counter-terrorism agenda that Heads of State and Government set out at their special Summit on 21 September. The effective implementation of this agenda is clearly a priority for the Government as for the Union as a whole. In this context, the European Council is expected to consider among other things the initiatives taken in the Justice and Home Affairs area, including the proposed framework decisions on combating terrorism and on a European arrest warrant, which are under intensive discussion at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Laeken meeting will also review progress on the objectives set out in the Justice and Home Affairs area more generally at the Tampere European Council in October 1999. Key issues are likely to include immigration control, the harmonization of asylum and immigration legislation, improved police co-operation and improved working methods in the JHA area. Ireland takes a positive approach to this area, which affects the public very directly, but we also believe that, given its complexity and sensitivity, there has to be a focus on what is achievable.</P>
      <P>The European Council will also consider progress on enlargement on which it is expected that, following the commission's positive review of the negotiations with the candidate countries, the Council will make clear that the targets set down at Gothenburg for completion of negotiations at the end of 2002 and accession to the EU in 2004, for up to ten new states, can be met. Ireland supports this approach.</P>
      <P>The European Council will also discuss current international issues, in particular the humanitarian and post-military campaign situation in Afghanistan, the situation in the Middle East and progress in the western Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the future of Europe debate, I look forward to agreement on a declaration at Laeken which will launch the next phase of the debate. It is envisaged that the Laeken Declaration will include agreement on the establishment of a convention, bringing together representatives of member state governments, national parliaments, the European Parliament and the European Commission, along with applicant country representatives. The task of the convention would be to prepare options for eventual consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for 2004. Ireland wants to see a coherent and focused debate which will concentrate on ways in <Col N="712" /> which the public can be reconnected to the Union.</P>
    <P>The Council may discuss the global Conference on Financing for Development which will be held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. In particular, the Presidency may focus discussion on progress by EU member states towards the UN target of spending 0.7% of their GNP on overseas development assistance. Ireland has given the UN a commitment to reaching the target by 2007.</P>

      <P>The Embassy of Ireland in South Africa is accredited to Zimbabwe on a non-resident basis and has the responsibility for providing consular assistance to Irish citizens in Zimbabwe. Irish citizens in Zimbabwe may also seek assistance from the embassy of any other EU member state in Harare. I am concerned about the continuing deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe. My Department is monitoring developments there closely and maintains regular contact with Irish citizens by telephone and e-mail, as well as through visits to Harare by embassy officials.</P>
      <P>The EU has been engaged in a dialogue with the Zimbabwean Government for a number of months. The General Affairs Council on 25 June noted the lack of substantial progress in the dialogue and stressed the need for rapid and tangible results in the following five areas: an end to political violence; an invitation to the EU to support and observe coming elections; concrete action to protect the freedom of mass media; independence of the judiciary and an end to the illegal occupation of properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council meeting on 29 October, my EU colleagues and I noted that no visible progress was being made regarding the concerns we had highlighted at our meeting on 25 June and, as a result, we decided to strengthen the ongoing political dialogue by opening consul<Col N="713" /> tations with the Government of Zimbabwe under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. The consultations will focus on the five areas of concern outlined by the General Affairs Council on 25 June.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens who have concerns regarding their personal safety or their property in Zimbabwe, or who wish to discuss their position following the Citizenship of Zimbabwe Amendment Act, 2001, should contact the Irish embassy in Pretoria. I will monitor the situation in Zimbabwe carefully and I will continue to make our concerns known in all appropriate fora.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the landfall of Hurricane Michelle on the southern coast of Cuba on 4 November, the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination team visited the country to assess the situation on the ground. Five people were reported to have died with many thousands having to be provided with temporary shelter. The Cuban Society of the Red Cross mobilised more than 12,000 volunteers who helped evacuate those at risk to temporary accommodation or to houses of relatives or friends.</P>
      <P>By 9 November the UN reported that water and electricity supplies had been substantially restored in Havana, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara and the Isla de la Juventud and totally restored in Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila. Electricity supplies were also substantially restored to these and other areas at that time. Thanks to the ongoing work of the Cuban Government and local authorities, further progress has been made in the restoration of basic services and in the provision of shelter to those in need since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of Cuba decided not to issue an international appeal in response to Hurricane <Col N="714" /> Michelle and the Cuban Society of the Red Cross has taken a similar line. However, Cuba has benefited from the services of the Pan-American Disaster Response Unit &ndash; PADRU &ndash; which is run by the International Federation of the Red Cross and Crescent and is supported by the Irish Government. In response to Hurricane Michelle, a representative of PADRU was sent to Cuba to support the national emergency effort. PADRU also worked closely with the Cuban Red Cross on the ground and kept a regional logistics unit on standby in Panama. This work was supported by an Ireland Aid grant of £100,000 made to PADRU earlier this year. In addition, the Government has decided to provide a further US$60,000 in support of UNICEF-Cuba which is responding to the immediate health needs of children in areas affected by Hurricane Michelle.</P>
    <P>The European Union, which is Cuba's major donor, is providing 8 million in humanitarian and emergency preparedness support for that country this year. This assistance is addressing immediate humanitarian needs as well as those of the elderly, the handicapped, mothers and other vulnerable sectors of the population. Geographically, the EU's humanitarian support concentrates on the five eastern provinces of Cuba which are most at risk due to hostile climate and remoteness along with some areas of the central provinces. In addition, the EU provides economic and NGO co-financing support which amounted to 13 million in 2000. During 1993-2000 78 million has been provided in humanitarian aid by the EU, representing 65% of its total support to Cuba during that period.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year 2000, almost £6 million has been provided by the Government in assistance to countries in Latin America. This assistance is made up of emergency relief and recovery support, co-financing of NGOs and missionaries and support for human rights and democratisation. The Government will continue its support, both bilaterally and as a contributing member of the EU, for emergency relief and preparedness programmes in Cuba and other countries of Latin America which remain particularly susceptible to climatic and other forms of natural disaster.</P>

      <P>The European Union and its member states play an important role in the search for a solution to the Middle East situation. Representatives of the Union and the member states have regular contacts at all levels with the key players in the <Col N="715" /> region. Only this weekend the President of the Council, Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium, accompanied by Foreign Minister Michel, Commission President Prodi and High Representative Solana, made a tour of the region and held talks with the leaders of Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon. The special envoy of the EU for the Middle East peace process, Ambassador Moratinos, who has just been re-appointed for a further year, is in constant contact with the parties and regularly present in the region.</P>
      <P>The Europe-Mediterranean Partnership established under the Barcelona Process is also an important expression of the European Union's commitment to the region. This brings the EU together with the 12 states of the southern Mediterranean and fosters co-operation in the fields of political co-operation, economic development, justice and home affairs and social development. The most recent ministerial meeting of this group, which I attended, took place in Brussels on 5 and 6 November.</P>
      <P>The international community is currently engaged in an initiative to secure the implementation of the measures set out in Senator Mitchell's report of 30 April. This initiative is supported by the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia whose current shared position was set out in the statement issued by their four envoys on 25 October. This statement called for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from Area A and immediate implementation of the Mitchell Report and the Tenet plan leading to a resumption of the political process in order to address the fundamental issues between the two parties. These steps are essential to progress on a final settlement. I understand the envoys of the EU, the UN, the United States and Russia will continue to co-operate and co-ordinate their efforts in the region to bring the parties to negotiations.</P>

      <P>Under the Voice Telephony and Universal Service Regulations, 1999, Eircom has been designated by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to meet all reasonable requests for connection to the fixed public telephone network at a fixed location, for access to fixed public telephone services and to supply such services at an affordable price within the geographic area identified by the director. A basic phone connection enables normal speed dial-up Internet access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been increased significantly to 200 million, £157.5 million. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received, my Department entered nine contracts at the beginning of the year, which will result in additional investment in regional broadband infrastructure. A second call for proposals has been run with a number of applications received on 19 October last. These projects will be evaluated in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The rollout of radio is a matter for individual operators in accordance with the terms of mobile licences. Mobile Internet access will be facilitated by the development of 3G mobile services in Ireland. The conversion from analogue to digital terrestrial television will enable Internet access. However, the provision of television services is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in which I have no function.</P>

      <P>Following the Government decision that the operating licence for the first light rail lines should be awarded following a competitive tendering process, my Department engaged consultants, Masons Solicitors, Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton and Babtie Group Limited, to design and conduct the competition in accordance with EU public procurement rules. The consultants are reporting to a steering committee comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the light rail project office of CIE. An independent process auditor has also been appointed.</P>
      <P>The procurement process began in December 2000 and attracted interest from a number of Irish and international companies. I understand that three bidders remain in contention at this stage and it is hoped that a preferred bidder will be selected, after the completion of detailed negotiations, before the end of 2001. It is expected that the contract will be awarded by end January 2002. When the preferred bidder is selected, the consultants' recommendation will be referred to me for decision regarding the award of the contract. The contract is to be of five years duration, from the commencement of passenger services, with an option to extend, at the end of that period, for a further five years.</P>

      <P>The first Luas line from Tallaght to Connolly Station is on target for completion and commencement of passenger services by the end of 2003. I will bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks for the development of the metro. In terms of services to the west side of the city, it is likely that the first phase of the system will include construction of a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the city centre. I hope the procurement process for this line can begin shortly thereafter. The line will be procured as a public private partnership and, therefore, the precise route alignment, cost and timescale will be negotiated as part of this process. Information available to me suggests that the services could begin by 2006-07.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has also proposed an extension of the Luas network covering various parts of Dublin, including a line from Lucan to the city centre. While initial planning and preliminary public consultation work on these lines has commenced, no formal dates for commencement of construction have yet been determined. In the case of the metro, the line from Blanchardstown through Clondalkin and Tallaght to the city centre will be considered as a second phase.</P>

      <Quest>if she will make arrangements for a subvention to the Aer Lingus pension fund along the same lines as was made in accordance with EU rules by another airline as detailed in her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 205 of 13 November 2001.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28869/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 205 of 13 November, in 1995 the European Commission investigated plans by the German Government to contribute to pension funds concerning Lufthansa employees as part of the company's privatisation programme. The measures were linked to Lufthansa's withdrawal from a supplementary pension fund managed by the VBL, Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Laender, to which as a public company it had been obliged to belong but as a private company was obliged to leave. This proposal was challenged by the European Commission for its compatibility with State aid rules. The Commission decided not to raise any objections on the basis that a private investor in the same position as the German Government would probably have acted in the same way and the injection was, therefore, found to be compatible with State aid rules.</P>
      <P>Deputies are already aware from my recent statements to the House that the European Commission in all recent contacts have been unyielding in their view that a State injection of funds into Aer Lingus in whatever form would be in breach of the State aid rules. Furthermore, any proposal such as a subvention to the Aer Lingus pension fund would require to be notified to the Commission under Article 88 (3) of the Treaty. The resultant examination by the Commission could take a minimum of 12 months, with no certainty of approval at the end of the process. Unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of such a timeframe while attempting to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this position, my officials are reviewing all competition and state aid rules in consultation with the Attorney General's office and other experts. I welcome the fact that Aer Lingus has been in a position to announce a voluntary early retirement programme within the resources available to them.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the purchase of 58 diesel railcars, with Iarnród Éireann funding the purchase of an additional 22 from its own resources, and the quadrupling of the railway line from Heuston to Kildare. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that the diesel rail cars are due to be delivered next year and in 2003 and will be used both to replace older rolling stock and improve frequency on suburban railway routes. It also informed me that design work on the quadrupling of the line to Kildare is continuing. Taken together, these two projects are designed to provide additional train paths into and out of Heuston Station by separating express and local trains. A separate significant project is already under way in Heuston to provide a more efficient marshalling of trains and additional platforms. The question of specific train stops, in the context of safety considerations, is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann to decide.</P>

I have also raised the question of the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep producers. I will be making our case on these issues once again at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 20 November.</P>

In addition to the above, the Commission has recently submitted a proposal to Council for a traceability system covering genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in feedingstuffs.

      <P>I am aware that the market for beef from over 30 month cattle is currently weaker than for beef from under 30 month cattle. While there appears to be a general move within a number of outlets towards beef from younger cattle, the current price differential between over and under 30 month animals must be seen in the context of a dramatic drop in beef consumption generally during the past year. The measures taken at EU level are now having effect and the consumption losses are being regained. That said, there are, nevertheless, outlets for beef from over 30 month animals, particularly in continental European and Russia. In addition, beef from over 30 month cattle can be sold into the special purchase scheme and intervention. The quantity of beef currently being sold into the special purchase scheme is considerable and accounts for the vast bulk of the cows slaughtered in the country in recent weeks. I have made representations to Commissioner Fischler to extend the special purchase scheme which is due at the moment to end on 31 December 2001. As far as intervention is concerned, the quantity offered into intervention is entirely a matter for the beef processing industry. The European Commission has accepted the bulk of the beef offered into intervention by Irish processors this autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the beef premium regime which were adopted at the meeting of the Council in June included a new provision requiring farmers with a suckler cow quota in excess of 13 suckler cows to submit heifers for at least 15% their suckler cow premium claim. I am disappointed the European Commission has interpreted this provision in a manner which requires heifers submitted as part of the 15% requirement to be replaced if they calve down during retention. I raised that matter at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 23 October and I also made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler subsequently on the issue. The FEOGA committee has, however, accepted the European Commission's interpretation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe, however, that the more restrictive interpretation of the 15% heifer requirement will create major problems for Irish producers generally as two thirds of our farmers will be exempt from the requirement. In addition, premium statistics show that in general suckler cow producers have relatively low stocking densities and should be able to accommodate the necessary heifers on their farm. Furthermore, the Teagasc farm survey for 2000 shows that the average specialist suckler cow producers already have sufficient number of dry heifers on their holdings to meet the 15% requirement.</P>

      <P>Under the European Commission rules which apply to all aids in agricultural holdings, provision is made to increase the percentage of grant aid by 15% in disadvantaged areas and by 5% in other areas for young qualified farmers under 35 years. However, the additional grant rates may be applied only to investments undertaken within five years of setting up in farming. In approving the schemes of investment aid for farm waste management and investment aid for the improvement in dairy hygiene standards the European Commission applied the above rules. In the circumstances, it is not possible to review the position in relation to the herdowner concerned.</P>

      <P>Article 32.11 of EU Commission Regulation 1900/2000 provides for the application of a co-efficient of 0.8 to the number of bovine livestock units recorded on holdings for extensification premium purposes in cases where, owing to an epizootic, the competent veterinary authorities decide that no animals may leave the holdings except for slaughter. The concession applies for the duration of the restriction on movement and for 20 days thereafter and is conditional on the farmer taking all measures necessary to prevent and/or limit the occurrence of the epizootic that led to the restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concession will be applied automatically in the case of farmers who co-operated with the measures put in place to prevent the occurrence or spread of foot and mouth disease in the early part of 2001. It will also be applied automatically <Col N="728" /> in the case of farmers whose herds are restricted under the TB and brucellosis regulations at any time during 2001, provided of course those farmers have taken the measures necessary to prevent the spread or recurrence of disease.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 23 cattle under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 9 May 2000 and was paid £1,290 on 29 September 2000.</P>
      <P>Following a subsequent office check on his application, it was noted that six of the animals applied on had been sold at the mart on 11 May 2000. Under the terms and conditions of the 2000 cattle headage scheme animals applied on had to be retained on the farm for two calendar months from the day following receipt of application, or had to be replaced with other acceptable animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 6 October 2000 advising him of the situation and asked him to forward the tag numbers of replacement animals, if any. In reply, he stated that he had written to his district livestock office on 16 May 2000 to inform the office that he had sold the six animals. He was then advised that cattle headage grants paid to him would have to be recouped. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to the regional higher executive officer setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. He was also requested to forward proof of posting of his letter of 16 May 2000, as there was no record of receipt of this letter. He furnished a certificate of posting and he was written to on 25 January 2001 advising him that the decision was upheld on review, and the amount of £1,290, 1,637.96, already paid to him would be recovered from other grants due to him. He was given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing <Col N="729" /> to the headage and premia appeals unit within 21 days. The person named appealed the decision to the appeals unit. The decision was upheld on appeal and he was notified of same by letter of 3 July 2001. However, following further consideration of the matter, the appeals unit reviewed its earlier decision, and informed him by letter of 4 September 2001 that the six animals in question would be deleted from his claim, and the remaining animals would be accepted for payment without penalty. Grants on the six animals amounted to £118.80, 150.84, and as he was already paid £1,290, 1,637.96, the sum of £118.80, 150.84, was recouped from the second instalment of his 2001 ewe premium grant which issued to him on 19 October 2001, leaving him with a balance of £110.42, 140.20.</P>
    <P>He has been paid his full entitlement of £880.00, 1,117.37, on 80 sheep under the 2000 sheep headage scheme. He was paid £800, 1,015.79, on 8 September 2000, and £80, 101.58, top-up on 20 December 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme the person named was paid the 60% advance of £1,149.64, 1,459.74, on 16 October 2000 and the 20% advance of £383.21, 486.58, on 19 December 2000 in respect of 13 animals. The balance of his entitlement, amounting to £383.22, 486.59, will issue to him shortly as will his entitlement of £59.02, 74.94, under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme euro compensation.</P>
    <P>Following payment of the balance of 2000 suckler cow premium, the person named can expect payment of his 2000 extensification premium. The payment, based on his 13 eligible suckler cows, will amount to £675.74, 858.01. In addition, he can also expect payment of euro compensation of £17.68, 22.45, in respect of the same 13 animals.</P>

      <P>The production of sugar in all member states of the European Union, including Ireland, is regulated by the EU sugar regime, which has been in operation since 1968. The EU regulation specifies a quota in respect of manufactured sugar for each member state and provides that the quota be allocated to the sugar manufacturing enterprises on the member state's territory.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case the quota is allocated to Irish Sugar plc, the only manufacturer of sugar in the country. It is a matter for the company to place contracts with growers to deliver sugar beet sufficient to allow for the manufacture of the national sugar quota.</P>
      <P>The sugar manufacturer is required by EU regulation to pay to growers at least the minimum price, as specified in the regulation, for sugar beet of standard quality and sugar content. Ireland and all other member states of the European Union must operate the sugar regime in accordance with the EU regulation. Accordingly, in Ireland's case, the quota is allocated to the only manufacturer of sugar in the country.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Act, 1991, provides for a special share in Greencore Group plc to be held by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Ownership of the special share prevents the disposal of the controlling interest in Irish Sugar plc, or any of the Irish sugar quota, or more than 20% of Irish Sugar's fixed assets used in the production or processing of sugar, and prevents a single shareholder or group of shareholders acting together from gaining control of Greencore plc, without the written prior consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the present dispute between the sugar beet growers and Irish Sugar plc and I am very anxious that the matter be resolved quickly to the satisfaction of both sides.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 37 cows and three heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application it was found that animal tag number DCL682556 died on the farm on 23 August 2001 and animal tag number DWK149211 was moved off the farm to a factory on 4 October 2001. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme an animal must be replaced within 20 days of the date of loss/sale and the district livestock office notified in writing of replacement details within ten working days of the date of replacement. For an animal to be considered as natural circumstances, for example, death of an animal, the producer must notify the district livestock office in writing of each such event within ten working days of that event.</P>
      <P>The district livestock office of my Department received notification and replacement details for animal tag number DWK149211, but did not receive notification regarding animal tag number DCL682556. Accordingly this animal will be rejected from the application with a consequent reduction penalty of 2.56% on the remaining animals. Correspondence dated 19 November 2001 has issued to the person named informing him of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted two applications in respect of a total of ten animals for special beef premium under the 2001 scheme. The second application was randomly selected for field inspection at which greater than 20% identification and registration non-compliance was found &ndash; 12 out of 13 animals in the herd on the day of inspection were not registered and had no passports. The resultant penalty is no premium payable on animals applied on in the 12 months prior to the date of inspection. Consequently, no special beef premium payments are due to this person. The person named has sought a review of the findings at the inspection. He will be notified of the results of the review within the next two weeks.</P>

      <Quest>the position of the Government and his Department regarding article 67B of the EU regulations relating to prescription only animal medicines; his views on the representations to maintain the existing responsible supply chain where appropriate in order that previous acceptable practices for routine products such as worm doses, vaccines and basic antiseptics can continue without the requirement of a prescription; and if his Department has carried out an assessment of the effect such a regulation may have in terms of additional costs on farmers and the potential resultant usage of such basic products.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific proposal referred to forms one part of a package of proposals brought forward by the European Commission in July of this year in the context of a major reform of the EU legislation regulating both the human and veterinary medicines fields. This package of proposals falls to be dealt with under the co-decision procedure involving both the European Parliament and the European Council. As such, best estimates indicate that it will be at least two years before final decisions on the Commission's proposals will be taken by parliament and the council.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals have not yet been discussed in detail. My initial approach to such discussions will be to obtain clarification from the Commission on its proposal to make all medicines for food-producing animals subject to veterinary prescription, given that currently there is an absence of harmonization at EU level as regards the operation of prescription regimes. I might add that Ireland has already, prior to the emergence of these proposals, asked the Commission to address the harmonization issue in order to improve regulation of the EU veterinary medicines market. Among the key issues yet to be clarified are the principles which would govern prescribing activity and supply of medicines by veterinarians, the dispensing of prescriptions and also the specific range of products which would come within the scope of the prescription requirement. In the absence of such details, it is not possible to carry out a meaningful assessment of the potential effect of the Commission's proposals on the Irish regime which, I am glad to acknowledge, has by and large been working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this early stage in the EU decision-making process, it would not be appropriate for me to take an absolute position on one aspect of the Commission's package of proposals affecting the veterinary sector. Without prejudice to the position which I may adopt on the various detailed <Col N="740" /> elements, I can empathise with the overall stated objectives of the European Commission, which are fundamentally about enhancing the protection of European consumers and which also fully recognize the importance in this context of ensuring the availability of veterinary treatments. I will approach the discussions with a view to ensuring that the EU legislative framework resulting from the reform meets these objectives. In this regard, the views of all stakeholders will be fully taken into account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>Every year there is a delay in paying overtime at this time because payroll processing has to be anticipated to allow for the Christmas and new year holidays. This year there are two additional factors that require bringing forward the payroll processing to earlier than heretofore. Firstly, the end of the tax year is impacting at this point for the first time this year. This has a major effect on the scheduling because of the additional processing required. Second, many Departments, including the Department of Finance, have recently changed their payroll software in preparation for the euro changeover and so are operating end-of-year routines for the first time with new systems. Consequently, caution has to be exercised in the scheduling of the process to reduce the risk to the payment of the payrolls due in the early days of the new year.</P>
      <P>This compression of the processing necessarily requires the postponement until January of the overtime payments that would, in the normal course, have been paid in December. In compensation, weekly paid staff will be paid their basic salary in advance &ndash; the payment due on 21 December will be paid on 14 December and that due on 28 December will be advanced nine days to 19 December. By 21 December, basic pay will be in advance of normal, although overtime will be necessarily delayed.</P>

      <P>The business expansion scheme, BES, provides individual investors with tax relief in respect of an investment in companies carrying out certain activities, for example, manufacturing. A company can raise up to a maximum of £250,000, 317,500, under the scheme while the maximum amount an individual can claim tax relief for in any one year is £25,000, 31,750, which is reduced to £18,500, 23,495, for the short tax year 2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the BES is due to expire on 31 December 2001. I will be considering whether to extend the scheme for a further period during the preparations for the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill. I will bear in mind the investor and company limits in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The formation of economic and monetary union, EMU, including the establishment of the euro, are the culmination of a process of preparation which has been going on since the signing in 1992 of the Treaty of the European Union, the Maastricht Treaty. The Delors Committee report of 1989, together with the European Commission report &ldquo;One Market, One Money&rdquo; of 1990, laid the foundations for the provisions on EMU that are set out in the Maastricht Treaty. Among other provisions, the Maastricht Treaty provided, in essence, that member states which fulfilled the necessary conditions and which did not have an opt-out were to participate in EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treaty received widespread support in Ireland and the leaders of the four main political parties issued a joint statement urging a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on it held in June 1992. The treaty was endorsed by a substantial majority; just under 70% of those who voted were in favour of it. Essentially, therefore, it was the <Col N="743" /> people of Ireland who made the decision to join the euro, by way of referendum.</P>
    <P>The goal of qualifying for EMU membership has been a consistent element of the policy of successive Governments. The previous Government commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to conduct an independent study of the likely economic implications of EMU for Ireland, with particular reference to employment, in the context of various membership scenarios. Essentially the findings of the ESRI report were that, on balance, membership of EMU would be economically advantageous for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, the heads of state or government of the EU member states decided that 11 member states, including Ireland, qualified to form economic and monetary union, EMU, and to adopt the single currency, the euro, from 1 January 1999. On 6 May 1998, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, stated that membership of the euro was in Ireland's long-term strategic interests.</P>
    <P>In the lead-up to the EU leaders' decision, the Houses of the Oireachtas discussed Ireland's prospective participation in EMU on a number of occasions. In particular, I appeared before a joint meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Finance and the Public Service, and on Enterprise and Small Business, on 4 February 1998.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas has passed a significant body of legislation which was required for Ireland's participation in EMU. In particular, in February-March 1998, the Central Bank Act, 1998, was debated and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This Act was designed to bring the legislation governing the Central Bank of Ireland into conformity with the relevant provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank set out in Protocol No. 3 to that Treaty. Following publication in March 1998 of the convergence reports from the EMI, the European Commission and the Central Bank of Ireland, and the European Commission's recommendation, the Government introduced motions on Ireland's prospective participation in EMU in Dáil Éireann on 1 April and in Seanad Éireann on 7 April 1998. Both Houses noted the recommendation from the Commission that Ireland fulfilled the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. In introducing the debate in the Dáil, I stated that the reason I had put down this motion was to provide Dáil Éireann with the opportunity to discuss Ireland's prospective participation in economic and monetary union at the outset on 1 January 1999. I also stated that the people of Ireland decided by referendum in 1992 that we should participate in EMU if we qualified and the Government resolved to give effect to that decision. The Oireachtas also passed the Finance Act, 1998, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the taxation changes required for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, and the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998, which declared that by virtue of Council <Col N="744" /> Regulation (EC) No. 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State is the euro and the Irish pound is a subdivision of it.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1999 the euro has been usable in cashless form, cheque, direct debit, credit transfers. On 1 January next, euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation and the withdrawal of Irish pound notes and coins will begin.</P>

The value of claims for allowances would be dependent on the payment made for such licences, the individual's marginal rate of tax, the amount of qualifying income liable to tax at that rate and the number of licences which qualify for relief, those not used for trading purposes by their owners and exclusively let out would not qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr McCreevy Mr McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 to 261, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, already provides a scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. For tax relief purposes the qualifying expenditure is deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date or, if later, the date the taxi trade commenced.</P>
      <P>The capital allowances are available on the full cost of the taxi licence over a five year period, that is, at a rate of 20% per annum. The allowances for the tax year are deducted from the profits of the taxi trade for that year. Where the allowances exceed the profits in a year, the excess is carried forward to the following year or years. The value of any claim for allowances in any one year will depend on the cost of the licence, the individual's marginal rate of tax for the year in question and the amount of qualifying income liable to tax at that rate.</P>
      <P>The section provides that the write-off will be allowed against the trading income of the licence owner who drives the associated taxi. The cost will not be allowed where the licence owner rents out the licence and associated vehicle to another person except where a spouse inherits a licence from his/her deceased spouse. In the latter case the deceased spouse must have acquired the licence on or before 21 November 2000 and he/she had carried on a taxi trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, relief will not be denied where the taxi owner-driver rents the vehicle to others on a part-time basis. In this latter case the cost will be allowed against both the trading and the rental income from the vehicle in question. Where more than one licensed vehicle is operated in such a manner, the capital allowances will be available <Col N="747" /> only in respect of the cost of a licence relating to one vehicle.</P>
    <P>Claims for the capital allowances should be made to the individual's tax office. A claim should include details of the date the licence was acquired, the actual cost of the licence, the date the individual started the taxi trade and, where a licence has been part let, the percentage use of the taxi vehicle for trading and letting purposes. If the individual has already submitted a return of income in respect of the tax years for which the allowances are being claimed, these details should be forwarded in support of a written claim to the tax office. Otherwise the details should be included with the individual's return of income for the tax year or years in question.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of providing additional reliefs in relation to the introduction of wheelchair taxis, I have no plans to introduce any further such reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to vehicle road tax. If he meant vehicle registration tax, I have no plans to make any special concession to taxi drivers in this regard. If, however, he was referring to motor tax, which falls under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, I am informed that a concessionary rate of £49, 62, already applies to all small public service vehicles such as taxis.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated extra return to revenue resulting from the abolition of the employee PRSI thresholds at the present rate of PRSI, if the present rate is reduced by 1% and if the present rate is reduced by 2%.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the threshold at which persons enter the PRSI net and not the ceiling at which they leave it. The PRSI free exemption threshold is £226 &ndash; 287 &ndash; per week and applies to employees in classes A, E, B, C, D and H. The estimated extra revenue or yield from the abolition of the PRSI free exemption threshold for class A PRSI contributors, which represents the majority of contributors, is £30.5 million &ndash; 38.7 million, in a full year.</P>
      <P>The PRSI income would drop very considerably if the contribution rate for these classes were reduced by 1% or 2%. If such reductions were put in place and if the thresholds in question were then abolished, then the yield from the abolition would be reduced considerably. At a contribution rate of 3% the yield would be £23 million &ndash; 29.2 million &ndash; and at 2% the yield would be £15.25 million &ndash; 19.36 million &ndash; in respect of class A contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the question is about the yield from abolishing the employer PRSI ceiling, the position is as follows. The additional full year PRSI yield from the abolition of the employee <Col N="748" /> ceiling for all classes would be £129 million &ndash; 164 million. Reducing the employee PRSI contribution rate by 1% and 2% respectively, would in a full year cost £157 million &ndash; 199 million &ndash; and £314 million &ndash; 399 million. If at the same time, the ceiling were to be abolished these costs would be reduced by the £129 million &ndash; 164 million &ndash; referred to earlier in this paragraph.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year costs to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2002 incomes, of the change mentioned by the Deputy would depend on whether this is done by increasing the personal credits or the PAYE credit or some combination of the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> If the personal credits were used, the cost would be of the order of £676 million, 858 million. This measure would remove some 143,400 taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
    <P>If the PAYE credit alone were used, the cost would be in the region of £462 million, 587 million, and some 100,900 taxpayers would be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>These costings are based on a minimum wage of £4.70 per hour &ndash; 5.97 &ndash; per hour over a 39 hour week, for 52 weeks. These figures are provisional and are likely to be revised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently four EU directives awaiting implementation by my Department. Two EU directives relating to electronic money, e-money, are awaiting implementation by my Department and the details of these are set out below. It is regretted that due to a misinterpretation of the legislative requirements for transposition, only one of these was referred to in my earlier reply of 8 May last.</P>
      <P>Directive 2000/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000, amends Directive 2000/12/EC, relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions. This directive involves an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;credit institution&rdquo; in the general banking directives, to provide that any institution which issues e-money will be subject to supervision by the relevant competent authority in each member state. In Ireland's case, the relevant competent authority is the Central Bank of Ireland. This directive must be transposed into domestic law by 27 April 2002 at the latest. As such, a draft Statutory Instrument to effect transposition has been prepared by my Department and forwarded to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting. I expect that this Statutory Instrument should shortly be signed into law.</P>
      <P>The other EU e-money directive awaiting implementation is Directive 2000/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the taking up, pursuit of and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions. &ldquo;Electronic money&rdquo; is defined in the proposals as monetary value stored on an electronic device such as a chip card, pre-paid card or electronic purse, or on a computer memory, network or software money, and which is accepted as a means of payment by undertakings other than those of the issuer. In essence, these cards work on the same principle as a pre-paid mobile phone.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this directive is to improve the single market in financial services by introducing a minimum of harmonised rules for the business of issuing e-money. It creates legal certainty for issuers of e-money by setting up a special regulatory regime for e-money institutions, and introduces the concept of the single European passport for these institutions. The overall objective is to provide a regulatory framework that enables e-money to deliver its potential, while not hampering technological innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This directive must also be transposed into domestic law by 27 April 2002 at the latest. Consequently, my Department, in consultation <Col N="753" /> with the Central Bank, is currently preparing a draft statutory instrument which will transpose the provisions of the directive, and will shortly forward such to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting. Therefore, I am pleased to report that we are on schedule to meet the deadline of April next year.</P>
    <P>Directive 2001/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the re-organisation and winding up of credit institutions has yet to be implemented by my Department. This directive was agreed by Council on 12 March 2001. Under the directive, where a credit institution with branches in other member states fails, the winding up process will be subject to a single bankruptcy proceeding initiated in the member state where the credit institution has its registered office, known as the home state, and governed by a single bankruptcy law, that of the home state. This approach is consistent with the home country control principle that is the basis for the EU's banking directives. The directive will fill a major gap in the European Union's financial services legislation. It was identified as a top priority in the financial services action plan and the importance of its implementation was reiterated at the Lisbon Summit in March 1999.</P>
    <P>Currently, if a bank or credit institution with branches across Europe has to be wound up and its assets divided among its creditors, the authorities in each member state where the institution is represented can open separate insolvency proceedings. This can lead to conflicts of jurisdiction and means that creditors are not equally treated. Similarly, if an institution has to be reorganised to restore it to financial health, approaches in different member states can be divergent. While winding up and reorganisation proceedings are, hopefully, rare, the directive is designed to guarantee consumer protection in such instances. This is particularly important given the rapid expansion in financial services and the growth in personal investment and savings plans. The deadline for transposition of this Directive is 5 May 2004.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 2001/44/EC, which amends Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, and of agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value added tax and certain excise duties was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 15 June 2001. The directive is supposed to be transposed into national law before 30 June 2002.</P>
    <P>This directive is currently the subject of a legal dispute between the European Commission and the Council of the European Union regarding the appropriate EU treaty legal base, which may be decided by the European Court of Justice, thus it is unclear when this directive will be transposed into national law. Derogation has not been sought in the case of any of the directives listed above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under general tax law, the gain arising from shares acquired as a result of employee share options is chargeable partly to income tax &ndash; on the difference between the price paid for the shares and the market value at date of exercise of the option &ndash; and partly to capital gains tax &ndash; on the difference between the market value at the date of exercise and the proceeds received on any subsequent sale of the shares.</P>
      <P>The case had been made to me that the gain from such shares was more in the nature of a capital receipt than income and should, therefore, be charged to capital gains tax only. This treatment, it was argued, would help companies recruit and reward highly skilled and internationally mobile staff.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in this year's Finance Act, after extensive consultation with interested parties, I introduced a scheme providing for such tax treatment provided certain conditions were satisfied.</P>
      <P>For a scheme to qualify for this tax treatment, at least 70% of the options granted must be available to all employees on similar terms and the balance of up to 30% may be provided to key employees. There is also a minimum retention period of three years between the time the option is granted and the time the shares are actually sold by the individual.</P>
      <P>The all employee-similar terms rules are a feature of the other tax relieved employee share schemes. It was understood that the scheme as introduced would meet its objectives.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that to date two schemes out of 50 applications have been approved for the purpose of the relief and it is estimated that 4,101 individuals within these schemes could benefit from the new relief.</P>
      <P>Details of the cost of the scheme will not be available until early next year when the approved schemes must file returns. As I mentioned to the Deputy previously, as with all tax reliefs, I will be monitoring the operation of this particular scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that the VAT treatment of charitable and non-profit organisations is a direct consequence of EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. It is not within my power, therefore, to relieve the Louisburgh unit of the Order of Malta of the requirement to pay VAT on the medical equipment they have purchased.</P>

      <P>In Budget 2001, I announced the abolition of the PRSI contribution ceiling for both employers and the self-employed, consequently there is no contribution ceiling for both groups in 2002. The recently published Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) and Summary Public Capital Programme for 2002 reflects this fact. The employee PRSI contribution ceiling currently applied is £28,250, 35,870. The published Abridged Estimates Volume for 2002 reflects an increase in the employee ceiling in line with projected wage increases. The figure used is £30,500, 38,727.</P>

      <Quest>when it is intended to issue the certificate of tax free allowance for the tax year 2002; and the way in which he will treat the fact that by the time of issue, an arrears of tax refunds will have accumulated which will not be shown by issuing the weekly value of the full years tax credits.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that certificates of tax free allowances have been replaced by certificates of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they began issuing interim certificates of tax credits for the <Col N="756" /> tax year 2002 on 13 November 2001. As budget details will not be available until 5 December 2001, the interim certificates are based, with some exceptions, on the tax credits that taxpayers currently hold for the short tax year 2001.</P>
      <P>Where the personal circumstances of an individual taxpayer change, for example, if the taxpayer marries or becomes widowed, the taxpayer should notify his/her inspector of taxes who will amend the taxpayer's tax credits accordingly.</P>
      <P>The exceptions referred to in the first paragraph above are mainly tax relief for mortgage interest payments and premiums paid to medical insurance companies. With effect from 1 January 2002, income tax relief for these payments will be given at source by, respectively, the relevant lending institutions and medical insurance companies. Consequently, tax relief for these payments will not appear on the certificates of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point.</P>
      <P>Amended certificates reflecting relevant budget changes will issue in February/March 2002. These certificates will be effective retrospectively from 1 January 2002. Where refunds of tax arise, these will be made directly by employers to employees. An information leaflet accompanies each certificate.</P>

      <P>The yield for social insurance and the health levy contained in the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) and Summary Public Capital Programme for 2002 is based on the existing exemption limits and thresholds.</P>
      <P>The health levy is currently charged at 2% and is payable on all income from the first pound earned when weekly income exceeds £280, 356. It is applicable to all classes of contributors. Individuals who are medical card holders, or in receipt of widow's/widower's pension, one parent family payments or deserted wife's benefit/allowance are exempt.</P>
      <P>The PRSI employee exemption limit is £226, 287, per week and applies to classes A, E, B, C, D and H. The PRSI employee allowance in respect of class A &ndash; full employee PRSI rate of 4% &ndash; is £100, 127, per week on which the employees pay no PRSI contribution. This allowance also applies to classes E and H.</P>
      <P>The PRSI employee allowance for modified contributors, namely, public servants, is £20, 25.4, per week which applies to classes B, C and D.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="759" /> changeover to the euro has been a corporate priority since 1997. They have worked closely with public and private sector bodies in preparing Revenue's changeover plans. These plans are designed to meet the needs of both business and PAYE customers and are now being implemented.</P>
      <P>By way of brief overview, I might mention that since 1 January 1999, Revenue has provided businesses with the facility of conducting their tax and customs affairs in euro or Irish pounds. Take up has been quite low. Revenue's approach to the final changeover of tax and customs affairs to euro is designed to facilitate a smooth transition for all its customers. The plans for the migration of all Revenue business to euro are based on the assumption that the great majority of businesses will continue to trade and keep their accounts in Irish pounds up to 31 December 2001. Accordingly, where possible, businesses will be able to complete their returns in Irish pounds for periods up to 31 December 2001. Businesses, which wish to do so, may elect to complete these returns in euro. In this way, the burden of the final changeover on taxpayers can be minimised.</P>
      <P>An integral part of Revenue's euro changeover preparation is keeping business and the public informed as to its changeover plans. To date, Revenue has distributed over 240,000 business guides, 8,000 posters, and various leaflets, newsletters, etc. They have also provided information for inclusion in the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland booklet, recently distributed to all households, and various publications produced by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign. Revenue intends to issue further notices/reminders to businesses.</P>
      <P>Revenue's customer focused approach to the changeover and its rigorous information campaign will help to ensure that the changeover to the euro is as simple and straightforward as possible for all taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I should also say that I have put arrangements in place so that Revenue, in line with all Departments, provides monthly progress reports to Government on implementing its euro preparations. I am pleased to report that Revenue's changeover plans are progressing on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in this year's Finance Act the various tax reliefs for third level education were merged into a single relief and the relief was considerably widened. Generally speaking, the new relief now covers fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. The <Col N="760" /> scheme also applies to fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Courses may be either full or part-time. Undergraduate courses must be of at least two academic years' duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years' duration.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for relief. The relief is available at the standard rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The maximum relief that can be claimed is set annually by the Minister for Education and Science. It is currently £2,500, 3,175, per year in respect of third level fees. In the case of fees for training courses in foreign languages and information technology, the maximum relief is set at £1,000, 1,270, and no relief is due where the fees for the course are less than £250, 315.</P>
      <P>No relief is available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the inspection of pre-school facilities under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, rests with the health boards and the area health boards in the eastern region. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of each health board and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to reply directly to the Deputy with the information sought in respect of their area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that a review of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, will commence shortly. A review group is being established to undertake the work and nominations have been invited. The review group will include representatives from the health boards, the national voluntary child care organisations, the National Children's Office; relevant Departments such as my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and a parent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitment to the development of child care supply in Ireland having identified it as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A sustained level of funding has been allocated to the equal opportunities child care programme, which is administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This programme, announced in April 2000, now has an overall budget of £344 million for child care service delivery and includes capital grants for community based and self-employed private child care providers and staffing grants for community based child care providers. Funding in excess of £76 million, 96 million, nationally has been allocated to date including £64 million, 80 million, to child care services on the ground. This funding will support over 25,000 child care places nationally including the creation of over 11,000 new child care places.</P>

NOVA is designed to complement the ongoing work already being carried out by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
      <P>Funding of the office is a joint arrangement between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. My Department directly funds the office manager post in NOVA to the tune of approximately £25,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The office offers the following services to victims of abuse: confidential freefone helpline; assistance to persons wishing to trace their records; referral service to persons wishing to avail of literacy services, health services, the national counselling service, education and other appropriate social services.</P>
      <P>The office is located at 19 Upper Ormond Quay, Dublin 7 and the opening hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. The office also operates a freefone service at 1800 25 25 24.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 25 October I informed the House that the chairperson of the Lindsay Tribunal had stated <Col N="768" /> she did not believe it would be correct for her to consent to an amendment of her terms of reference to enable the tribunal to investigate the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies. She stated that she believed it would be fundamentally unfair to the parties before the tribunal and to the persons who have co-operated with the tribunal to alter the terms of reference in the manner suggested at this very late stage in its work.</P>
      <P>I also informed the House that, notwithstanding the complex legal difficulties associated with an Irish tribunal seeking to investigate entities in other jurisdictions, I was consulting the Attorney General in relation to the options available. Following those consultations, the Government agreed that I should appoint a senior counsel to produce a report about the position in Ireland and the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and Hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</P>
      <P>On 7 November I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to investigate and consider what steps are open to the State to instigate an effective inquiry into matters arising outside the State which relate to the infection of persons with haemophilia in Ireland. In the course of his investigations, he will consider the legal opinions and advice obtained to date both by my Department and by the Irish Haemophilia Society on the issue of obtaining documentation in the United States.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gardiner will travel as soon as possible to the United States where he will visit with and take legal advice from US lawyers in relation to an application being made for access to the document depository in Pensacola, Florida. This depository was created to ensure that all American HIV infected haemophiliacs had access to a similar quality and volume of documentation in relation to their litigation against the pharmaceutical companies. It had been suggested that the imminent closure of the depository would affect any attempt by an Irish entity to access these documents.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House, assurances have been furnished that, while there is a possibility that these documents may be moved to a different site or sites, they will not be destroyed. Lead counsel for the depository has also given an assurance to the IHS solicitors that, should the pharmaceutical companies seek the return of their documents, this will be opposed.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gardiner will ascertain the legal position regarding the maintenance of the documentation in the depository, and the possibility of ensuring the documentation is retained at its current location. He will liaise with the solicitors acting for the IHS and will be happy to consider any suggestions which they might make in relation to his investigations. On completion of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner will complete a report on all the relevant matters and submit it to me for presentation to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> For any decision to be made on an Irish entity attempting to investigate entities outside the jurisdiction, it will be necessary for the Government to have as much information as can be gathered with regard to such a process taking place. I am confident the process now in train is the optimum method by which this can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, four dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, commenced training in October 2001 for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £2.34 million &ndash; 2.971 million &ndash; has been approved for the ERHA for orthodontic services this year, of which £1.61 million &ndash; 2.044 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling the health board to recruit additional staff. The authority has also developed an additional six surgery facility and a five surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit respectively. Furthermore, under this initiative my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic <Col N="770" /> practitioners and in out of hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 3,288 patients in treatment in the authority. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

      <P>It is a priority that sufficient numbers of physiotherapists are employed in the public health service to ensure that all persons requiring treatment receive treatment within a reasonable timeframe. In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions and the delivery of therapy services nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals is essential over the next 15 years, including a doubling in the number of physiotherapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 25 course places for physiotherapy. I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond quickly to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

The use of occupational therapy staff from the health boards to carry out assessments is entirely a matter for discussion between the health boards and the local authorities. Copies of the Deputy's questions have been referred to the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matters and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parent's nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. Instructions as to how the payments should be made issued recently from my Department and funding has been made available to commence the making of these payments from 1 November 2001.</P>

These are Warrenstown House and Court Hall in Dublin and St. Anne's Children's Centre in Galway. The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient units be developed throughout the country. The recommended size for each unit is 20 beds providing six beds for the under 12 age group and 14 beds for the 12 to 16 years age group. Funding for five of these units is being provided under the national development plan. The units will be located in Cork, Galway, Limerick and two in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the <Col N="775" /> responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, a dentist for the South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; SEHB &ndash; commenced training in October 2001 for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £150,000 &ndash; 190,000 &ndash; has been approved to the SEHB for orthodontic services this year, of which £100,000 &ndash; 127,000 &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This has enabled the health board to recruit additional staff. Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out of hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, when fully implemented, this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

      <P>Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way patients in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care, patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated will depend on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in an area.</P>
      <P>Health board consultant orthodontists recommended that the 1985 guidelines be modified to prioritise treatment for the most severe categories of patients. My Department will be writing to the chief executive officers of the health boards concerning the operation of these modified guidelines with regard to maintaining the delivery of orthodontic services in a prioritised way.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. It is expected that phase one will be completed by December 2002. To date over 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. Counties Longford, Westmeath, Meath and areas of Dublin have been screened and BreastCheck is currently screening more areas in Dublin and County Louth and County Kildare. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the health boards concerning the roll out of the programme nationwide.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme was launched in October 2000 to cover the Mid-Western Health Board area. Under phase one, cervical screening is being offered free of charge to approximately 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group at five yearly intervals. As with BreastCheck, it is important to have a national cervical screening programme which is underpinned by quality assurance and best practice. The experience gained from phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll out of this programme. Currently the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a recent initiative which involved the health promotion unit of my Department, the universities and third level institutions and the Union of Students in Ireland coming together to formulate a response to growing concerns about high-risk drinking among students and its impact on student attrition and academic performance.</P>
      <P>One of the actions called for in the national alcohol policy was the development of a campus alcohol policy which would promote sensible drinking among students and limit campus-related drinks industry sponsorship. Following discussions among a number of colleges, a working group was established consisting of representatives from the third level institutions and universities, the Union of Students in Ireland and the national alcohol policy adviser to the health promotion unit of my Department to develop such a policy. The University of Limerick hosted the working group's meetings and the Higher Education Authority also provided support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The framework document for developing a college alcohol policy, which I launched last month, outlines a comprehensive strategy to enable each third level institution and university to develop a policy suitable to its own requirements. It also outlines public health alcohol policy and discusses the college environment and student life in that context. The aims and objectives of a college alcohol policy are described. The actual policy formulation process is outlined and the drafting, review and evaluation of an action plan are recommended. Five specific topics for inclusion in the policy document are included. The document also provides contact details for the local support services around the country and other relevant organisations. Three examples of a college alcohol policy are provided. I am confident that this framework document will be of great assistance to colleges and universities in their development of campus alcohol policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the submission by the post polio support group the Deputy refers to was in preparation for the European Union Health Council meeting on 15 November last. My Department is well aware of the services that people require to combat the late effects of polio.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office this Government has allocated just over £107 million, 135.86 million, for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £23.325 million, 29.616 million, has been provided specifically for aids and appliances. Currently, a full year cost of £6 million, 7.618 million, for personal assistant services is being provided which will fund an additional 312 personal assistants over the next two years to provide a service for approximately 230 clients. This level of funding is indicative of this Government's on-going commitment to the development of the broad range of home support services which are required to enable people with disabilities to live as independently as possible and also to provide relief to a significant number of carers.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. The programme for prosperity and fairness states that the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance will set up and participate in a working group which will consult with the social partners to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. The working group has commenced its work. It is being chaired by the Department of Health and Children and includes representatives of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Department of Finance, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nation wide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and <Col N="786" /> demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last. It concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next fifteen years including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third-level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, plans are in train to relocate the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, to the Mater Hospital campus and a number of steering groups are in place to plan for the development of facilities on the new site. The new hospital will be the largest in the State and will serve the catchment area of north Dublin and the wider community through its tertiary specialities. In this regard funding in the region of £180 million, 228.6 million &ndash; October 1999 prices &ndash; has been identified in the national development plan for the re-development of the Mater campus.</P>
      <P>A design brief for the development has been completed and approved by my Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The main clinical areas to be provided in the development are: accident and emergency department; out-patient day care and ambulatory care facilities; operating theatres including day surgery; sterile supplies; heart/lung transplant facilities; ITU-HDU; pathology; diagnostic imaging; pharmacy; new children's hospital and physical medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to proposals for the future use of the existing Temple Street buildings, I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is responsible for the funding of services at both the Mater and the children's hospitals, that a working group is being set up in conjunction with <Col N="787" /> the Sisters of Mercy to consider the issue. All options regarding health service provision will be considered by the group including the possibility of developing a service for older people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances justify it. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the PPF a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. This review has been completed recently and I understand that the chief executive officers will present a report of their findings to my Department shortly. This report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is taking place in the context of the new health strategy.</P>

      <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of work force requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next fifteen years including a fourfold <Col N="790" /> increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the Report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority.

Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapists in County Meath rests with the North Eastern Health Board.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 347 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984, my Department sponsored a national survey of children's dental health. The survey was conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre in Cork and showed that residents of fluoridated communities had significantly lower levels of dental caries than residents of non-fluoridated communities. These lower levels were, in the main, attributable to the fluoridation of <Col N="791" /> water. During the 1990s, health boards, in conjunction with the Oral Health Services Research Centre, have undertaken local studies of the effects of fluoridation. These show diminished levels of dental decay, particularly marked in lifetime residents of fluoridated areas.</P>
    <P>A national survey of children's dental health is currently under way in health boards. A similar survey is taking place simultaneously in Northern Ireland which is non-fluoridated. The results of this survey will yield important information regarding water fluoridation. The survey is expected to be completed in April 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 348 to 350, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fluoridation of public piped water supplies is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The regulations provide that the amount of fluorine which may be added to a water supply shall contain not more than one part of fluorine per million parts of water and not less than eight tenths of a part of fluorine per million parts of water. The levels of heavy metals in drinking water are monitored through EU drinking water directives that are given effect in Irish law by statutory regulation. The regulation specifies that the levels of fluoride in drinking water should not exceed 1 mg <Col N="792" /> of fluoride per litre of water. The levels for lead and arsenic are 0.01 mg per litre and 0.01 mg per litre respectively. I understand that the general level of fluoride in fluoride toothpastes is between 1,000 and 1,500 parts per million.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the eight regional health boards, has awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, to advise health boards on an up-to-date status report on all aspects relating to fluoride use including water fluoridation and fluoride intake in the Irish population. The status report is due late next year. In addition, I established a forum on fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. It held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the forum are as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; to report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually. I understand from the chairman of the forum that its report will be available to me in December 2001 and I expect that it will deal comprehensively with the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Income guidelines to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for the health services are revised annually in line with the consumer price index by the chief executives of the health boards <Col N="795" /> or authority. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The recent Book of Estimates takes account of this process as well as the recent extension of medical cards to people over the age of 70 years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the PPF, a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to provide a subsidy from public funds for the ongoing costs of recycling operations.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, it is right that waste generators should pay directly the full costs of waste collection, treatment and disposal. In support of this approach, producer responsibility initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste &ndash; Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics. In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or, alternatively, to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question. These schemes in turn provide a subsidy for the collection and recovery of material for recycling, which provides economic support for the recycling sector.</P>
      <P>It is intended that similar producer responsibility initiatives will be extended to other waste streams in the future, for example, end-of-life vehicles, tyres, waste electronic and electrical equipment etc. These initiatives, together with the increasing cost of landfilling waste, will further stimulate and improve the economics of recycling in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Capital funding for suitable waste management projects, including recycling initiatives, will also be made available under a new scheme of capital grants for waste recovery infrastructure, which I intend to announce shortly. The environment fund, which will be funded by the proposed levies on plastic shopping bags and landfilling, will provide another source of potential future support for recycling.</P>

      <P>Under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended by the 1992 Act, any person may apply to the High Court seeking an order prohibiting unauthorised development or use of land. The court may, on foot of such an application, require that the development or unauthorised use be discontinued and, in so far as is practicable, that the land be restored to its condition prior to the commencement of the development or unauthorised use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar provisions, suitably simplified and strengthened, will operate under section 160 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which will soon be commenced. I consider that strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. The new legislative provisions will address concerns about lack of enforcement and will include, in particular, a requirement on local authorities to keep complainants updated as enforcement actions <Col N="808" /> proceed. I propose to commence the enforcement provision, together with the general development control provisions, early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The information sought is not available in my Department. The resourcing of the county/city development boards, CDBs, is primarily the responsibility of the county/city local authorities in the light of their role as lead agencies for the CDB process. Within this framework, the funding of the CDBs is determined by local authorities in the context of their annual estimates. It is also open to other public agencies represented on the CDBs to make a contribution to the resourcing of the CDBs and, where appropriate, such agencies are encouraged to do so.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 2001, I provided a total of £1 million, 1.27 million, in funding through my Department's Vote to resource the community and voluntary fora, which have been established in each county and city as part of the CDB process.</P>

      <P>An updated review of the preliminary report prepared for the Milltown sewerage scheme in 1994 was submitted to my Department by Galway County Council earlier this month but has not been approved.</P>
      <P>The scheme was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02 announced in July 2000. Because of the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I would stress that in considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes, one has to take into account that such schemes are voluntary arrangements between an employer and employees.</P>
      <P>However, I am anxious that, where such occupational schemes exist, the question of indexation is considered and the members of the scheme are made aware of the results of this review. In the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which is currently before the Seanad, I have set out proposals to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>For schemes that do not provide indexation, the Bill proposes a mandatory review by the trustees of the scheme in relation to the possibility of indexing pensions in line with the consumer price index, CPT, or 4%, whichever is the lower. The outcome of this review and the employers, response, where required by the rules of the scheme, must be published in the annual report. I believe that this is the best approach to ensuring that proper consideration is given to the viability of the pension industry payments in line with the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a <Col N="812" /> weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6, 7.62. This £6, 7.62, represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Most recipients pay more than £6, 7.62, towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>SWA is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years which allow people on approved employment schemes such as community employment, CE, to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250, 317.43, per week and certain other conditions.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000, substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The £250, 317.43, per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four.</P>
      <P>As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
      <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA for participants of CE schemes. All participants in CE schemes are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA described earlier, whichever is the greater. The level of payments made to employers and employees under the CE scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments in recent years has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s). Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy approach, substantial additional resources have been invested in the child benefit scheme since this Government came into office. Over our first three budgets annual expenditure on child benefit increased to £575 million, 730.1 million, a rise of more than 40% on pre-election levels. Following payment in June of the significant increases in child benefit rates of £25, 31.74, and £30, 38.09, per month respectively, total expenditure on child benefit is now over £900 million, 1.143 billion, per year. I believe that investment in the child benefit scheme is still the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>

      <P>The Christmas bonus has, since its inception, been paid as a percentage of the person's entitlement from this Department, subject, in recent years, to a minimum payment being made. The bonus this year, for the second year in a row, will be at the rate of 100% of the normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20 and will be paid during the week commencing Monday, 3 December. It is estimated that some 1.2 million people, comprising 780,000 recipients and 400,000 dependants will benefit at an estimated cost of £79.1 million. It is understood that people who are getting British <Col N="814" /> retirement pension will also receive a bonus from the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the national and smokeless fuel schemes is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to receive a payment a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment and satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>Fuel allowances are means tested payments that are not age related. The free schemes, on the other hand, are payable mostly to pensioners and are an important part of the package of supports for people of retirement age. This is the reason for the different treatment of fuel allowances and free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, in recent years I have extended the duration of the fuel season from 26 <Col N="816" /> weeks to 29 weeks and introduced substantial improvements in the means test which mean that a person may now have a combined household income of up to £40, 50.79, per week or savings-investments of up to £30,000, 38,092, over and above the maximum contributory pension rate and still qualify for fuel allowance. I recognise the importance of fuel allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. To remove the means test for people over 70 years would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>There are two directives relating to my Department awaiting transposition into Irish law. These are Council Directive 98/49/EC, which was adopted on 29 June 1998, and Council Directive 2000/43/EC, which was adopted on 29 June 2000. Directive 98/49/EC deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>This directive was adopted on 29 June 1998. Member states were required to comply with the directive by July 25, 2001 and member states are to communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this directive by 25 January 2002. The Pensions Act is already largely in compliance with the terms of the directive. However, some minor changes are required to that Act to ensure full compliance. These have been incorporated in the forthcoming pensions Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The aim is to have the pensions Bill fully enacted as early as possible in 2002 and I will then be in a position to inform the European Commission that we are in full compliance with the directive. In view of this, the Government did not consider it necessary to seek a derogation in relation to the date of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 2000/43/EC relates to implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons <Col N="817" /> irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. The purpose of the directive is to allow the participation of all persons, natural and legal, in society regardless of racial or ethnic origin. This directive was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 29 June 2000. While primary responsibility for its implementation rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the scope of the directive includes social security. Consideration is being given to any changes in the social welfare code which may be necessary for compliance with the directive, for implementation not later than the deadline of 19 July 2003.</P>

In May 1999 five regional committees were established to oversee the implementation of partnership across my Department's network of headquarter, regional and local offices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The steering committee and regional committees are comprised of management, union and staff representatives. The aim is to achieve common ownership of the Department's modernisation programme and to provide ways of involving staff in decisions affecting their work and the work of my Department generally. The partnership committees have discussed a wide variety of issues since their establishment, including human resources management, customer service, the strategy statement and performance management and development.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to bring partnership to local level where its benefits can be most apparent to staff and, in this regard, a total of 30 local committees have been set up in my Department which now has the most extensive partnership structures in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The programme to extend and strengthen partnership is continuing with the aim of embedding the process in all areas of the organisation, particularly in the larger offices. Appropriate training is provided to staff involved in the committees.</P>
      <P>The partnership process is currently being evaluated across the Civil Service and its further development in my Department will be informed by this review along with some internal review work which is being carried out as part of a new training programme from the steering committee and the five regional committees.</P>

      <Col N="819" /> To qualify for unemployment assistance a person must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a deciding officer, that he/she is available for and making genuine efforts to return to work. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate this. Any efforts the person has made to obtain any employment, whether in the immediate locality or otherwise, to avail of services such as FÁS or local employment, or to access any training available, will be taken into account by the deciding officer when deciding the case.</P>
    <P>A deciding officer will also take into account the economic environment and employment opportunities available. However, deciding officers are not required to refer claimants to specific employment opportunities nor could their decisions be conditional on them being in a position to do so.</P>

      <Quest>the items which are disregarded in the means test for a rent or mortgage supplement where the applicant has a working spouse or where the applicant is working part-time or is unemployed; if these income disregards are indexed or are subject to alteration in the Budget Statement or in the Estimates.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf on my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test in which total household income, including that of a working spouse, is taken into account. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the household, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6, 7.62. This £6, 7.62, represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6, 7.62, towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>SWA is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years now which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment, CE, to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250, 317.43, per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test was eased with the introduction <Col N="821" /> of a disregard for the back to work allowance, BTWA, and family income supplement, FIS, in the assessment of means for the £250, 317.43, gross household income limit. PRSI and any reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
    <P>April 2000 also saw an increase from £50, 63.49, to £75, 95.23, in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which is disregarded in the assessment of means for rent or mortgage interest supplement. In addition to this I also introduced a new disregard to benefit people who take up part-time employment or participate in approved training courses. The first £25, 31.74, of their earnings is disregarded in the means test.</P>
    <P>Other improvements were also introduced during 2000. An employment programme for those who were unemployed for five years and over was introduced with effect from 21 August 2000. Participants on the scheme will receive an additional payment of £35, 44.44, per week for up to six weeks compulsory training with an employer followed by an automatic transfer to the back to work scheme when the person takes up regular employment. There will also be two payments of £200, 253.95, after the person joins the BTWA programme. All these payments are disregarded in the assessment of the gross household £250, 317.43, income limit for the purposes of rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>The method of the means test calculation for rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected next year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the fuel allowance that applies nationally and of the additional supplement which applies in smoke free areas; and the areas where the smokeless fuel supplement applies.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5, 6.35, per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3, 3.81, per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total <Col N="822" /> amount in those areas to £8, 10.16, per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3, 3.81, per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>The average weekly number of recipients of the fuel allowances in the 2000-01 fuel season was 287,400. Approximately 175,000 of these received £5, 6.35, per week, over 112,000 received £8, 10.16, per week and less than 3,000 received £3, 3.81, per week. Total expenditure on the scheme in the 2000-01 fuel season was £49.9 million.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment as set out in the following tabular statement, live alone or with qualified dependents, be a carer, a person in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance payments or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P Just="Center">List of qualifying payments:</P>
      <P>Old age contributory or non-contributory pension</P>
      <P>Retirement pension</P>
      <P>Widow's or widower's contributory or non-contributory pension</P>
      <P>Employment schemes, for example, back-to-work, back to work enterprise allowance, job start, revenue job assist, job initiative</P>
      <P>Unemployability supplement</P>
      <P>Blind persons pension</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension</P>
      <P>Disability pension</P>

      <P>Social security pension-benefit from another country</P>
      <P>Special Department of Defence allowance.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Applicants must also satisfy a means test. Substantial improvements in the means test were introduced in recent budgets. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £40, 50.79, a week or savings-investments of up to £32,500, 41,266, over and above the maximum contributory pension rate and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Participants in approved employment schemes may retain entitlement to fuel allowances subject to a weekly household income limit of £250, 317.43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The smokeless fuel allowance of £3, 3.81, per week, was introduced in October 1990, to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. This allowance has been extended to cover Cork city and adjacent areas from 1995, designated areas in Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford from October 1998 and to Galway <Col N="823" /> City, Waterford City, Celbridge, Leixlip and Naas from October 2000.</P>
    <P>The list of qualifying payments is as follows: old age contributory or non-contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's or widower's contributory or non-contributory pension, employment schemes, for example, back-to-work, back to work enterprise allowance, job start, revenue job assist. job initiative, unemployability supplement, blind persons pension, invalidity pension, disability pension, deserted wives benefit or allowance, one-parent family payment, orphans contributory allowance, orphans non-contributory pension, farm assist, pre-retirement allowance, prisoners wives allowance, long-term unemployment assistance &ndash; including smallholders, disabled persons rehabilitation allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, basic supplementary welfare allowance, social security pension/benefit from another country and special Department of Defence allowance.</P>

      <Col N="824" /> Example: A person with savings of £16,000, 20,315.81, would be assessed with means of £6, £7.62, per week. A person with savings of £25,000, 31,743.45, would be assessed with means of £20, 25.39, per week.</P>
    <P>In so far as it relates to old age non-contributory pension, blind pension, widow/widower's non-contributory pension, one-parent family payment payable in respect of a widow/widower and orphan's non-contributory pension, the revised assessment took effect from 13 October 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Explosives Act, 1875, fireworks are deemed to be explosives. Accordingly, they may not be imported into the State except under an importation licence granted by my Department. It is a long standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by knowledgeable and professional operators. The following are the conditions which are attached to the importation licences. The organisers and operators must co-operate fully with all instructions issued by the Garda Síochána and the fire authorities and the display must be conducted at all times with due regard to public safety. In addition, the fireworks must be classified and labelled in accordance with the UN hazard classification system; be packed in accordance with the <Col N="827" /> UN recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods; conform with the requirements of the Classification and the Labelling of Explosives Order, 1994, S.I. No. 450 of 1994; be conveyed in accordance with the provisions of the European agreement on the international carriage of dangerous goods by road; be retained in their parent packs during any period of transport and storage; be stored in a safe and suitable place with all due regard to public safety.</P>
      <P>The current restrictive policy for the granting of importation licences for fireworks is aimed at protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks while at the same time ensuring that they are not deprived of the spectacle of fireworks. However, as I have indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject, my Department is reviewing the legislation relating to explosives and this review will extend to the law and the policy on the regulation and control of fireworks.</P>

Given that the persons in question are not cur<Col N="828" /> rently legally resident in the State I am not in a position to give an undertaking that they will be allowed re-enter the State after the Christmas holidays. However, they are in a position to request that their application for residency on the basis of an Irish born child be pursued in their absence.</P>

      <P>In October 2000, the Government approved my proposals for a Garda recruitment competition and the recruitment of 500 Garda trainees from that competition in 2001. This follows on from decisions to recruit 550 trainees in each of the years 1998 and 1999 and 500 trainees in 2000. The latest recruitment competition will fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the strength of the force to 12,000 &ndash; the highest ever in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of An Garda Síochána, as at 1 November 2001, was 11,759.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the workload of the forensic science laboratory has been on the increase in recent years. The Government's approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage and Garda operations, such as Dóchas and Cleanstreet, have resulted in significant drug seizures and continue to prove effective in targeting on-street drug dealing.</P>
      <P>I am aware that these operations, in addition to the dramatic increase this year, arising from the foot and mouth situation, in referrals to the laboratory of cattle ear tags for examination and other factors have led to an increase in the workload of the forensic science laboratory.</P>
      <P>In relation to the processing of evidence I am informed that the management of the laboratory has instituted a procedure whereby any cases, where it is notified that the result is urgently required, are expedited. The quality of the forensic evaluation and evidence provided by the forensic science laboratory to the courts has always been held in high esteem. It is my intention to ensure that this situation will continue and that no prosecutions will be dropped or cases collapse due to delays in the processing of evidence by the laboratory.</P>

      <P>Various non-EEA national members of this family have arrived in Ireland since 1992 and have remained here without permission other than temporary permission granted as visitors upon entry. Despite requests from this office and the local Garda registration office the extended family have failed to supply adequate documentation relating to their purpose of residence here, including details of their various business undertakings, which would enable my Department reach a decision on whether they should be granted permission to remain. If the persons concerned forward documentation relating to the grounds on which they are seeking residency, their case will be fully considered. Financial documentation, including details of property owned, tax returns, company accounts and so on, should be supplied. The persons in question will be expected to respond to requests from my Department for further information and additional documentation in this regard if required. The Department has no record of having received applications for citizenship in respect of the persons referred to.</P>

      <P>Section 23 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which came into operation on 18 October 1999, states that any act, request or conduct, including the display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material in the workplace, shall constitute sexual harassment if the act, request or conduct is unwelcome and could reasonably be regarded as sexually &ndash; or otherwise on gender grounds &ndash; offensive, humiliating or intimidating. An employer may be liable for sexual harassment of his-her employees by a co-worker or by a client, customer or other business contact unless the employer takes such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent the harassment. An employer is, therefore, entitled to request an employee to remove pornographic material from the workplace. I am satisfied that there is not a loophole in the Act. It is also worth pointing out that irrespective of the content of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, any person in control of premises is entitled to prohibit the display of offensive material on the premises.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, grants for child care service providers are available under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06. The programme is funded by the Government and the European Union under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Between 1998 and 1999 the programme allocated £3.9 million in the Dublin area for training and development projects, staffing and capital costs of child care groups and as part of the employer demonstration initiative. The main focus of the funding provided under the 1998-99 programme was on quality improvement through the funding of training, development and community support initiatives and as such, details on the number of child care places were not captured under that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2000 I launched the current programme, which is making £344 million, or 437 million, available nationally for the development of child care service provision. Under this programme the first grant allocations were announced in July 2000 and since then I have <Col N="836" /> allocated more than £76 million, or 96 million, nationally which includes more than £64 million, or 80 million, to child care services on the ground and more than £12 million, or almost 16 million, on quality improvement projects. This funding will support more than 25,000 child care places nationally, including more than 11,000 new child care places. Since the first announcement of grants under the programme in July 2000, I have allocated more than £18 million, or 20 million, to 175 projects in County Dublin under the capital and staffing grant schemes of the child care programme. This funding will support 6,318 child care places and lead to the creation of 2,793 new child care places in County Dublin. The funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow child care providers to extend their opening hours.</P>

      <P>Under the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, sex offenders are obliged to notify the Garda Síochána of their names and addresses within a specified time of their conviction or release from serving a custodial sentence, whichever is applicable. Any changes to those names and addresses also have to be notified. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that the Garda Síochána has up-to-date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. This in itself should act as a deterrent to reoffending and so contribute towards their rehabilitation. In addition, the availability of up-to-date data will be of particular benefit to the Garda in the investigation and prevention of sexual crimes.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Act is a matter for the Garda Síochána. Information will only be disclosed to other persons in the most exceptional circumstances in order to prevent an immediate crime or to alert members of the public to an apprehended danger and then only on a strict need-to-know basis. As the Deputy will appreciate, any widespread or inappropriate disclosure of names could have undesirable consequences such as public disorder or attacks on persons, even on persons wrongly identified. Victims who have concerns regarding offenders should contact their local Garda station.</P>

    <P>In relation to the number of applications for residency rights, records are not maintained in such a way as to enable these figures to be extracted without the diversion of a disproportionate amount of staff resources. However, all non-EEA nationals require the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to remain in the State and applications to do so are received on a wide variety of grounds. The total number of non-EEA nationals with permission to remain registered with the Garda authorities &ndash; other than those permitted to remain solely in order to pursue an asylum claim &ndash; was approximately 47,000 in 2000, 29,000 in 1999, 22,000 in 1998 and 18,000 in 1997. I also refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 661 of 6 November 2001, the answer to which provided details of applications received for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child.

      <P>The statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that 139 states have signed the statute and, of these, 44 have ratified it. It will be necessary for my Department to introduce implementing legislation to give effect to the terms of the statute in Irish law following the successful outcome of the constitutional referendum earlier this year. The Rome statute is a very complex instrument that requires detailed consideration to establish exactly what will be required by way of legislation to enable us to ratify it. Even a cursory examination of the statute will give an idea of the intricate issues to be dealt with and the legislation required to give it effect in Irish law will be very substantial.</P>
      <P>A careful and detailed examination of the statute is taking place in my Department in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be taken in order so that we will be in a position to meet our obligations under the statute. I am happy to report that substantial progress is being made in this regard. The legislative changes needed to give effect to the statute in law, following completion of this examination, will be introduced as soon as possible, having regard to other high priority legislative requirements.</P>

      <P>While I am reluctant to comment on individual cases, I can inform the Deputy that the person referred to was approved three <Col N="841" /> overnights compassionate temporary release to visit his ill father. This period of temporary release, in common with all such releases, was subject to conditions which included good behaviour during his period of release and that he return to the prison at an appointed time.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that temporary release was granted on the understanding that the offender would not be returning to his home area. This was deemed appropriate in this case in order to lessen the possibility of him encountering a relative of the victim while on temporary release. By its nature, this type of temporary release is unsupervised, but I have to say that I am not aware of any evidence that the temporary release in this case was used for any purpose other than that for which it was granted, or that any of the conditions attaching to the temporary release were breached.</P>

      <P>Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants are allocated to clubs and organisations for the development of sports and recreational facilities. Among the aims and objectives of the programme are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities, to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sports and recreation, to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities and to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications received under the programme are treated on their merits and assessed in accordance with the detailed criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. Projects must be directly related to the provision of sports and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature. High priority projects include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance such as pitch development, floodlighting or dressing rooms and showers. All funding has been allocated under the 2001 programme. An application for funding for equipment was received from the Lough Dan Adventure Centre but following the assessment process the application was unsuccessful and this decision was conveyed by my Department to the organisation in a letter dated 13 June 2001. I will be announcing the 2002 sports capital programme <Col N="842" /> within the next few weeks and it will be open to Scouting Ireland to make an application for funding in respect of the Lough Dan Adventure Centre.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, 2000-2002 administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report; contract document; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council submitted a proposal on behalf of Loughrea Swimming Pool Company Limited to my Department in relation to a proposed new pool at Loughrea. My Department has approved the appointment of consultants for the preliminary report stage of this proposal. Further consideration will be given to the proposal when the preliminary report is submitted by the council. Grant-aid is not allocated to any project until such time as tenders for the project have been received.</P>
      <P>Grants of up to £3 million are to be made available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. These revised grant levels will operate to the end of the current three year programme in 2002.</P>

This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the proposed project for Clontibret primary school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard in recent years two grants have issued from my Department directly to primary and post-primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was called a library grant and was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant that issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320. A second grant issued to all primary and post primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Post primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level, the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million. Coon national school received a total of £1,462 under the above two grant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where mainstream national schools are allocated resource teaching provision for the support of special needs pupils, a start-up grant for <Col N="851" /> textbooks and materials amounting to £500 is paid to the base school together with an annual grant thereafter of £250. However, it is important to distinguish between arrangements relating to the funding of schools' operating costs and funding requirements which might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires a special piece of equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment. My Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised equipment for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system. Should the school referred to by the Deputy wish to apply for additional funding for special equipment such application should be made through the local school inspector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 70% funding figure quoted by the Deputy refers to a comparison between the net expenditure from the Education Votes contained in the 1997 and 2001 Revised Estimates volumes and which also takes into account an additional <Col N="853" /> provision of £71 million from the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund for expenditure in 2001. For the purposes of valid comparison, expenditure on sport programmes and An Gúm, which were subsequently transferred to other Departments, have been excluded from the 1997 base figure.</P>
      <P>The relevant comparable net expenditure figures for my Department are £2,096 million for 1997 and £3,606 million for 2001, that is an increase of 72%. Details, by subhead, of the funding for my Department for 1997 and 2001 are contained in the Revised Estimates volumes for the years in question.</P>
      <P>All levels of the education sector have received significantly increased funding since 1997. In summary, there have been substantial increases in expenditure on programmes for the disadvantaged and for children with special needs as well as very significant improvements in first and second level pupil-teacher ratios, school support services and capitation grants. At third level there has been major additional investment in skills needs programmes, teacher training and research and development activities. The capital provision has also been substantially increased for all levels &ndash; the overall capital allocation in 2001 is more than four times the corresponding figure in the 1997 Revised Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation to which the Deputy refers arises only in relation to the provision of home tuition services and only then when the teacher recruited to provide the service is not a serving teacher.</P>
      <P>Home tuition services are designed to address the educational needs of children who, because of their circumstances, are unable to attend school on a regular basis. Where the teacher employed to provide the home tuition service is a serving primary teacher, arrangements are made within my Department for payments to issue directly through the primary teachers' payroll. However, where the teacher recruited to deliver the service is not a serving teacher there is no current mechanism through which payments in respect of home tuition can be centrally addressed.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy in relation to this matter. I am hopeful that these concerns can be addressed in the context of the restructuring of my Department's role in the special education area which will arise with the establishment of the national council for special education.</P>

      <P>My Department has more than 800 major school building projects in architectural planning. Approximately one quarter of these projects are at an advanced stage of the planning process and should be ready to go to tender in 2002 and subsequent years. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects will be taken as in previous years in light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology is a statutory body established under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992-99. Under these Acts the governance and day-to-day activities of the institute, including library opening hours, are matters for which the governing body and the management of the institute are responsible. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to intervene in such matters.</P>
      <P>My Department has an annual provision to address, on a priority basis, the capital needs of all third level colleges, including the provision of equipment. A total amount of £955,564, 1,213,316, was approved in 2000 towards the cost of loose furniture and equipment for the restaurant and library buildings at Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology. The institute has drawn down approximately £686,700, approximately 871,929, of these moneys to date and the balance will be paid to the institute upon receipt of appropriate invoices and confirmation of compliance with procurement procedures.</P>
      <P>In addition, a devolved grant of £171,800, 218,141, for small capital works was issued to the institute last year to spend at its discretion. My Department's building unit will continue to work closely with Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology to ensure that all priorities identified by the institute are addressed in the context of available funding.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the stay safe programme involves inservice training for the school staff, parent education and personal safety skills education for primary school children. Since its introduction in 1991 almost all schools, 98.6%, have participated in inservice training and 87% have facilitated parent education regarding child protection issues. Results of a survey carried out in 1999/2000 show that 74% of schools are teaching the stay safe programme. It is anticipated that the children first guidelines which are being introduced in the current school year will result in an increase in the number of schools teaching the stay safe programme.</P>

      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued guidelines on countering bullying behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their <Col N="864" /> responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour. The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
      <P>Where staff in my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance is offered by staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service is available as a support service to schools for individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495, 496 and 502 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next fifteen years. In relation to training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy. These increases are in addition to the extra number of places provided by the colleges from the last academic year in response to the request of the Higher Education Authority to expand provision in the light of perceived shortages.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority to pursue the issues arising from the report. The Higher Education Authority has invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes for the three disciplines. A meeting of the inter-agency working group is being convened to consider the response to the authority's invitation.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance at approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the scheme for PLC students are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to <Col N="867" /> depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment, CE, schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment, CE, schemes, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951 per annum, to my Department on a phased basis as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79 per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98 per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79 to £60, 76.18 per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58 per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37 to £4,800 , 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76 to £40,000, 50,789.52 per annum. My Department recently issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of funding towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. The scheme provides grants to schools that are not directly linked to any objective pay scales. Therefore, the level and extent of services provided is <Col N="868" /> a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</P>

This decision was taken in order to facilitate more ready access to assessment services by children with special needs. In addition, I have made £1.25 million available to NEPS in the current year to facilitate the engagement of private educational psychologists to conduct assessments where NEPS is not in a position to deliver such services on a timely basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 503 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the income thresholds prescribed under the student maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage to March of the previous year. Last June, in line with this policy, I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-02 academic year. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000.</P>
      <P>For the 2002-03 academic year, reckonable income will be based on the short transitional tax year running from 6 April 2001 to 31 December, 2001. In general, for revenue purposes, all allowances, credits, bands, exemption limits and other annual amounts will be adjusted, where relevant, from their full year value to take account of the short tax year. Similarly, it is intended that the reckonable income thresholds, to be prescribed in my Department's schemes of student support for 2002, will be adjusted accordingly. The schemes of student support, with prescribed reckonable income limits, are normally issued in May-June of each year and it is intended that the issue of the 2002 schemes will adhere to this practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has provided £95 million under the national development plan for a third level access fund to tackle disadvantage at third level. Last July I launched the report, Access to Third Level Education, prepared, by the group which I set up in September 2000 to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of disadvantaged students, mature students and students with a disability at third level. In light of the report, my Department has to date initiated a number of measures which provide additional funding to encourage participation in third level education.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the action group in September 2000, I announced as an initial step, pending the findings of the group, the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders in 2001. Recommendations relating to the criteria for the special rates of grant are set out in the action group's report and approval for payment of the special rates have issued to the local authorities-VECs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special rates, effective from the 2000-01 academic year, are £3,000, 3,809, for students residing over 15 miles from the college attended and £1,200, (1,524), for students residing less <Col N="871" /> than 15 miles from the college attended. The local authorities and the vocational educational committees, who administer the standard maintenance grant schemes, will assess candidates for the special rates of maintenance grants also. I am arranging for my Department to forward details of the eligibility requirements for the special rates to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In September 2000 I also announced a millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001. The fund is intended to build on the experience of the support scheme for students from disadvantaged <Col N="872" /> families, operated by the Northside Partnership, which assists students to participate in higher education. The action group's report sets out detailed recommendations on the criteria which should apply in the disbursement of the fund.
