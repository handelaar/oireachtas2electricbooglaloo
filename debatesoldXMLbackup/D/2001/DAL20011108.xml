      <P>Two weeks ago the Tánaiste took the Order of Business and in reply to questions she said Ireland had the fastest growing and most successful economy in the world. She also claimed she had an effective early warning system which signalled any job losses and she was buoyant and optimistic. Since then we have had a list of closures and job losses around the country. October has been the worst month in terms of unemployment figures since 1967. Yesterday, both inside and outside the House, the Taoiseach agreed with the Governor of the Central Bank that we are heading straight into a recession. How is it possible for the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Government to have such divergent views on the economy? Are different people advising the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach? Has she changed her view in the past two weeks?</P>

      <P>Following on from our exchange a fortnight ago and having regard to the work of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, can the Tánaiste tell the House how many people are in the early warning monitoring unit in her Department? What is the level of staffing in terms of senior personnel? What systems of advance warning and communications does it have? Is there an informal link with the banks, which are the first line of information about companies or sectors which could be in crisis, without breaching the confidentiality of the <Col N="1090" /> bank/client relationship? Has she any additional information to give to the House? Will we continue to see this type of headline&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It behoves all of us not to hype a difficult situation. I was in the House answering questions two days ago and my view has not changed. The economy continues to perform well and it is the most successful in Europe. Unemployment is below 4%. In Germany, France, Italy and other countries it is 9%, 10% and 11%. There is no difference between the Taoiseach and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's speeches in the United States will be upbeat and they will point out the benefits Ireland has to offer to companies restructuring. Different people have different perspectives. One of the most respected economic commentators, Dan McLaughlin, had a different perspective from other people this morning. Just because one stops driving a car at 100 miles per hour and slows down to 70 miles per hour does not mean one is not driving the car. This economy continues to grow. There are more people at work in Ireland today than there were this time last year. Today there are an extra 117,000 people at work in Dublin and 320,000 people at work in the country compared to four years ago. I could read out a list of ten companies which are currently recruiting, such as Microsoft, Oracle, Dell, Prumerica, Nypro, Irish Life and many more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put things in perspective in this House. The economy is doing well. There are huge international difficulties. We are not doing as well as we were. We are an open economy. There is a global slowdown, which was already happening in the ICT sector. That has been compounded by the tragic events of 11 September <Col N="1091" /> which have undermined confidence in the United States and globally. We are suffering and will continue to suffer the effects of that in the next number of weeks. However, the fundamentals are sound. We have a good budgetary situation relative to where we were ten years ago when we experienced difficulties. We had more than 15,000 notifiable redundancies in 1993. The economic base at that time was different from what it is today. There are an extra 400,000 at work today than there was on that occasion. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we must put things in perspective and we must maintain confidence in ourselves as a people and as a country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>People are losing confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Noonan: The people do not have a lack of confidence in themselves, but they have an increasing lack of confidence in an incompetent Government that has squandered the boom. That is the difficulty. I appreciate what the Tánaiste said this morning, but it is totally at variance with what the Governor of the Central Bank said yesterday at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He said the Celtic tiger phase of the economy was over and growth was flat which, as every economist knows, means zero growth. We know what is the next phase after growth.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Tánaiste's particular job. Did her early warning system signal the job losses which were announced in the past two weeks since she addressed the issue last in the House? I heard her on radio and television saying nobody told her about the 700 job losses at Tara Mines and it was not really her job because mining reports to a different Minister. Is she not the Minister responsible for employment? What kind of an early warning system does she have if 700 jobs go out of the economy and nobody even tells her it is about to happen? What did she know about the job losses? Is she confident that she knows what will happen over the next month or so? She is able to signal that people are hiring on a contract basis for the Christmas rush but she is not able to indicate what the job losses may be going forward or else she is not giving us full information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no early warning system or complicated formula that can tell us what may be decided in a boardroom in the United States or somewhere else. For example, last Sunday Motorola informed Celestica that it did not want to go ahead with a legal contract it had signed because the mobile phone industry was in serious trouble and it, in particular, was in difficulty. Celestica made certain decisions. I was not aware that would happen and that a legal contract would be broken. No early warning system in the world would detect that.</P>

      <P>I do not have ministerial responsibility for the mining industry but, notwithstanding that, I took questions in the House on that the other day. I am not trying to run away from responsibility. With regard to the mining industry, the price of zinc is on the floor at a 20 year low. It is down to $760 a barrel. I am not an expert on mining because I do not have responsibility. The workers are on protective notice. There are industries in difficulties and restructuring all the time, even in good times.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, we have new early warning systems in place. In the first instance, Forfás has conducted an analytical assessment of the current situation and we have put action plans in place. In particular, all executives working overseas for Enterprise Ireland have been at home over the past few weeks meeting Irish companies to try to help them in a new marketing drive.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is engaged with companies almost on a daily basis and those companies are reviewing or restructuring their operations. We are trying to point out to them the advantages of doing more business in Ireland because we are very competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed an early warning system in times of uncertainty and the Tánaiste has indicated the difficulty of anticipating certain events. I turn to something that is full of certainty. On 13 June Mr. Justice Flood <Col N="1094" /> requested the House make extra personnel available to him and on 14 June the Tánaiste replied to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, stating: &ldquo;Even if the judge gets the two extra members he requests in his correspondence to this House the tribunal will take two further years and if he does not, it will take considerably longer&rdquo;. She further stated: &ldquo;It would be right that that parties in Opposition be consulted about the new members to be appointed as it is this House that established the tribunal. It can be taken that that will happen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste does not need an early warning system for this. What is happening? It has been five months since this request was made. It is a matter of concern which is not the private property of the Government. Have there been discussions with the Attorney General and senior members of the Bar? If so, why have Opposition parties, to whom the Tánaiste gave an undertaking in this House, not been consulted? I raised this matter some weeks ago in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware no consultation has taken place with myself or my party on the appointment of additional judges to the Flood tribunal? Is she further aware a number of names are freely in circulation and are openly speculated about? As far as Fine Gael is concerned, token consultation will not fit the bill and if we are not happy with the proposals made, we will object both publicly and privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the tribunal was established by the House and it would be appropriate, therefore, that parties should be consulted in regard to any appointments. If that has not yet happened, I apologise. I was not aware of that but I know the Attorney General has had discussions with Mr. Justice Flood. New counsel has been appointed to the tribunal and I will speak to the Attorney General in regard to this matter. I do not know when the appointments will happen. There is no difficulty. Whatever resources are required will be made available to Mr. Justice Flood and the tribunal. I will revert to the Deputies later or perhaps tomorrow and I will ask the Attorney General to speak to the Deputies in regard to the appointments in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the apology given by the Tánaiste. It was very graciously given and I accept it in that spirit. This matter is above party politics. It is about the confidence of the citizens in the democratic process of the country and the way in which decisions are made. Will the Tánaiste give an undertaking that there will be consultation within the next few weeks at the latest and that a decision acceptable to all parties in the House will be made in a manner that does not damage the integrity of the Flood tribunal or its operations, having regard to the fact that, as the Tánaiste said, we do not want to prolong the work of the tribunal any longer than is necessary or curtail its effectiveness in reaching finality on <Col N="1095" /> how decisions were made? Will she recognise that Mr. Justice Flood made the request on 13 June and asked that it be acceded to and completed by the end of the summer session, yet we are now less then six weeks from the end of the autumn session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an undertaking that there will be consultation with the Opposition and I will ask the Attorney General to speak with the Leaders of the Opposition parties. I am not aware of what are the mechanisms. Earlier in the summer there were discussions about various personalities and the Attorney General spoke with different members of the Judiciary and the Flood tribunal. I do not know where that is at now but I will ensure that the Opposition is kept informed.</P>

As we know, the Minister has been captured by the Department, the Tánaiste and her party have been defeated and this legislation will never see the light of day.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to ask for your assistance on a matter. There is a consensus in the House on the need for hearings by the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on the situation in Aer Lingus. Unfortunately the Chairman is unable to accede to a request because of the committee's involvement in the mini-CTC inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does not involve promised legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does involve promised legislation in that the Government proposes to sell off part of Aer Lingus, for which legislative authority will be required. The House would not be satisfied to pass such legislation unless we held proper hearings on the options available to Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met the ICTU last week, but refused to answer questions this week on those meetings, even though he later declared that the company could close within one week. As the Minister will not take questions in the House until 27 November, the House is powerless at present. The committee is unable to deal with this issue because of the mini-CTC inquiry on which all its resources are deployed.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has put a question to <Col N="1099" /> the House. The Government could assist committees by making extra resources available. The reason committees cannot meet is because all the House's resources have been, of necessity, made available to the mini-CTC inquiry. The Tánaiste put a question to the House suggesting that if the Government can help, it will do so. The Government can release some of the consultants it has hired and some of the resources for the 73 press officers to give additional resources to committees. That is the answer to the Tánaiste's question.</P>

Although, sadly, it took almost ten years for that to become a reality, we all lived with the shame and embarrassment of it. Because of that, another referendum was held in 1992.</P>
      <P>During that nine year period, through court case after court case taken by SPUC, women in Ireland were denied the right to information. Students and other groups were taken to court repeatedly. Copies of <i>Cosmopolitan </i>appeared month after month with a blank page showing the censorship which went on in this country in regard to the names and addresses of legal clinics and abortion centres in Britain. Women, in particular, lived with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an even greater deprivation of the rights of women and citizens because during that period, the right of women to travel was questioned and denied. In the 1992 referendum, we dealt with the substantive issue, the right to travel and the right to information. This came about because of a horrific and tragic case, the X case, as a result of which the interpretation people feared in 1983 came to pass. A 14 year old girl who had been raped was pregnant and suicidal and her parents were denied the right to travel to a legal abortion clinic in Britain to have an abortion carried out. Despite our embarrassment and <Col N="1103" /> shame, the compassion of the people in identifying with the suffering and trauma that young girl and her parents were going through ensured we would get an outcome that would relieve such a terrible situation and that the State would pay the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>We hit international headlines. I and, I am sure, Deputy Shatter and other colleagues in this House received telephone calls and queries from all over the world asking us if we were even members of the European Community as it was then known. As a result of that, we had a second debate and attempt to quickly and naturally restore the right to travel and information which, thankfully, was passed by a majority of voters. However, we also had and still have what is known as the &ldquo;substantive issue.&rdquo;  That was and is an attempt to remove the grounds under which in 1992 the Supreme Court allowed two parents and their young girl travel to Britain to have a legal abortion, as happened again in 1995 in another distressing case involving a young girl. This is because we could not and would not provide the necessary facilities here. The Supreme Court based its judgments on the threat of self-destruction or suicide.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Flynn, in introducing the Second Stage debate on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, dealing with the right to travel and information, said that should it transpire that the people decided not to adopt the twelfth amendment, the Government had decided to introduce legislation to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision. He continued by saying that if that amendment was defeated &ndash; and he did not believe that would happen which is a case of a political projection being wrong &ndash; it was the Government's firm and considered view that the only practicable alternative was to legislate on the basis of the X case. Mr. Flynn said that this was not meant to be a threat to anybody or to put pressure on them to vote in a particular way in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Not alone did Mr. Flynn promise that the only option if the amendment was defeated would be legislation on the basis of the X case, he used that assertion to urge people to vote for the removal of the threat of self-destruction. The people did not agree with that, they did not support it and they did not vote for it. Why, in 2001, are we facing a third attempt to put words into the Constitution that will clearly be challenged, and interpreted in ways that will not satisfy the same pressure group who pushed for it in 1983, 1992 and now in 2001? Members may be aware of the famous &ldquo;Rocky Horror Show&rdquo; which has the theme song titled, &ldquo;Let's do the time warp again&rdquo;.  That is exactly what we are doing. We are doing the time warp again.</P>
    <P>In 1983, a small, intolerant pressure group decided that it did not trust legislators. In 1992, because of the Supreme Court interpretation, the group decided that it did not trust the courts or <Col N="1104" /> the judges. Now in 2001, it does not trust the psychologists or the psychiatrists. However, every year and every decade, they do not trust women. During these debates women have been disembodied, divided and dehumanised. It gives me and other colleagues in this Chamber no satisfaction to go through this again because underlying the issue is the belief of some men that women have to be controlled with regard to a murderous intent towards their unborn. That is basic, fundamental, fundamentalist and highly insulting.</P>
    <P>During the ten years since the last debate, thousands of women have travelled to Britain for abortions. This required desperation, silence, shame and the extraordinary, practical need to raise enough money to pay for the journey and the treatment. It was usually done in a solitary, shamed way. As Deputy McManus has said, special medicines and antibiotics are given to Irish women because, from the medical experience of people working in the British clinics, it is realised that the majority of those women will not seek treatment, either psychological or medical, when they come home.</P>
    <P>There is also a more dangerous experience. Because of the difficulties and because of the lack of economic independence on the part of many of these women, the termination of pregnancy is delayed, giving rise to huge problems, including medical, emotional and psychological problems. We in Ireland are not prepared to take that on board much less address it.</P>
    <P>Added to the present debate is another facile slogan. The slogan in 1983 was &ldquo;abortion on demand &ndash; a woman's right to choose.&rdquo;  The underlying meaning of that was if a woman had any right or opportunity to choose, she would choose to abort her child. I want people to take on the meaning of that in the experience of women, not just in Ireland, but worldwide; in the experience of refugees and millions of women desperately trying to nourish and keep their children and their lives together. We now have the slogan &ldquo;social abortion.&rdquo;  I will not spend time on this subject because many of my colleagues &ndash; including, I am glad to say, male colleagues &ndash; have been appalled and outraged that we should reduce such a fundamentally difficult and desperate situation to a phrase such as &ldquo;social abortion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, the phrase gives an indication of the mind set of those who view women at that level. With regard to all areas of equality, citizenship, and rights that touch on the status of women, we have much to worry about. The phrase &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; is an indication of the deep, traditional, subversive, suspicious situation women must still deal with in Ireland. I pay tribute to the many male colleagues in this and in past debates who have also felt offended and rejected by the language and attitude to women. In 2001, more than ever, this feeling is shared by the majority of voters, both men and women. If this ludicrous legislation is put forward in a referendum to the <Col N="1105" /> people, they will reject it, and they deserve the right to do so if this matter goes that far.</P>
    <P>In 1992, when the details of the X case were revealed in Ireland and worldwide, there was a unanimous reaction. People were horrified at how it could have happened. A child was not allowed to have a legal abortion in Britain. There was shock, shame, embarrassment and above all, compassion, which I stress. We have compassion. We are family-centred. We care about mothers and children. Why are we separating them in this divisive way now when on other levels they are almost an icon in our society? The Irish mammy could be canonised any day. Why is there a split mindset with regard to women as mothers? At least, let us hope this debate will engender discussion, philosophical and otherwise, about this difficult and divisive situation in which women find themselves. It is the old story of Eve and the Virgin Mary, but that debate is for another day and I do not know if we would be allowed to have it in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Noonan, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, addressed a series of questions to the Taoiseach, he was accused of time wasting as if it was a political ploy. However, the questions were very important and we learned much from the replies which revealed not just flaws in the proposed legislation but the most flawed thinking we have ever encountered in this House. I have a great regard for this Chamber and I consider it a privilege to be here. One of the greatest pleasures &ndash; soon to come to an end &ndash; I have had is to be a legislator. It is a privilege that is not enjoyed by many and it is one we should not lightly relinquish. We receive a mandate from the people to legislate on their behalf and they trust us to do so, but that is about to be taken away. It worries me not just with regard to this debate but with regard to the future power, authority and autonomy of legislators.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that this flawed legislation will be put to the electorate, but how can voters know what the impact or import of the individual sections will be? If they vote in favour of the referendum, that legislation will stand as part of the Constitution and, thus, we as legislators will be powerless to change it. There is not any legislation in which I have been involved in debating that did not require amendments. In some cases, once legislation has been enacted, we only realise after it has been implemented that it requires amendment because we overlooked certain dimensions.</P>
    <P>This legislation is unprecedented, unbelievable and bizarre. We are tying ourselves into a referendum on legislation which is flawed. As legislators we often realise that legislation is flawed after it has been enacted, yet in this case we will not be able to do anything to rectify it. As a Deputy serving my last term in the House, I am worried by the enormity of that situation. I will not refer to the four Independent Deputies who have brought this upon us because I do not think they would understand the import of it. However, <Col N="1106" /> I am asking both Government parties and, in particular, the Minister for Health and Children, to think again. Do not plunge us into what we went through in 1983, 1992 and 1995. It is too much and does not reflect well on any of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Barnes for her fine contribution. I do not agree entirely with everything she said but it is fair to say she has been a champion of women's rights here, going back to her early days in the House. She has kept faith with the vocation she set for herself of speaking clearly to advocate the rights of women in all circumstances. It is a great pity that she is not seeking re-election, not least for Fine Gael which will have difficulty in retaining that seat in Dún Laoghaire. So much for Fine Gael's worries, however.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes has made a balanced speech. I find it rather strange to be speaking in this debate because if one had asked me in the 1980s, I would not have thought I would be involved in politics now. Part of the reason I was not involved in politics in the 1980s, and part of the reason I emigrated to England, was precisely because of all those referendums that were going on. It seemed to me there was much opportunism and conservatism in evidence at the time. When it came to abortion and divorce, so-called official Ireland tended to ignore people in difficult situations with reduced economic and social circumstances. One of the characteristics of the 1980s was that official and unofficial Ireland co-existed and people lived quite different lifestyles. Official Ireland seemed determined to ignore what was happening in unofficial Ireland, and moved in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>Now, however, unofficial Ireland has ceased to be. As a society, we have moved far beyond the 1980s, socially and most importantly economically. While it may sound callous to say so, we have moved on and our society is much more secure in its value systems and its sense of well-being. Irish society is much more self-confident now. In that context, we must grapple with this age-old problem of where we stand on abortion. The situation must be clarified once and for all. Nobody on this side of the House is holding a torch for these measures. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, have accepted that this legislation represents a compromise. It is not something we would choose to implement in an ideal world. It reflects the compromise and consensus that developed as a result of widespread consultation through an Oireachtas committee, as well as much contemplation by the Taoiseach and by the House as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has played an honourable role on this issue. He made a promise prior to the last election that there would be a referendum on this issue before he left office. He has not honoured that type of promise in every case. For instance, he was criticised for not honouring his promise <Col N="1107" /> concerning the Partnership for Peace, although I believe he was right not to do so.</P>
    <P>Abortion is a fundamental issue, however, which has perplexed the political establishment for years and it is time an element of clarity was brought to bear on the situation. The Government's proposal by way of a constitutional amendment to insert legislation in the Constitution is a positive thing to do. Deputy Barnes spoke earlier of a lack of trust in the political classes that obtained in the 1980s. I am sad to have to disappoint her but the level of trust has not increased since then, mainly because of what some of the more prominent members of the political classes did in the 1980s. Given the large scale public cynicism about what occurs in the House, perhaps it is a good thing that this legislation is to be incorporated in the Constitution. There will, therefore, be no change to it in future without the people being directly consulted.</P>
    <P>Abortion is a difficult moral issue and in some sense we are at a turning point as a society. There is a strong pro-choice element within the population. A recent <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> opinion poll indicated that 40% of those surveyed were pro-choice, while 60% were pro-life. Broadly speaking, that reflects the state of public opinion at the moment. As we know, however, from previous referenda on divorce and abortion, and from the referendum on the Nice treaty, that margin can narrow substantially in the run up to a campaign.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult issue and one about which all politicians should be careful. Politicians should not preach about such moral issues because people are sick of that. Essentially, it is a matter of huge personal conscience as to how people vote on this matter. Yesterday, members of my party met representatives of the pro-life movement who were pushing the case for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. At that meeting I specifically made the point that in this case politicians should not canvass vigorously and aggressively, as they do in general elections and by-elections. It is the duty of every politician in the House, once legislation is passed and a referendum date chosen, to go about his or her business in a responsible way. We should seek to inform rather than proselytise on the issue. If politicians do this, they will win respect from the public which is cynical about referendums as we know from the Nice referendum fiasco. Few people actually vote in referendums. I suspect, however, the turnout will be higher on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The turnout will reflect on this House. A low turnout will not reflect disinterest in the issue, but the weakness of the political class and its inability to communicate with the public on which it depends for support&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that it is doing exactly what Mr. Haughey did in the 1980s. It is opposing for the sake of it in the hope of achieving a political result and embarrassing the <Col N="1109" /> Government. It has no regard for the moral issues involved. I make that criticism specifically of Deputy Shatter, not Deputy Barnes whom I know has a genuine concern on the issue. Deputy Shatter, however, has no genuine concern on it whatsoever. He is merely deploying the usual rhetoric of opposition.</P>
      <P>We now need to look at the Labour Party which is taking an each way bet on the issue. Its party conference is conveniently voting for the pro-choice position while the leadership is rapping it on the knuckles and stating it would like to see the matter go another way. It is not unusual nowadays within the Labour Party to want an each way bet and claim victory no matter what the result. Conference delegates will claim victory if it is defeated while the leadership will claim victory if it is passed. It is typical of the confusion that seems to exist in the Labour Party. I suspect that we will see more confusion in the months ahead as to whom it will choose as a coalition partner. No doubt it will try to confuse its own delegates on that issue too.</P>
      <P>This is not a debate on which people should preach. The public does not want politicians to preach on the issue. The proposal is not an ideal solution, but no party or individual could come up with&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an Irish solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a solution that could get over the essential hypocrisy on the issue. For once it is not hypocrisy in this House, but hypocrisy among the public. In 1992 it voted for quite contradictory things. It voted for the right to travel &ndash; to the United Kingdom or elsewhere &ndash; to secure an abortion and the right to information about how to travel and how to obtain an abortion. As we know, it did not vote for the proposal in relation to the substantive issue. In effect, therefore, public opinion is hypocritical. There is a central defining hypocrisy in the Irish mind on the issue. It wants women to have the right to travel and the right to information, but does not want to have abortions performed within the State.</P>
      <P>Between those twin positions the political class must come up with a reasonable and workable solution. That is what the Minister, Deputy Martin, has done. His proposal is reasonable, practicable and addresses the particular issue. It would not be responsible for any Government to advocate the pro-choice position in the full knowledge that it would be defeated by the electorate. That would be a wasteful, damaging and injurious exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at the practicalities of the issue. The supporting legislation and agencies being put in place to provide backup for women in crisis pregnancies are a positive development. Fine Gael played a positive role in relation to the all-party committee on the issue in bringing forward the idea of a crisis agency. That is something that has changed in the House since the 1980s. <Col N="1110" /> Then it seemed that the public and politicians were blithely prepared to pass a pro-life amendment to the Constitution and forget about the consequences and the people tragically caught in these particular circumstances. Politicians in the 1980s wanted to ignore that underlying reality. Today's politicians are not prepared to do so and have provided within this legislation a supportive framework. That is appropriate and right. I acknowledge the positive role played by Fine Gael in relation to it. I hope it will come round and support the actual campaign when it gets under way.</P>
    <P>Most of us know that many Fine Gael Deputies will vote one way in the House and listen earnestly to their spokespersons on the issue and will then go to their constituencies and advocate a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. That could be called hypocrisy, but on this issue it only reflects the complexity of the debate, even within political parties. In Fianna Fáil there are many who would advocate the pro-choice position, but they will remain quiet and silent throughout the campaign. That is their choice. The political class should not campaign in the vigorous, no holds barred manner that it normally does on this particular issue. It should focus on the conveying of information. If the Opposition has concerns they should be expressed in a reasonable and proper manner and not in a scaremongering way.</P>
    <P>I am not sure when would be the best time to hold a referendum on this issue but it must be resolved well before a general election and this would indicate a referendum in the early part of the new year. The Minister may address this question when he closes the debate.</P>
    <P>It is important that the debate throughout the country is conducted in a proper manner. Notwithstanding her heartfelt and deep seated reservations and concerns, I hope the tone of Deputy Barnes's remarks do not mean she intends to scaremonger and attack the issue aggressively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

Deputy Barnes rightly spoke about the young girl at the centre of that controversy. As far as she and her family were concerned the rights to information and travel were the substantive issues. It ill behoves us to talk about that matter because the young girl involved is now a young woman and has made her own life. The less we talk about her the better. The rights to information and travel, which were most important to the family concerned, were copperfastened so that a similar case could not recur and an unthinking and insensitive State could no longer stop a woman achieving what she wanted to achieve in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate on the protection of human life in pregnancy.</P>
      <P>The current view that is being ascribed to the Labour Party in relation to abortion &ndash; supposedly abortion on demand &ndash; is not one to which I subscribe. I am opposed to the decision taken by some members of the party at the recent conference, if the interpretation of that debate was to infer that abortion on demand was the agreed outcome. I hope Deputy Lenihan will understand my clarification of this matter.</P>
      <P>For many years the statistics on the numbers of abortions on Irish women taking place outside the jurisdiction of the State have continued to shock us. In a modern outward looking society there is still a sense of shock at the increasing number of Irish women purported to travel to Britain annually to terminate crisis pregnancies. The tragedy of these statistics is that the relative effort and support dedicated to the prevention and management of crisis pregnancies has been dismal. The support given to vulnerable young and not so young women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy has been appallingly poor.</P>
      <P>Compared to the supports dedicated to other problems in Irish society, the support for women with crisis pregnancies is embarrassingly small. The education, treatment, counselling and management of unfortunate victims of drug abuse, for example, receive moderately good support. Large tracts of public money have been set aside to research the causes and symptoms and to provide for the needs and treatment of drug addiction, and rightly so. The amount of resources dedicated to the management of the drugs problem is still far short of what is needed, based on the current level of abuse of illegal substances. A high profile campaign was launched recently to reduce the level of smoking. Large amounts of public money have been spent on this campaign, and rightly so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are just two very worthy examples which are entitled to full support but there is surely a <Col N="1112" /> reasonable expectation that crisis pregnancies should be given the same level of support, counselling and management. The State has a responsibility to ensure the rights of all individuals, including the unborn. It is not fair or just that supports and services for some crises fall far short of the norm that is provided for many others.</P>
    <P>Money has been well spent in supporting sports activities, for example, and there continues to be a great need for better sports facilities. Earlier this year it seemed probable that £1 billion could be used for the building of a sports stadium that would be available largely to the sporting elite. I could continue with the list of social needs which have been or are being addressed by substantial investment of State money, yet when we look to the fundamental question of support for the protection of human life in a most basic way it is clear that it has dropped off the agenda of supports for crises and social concerns.</P>
    <P>Only last month a commitment was finally given for financial support for women with crisis pregnancies with the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. The sum of money promised &ndash; £5 million for 2002 &ndash; is a mere drop in the ocean compared with the real need of those women who are in crisis pregnancies. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been set up with a brief to co-ordinate existing voluntary and non-governmental agencies. I welcome the establishment of this agency but it should be given substantially more resources than have been committed to it. On the basis of a reported 6,000 women travelling to Britain every year for abortions, the amount set aside for the agency amounts to less than £1,000 per crisis pregnancy. This does not rate as placing a significant value on the protection of human life. For a number of months while the all-party Oireachtas committee was debating the complex matter of abortion, the number of Irish women travelling to England for abortions continued to increase. The work and subsequent report of the committee were very welcome but the number of abortions continued.</P>
    <P>The social stigma that was once associated with unwanted pregnancy has abated somewhat. However, it is still difficult for a young woman to access the necessary supports, to be assured of a quality child care service that will allow her to continue her education, to be guaranteed an acceptable level of accommodation, to be assured that she will be able to live a quality of life that will not restrict her social and personal development and at the same time assured that her child will be secure, safe and socially well adjusted.</P>
    <P>Education designed to ensure young women do not become pregnant is a first target and an area where significant resources must be invested. There is no problem with providing information for young people on the dangers of alcohol, other drugs or smoking. The same commitment should be given to sex education so that young people are well informed and aware of the risks of unplanned pregnancies and the possible risk of <Col N="1113" /> sexually transmitted diseases. The number of teenage pregnancies continues to increase and the underlying causes of this must be addressed through education and information for young men and women.</P>
    <P>Last week a national newspaper carried a report of a young woman who had chosen to have an abortion because having another child would have obliged her to give up her career. Having children and a career should not be mutually exclusive. If this country truly values its women it will provide the level of support, care and opportunity that allows a woman to continue with a pregnancy and a career.</P>
    <P>The care and support for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies have largely been left to voluntary organisations which have few resources with which to offer support and are very often dependent on good will and, effectively, charity. The prevention of crisis pregnancies and the follow through for those women who become pregnant have never been given the same level of care and consideration as other social problems.</P>
    <P>Many teenagers drop out of school due to crisis pregnancies. This group must become the focus of a much enhanced support network. The vicious circle of disadvantage, which is linked to lack of education, will continue unabated unless the necessary supports to allow young women to continue in education are provided. For those who have already dropped out and now find themselves unable to find a job, provision must be made to allow them to return to education.</P>
    <P>Re-entering the education field, however, is about much more than returning to a classroom. Child care needs to be addressed through major investment and support. Quality affordable child care must be available to allow young women to complete or resume their education. Enhanced social welfare payments should be provided, linked to school attendance and completion of courses, if necessary, to give these young women with commitment the opportunity and incentive to reintegrate and achieve an appropriate level of education.</P>
    <P>There are many heart-rending accounts of women who felt they had no choice but to have an abortion and many sad and moving accounts of women who chose to have their baby and were rejected by family or society. This attitude and mindset must be changed, coupled with appropriate supports. I welcome the commitment of the Government to provide the resources to support women in crisis pregnancies, but the level of commitment and support, not just financial, needs to be greatly increased to give any woman who feels vulnerable or threatened the opportunity to ensure her quality of life and that of her child is not compromised. The culture of secrecy and fear which has dominated Irish thinking on crisis pregnancies must be replaced by a culture of openness, care and security.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues in the Bill which are far from clear and give rise to concern, some <Col N="1114" /> of which may just be matters of detail that can easily be clarified. However, the lack of clarity raises a concern about the substantial intention of the Bill, for example, medical practitioners of any hue or training are to be allowed to perform the medical procedures. Despite the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea's passionate defence of the Bill he is entirely wrong to dismiss the use of the term &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; as unimportant. I have raised before in this House the question of alternative practitioners, a group not governed by legislation. Under the proposal in the Bill there is nothing to stop such a practitioner, or anybody who cares to classify himself or herself as a medical practitioner, from carrying out the prescribed medical procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche emphasised that philosophical, moral and theological questions are to be ignored in the Bill. Surely the voting public needs to know the very implications of the questions he dismisses. He also submitted that irrelevancies should not be addressed and added that we come, as legislators, to have a reasoned debate. It is precisely for this reason that it is important we avoid the fudge factor and address the detail of the Bill in order that when the question is put we are all very clear on what we are being asked to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred to confusion in the Opposition parties. There is a lack of clarity and a degree of fudge in the detail of the Bill and the Opposition parties have by no means a monopoly of confusion as far as the Bill is concerned. I was intrigued by the Deputy's proposal that his colleagues remain silent. This is hardly a responsible way to discharge one's duties as a legislator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, is the first legislative proposal since the Supreme Court decision in the X case in 1993 which seeks to honestly and comprehensively address the issue of abortion. It is the result of an exhaustive process which started in 1997 when the Taoiseach initiated the Green Paper on abortion. This led to the wide ranging consultations of the all-party committee on the Constitution chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan which published its detailed report in November 2000. The process, initiated in 1997, resulted in the most detailed legal, medical and social examination ever undertaken anywhere in the world of the sensitive issue of abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those from many differing standpoints who participated in the process are to be commended for the manner in which the consultations were conducted. I was struck by the evident maturity with which people representing every shade of opinion approached the committee. They attended in good faith and put their case with conviction. The hearings were marked on all sides by a tone of mutual respect and a determination to adopt and maintain a measured tone throughout. I hope this House can conduct its business of moving the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution in the same atmosphere of reciprocal <Col N="1115" /> regard for those with whom we disagree. Let us use moderate language. The matter is too weighty to be addressed in a tone of recrimination and name calling.</P>
    <P>For this reason I was disappointed by the tone of some Deputies' remarks in the opening weeks of the debate. Surely we are mature enough to debate without seeking to demonise each other. Calling those who differ from us misogynous raises the temperature and does not advance our understanding of the proposal one iota. If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of women in crisis pregnancies and their unborn children, there is an onus on us all to conduct ourselves in a calm and reasoned manner.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas hearings on the issue identified the key areas of consensus which laid the foundations on which the current proposal has been built. The broadest area of consensus is surely the universal sense that abortion is a terrible experience for any woman. It is a tragedy in every instance. No one who attended the hearings spoke of abortion as something positive, it was universally regarded as a negative experience. There was, however, a pervasive sense that we all have a grave responsibility to support women in crisis pregnancies, to be there for them in order that they do not feel abandoned when making their decision and put in place whatever practical supports they need to enable them to feel there are real and positive alternatives to abortion.</P>
    <P>Every crisis pregnancy represents an urgent call to all of us to do more to ensure women do not feel abandoned to cope alone. For this reason every woman who feels she has no real option other than abortion represents a failure on our part and of social solidarity because, as the people around her, the members of society, we have a civic responsibility to step in and put in place the full range of supports needed. We owe it to every woman who has had an abortion and to women who find themselves facing a crisis pregnancy in the future to commit ourselves to surrounding them with strong, warm, personal support and, as a society, to put in place an ample range of practical supports in order that there will be real and positive alternatives to abortion.</P>
    <P>I am an optimist. Our abortion trends are not irreversible. The numbers of women seeking abortions are distressingly high and rising, though lower than in most countries. These trends can be slowed down and eventually turned around by addressing the reasons that drive women to seek abortions in the first place. This is a central part of the role of the new crisis pregnancy agency chaired by Ms Olive Braiden, a respected person in her profession.</P>
    <P>As a recent Trinity College study, Women in Crisis Pregnancy, showed, the reasons many women seek an abortion are the very real practical problems posed by the unexpected pregnancy and the considerable difficulties involved in rearing a child alone. If we adequately address these <Col N="1116" /> difficulties, we will gradually begin to meet the real needs of women in crisis pregnancies and help to considerably reduce the abortion rate. The Government approach to this issue is being adopted at three separate levels, constitutional, legislative and social.</P>
    <P>The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution will protect best medical practice in the care of women in pregnancy while at the same time restoring clarity to the law regarding the right to life of the unborn child. It is important to recognise that Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to be pregnant and the Green Paper on abortion recognised that our maternal mortality rate could hardly be improved upon. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution takes account of the consensus of psychiatric opinion in the Oireachtas hearings against making a threat of suicide as grounds for obtaining an abortion. The evidence was starkly illustrated by the Finnish study from the Finland National Research and Development Centre, published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in 1996. This study compared the number of women in the general population of women of child-bearing age who committed suicide with the number among women who had a baby and with the number who had an abortion. They found that the number of women who committed suicide after having a baby was only half the number in the general population of women of child-bearing age; but the number of women who committed suicide after an abortion was nearly six times more than the number of those who had a baby. Having a baby was strongly linked to a lower rate of suicide but having an abortion was very strongly linked with a significantly higher rate of suicide. If the legislation followed the line advocated by those Deputies on the other side of the House who are seeking abortion to be allowed on the grounds of threatened suicide the results could be expected to show a rise not a fall in the numbers of women committing suicide. The Government's proposal takes account of the consensus in the expert psychiatric testimony presented to the Oireachtas hearings.</P>
    <P>I remember the harsh criticism voiced in the X case rulings of the failure of the Oireachtas after 1983 to fulfil the duty laid upon it by Article 40.3.3: </P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas should have enacted a law to indicate how that balance should be kept; how in seeking to preserve the mother's life, the doctor had also to keep in mind the need to preserve the life of the child as far as practicable, but it failed to do so. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution is a genuine attempt to discharge that responsibility, made more complicated by the X case ruling. The twenty-fifth amendment repairs <Col N="1117" /> the damage done by the Supreme Court ruling to the protection of the right to life of the unborn in Article 40.3.3. The X case ruling breached the protection which the people intended to be provided to the unborn in Article 40.3.3. by inappropriately foreshortening the protection to be extended to the unborn when seeking to preserve the mother's life. To repair that breach, the X case ruling needed to be reversed.</P>
    <P>The 25th amendment does this in two steps: by removing the threat of suicide as grounds for abortion in line with the expert testimony of the psychiatrists in the oral hearings; by requiring the doctor when intervening to preserve the life of the mother to have regard to the need to preserve the life of the unborn, as far as practicable. It safeguards the legal availability to women of medical treatment that they may need if they face a risk to their own life in pregnancy, in line with the consensus among obstetricians and gynaecologists as established by the Oireachtas hearings.</P>
    <P>The proposal criminalises the intentional destruction of the unborn after implantation in the womb. It defines abortion for the purposes of the Act but does not seek to define where human life begins. The alternative approach to that being adopted by the Government is to legislate for abortion in line with the Supreme Court decision in the X case ruling which would allow for abortion up to birth. This is the reality of abortion laws in Britain and other countries. It would have the support of the official Labour Party although I respect that there are members in this House and elsewhere who do not see themselves as party to it. It would not, I believe, have the support of the Irish people. The Government proposals are a genuine attempt to confront the reality of crisis pregnancy and to address the very important issues relating to the right to life.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and ask some people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider what the consequences of rejection would be. If it were defeated it is most probable that abortion along the lines of the X case would follow some time in the future and may be further liberalised by court actions if this loophole is not closed now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much misinformation spread about this Bill, some through misunderstandings, some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread that it redefines life as starting at implantation, redefines the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and leaves the way open to experimentation on human embryos. <Col N="1118" /> Some even say it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does absolutely none of these things and people making such statements should be challenged.</P>
    <P>The 25th amendment has achieved the proper balance of protection. It writes into law the two-patient model of pregnancy that has always informed the ethos of Irish medicine. It also provides a secure legal foundation for current ethical medical practice. The 25th amendment is a humane and enlightened proposal worthy of our support and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a dreadful feeling of <i>déja vu </i>about all this. It was back in 1983 when Deputy Barnes and I sat together in this House and voiced concerns about the 1983 amendment which the Fianna Fáil party was hell-bent on putting to the people. It was in 1983 when Deputy Barnes and I in this House voted against that proposal and it was in 1983 when each of us in our contributions to this House predicted practically all the difficulties that have arisen from that proposal and predicted the manner in which the courts would interpret it.</P>
      <P>The latest abortion referendum proposal is built on a bedrock of hypocrisy, decorated in the colours of political expediency. It is a constitutional flagship which highlights the capacity of the Government parties and others outside this House to indulge in a denial of reality and self-delusion at a level only psychologically possible because of our proximity and easy access to England. In an area of human conduct which cannot be regulated by constitutional amendment because of the private tragedies annually affecting the lives of thousands of women, we retain an extraordinary post-colonial dependence on English termination services to preserve a national fundamentalist illusion of moral purity and superiority.</P>
      <P>This proposal has been described by some as yet another Irish solution to an Irish problem. That is not an accurate description. This proposal seeks to constitutionally fasten an English solution to an Irish problem. The constitutional and legislative architecture of this latest abortion proposal is supposed to be politically admired for its cleverness and cuteness in attempting to integrate fundamentally diverse positions. At the time of its unexpected publication and launch at a well-managed Government press conference it seemed that its very complexity was enough to warrant praise and support from commentators who are usually more sceptical and discerning. In the days immediately following its publication it seemed that to analyse the substance of what it is proposed we now do was likely to be portrayed as politically dangerous and unnecessarily divisive. Deputy Lenihan revisited that territory earlier this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste presented this constitutional proposal as a consensus measure worthy of support. Too often in politics, the mention of political consensus is used to avoid direct <Col N="1119" /> and informed political debate on controversial, difficult and sensitive issues. Those issues frequently have a heavy theological overlay. After two decades of parliamentary agonising we should know better and we should confront reality.</P>
    <P>The proposed 25th amendment of the Constitution and the Bill to which its proposers intend to give a constitutional status is a morally bankrupt and pernicious Bill. Its political objective has nothing to do with any issue of substance. Its political objective is to enable the Taoiseach say he has delivered or attempted to deliver on his promise to hold a referendum.</P>
    <P>That is to shore up political support from his four Fianna Fáil dependent Independents until an election is called and to ensure, should any of them be re-elected as it is anticipated some may be, that when the next Dáil sits the Taoiseach can rely on their support and that they would be available to him should he again attempt to form a Government. That is the sole political purpose of this proposal. If it were not for Deputy Healy-Rae and his colleagues in this House, this proposal would not be before us and were it not for the Government's dependence on four Independents, the proposal would not be before us in the manner in which it is framed.</P>
    <P>In terms of the campaign run over the past 20 years by the self-proclaimed pro-life organisations, this proposal is a betrayal of the originally proclaimed objectives of its chief protagonists such as Mr. William Binchy. The original objective of those chief protagonists was to constitutionally prohibit abortion in all circumstances and to prohibit any termination from the moment of conception. This proposal is based on a denial of the principle that life starts from the moment of conception. In the best Orwellian traditions of the book, <i>1984</i>, it redefines abortion to exclude any termination up to the time of implantation and gives legislative recognition to the fact already constitutionally acknowledged that abortions may be lawfully undertaken where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, except where the risk is posed by suicide. It is my personal view that an abortion should be permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, until recently all of the self-proclaimed pro-life groups denied that mothers' lives were ever placed at such risk as to justify a termination of pregnancy. By engaging in word games and semantic gymnastics the Government's proposal hides the fact that it is not delivering the amendment proposal for which the supporters of Mr. Binchy and the Government Independents have campaigned throughout the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>Mr. Binchy, who is quietly briefing a select targeted group of TDs in different parties of his happiness with the proposal, is at odds with his former ally, Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon, who understandably has denounced the proposal. Mr. Binchy is also at odds with and has caused great <Col N="1120" /> confusion for a large number of people who followed his lead in 1983 and in 1992, many of whom are writing to Deputies from the self-proclaimed pro-life perspective urging that this proposal be rejected.</P>
    <P>I remind those who look to Mr. William Binchy as the legal guru on this issue that it was he who conceived and gave birth to the original 1983 amendment. It is he who since the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case has campaigned for another amendment and claimed it was the Supreme Court, not he, who got it wrong. The reality is that William Binchy and the small group around him have been proved consistently wrong on this issue over a period of 20 years. The advice they are giving to Members of this House and to members of the general public should not be trusted. I say this with regret because I regard Mr. Binchy as a lawyer of great eminence for whom I have much admiration across a broad range of legal learning. Unfortunately, this area is his Achilles heel. Unfortunately, in his pronouncements with regard to this very sensitive and difficult issue, which primarily affects the lives of women, he has been proved consistently wrong.</P>
    <P>In 1983, when we had the first debates in this House on constitutional amendments relating to the abortion issue, approximately 2,500 women were recorded as travelling from this State to England to effect pregnancy terminations. In 2001, it is estimated that 6,500 women will travel from this State to England to effect terminations. The objective of the 1983 amendment was to protect life, to discourage abortion, but the reality has proved entirely different. If the Government was serious in trying to encourage women in crisis pregnancies to take other options and not to go the termination route, the package of measures announced, essentially as decoration at the press conference held by the Taoiseach and his Ministers when the constitutional proposal was unexpectedly launched, would have been put in place four years ago. Why were those measures not put in place in 1997, in 1998 or in 1999? If the Government is truly serious about reducing the level of abortion, why have these proposals been produced only in the dying days of the life of this Government? If the Government is serious about encouraging options other than abortion in crisis pregnancies, in the almost five years of this Government's life why has a single step not been taken to modernise our adoption laws to make them more user-friendly to women in crisis pregnancies and to make the option of adoption more attractive to pregnant women who feel they are not in a position to care for a child? The Government has failed to do anything in that regard.</P>
    <P>This proposal is bringing us back to the future. We are revisiting Deputy Reynolds's 1992 proposal when he was Taoiseach. Suicidal pregnant teenagers and women are to be denied the possibility of a pregnancy termination here. With great cynicism and a total lack of humanity the Taoiseach has explained, as has his Attorney General in a sort of folksy way, that this is okay because <Col N="1121" /> they can all go to England. It is Government social policy that we should export distraught, raped and suicidal teenage girls who wish to terminate a forced pregnancy across the water to preserve a self-delusion of moral superiority. If as a result of rape, a man could become pregnant, I doubt whether any such proposal would be contemplated in this House.</P>
    <P>This proposal fails to treat women as people; it treats them as a commodity. As my colleague, Deputy Barnes, said, it treats women as if they cannot be trusted. It is argued that if a raped woman becomes pregnant, the very fact of pregnancy diminishes the possibility of suicide. Finnish research has been cited, but I seriously question that research and this proposition. What research has been undertaken in this State to determine the number of rape victims who have committed suicide? How many women have sustained a pregnancy resulting from rape and in the months or years subsequent to the birth of their child committed suicide? No one knows the answer to that.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary aspects of this proposal is the attitude of the Progressive Democrats. In 1992, Progressive Democrat Members of this House stood on their feet in a state of moral outrage to condemn the proposal put to the people in the 1992 referendum to exclude the possibility of a termination where there was a risk of self-destruction. We now have the Progressive Democrats in Government and a former Progressive Democrat Attorney General producing a proposal which simply replicates what occurred in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's attitude to this is particularly astonishing and deserves some brief examination. It cannot be dealt with to the degree I would like to deal with it today. He states it is impossible to allow terminations to rape victims should they be suicidal or should they not be suicidal but simply rape victims, and he gives reasons. He states that if we did, it would allow any person below the legal age to have an abortion, but if a girl below the legal age is pregnant, it means she is the victim of statutory rape. Are we saying that 12 and 13 year olds who have been raped should not be allowed a termination? It seems we are, but even more astonishingly, the Attorney General claims that if we had to decide a woman was the victim of rape and we allowed a termination, that could jeopardise a fair trial of the person alleged to be the rapist. The Attorney General's logic is that a pregnant suicidal girl or woman who is the victim of rape should be prevented from a pregnancy termination because the alleged rapist, if a termination was allowed, might be denied a fair trial. That reasoning is not only unacceptable but extraordinary.</P>

      <P>It is the reasoning of a technical legal mind, lacking insight and humanity. If the majority of women in this country believed we <Col N="1122" /> had an Attorney General who thought that way about this issue, this proposal would have no credibility.</P>
      <P>Following a woman conceiving as a result of rape, the central issue should not be whether the woman is suicidal. After suffering the trauma of being raped, it is for the pregnant victim with the help of counselling to determine whether to maintain her pregnancy. Having suffered such personal violation, only a barbaric society would deny to a rape victim the opportunity to terminate a pregnancy conceived through rape. If asked whether a woman who has been raped and is pregnant as a result of that rape should be allowed to terminate her pregnancy, the vast majority of people in this State would answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>How many male Members of this House would deny to their wife, daughter or partner the possibility of a termination where their wife, daughter or partner had conceived as a consequence of rape? I do not believe many Members would go on public record to say that if their daughter was raped, they would compel her to maintain the pregnancy. Curiously, I have not heard any Members of the House who favour this legislation address that issue in these personal terms, despite the fact that this proposal seeks to ensure that within this State a rape victim should not be allowed the possibility of a termination, even if they are suicidal.</P>
      <P>It is 18 years since we addressed this issue in the first abortion referendum. I opposed that proposal at great political cost personally and I am opposed to this proposal. Instead of trying to deny the possibility of termination to suicidal rape victims, be they adult women or teenage girls, we should change our laws in a different direction. We should be mature enough to debate this issue and to allow the pregnant victims of incest or rape the right to a termination in this country where the pregnancy results from incest or rape. For the State to attempt, through constitutional measures, to deny the possibility of termination to a raped pregnant teenager or woman, it can truly be described as State abuse and, in relation to teenagers, State constituted child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government presented this Bill as a means of addressing the concerns of the pro-life lobby. It ends the possibility of a suicidal raped teenager to effect a termination while it claims to be addressing the general concerns of women in providing for terminations in approved hospitals. However, it is worth looking at what the legislation provides. The legislation extends the possibility to a Minister of approving places that may conduct medical procedures to terminate pregnancies where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, it provides no guarantee that an order will ever be made by the Government or its successor to approve any <Col N="1123" /> hospital or clinic anywhere in the State to carry out any such terminations.</P>
    <P>What would the position be if this proposal was successful and this Government or its successor was dependent after the next election on the four Independents who warned that should any hospital or clinic be approved for the carrying out of terminations they will either not support the Government or bring the Government down? This legislation is a charade. It makes a pretence of addressing what is referred to as the substantive issue, to allow for the carrying out of terminations in this State where women's lives are truly at risk, but gives no guarantee that any hospital or clinic will ever be approved for the carrying out of such terminations. The Bill only guarantees to end the possibility of young women who are the victims of rape or young women who are pregnant and suicidal having those pregnancies terminated in this State. In that sense the Bill is a charade.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting question. If this Bill is enacted and approval is given for a hospital or clinic to carry out terminations, there is no measure in the Bill for that approval to be withdrawn. I share the views expressed by Deputy Barnes when she criticised the use of the term &ldquo;social abortions&rdquo;. However, I raise the following proposition for those who wish to engage in that type of language. Should a hospital or clinic be approved, as is envisaged, for the carrying out of terminations, should the medical personnel in that hospital or clinic take a broad view of the circumstances in which terminations can be effected and should they effect what the Attorney General has referred to as social abortions, it is clear that, in the context of this measure being given a constitutional imprimatur in a referendum, there will be no mechanism available to Government to withdraw the approval previously given.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons and many others I do not have time to discuss, the Bill should be opposed. I wish to give the Government a warning. There is a suggestion that Committee Stage of this Bill may be taken by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health and Children instead of on the floor of the House, but that should not happen. Committee Stage of the Bill should be debated on the floor of the House with all Deputies having an opportunity, under the glare of public monitoring, to participate in that debate and to tease out the fundamental and fatal flaws in the proposal.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support a Bill which will give the people of Ireland an opportunity to express their view on abortion. Political research over the past decade has consistently shown that the people stand by their decision in 1983 to provide for a constitutional ban on abortion. If anything, support has grown for that ban since 1983. A new generation of young voters, too young to vote in 1983, will go to the polls to <Col N="1124" /> express their support for a constitutional ban on abortion.</P>
      <P>The current debate was sparked by the extraordinary judgment in the so-called X case in 1992. It seems perverse to many people that a constitutional wording designed to protect equally the unborn child and its mother could have been interpreted in such a way that the mother could threaten to kill herself and, in effect, her unborn child and use this threat to demand an abortion. It is my opinion, which I express under Dáil privilege as a Member of the Legislature, that no reasonable person could conclude that the people of Ireland or the Oireachtas intended to create any abortion right in passing the eighth amendment in 1983.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court ruled in February 1992 that such an abortion right had been created. That was the court's privilege. It is now our privilege to give the people a chance to right this perceived wrong. When this amendment goes before the people, it will be their privilege to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to it and I will join them in casting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>I have used the term &ldquo;abortion right&rdquo;. Those two words lie at the centre of the decade of debate since 1992. Let us get to the heart of the matter. In our society, as in almost all societies, there is a group of people who actively campaign to introduce abortion on demand. That is the ultimate abortion right. The way in which these people and groups work is to start with a hard case and press for the introduction of a limited abortion right which they then campaign to extend. In Ireland, the tactics of the pro-abortion lobby have been to try, despite the eighth amendment in 1983, to get something, anything, defined as an abortion right. Their main approach has been to attempt to have defined as abortion the long-standing medical practice of intervening to deal with an illness that threatens the life of a pregnant woman, where the treatment has a high probability of causing the death of the child, who would probably die anyway if the mother was not treated. The main reason for the opposition of those who support abortion to this constitutional amendment is that if it is passed, procedures intended to save a woman's life, as opposed to killing an unborn child, would not be defined as abortion.</P>
      <P>Those who campaign for limited abortion use the phrase &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo;. Pregnancy is the stage of human life between the fertilisation of a conceived human being in the womb and the birth of that human being. This constitutional amendment will prevent the intentional taking of human life during pregnancy. It is clearly and unambiguously anti-abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution will continue the unambiguous right of a woman to life during pregnancy, a unique phase of life during which two human beings physically co-exist, each with an equal right to life. When a medical threat to one or both lives occurs, very difficult decisions have to be made. The threat <Col N="1125" /> must be addressed with the intention of saving both lives, but unfortunately one life may be lost. Very often the unborn child, the weaker of the two, will not make it through. The death of the child in such circumstances is a different moral situation, however, to the deliberate destruction of the child. As medical interventions during pregnancy are intended to save life and not to kill it, these interventions are not murder and cannot be referred to as abortion. This Bill intends to facilitate the practice of such medical interventions. Natural occurrences lead to the need for medical intervention. There can be no question of the bona fides of an intervention that is made in response to the diagnosis of a serious physical problem. In plain language, such a problem cannot be put on for the purpose of procuring a social abortion.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the rare cases of ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilised egg does not reach the womb, rests in the fallopian tubes and develops there. Action has to be taken in such circumstances as the unborn child will not survive in the tubes and the mother may also die. The key point is that action should be taken to save life. The proposed amendment makes clear that intervention may happen in such cases without being seen to constitute abortion.</P>
    <P>There is no threat to the life of a woman in the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution, but there is a ban on abortion when a woman threatens her own life. If constitutional law allowed it, it would be the easiest thing in the world for a woman to announce that she is suicidal and to threaten to commit suicide if she cannot have an abortion. The Medical Council has protected this country from the introduction of such social abortions. I regret that the council has been targeted recently by the pro-abortion lobby, which tried to overturn the council's long-standing guidelines in a ham-fisted manner. The Medical Council should not have to hold the front line against abortion as that is our job as legislators, as Members of the Oireachtas. We have been elected by the people, to whom we will have to answer next year. Those of us opposed to abortion have put the onus on the Medical Council. We have asked doctors to take the main stand.</P>
    <P>Those of us on the Government side have taken a courageous stand to tackle this issue as legislators in a democratic manner, as desired by the people. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach for his leadership on this issue. The Government has taken time to think carefully about this issue. Deputy Brian Lenihan has played a key role in the process and it has been shown beyond doubt that his recommendations reflect the will of the public for a referendum on life. Members of Fianna Fáil have seriously doubted the resolve of the party and the Government to tackle this problem. Suspicion had started to build up against politicians as a result of years of delay and debate, but I hope people now clearly see that we will not let them down. Particular tribute is due not only to the Taoiseach and Deputy Brian <Col N="1126" /> Lenihan, but also to Deputies from the Progressive Democrats Party, who have displayed decisiveness. Although it is seen as a liberal party, it has put the democratic wishes of the people above the personal views of individual members. Deputies from that party will be seen as greater statesmen and stateswomen as a result.</P>
    <P>Such decisive leadership in an election year contrasts with the behaviour of the Opposition. I give credit to the leader of the Labour Party for announcing a clear policy favouring abortion in certain circumstances, although I oppose it. The problem faced by Deputy Quinn is that his party's policy directly defies the democratic expression of opinion at its conference. Members of the Labour Party voted to make it party policy to support abortion on demand. It is clear to all that the Fine Gael Party is incapable of demonstrating leadership on any matter related to the liberal agenda, as there are two totally polarised viewpoints within the party. It is united only in its defunct policy of civil war politics on the North and by its anti-Fianna Fáil tendencies. At least two Fine Gael Members of the Oireachtas from Dublin have based their political careers directly on their promotion of a pro-abortion stance. At the other end of the country, Fine Gael Oireachtas Members are completely pro-life. The result is that Fine Gael is incapable of taking a stand as a united party.</P>

      <P>I am aware that this issue cost Frank Crowley his seat in the Cork North-West constituency in the last election, as disgusted Fine Gael voters in that constituency switched in droves to Fianna Fáil candidates. They were disappointed by Fine Gael concessions to the liberal agenda of the Labour Party. Some smaller parties and Independent Deputies have questions to answer on abortion. I am grateful for the support of four Independent colleagues, Deputies Fox, Blaney, Gildea and Healy-Rae on this matter, but people would be foolish to conclude that all Independents are pro-life.</P>
      <P>Some campaigners speak of a woman's right to choose, but to choose what? If they mean a woman's right to choose abortion, why do they not say so openly? Most Irish people do not believe that a person has the right to take the life of another, but they believe that a woman has the right to choose whether to become pregnant. Our society supports that right to choose, provided it is exercised with regard to conception. There are differences of opinion regarding whether it is morally right to use artificial contraception and about the morality of forms of contraception which operate after conception, which are known as abortifacients. I will say more about this issue later. Those who oppose artificial contraception accept that a woman has the right to choose whether to become pregnant. There are differences of opinion regarding the freedom of choice that should be allowed when a woman's right to choose not to become pregnant has been violated. Severe sanctions are imposed on those who commit such violations. In the last decade, the concept of rape within marriage has been introduced by this House, precisely to support women's right to choose. As a crime, rape is considered as second in seriousness only to murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no question, therefore, about our support of the right to choose whether to become pregnant. Most people, however, will not support the right to a change of mind, at the cost of a human life, after pregnancy has occurred. There can be no moral justification for such a decision. Some campaigners talk of the terrible situation <Col N="1128" /> when a woman has been raped and becomes pregnant against her will. As I have said, our society sees this as the most serious crime that can be committed against a human being, with the exception of murder. It stands to reason, therefore, that we cannot condone the murder of an innocent unborn child, even in such terrible circumstances. Most people oppose abortion in the case of a pregnancy as a result of rape. We show support for women's rights by helping to pursue rapists, but we cannot do so by killing innocent children.</P>
    <P>What about suicide? Suicide may be a complex issue with many different causes. What was so wrong about the X case judgment was that it took the safety of an unborn human life out of the domain of medical judgments on medical threats to the mother's life and that of her child and into the domain of psychiatric assessment and even psychology in some cases. It was based, ultimately, on what a woman in a distressed state of mind was prepared to threaten to get her own way on abortion. It is quite clear that the pro-abortion people would make it known that certain psychiatrists who would be considered as pro-abortion could be relied upon to certify that a woman had suicidal tendencies to allow her the constitutional right to an abortion to be carried out in Ireland. She would, of course, be certified as having recovered from the suicidal tendencies once the abortion was performed. One might call it the pro-abortion Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the twenty-fifth amendment is to put a stop to that route to abortion. There is no secret about this. The X case effectively permitted social abortion, which those of us who support this amendment are trying to stop. It is as simple as that. The opponents to the holding of this referendum oppose it for one reason only. They are convinced that it will be passed by the people. To deny the people a referendum on a proposal in the knowledge that they would approve that proposal would be a fundamental denial of democracy, yet there are people in this House who oppose the concept of holding a referendum on this proposal. If they oppose it, let them campaign on that basis to get people to vote against it. However, there are serious questions about the commitment to democracy of anybody in this House who opposes the idea of putting this matter to the people for decision in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Those on the pro-life side have raised questions about abortifacients and stem cell research. The issue of stem cell research and cloning, as well as conception by artificial means outside the womb, raises other issues of a pro-life nature. Catholic teaching in relation to these questions is followed by most people in this country and that teaching simply states that these techniques are morally wrong as interference in the natural process of conception. There is a significant minority within the Catholic Church who would disagree to varying extents with this teaching. The situation is probably similar with the stance adopted by other <Col N="1129" /> Christian churches and other faiths &ndash; there are those who disagree to a varying extent. There is no legislative one-stop-shop or one size fits all proposal to safeguard human life after conception. Issues will continue to arise which will require debate and considered action.</P>
    <P>Although I am a Catholic and have no inhibitions about advocating Christian values in society, I would be disappointed if Christians of various denominations were the only people to support this ban on abortion. This a human rights issue for everybody, for people of every faith and none, for people of many religions, just as it a religious moral issue for me as a Catholic. However, people of no religion also have moral values. I would strongly encourage people who do not profess a religious belief, but who agree with the arguments against social abortion to join with Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox and other Christians, Muslims, Jews and other faiths in taking a pro-life stand at the referendum by voting &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  This is not a Catholic sectarian issue. If anybody has any doubts about this, they should ask Unionist politicians in the North what their policy on abortion is. On that point I hope we will not have to suffer listening to the nonsense about having a sectarian constitution in the Republic. Anyone who trots out that nonsense in support of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote does not deserve a hearing.</P>
    <P>The right tone for me to set in this debate is to say that I respect the honestly held views of those who argue that abortion is acceptable, but I strongly disagree with them. I believe I speak for a large majority of the people of Ireland, North and South, in saying that. I will vote in favour of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I will actively campaign for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the subsequent referendum. I am clear that this measure only bans abortion and does not tackle some other pro-life concerns. It is intended only to solve the abortion problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Bradford has had to leave. I obviously touched a nerve when I mentioned pro-life and pro-abortion Members of the Oireachtas in the Fine Gael Party. I thought I heard mutterings from some of them already today during the debate. I am sure we will hear more from pro-lifers, especially from the southern part of the country, who probably share my views. I apologise if I have upset him in any way, but one is entitled to express one's view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I am opposed to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. It has one purpose only, to overturn the 1992 ruling of the Supreme Court in the X case in which it stated that termination of pregnancy was allowed by the Irish Constitution when there was a substantial risk that continuation of a pregnancy could pose a serious threat to the life of the woman through self-destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change this Bill makes is to make <Col N="1130" /> illegal such a termination in such circumstances and therefore its effect is that the death by suicide of a woman is acceptable to the Government and preferable to the ending of the pregnancy which caused the state of mind that would trigger suicide. The Bill cannot, therefore, claim to protect human life in pregnancy because, stated at its most extreme, it elevates a fertilised embryo of some days old and virtually invisible to a pre-eminent position over the life of an adult woman. Even in the terms of the Government's own reasoning there is much absurdity in this because, according to it, it is fine to attempt to expel from the body of a woman before implantation a fertilised embryo that may have been some days in existence, but as soon as implantation has occurred, with virtually no difference in the state of the embryo, it becomes a serious crime to be prohibited, if the Government has its way, by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The only change the Bill introduces is to make illegal a woman's choice to have an abortion in the case of a threat or danger of suicide. It does not deal with the trauma of the thousands of women who end crisis pregnancies each year by travelling to Britain. It recognises existing practices, including the use of the intra-uterine device and postcoital applications. It, therefore, has nothing to do with the interests of women or morality. Its purpose is naked political opportunism.</P>
    <P>The Government believes it can copperfasten a small percentage of the conservative vote in the forthcoming general election and in that way make a bid to improve its chances of holding on to power after the next general election. It is quite incredible that the Progressive Democrats Party, which styles itself as a party of democrats and liberals, fully supports this proposal which has undoubtedly come primarily from Fianna Fáil. They do not, on this issue, deserve their title of Progressive Democrats, if they ever had a right to it. Pathetic Democrats would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is naked hypocrisy in the Government's approach to the trauma suffered by thousands of women. The Taoiseach in presenting the Bill said:</P>
    <P>In the last few days we have had further confirmation of the 6,500 occasions in the last year alone when women, giving an Irish address, have had abortions in Britain &ndash; about 18 women every single day of the year. Each of these stories is a cause of sadness in itself. Each of these stories demands a fair, compassionate and honest response from all of us.</P>
    <P>What is the fair, compassionate and honest response from the Taoiseach and the Government? It is to criminalise every woman who opts to terminate a pregnancy should she attempt to do so in the State rather than travelling to Britain. It is hardly honest and compassionate to threaten a woman with 12 years in jail at the most distressing time in her life. A woman, for example, in desperate circumstances, who tries to self-administer an abortion to end a crisis pregnancy and <Col N="1131" /> who ends up in a hospital in the State because things go horribly wrong will be at the centre of a criminal investigation as a result of what the Government is proposing in the Bill. It raises a big question about the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which I will speak about later, which is supposed to give aid, comfort, counselling and support to women who seek support and who have terminated a pregnancy. If that termination is carried out in the State in violation of the criminalisation policy of the Government, is the agency to which that woman turns obliged to notify the Director of Public Prosecutions that a crime has been carried out in the State, which would merit 12 years in prison, and is the DPP obliged to investigate and bring charges? That question should be answered by the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach claims the Government is providing an honest response and then he proceeds to enshrine blatant dishonesty in legislation. Section 1 decrees that an abortion is not an abortion because the Government does not wish it to be characterised as an abortion. Section 1 states that abortion &ldquo;does not include the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction&rdquo;. What does that mean? </P>
    <P>Abortion takes place in Ireland in registered hospitals by eminent obstetricians when that need arises. In November 2000 at the public hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution the master of the Rotunda Hospital made clear the position in that regard. He was frank and honest because he must deal with the real situation and not the fiction which politicians on the Government side create to try to gain political advantage and solve political problems. As regards terminations carried out to save the life of a woman in maternity hospitals, he said:</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that you are better to be up front and clean about this and say that the pregnancy is being aborted. That is the treatment. It's not that it is a side effect of the treatment, it's not that it's an unintentional side effect of the treatment. The treatment is you end the pregnancy. That is I think abortion.</P>
    <P>Yet the Government has stated that is not abortion because it knows it cannot ban abortion in those circumstances. However, if abortion is right in this circumstance, why is it not right in other extenuating circumstances? That is why the Government tries to say abortion is not abortion in certain situations it knows it cannot ban.</P>
    <P>As regards suicide, we have an incredible situation where the Government puts the life of a woman at a much lower standing than the embryo she is carrying. Those who wish to enshrine this in legislation are eager to play down the possi<Col N="1132" /> bility of women in crisis pregnancies committing suicide. Happily, it is not a common occurrence, but it is a possibility and it should be provided for in law. The master of the Rotunda Hospital, when dealing with this point, said:</P>
    <P>In medicine it is very dangerous to say things don't happen. I certainly was of that opinion but last year &ndash; the first time again &ndash; we had a woman &ndash; I had never seen it before &ndash; was brought into hospital, attempted suicide quite far on in the pregnancy, and it was a very serious suicide attempt, so it can happen. When you are dealing with humans you simply can't say it never will happen.</P>
    <P>There is a real and substantial risk to the life of some women from suicide because of crisis pregnancies, but the Government wants to trample on the right of a woman to safely terminate a pregnancy in such a situation. It is justifiable that the woman has the right to choose a termination in other cases. There is no question about it in the case of rape. If there is a violent attack on a woman, which is a crime of unspeakable proportion to begin with, and that crime is compounded by the woman becoming pregnant as a result, it is monstrous to force her to continue with such a pregnancy. It is reprehensible that a male dominated Parliament would seek to compel a woman in the State to continue with such a horrific pregnancy in such circumstances. A woman is justified in choosing to terminate a pregnancy which is caused by the violent acts of a man. Let no one be in any doubt that if the male species was transmogrified overnight and could become pregnant, the male dominated Parliament in the State would not compel men to carry the pregnancy through to a conclusion in the event of rape.</P>
    <P>As regards incest, particularly of young children, it is entirely justifiable that the woman concerned should have the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy which occurs in such tragic and criminal circumstances. If a woman opts not to terminate, every support should be made available to her. All counselling, psychological and financial aids should be provided but if a woman wishes to terminate a pregnancy, that must be respected.</P>
    <P>The Bill is laced with hypocrisy and goes as far as to state categorically that the right to travel to avail of an abortion in another state or the right to information in regard to abortion facilities in other jurisdictions are not interfered with. The Government's message in the legislation is to point the way to England for the thousands who experience crisis pregnancies in Ireland on a yearly basis. England is used by the Government and the Establishment as the convenient safety valve to deal with the problem they do not want to address and to allow women with crisis pregnancies to escape this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If England or any other jurisdiction with safe facilities for terminating pregnancies for women <Col N="1133" /> who opt to do so did not exist, Ireland would be faced with a different dilemma which the Government of the day or the Establishment could not escape because it would then be faced with the horrific reality of unsafe and back street abortions resulting in the deaths of women or the crippling of their health permanently. Undoubtedly, there would be an outcry that this would have to stop, even by those who find it morally difficult or objectionable to countenance abortion. A total of 80,000 women die each year as a result of complications from unsafe or back street abortions. Most die in the poorer areas of the world ruled by dictatorial regimes where abortion is banned and abortion facilities are not provided as of right.</P>
    <P>Abortion is a difficult issue. I respect fully that many people have moral objections and in their own case would never choose to have an abortion. Their choice should be fully resourced and supported but, equally, the only solution to this problem is that the choice must be left to the woman at the centre of the problem. It is repulsive to again hear Fianna Fáil politicians and others loosely tripping off their tongues terms such as &ldquo;the danger of social abortion&rdquo;, &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo;, etc., trivialising what is at any time, no matter what is one's view, an extremely difficult and painful decision for a woman.</P>
    <P>Politicians should read the stories of women in the book, <i>Irish Journey</i>, which was published recently. Above all else they speak about the silence imposed on them regarding the trauma they have gone through and the difficulties they had. They are condemned largely to silence because of the hypocrisy of the Establishment. A total of 100,000 women have made the journey abroad over the past 20 years. A substantial number of people, including partners and families, have had to deal with the reality of abortion as opposed to the theory. It is time we faced up to the issue honestly.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage must be taken in the House so that there is adequate time for every Member who wishes to contribute. If the referendum takes place, the constitutional amendment will be defeated in the same way as the Nice referendum by a combination of those who are opposed to the criminalisation of women envisaged in the Bill and a collection of the more conservative elements in society who object for their own reasons. It will, therefore, be a wasted exercise.</P>
    <P>I finally turn to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. There should be an agency and every support for crisis pregnancies but I condemn the fact that the establishment of the agency was delayed to coincide with the presentation of the anti-abortion Bill, when it could have been established years ago to support women facing these difficult circumstances. That was done again for political reasons to pretend that the agency was dependent on the legislation being passed. That is not the case and the agency could stand on its own. It should be properly resourced and brought into being immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. This is the first opportunity for a legislative response to this most difficult and emotive of issues since the X case in 1992. Most Members agree the legislative position has been unsatisfactory since 1992 and getting to the stage where the House could debate legislation on the matter has been a long and tortuous path.</P>
      <P>The issue has been extensively discussed and considered by the all-party committee on the Constitution. The committee took the advised road of inviting detailed submissions from interested parties. I was a member of the committee and there was an intense interest in the subject. The number of submissions meant that the committee secretariat was very busy for a long period during the hearings. The decision to provide concerned members of the public and the legal and medical professions with an opportunity to make individual submissions to the committee was very good. It took a long time to get through all of them but at the end of the day the subject was so serious that it would have been very wrong for a committee of the House to short circuit the debate and not provide people with their first opportunity to make their case to Oireachtas Members.</P>
      <P>As one who espouses the view that we should have a civilised society where there is clear and adequate protection for the unborn, I am pleased the Government has decided to introduce the legislation and, ultimately, to afford the electorate the opportunity to adjudicate on the subject. There were emotive debates on abortion in 1983 and 1992 and this is probably the final opportunity for the necessary constitutional amendment to be agreed by the electorate. The electorate wants the opportunity to air its collective voice. The Government made a wise decision to produce legislation and, by so doing, give the people the benefit of the debate in the House before the referendum is put to them. I hope this decision will be vindicated.</P>
      <P>This legislation seeks to protect best medical practice in this area. It also seeks to provide for a prohibition on abortion and to underpin that position by way of a constitutional amendment. In any man's language, this is a laudable objective on the part of the Minister. Those who predict that the referendum will be rejected by the electorate will have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>There is a diversity of views among Members on this issue and one can appreciate the depth of emotion which reflects the position outside this House. However, in the final analysis we are talking about the protection of those in the most vulnerable and least advantaged position to protect their own lives, namely, the unborn. We are balancing this objective with ensuring that the best medical practice and treatment can be provided for pregnant women. The underlying and core objective of this legislation is to get that balance right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if he interpreted it as a danger, <Col N="1135" /> but Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the issue of social abortion. Few, if any, Members would wish a situation to develop in which abortion was freely available and where the phrase &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; became common currency in the political arena. That would be undesirable and would quickly lead to a breakdown and lowering of standards in what is a reasonably civilised society.</P>
    <P>Having studied the hearings held by the constitutional committee and listened to the debate in the House, I am satisfied the Government has taken the right decision by bringing forward this legislation and underpinning it by way of a constitutional amendment to be endorsed by the people. It strikes a balance on this issue, while ensuring that this remains a civilised society and a beacon for other communities across Europe. If we are to give a lead in this direction we should not have to apologise to anyone for the stance we take.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation and hope it is passed. I also hope the referendum will be endorsed by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill. My party and I are opposed to the Government's attempt to foist on the people another referendum on abortion. I am opposed to the proposed amendment to the Constitution which is contained in the Bill and which will reduce the equal right to life of mothers which is part of the Constitution. I am also opposed to the Bill's attempt to overturn the decision made by the people in a referendum in 1992 arising from the Supreme Court's judgment in the X case.</P>
      <P>It is something of a cliché to state that people do not want another referendum on abortion. I believe this is generally the case, although I acknowledge that some people want another referendum. However, that is not the reason this Bill is before the House. The Bill is before the House because Deputies Fox, Blaney, Healy-Rae and Gildea want a referendum on abortion. These Deputies have made the holding of such a referendum a condition of their continued support for the Government. That is the sole reason this Bill is before the House.</P>
      <P>This proposal is before the House because the Taoiseach promised the four Independents who support the Government that he would hold a referendum on abortion in return for their continued and loyal support. To be fair to the Taoiseach, when he makes a political deal, he keeps it. However, this Bill and the proposed referendum on abortion are products of a political deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, what is happening is that Deputy Fox is prepared to come into this House and stand shoulder to shoulder with her constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, over his lamentable handling of the Sellafield and nuclear safety issues, provided she gets a referendum on abortion. Deputy Healy-Rae is prepared to vote for the dismantling of parts of the <Col N="1136" /> local government system to which he has given a lifetime of service, provided he gets a referendum on abortion. Deputies Blaney and Gildea are prepared to vote with the Government on health, education and other issues about which they would normally be concerned in their constituencies, provided they get a referendum on abortion.</P>
    <P>I normally take political deals and their consequences with a degree of equanimity. However, we must oppose such deals when their price and currency is to play some kind of coalition roulette with the lives of women and mothers. The price of this referendum and this political deal will be paid by women for generations to come.</P>
    <P>I am particularly surprised by the Progressive Democrats' participation in this squalid deal. I could not believe my eyes and ears when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, attended the Government's press conference to advocate support for this referendum. If the referendum goes before the people, I would find it hard to believe that Deputy O'Donnell would go into the privacy of a polling booth and vote for it. If that is the case, I do not understand how she can come into this House and vote for it.</P>
    <P>Neither can I understand the position of Deputy O'Malley. When this issue was before the people ten years ago, he stated:</P>
    <P>We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where a woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists. For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will supply that reference. The Deputy continued: &ldquo;Such a girl with her unborn could be condemned by this amendment with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life.&rdquo;  Nothing has changed since then. This Bill is about removing suicide as a grounds or justification for availing of an abortion. Deputy O'Malley was so strong on this issue almost ten years ago, yet we are led to believe that his party will support this proposal in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I cannot believe that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, will vote in favour of this measure. Close observers of exchanges in this House will have noted the significant differences in the replies given by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harney, as to whether this referendum will be held. The Taoiseach stated that the referendum will go ahead and indicated it will take place next February. This appears to be the case as we are debating the Bill in November. However, Deputy Harney seems to be implying that no agreement has been made on the date for the referendum and that it may not be held. It appears the Pro<Col N="1137" /> gressive Democrats, embarrassed by the support they have given to this measure to date, are now seeking refuge in not having the amendment put to the people.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is not the place to deal with an issue which is as complex and, ultimately, as personal as abortion. I was opposed to the 1983 referendum and campaigned against it. I have opposed the holding of another referendum and I believe legislation should be introduced to give effect to the X case decision. I very much recall the debate in 1983. During the course of it when it was argued that exceptional circumstances might arise, when cases like the X case and C case, which eventually occurred, were being postulated and when it was suggested that they would cause enormous legal, constitutional and human difficulties, those who supported the referendum argued that these cases could not happen. The argument that it cannot happen is again a feature of the debate we are having at present.</P>
    <P>The essence of the current proposal is to remove suicide as a grounds on which an abortion may be permitted. I find it astonishing that this is being seriously considered. Is it being suggested that illness or risk to life comes only in physical form? Surely after 100 years of the separate discipline of scientific psychology and after a couple of 100 years of psychiatric medicine, it must be recognised that there are behavioural, psychological and mental factors which may give rise to a risk to life. Is it also being suggested that medical practitioners are only to be entrusted with decisions in these matters where their practice relates to physical medicine and not to the practice of behavioural or psychiatric medicine?</P>
    <P>If, for example, a woman presents as suicidal no matter what the circumstances &ndash; for example, a woman who may be very seriously mentally ill &ndash; it is now being included in our legislation and with the force of the Constitution that medical practitioners may not intervene in that pregnancy no matter what the risk to her life. No matter how one can dance on the head of the pin, that is reducing the rights of that woman and the so-called equal right to life of that mother. That relates to what is being excluded by the Bill. However, we also have to look at what is in the Bill and what we propose to put in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Up to now abortion has been regarded as a physical operative procedure performed usually a number of weeks into pregnancy and performed in a medical facility or hospital. That situation is changing due to two developments, in particular. First, pregnancy testing can now be undertaken at a much earlier stage of the pregnancy and, second, post implantation pills are now being developed &ndash; some have already been developed and are available &ndash; the effect of which is to induce a termination of pregnancy. I suppose, and without being flippant about it, what is being developed is probably the 21st century version of the bottle of gin and the hot bath.</P>
    <P>Let us move a number of years forward. The <Col N="1138" /> abortion response, if one can put it that way, to a crisis pregnancy will not be what our experience of it has been to date &ndash; in other words, the pregnancy test takes place two or three weeks into the pregnancy, there is a number of weeks of agonising by the woman about what she is going to do and then she makes an arrangement to have a physical abortion in a facility in the United Kingdom. In ten years' time or probably much earlier than that &ndash; arguably even now &ndash; a pregnancy test will take place within a couple of days of pregnancy and a pill will be available which will induce a termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is in the Bill and how it responds to that. The Bill defines that as an abortion because it states that abortion means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation. What that means is that the taking of a pill in those circumstances would be regarded as an abortion. The Bill then goes on to define that as an offence which is punishable on conviction by up to 12 years in prison. Let us think about what we are putting not only into the legislation proposed here but into legislation which will have the force of the Constitution and which cannot be changed without a change in the Constitution. We are going to create a criminal offence that can put a woman in prison for 12 years for taking a pill which will induce a termination of pregnancy. We are not just saying that &ndash; we are going further. What is being proposed is that if one attempts to do so, one will also be guilty of an offence. For example, a woman who has the pill in her handbag could be charged and convicted under this legislation because section 2(2) states, &ldquo;For the purposes of this section, a person shall be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her conduct;&rdquo;. Similarly, a doctor who assists a woman or who prescribes the pill would be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the &ldquo;it cannot happen&rdquo; scenario. Given the way life goes on in this country and the way society sometimes deals with these things, even if this provision is put into the Constitution, we all know women are taking the abortion pill, as it may be called, and life carries on. What happens if a complication arises? Sometimes people can have a bad reaction to taking a particular pill or form of medicine. If a woman has a bad reaction and goes to her doctor, what happens then? Is the doctor required to report that a woman who has come to his surgery has taken a pill which is illegal not only under law but under the Constitution? What happens if a garda searching a woman's handbag under other legislation finds she has a pill which is not just banned in law but banned by our Constitution? If this legislation and referendum are passed, we will find ourselves back to the X case all over again. We will find ourselves in a situation where a women will be charged with an offence under this legislation for having taken the pill, about to take it or having it in her handbag and a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> Do not tell me it will not happen. It happened in the X case. The unexpected and the so-called impossible scenario materialised. If charges are brought, we will all sit around and hope the judge who hears the trial of the action will use his or her good judgment and common sense. We will all hope that not only will the woman not receive a 12 year sentence but that she will not even receive a 12 month or even a 12 week sentence for this offence. If a woman is sent to jail for even a day under this legislation, the telephone lines to Joe Duffy and Marian Finucane will be jammed. The telephone lines to every Member of this House will be jammed with people asking us what we will do about it. The reality is that by then, we will not be able to do anything because we will not be dealing with legislation but, according to this proposal, with the Constitution. It will be enshrined and embedded in the Constitution and it will not be able to be changed without another referendum.</P>
    <P>I understand and respect that there are differing views on the subject of abortion and that it is a complex and difficult issue that gives rise to complex and difficult ethical considerations. I ask Deputies, however, whether they agree that a woman should be sent to jail for 12 years for taking an abortion pill or for having an abortion of any kind. I put the same question, through this House, to organisations and individuals who urge us to have another referendum on abortion and place a complete ban on it. Do they agree with the proposal that women should be sent to prison for 12 years or for any period of time for terminating a pregnancy?</P>
    <P>This is not an abstract question because the provision in the Bill is black and white. Section 2(3) states that a person who contravenes section 2(3)(1), or attempts to do so, or aids, abets, counsels or procures any other person to do so, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 years or a fine or both.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that women should be sent to prison for terminating a pregnancy. I do not agree that we should create in this House criminal law which, by definition, applies to only one gender. Not only that, but it is criminal law which is to be enshrined in the Constitution. No matter what circumstances arise, no matter what opinions we may form in the future about the offence which is alleged to have been committed or the decision of a judge in a court case, we will not be able to change it in this House, as we would any other criminal law, except by way of a change to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to rethink this proposal and withdraw it. In particular, I appeal to Progressive Democrats Members, who do not support this proposal unless they have had a most extraordinary change of mind, to oppose and vote against it. This is not something that should be put to the people. If it is, it should be defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposition that should be put to the people who are the final arbiters, especially on issues such as this. We should trust them, whichever way they vote. For the past 20 years Members of this House and those outside have been well aware of the concerns expressed on all sides of the issue. It would be a failing on our part if we continued to ignore the problem and the views expressed in society.</P>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Gilmore said, the Government did not depend on the support of Independent Deputies before it made the decision to put a referendum to the people. It was a matter discussed prior to the last election when we gave a commitment that it would be considered when we came to power. The Government did not set out to arbitrarily bring forward its own propositions, but established an all-party committee which did tremendous research and took great time before bringing its report to Government. It was well attended and assiduously supported by its members during the years that it sat. It listened to an unprecedented number of submissions from all sectors of society. It came up with three different proposals rather than one decision. The Bill before us is based on the proposal that the Government has decided to put to the people.</P>
      <P>The Bill was launched in October. It addresses the complex issues surrounding the protection of human life. It is important to remember that it is about protection. Listening to some contributions it would be easy to believe that it is about the destruction of human life, which is far from the truth. As it protects unborn human life, it ensures pregnant women will continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancy. This is one of the issues that helped defeat the previous referendum when it was felt that women would not have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arose during their pregnancy. The Bill recognises this and should take away some of the fears present during the previous referendum campaign. Medical people acknowledge this.</P>
      <P>Irish maternity services have a high reputation. The Government is anxious that the law should protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment that doctors may consider necessary when rare life-threatening medical conditions occur during pregnancy. This is something of which people must be informed. It must be made clear that best medical practice is available to those with problems during pregnancy. This is important for men also. Some imply that fathers have no interest in their wives or their children, but I do not hold to that theory. Both fathers and mothers have deep worries if anything goes wrong, although the mother will, naturally, have more contact with the child. This protection of best medical practice should take away concerns and the misconceptions about what will happen if the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming to office the Government has engaged in exploring the issues in depth. It has <Col N="1141" /> listened to many individuals and organisations. Up to 100,000 submissions were made detailing views on the protection of unborn life. It considered ways of moving forward which can command the support of the people. It would have been wrong and a waste of time if it brought forward a proposition which was not well thought out and feasible in order that it might have a chance of success if put to the people. That success will be for the best possible motive &ndash; the protection of human life.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware that addressing constitutional and legal issues may have little impact on Irish women who choose to travel abroad for abortions. Many of those who participated in the consultation and discussion process which preceded the production of the Green Paper and later the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution have recognised this also. The study, Women and Crisis Pregnancy, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and carried out by the department of sociology in Trinity College, was very useful in providing an understanding of the factors leading to crisis pregnancy and the experiences of women in this situation.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution identified a range of issues to be addressed in a strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It also pointed out that several Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities for aspects of these issues. The complexity of the programmes needed and the co-ordination necessary for their success requires a single planning focus. It proposed the establishment of an agency to draw up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies, promote options other than abortion where a crisis occurs and provide post-abortion services. The agency would also have responsibility for overseeing implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Having considered the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the Government decided to set up a statutory agency to be known as the crisis pregnancy agency. Some £6.5 million is being provided by the Government to fund this new agency which will be established initially for a period of ten years. Not only will it deal with the health sector, but also with education, employment and housing. It is important for the agency to be all-encompassing, especially for the many single women who become pregnant. They not only require health care but also education, employment and housing.</P>
    <P>Preventative issues concerning the education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed. Much concern has been expressed about the need to make women more aware of their options should they experience a crisis pregnancy, to enable them to consider these carefully and to assist them before making decisions about the course of action they want to take. This is another major area which will be addressed by the new agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> One of the conundrums in our society, where levels of education are higher than ever before and so much information is imparted via the mass media, is that many young people are not aware of the facilities available to help them in times of crisis. I hope the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will help to reduce these deficiencies.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another issue which was highlighted in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Concern was expressed that legislation on abortion might have implications for the use of the morning after pill. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution felt that legal uncertainties that might exist with regard to the morning after pill should be removed. These treatments are intended to prevent pregnancy and, as such, do not come within the definition of abortion as set out in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. This legislation will, therefore, remove any doubts about the legality of emergency contraception in the form of the morning after pill and the IUD. The question of licensing any particular medicinal products will remain a matter for the Irish Medicines Board, the independent agency with responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill would overturn the Supreme Court decision in the X case, including suicide as a ground for abortion and other aspects of the judgment which could introduce wide-ranging abortion services. It would recriminalise deliberate, intentional abortion for anyone who aids or abets it and would differentiate between abortion and cases where the baby may die or be harmed by treatment necessary to save the life of the mother, but where practicable effort must be made to preserve the baby's life. This is the first time this has been done anywhere in the world. It could be argued that the legislation is unattractively written and off-putting, but essentially it does the job it was intended to do and will be a definite brake on the development of an abortion culture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Even though, theoretically, Ireland has had abortion since 1992, no legal abortions have been performed here due to the strict guidelines of the Medical Council as adopted in 1993 and 1998. However, things are changing and that may not hold in the future. That is one of the reasons it is necessary to have a legal underpinning for current medical practice.</P>
    <P>I would ask some people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider the consequences of rejection. If the referendum proposal were to be defeated it is most probable that abortions along the lines of the X case would follow some time in the future, and the situation may be further liberalised by court action if this loophole is not closed. I recommend to those individuals to heed what the Pope said in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, which stated:</P>
    <P>A particular problem of conscience can arise in cases where the logistical vote would be <Col N="1143" /> decisive for the passage of a more restrictive law aimed at limiting the number of authorised abortions, in place of a more permissive law already passed or ready to be voted on. Voting for such law does not in fact represent an illicit co-operation with an unjust law, but rather a legitimate and proper attempt to limit its evil aspects.</P>
    <P>People should take note of that pronouncement by the Pope. Some misinformation has been spread concerning the Bill, some of it through misunderstanding and some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread: that the Bill redefines life as starting at implantation, but it does not; that it redefines the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and leaves the way open for experimentation on human embryos, but it does not; and some even say that it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does absolutely none of these things and people who make such statements should be challenged.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some comments on suicide in pregnancy as that issue is being bandied about a lot by those opposed to the legislation. Suicide is a rare event and the suicide rate in Ireland is approximately ten per 100,000 per annum. The risk of suicide during the year following attempted suicide is approximately 1%, which is about 100 times that of the general population.</P>
    <P>The most identifiable risk factors are: male sex; aged over 45 years; unemployment or retirement; living alone; receiving medical treatment within the previous six months; or having a pre-existing psychiatric disorder.</P>
    <P>Pregnancy is not a risk factor in suicide. Pregnancy reduces the overall risk of suicide compared with the sector of the population that is not pregnant. In a study in the US, the estimated suicide rate for specific groups was: 0.6 per 100,000 pregnant women; 3.5 per 100,000 non-pregnant women; and 16 per 100,000 men.</P>
    <P>A study in England and Wales over a ten-year period found pregnant women aged 15 to 44 were 20 times less likely than non-pregnant women to commit suicide.</P>
    <P>Another study based on autopsy reports of all female residents in New York city, aged ten to 44, who committed suicide between 1990 and 1993 found that the number of suicides of pregnant women was only one third of that expected.</P>
    <P>Not only is the risk of actual suicide lower in, and following, pregnancy but also the incidence of parasuicide is low despite the high rate of psychiatric morbidity in pregnant and post-natal women. While pregnancy is a potent protector against suicide, induced abortion appears to be a risk factor. A review in Finland of 73 women who committed suicide between 1987 and 1994 found a mean annual suicide rate of 11.3 per 188,000. The suicide rate associated with birth was 5.9 and that associated with induced abortion was 34.7.</P>
    <P>The report on confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom 1991-1993 reports two deaths due to suicide within 42 days of the abortion and another two deaths in <Col N="1144" /> women known to be substance abusers who died of substance abuse overdose within one year of an abortion.</P>
    <P>Suicidal thoughts are relatively common in normal adolescent girls occurring in up to 16.5%, while in girls referred for psychiatric treatment suicidal thoughts occur in 36%. Actual suicide rates for teenage girls were 0.0003% for those aged ten to 14 and 0.0034% for those aged 15-19 years.</P>
    <P>Prediction of suicide is at the basis of the decisions, relating to abortion, in Irish courts. Writing about the Supreme Court decision in the X case, Dr. Kelleher pointed out that suicide is a rare event and in all rare events the greatest likelihood is that the event will not occur. Research evidence indicates that medicine and psychology do not have the ability to predict suicide, even with a moderate degree of accuracy. Numerous studies have attempted to predict suicide in high-risk populations. The most thorough assessment showed that the prediction of suicide was wrong 97 times out of 100. There is no literature on the association between threats and completion of the act since threats are so common and completed suicide is so rare. Therefore, extrapolating clinically or statistically from threats to complete suicide is impossible.</P>
    <P>All those who attended the oral hearings and were asked about suicide agreed that it is much rarer in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. Those questioned included Dr. Seán Daly, master of the Coombe, Dr. Peter McKenna, master of the Rotunda, Dr. Anthony Clare, director St. Patrick's Hospital, and Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychiatrist at the Rotunda Hospital. Even Dr. Alannah McGee, representing psychologists for freedom of information agreed when she said:</P>
    <P>Our evidence would concur with the general thrust of the findings that have been presented to you that completed suicide during pregnancy is significantly reduced over and above levels in non-pregnant women of similar ages.</P>
    <P>Dr. Anthony Clare and Dr. John Sheehan outlined the difficulty in predicting suicide. Dr. Clare referred to a statement from Dr. Kelleher to the effect that for every hundred cases of suicide predicted the prophecy was wrong ninety seven times. Dr. Geraldine Moane representing psychologists for freedom of information accepted this figure when questioned closely on the matter by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and she said &ldquo;certainly, they are 97% wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of contributors referred to the psychological impact of having an abortion. Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychologist to the Rotunda quoted from a Finnish study on suicide which found a six-fold increase in suicide after abortion. This study was cited by a number of other contributors. Perhaps the most telling analysis of the suicide question in relation to abortion was the statement of Dr. Anthony Clare:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> So if I were to summarise, I would say that the only real reason you will find psychiatrists involved in this is because we have been drawn in to try and get people off the hook over this issue. Who better than to get the psychiatrist to tell you that &lsquo;if this is refused, this woman will kill herself.' Well no such statement can be made with any great safety whether the person making it is a psychologist, psychiatrist or a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting the findings of the 1994 commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Rawlinson, into the operation and consequences of the Abortion Act, 1967, in Britain, which concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>The Commission heard from witnesses representing the Royal College of Psychiatrists who stated that although the majority of abortions are carried out on the ground of danger to the mother's health, there is no psychiatric justification for abortion. Thus the Commission believes that to perform abortions on this ground is not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law but also puts women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion without alleviating any psychiatric problems that already exist.</P>
    <P>It would be ludicrous to allow a procedure on grounds of suicide risk if that procedure itself increased the risk of suicide, as clearly demonstrated by the Finnish study. The response to those who are suicidal in pregnancy is to offer appropriate psychiatric help. The complete range of psychiatric services is available to these women and should be utilised in full.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies who continue to raise the issue of suicide as grounds for abortion are re-inventing the wheel and obviously have not read the contributions of the mental health professionals to the all-party Oireachtas committee. Their antics would seem to be a classic psychiatric case of denial &ndash; denial of what has been detailed in the report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on abortion and denial of the scientific information available on the risk of suicide in pregnancy. Deputy Owen pondered the question last week of why the body of psychiatrists had not publicly condemned the Government measures. The answer is that psychiatrists recognise that the disorders and behaviours they treat do no constitute grounds for abortion.</P>
    <P>If objectors on the Opposition benches really cared about women, instead of hurtling accusations of misogyny at speakers, they would welcome these measures and voice their concern at any proposal that sought to legislate for procedures, such as abortion, that place women at risk of suicide, instead of playing political and ideological football with this proposal and ultimately with pregnant women's lives and those of their pre-born children.</P>

      <P>I was not involved in a public fashion in the debate that took place in the House <Col N="1146" /> previously, but as an ordinary voter I followed the debate with interest. I was aware of the highly charged situations that arose in the House and in debates around the country and I am aware through family members of the difficult experiences many public representatives faced in 1983 and 1992. The same tension, bitterness and disrespect do not pervade the debate today although I am not sure the Tánaiste will receive the consensus she seeks.</P>
      <P>We will have the debate, that has been missing so far, only when this proposal is teased out in the public domain and when people get a chance to go over the detail. Like others, I have not received a large volume of correspondence on this issue but in the past week all the correspondence I received on the matter opposes the legislation. Many positive things can be said for the Government proposals. The most welcome is the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. Fine Gael published a Private Members Bill over the summer, the Care of Persons Board Bill which demonstrated our desire to address the lack of support for women with crisis pregancies. Support is essential, as acknowledged by many speakers today.</P>
      <P>An issue that is of great concern is that we are now attempting to reverse the X case judgment and to state that in legislation. In 1992 the Supreme Court determined in the X case that a threat to self-destruction can amount to a substantial risk to the life of the mother. Today we have a proposal which specifically excludes self-destruction. In the Government's wording this legislation excludes from the definition of abortion any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which, or as a result of which, unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction.</P>
      <P>Why is this? Why do we decide that suicide and the threat of suicide are not real illness and therefore do not entitle a woman to an abortion? I have been told by various professionals that suicidal tendencies cannot be measured and that their existence is based on opinion only. Where does the psychiatric profession stand on this question? I know of no study of suicidal pregnant women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that pregnancy is a protective state of being and that most pregnant women develop nurturing and protective tendencies towards their unborn child. I am sure this is true for most pregnancies but what studies have been carried out on crisis pregnancies? What were the feelings of the unfortunate 14 year old girl at the centre of the X case and what attitude did she have towards her pregnancy? None of us will ever know. The debate at the time centred around her right to travel. How many studies have been carried out on suicidal women in crisis pregnancies? I do not believe such a study exists. We have heard much discussion on the non-risk of suicide among pregnant women. However, not all preg<Col N="1147" /> nancies are normal. Many pregnancies exist in a situation of crisis rather than of happiness and support. Age, poverty, family commitments and the fear of social stigma can all create a crisis for a pregnant woman. A crisis pregnancy is completely different from a normal pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The Master of the Rotunda Hospital, Dr. Peter McKenna, wrote in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>:</P>
    <P>I have reservations concerning the fact that the risk of suicide has been removed specifically as a justification for termination. I personally have never seen a patient where a termination is necessary for psychiatric reasons but I have a niggling fear that some day I might. [He goes on to say] I am still unhappy that a specific cohort of patients are being excluded for no better reason than their inclusion could be open to interpretation.</P>
    <P>This expresses my own concern. I am aware of the report given by Dr. Anthony Clare to the all-party Oireachtas committee in which he appears to exclude a pregnant woman having suicidal tendencies.</P>
    <P>Doctors differ and opinions vary but we are being asked to make a judgment on something with which we are not medically equipped to deal. I am neither a medical nor a psychiatric expert. I could get several different opinions from a number of medical professionals. Which of us could stand with our hands on our hearts and say that no pregnant woman should ever be allowed an abortion if she is suicidal? Which of us can say that such a situation will never arise? The fact that we are attempting to attach such a provision to the Constitution is alarming.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why mental health does not have the same standing as physical health in this area. Have we made any advances in our sympathy for mental illness or our understanding or recognition of it? What will this referendum and legislation mean for the recent advances in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression or post-natal depression? Society now regards these conditions as illnesses and treats them accordingly. Are these advances to be downgraded? It is being argued that a person, male or female, who says he or she is suicidal cannot be trusted. How do psychiatrists stand on this question? Are they to be trusted? It is implied that a pregnant woman could easily claim to be suicidal and thereby demand an abortion in this jurisdiction. If that were the case we would have seen such claims made since the Supreme Court judgment of 1992. Following that judgment any woman is entitled to an abortion in this country if she is suicidal. The Minister said that the inclusion of suicide &ldquo;would not command wide support and could, in effect, ultimately open the way to social abortion&rdquo;. If this were the case the Minister's fears would have already become a reality since 1992 but the floodgates have not been opened. The Supreme Court judgment has <Col N="1148" /> not led to abortion on social grounds. However, the number of Irish women travelling to the UK for abortions since 1992 has increased to more than 6,000, and this is merely the number of women who give Irish addresses.</P>
    <P>The essence of the current proposal is exactly the same as that put to the people and rejected in 1992. I do not believe the views of the electorate have changed since then. They made their judgment on three proposals in 1992 and I believe they will do so again, when and if they vote on the referendum. We are going back over the same ground. The same positions were articulated in this House at that time, although I believe some Members have changed their opinions since then.</P>
    <P>The proposal has been described as anti-women. It says to a section of the community that we do not accept their bona fides in a particular situation. It is dangerous to ask the people to make a judgment on the mental health of a pregnant woman. The women of Ireland will reject this amendment and many men will support them in their views. I agree with Deputy Michael Ahern when he says this is not an issue for women only. Many women who travel to the UK for abortions do so with the support of their male partners, many of whom travel with them. Many men play a part in supporting women when they are pregnant and in the period following pregnancy or abortion. The issue affects men and women, although women deal with the physical reality of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgments following the X case and the C case both stated that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and a substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that this real and substantial risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination would be lawful. Having been through the process in 1992 I fail to understand the value of putting the issue to the people again. From what I have seen and heard I have no doubt the proposal will be rejected.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate so far has centred on arguments for and against the constitutional amendment. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency also deserves to be discussed in detail because it can make an enormous difference. The recommendation of the committee on the Constitution to establish such an agency followed a proposal from Fine Gael. It is in this area that we will do most to reduce the level of abortion. While the legislation will do nothing for the 6,000 women who travel abroad each year, the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is a very valuable initiative.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies through education and raising awareness, particularly of contraception. I welcome the Minister's statement today and in a number of earlier press releases that the agency will address the needs and concerns of women who have already had abortions and provide them with the kind of support that has been lacking to date. As the debate progresses, we should <Col N="1149" /> not forget that choosing to travel to the United Kingdom for an abortion is a very lonely journey for any woman. These women have few supports in this country.</P>
    <P>The committee report outlined the reasons women cited for proceeding with an abortion. Job related concerns were cited by 36 women, the stigma of lone parenthood by 30 and the needs of the child by 30. A further 28 cited financial concerns, 27 were not ready to have a child, 34 could not cope, 32 stated they were too young and 19 already had a child. Others mentioned education and training while some said they never wanted a child. Social stigma, however, is cited again and again.</P>
    <P>The recent report on lone parents produced by the National Economic and Social Forum outlined the problems many single parents face. They include poverty and barriers to employment such as child care, housing problems such as finding accommodation, and rent problems such as dependency on local authorities for rent and supplementary welfare allowance. These issues need to be addressed. I welcome the fact that the new agency will underpin and support the work being carried out by these agencies which already provide a valuable resource for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies, particularly young women.</P>
    <P>To reduce unwanted pregnancies, particularly among young people, there must be a greater emphasis on education, notably sex education and the use of contraception, in particular. We have heard a great deal about sex education programmes prepared for children. However, some schools, including some I know, have not adopted these very valuable programmes. Many parents depend on the education system to provide their children with practical information and education on sexual matters. While there will always be some who do this at home, we cannot depend on parents. It is important that sex education is available in schools also.</P>
    <P>Many unhelpful labels, both pro-life and pro-abortion, have been bandied around in this debate. The majority of Irish people do not want abortion made available and I do not know of anyone who wants abortion made as readily available as in the United Kingdom. However, people do want to ensure the life of the mother is protected in all circumstances and that medical opinion is respected. I hope the debate will advance with respect shown to both sides.</P>
    <P>Although I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I would like to contribute on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to hold Committee Stage in the House in order that we can tease out the matters of concern to my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I commend and thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children <Col N="1150" /> and the Cabinet for bringing the Bill in its present format before the House. It is the result of a great deal of research, debate, thought and deliberation and represents the best possible solution to our legal dilemma. It best represents what the people have said consistently in successive referenda and is the best option for the future of Irish society.</P>
      <P>The proposal will overturn the Supreme Court decision in the X case, including suicide as a ground for abortion, and, perhaps more importantly, other aspects of the judgment which could introduce wide-ranging abortion. Other suggestions, which would further copperfasten the intended effect of this move, will be taken on board by the Government. No one has the monopoly of wisdom, especially in this 20 year debate, but the proposal contained in the Bill represents an honest attempt to finalise a debate and campaign which have dragged on for more than two decades.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that the legislation is unattractively written and off-putting. We have seen this type of legislation used effectively with regard to the Good Friday Agreement. The essential point is that it does the job it was intended to do and will act as a brake on the development of an abortion culture in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the possibility that it will be the ultimate solution, but I am realistic enough to know that, even if this measure is passed in the Oireachtas and approved by the people, medical advances, both good and bad, which are currently beyond our imagination, may force us to return to this Chamber in the future. We, or our successors, will have to deal with that. I am convinced, however, that this logical and reasoned amendment is the best possible course and will find favour with the vast majority of our people.</P>
      <P>Occasionally, legislation is presented in this House about which one can be totally positive. This is, thankfully, one such item. Few subjects generate as much emotion or controversy as abortion. Now that the debate is under way the media will be filled with opinions of every shade and hue and tempers will rise accordingly. Already we have seen the predictable articles from eminently predictable journalists, primed no doubt by equally predictable politicians, declaring that the last thing we need is another divisive debate and referendum campaign on the subject of abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree and their stance is the usual hypocritical one. Those who favour abortion often disguise the fact by using phrases such as &ldquo; the right to choose&rdquo;. Change for them means the widespread availability of abortion. Change means making available what they claim to be a civil and basic human right of being able to kill another individual, albeit one still in the womb in the protection of its mother. How anyone could either reason for that or see any possible right or logic in the claims is beyond me. I believe it is beyond the comprehension of the majority of the Irish people who, at the end of this process, wish to see a legal regime in place which protects, not <Col N="1151" /> only the rights of every individual, but their dignity and right to life as well.</P>
    <P>That is what we are charged to bring about. That is our duty and that is what this measure sets out to achieve. Perhaps such people would like the old absolutist dictatorial way of no debate, only decree. It would suit their purpose to have their proposal slipped through on the nod, with little or no debate, no consultation and no opportunity to endorse the will of the people in a constitutional provision or even legislation.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and would ask people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider what the consequences of rejection would be. If it were defeated it is most probable that abortion along the lines of the X case would follow sometime in the future and perhaps be further liberalised by court actions if this loophole is not closed now.</P>
    <P>One must give a certain grudging respect to the Labour Party, who on this occasion has shown no equivocation and has made its stance abundantly clear on the subject. It has gone as far as having its annual conference give it a clear direction in favour of abortion on demand and, by extension, the opposing of this measure before the House today.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are less clear on its position, but Fine Gael does not seem to know which way to jump on any issue. All it can be sure of is that it will eventually choose the losing option. A certain expression from Fine Gael's past involving soup and a fork comes to mind. I think that so far &ndash; we have to acknowledge we are not very far advanced nationally with this debate &ndash; we have seen a colouring of the waters by the media and an emphasis that leads us towards a liberal abortion regime. I oppose that strongly. I consider it wrong, bad law and a very backward step for this country. I believe the proposal before us is the best option possible and is the result of proper preparation.</P>
    <P>There has been much misinformation spread about this Bill some of it through misunderstanding, some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread that it redefines life as starting at implantation, redefines the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and leaves the way open for experimentation on human embryos. Some even say it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does none of those things and people who make such statements should be challenged. I repeat the same words I have spoken in this House before. I am not a spokesperson for the pro-life lobby or any other pressure group. If my views, opinions and beliefs run parallel to theirs, then so be it. I accept their right to campaign for a particular view, just as I accept the right of those opposed to put forward theirs.</P>
    <P>I do not see this as a Catholic Church or any other church issue. It is an issue of right and wrong, of what is acceptable in our society and what is not. Most of all, it is a matter of what has <Col N="1152" /> been approved and accepted by the people in the democratic privacy of the polling booth. That, and only that, is what is at stake here. The previous Government shirked its duty on this issue, but it will forever stand to the credit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Government of today that it is now being tackled head-on and the path being chosen is that which has been dictated by the people in two referenda. On previous occasions, the intent of the Oireachtas was frustrated in this matter and once more we have to place our intent on the record and ask the people to endorse it. The simplicity of the proposal before the people and the comprehensive way it is being dealt with on this occasion leaves me in no doubt that the people will come out to vote and will give it their resounding approval.</P>
    <P>Loath as I am to mention the June experience, I feel that on this occasion the approach by the Government has been impeccable and will be shown to be so in the polls. There will be attempts to muddy the water. There will be the campaign of misinformation, some of which has already started. There will be the cry of &ldquo;not another divisive campaign&rdquo;. By its very nature, any proposal being put to the people will show that there is a body of opinion for and against the proposal. That is the nature of politics. Every proposal is opposed for a variety of reasons, not all of which are even complementary.</P>
    <P>As one example of less than clear and responsible reporting, I quote from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 4 October, where under the title of &ldquo;Abortion: Saga Goes On&rdquo; Mary Carr attempts to give the background of the two decade history of the abortion debate. It is woolly to say the least and if it were not to have an effect on how people approach the matter at present, it is one piece which could easily be discarded. Under the sub-heading: &ldquo;It's back&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>In 1983 the nation was convulsed by a bitter abortion referendum campaign. Now the issue that has divided Ireland ever since is back to haunt us. But how has it come to this &ndash; and why has Bertie Ahern decided to act now?</P>
    <P>Politics itself is divisive. There is a natural division of opinion in every facet of life, especially in politics, otherwise we would not have five parties represented in this House or the need for them. There are few enough questions on which there will be anything approaching unanimity, though I am convinced that the majority of people are still fully committed to a ban on abortion.</P>
    <P>In explaining the eighth amendment of the Constitution, the right to life amendment, Mary Carr states:</P>
    <P>In the early Eighties, there was a vigorous campaign from the Pro-Life campaign and the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child to have an amendment inserted into the Constitution prohibiting abortion. The argument was that abortions may one day be legally possible unless such a safeguard was in place. But <Col N="1153" /> aside from the vocal and well-funded pressure groups, no such demand was coming from the general public. Nevertheless, both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael caved in and committed to supporting such an amendment.</P>
    <P>There is an immediate suggestion there that it is in some way wrong to hold pro-life views. The parties we are told &ldquo;caved in&rdquo; to doing what was right. That is a misrepresentation of the facts. The reason there was no widespread demand from the people for a referendum at that stage was that very few knew it would be required. It was a subject which was out of sight until brought to the forefront by the pro-life campaign. Thankfully, there were people alert to what was on the horizon, including members of Fianna Fáil, who had the foresight, commitment and courage to fight for constitutional protection for the unborn. Is there anyone today, almost 20 years on, who does not believe that without that campaign, which both alerted the people to the possibility of the introduction of abortion and eventually brought about the constitutional amendment, attempts would not have been made to have abortion brought in through legislation and on the pretext that it was a human right? I do not believe so. The people responsible for that chain of events have earned the gratitude of the people and I know that in time there will be a better understanding of the service they rendered to the people.</P>
    <P>Having sketchily traced the history of abortion to 1992 and the passing of two of the three amendments, the newspaper article asks why things cannot stay as they are.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Politics&rdquo; is the reply, suggesting that the sole reason for action is to retain the support of the Independents. Whatever validity might have been attached to this in the early years of the Government, given that we are within six months of a mandatory election, it will matter little when the next election is called or precipitated.</P>
    <P>This is just one more cheap shot, one which the people may choose to believe, but which is wrong. Everyone in this House knows that for the past nine years we have been in a legal limbo in regard to abortion and a situation has existed which should have been remedied by a referendum or legislation. Even taking two years to lay the groundwork properly and have the necessary consultation as well as publish a Green Paper seems to be a reason for criticism rather than an acknowledgement that a careful, prudent and proper course was followed.</P>
    <P>It appears that one is damned if one does and damned if one does not and even when action is necessary and long overdue, credit cannot be given by some to the Taoiseach and the Government for having the courage to enter where the last Government feared to tread.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Herald </i>also reported:</P>
    <P>The Pro-Life lobby have been fretting about the possibility of further court cases paving the way for a form of social abortion. They don't <Col N="1154" /> accept abortion can ever be the answer to a life-threatening medical condition.</P>
    <P>I am not a spokesperson for any organisation or lobby, but I do not think that a majority within or without the pro-life movement would totally disregard the threat to the life of the mother. I am aware and accept there are occasions where applying medical procedures to save the life of the mother results in the death of the foetus. This has widespread acceptance among the medical profession and the general public and to say otherwise is an outdated argument.</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that the current legal position in regard to abortion needs attention. There is a division of opinion on how the problem should be tackled. Some argue for a legislative solution in order that down the line it can be easily re-entered, changed and altered all too easily. The opposite view suggests it should be tackled via a referendum. Given the people's clear indications on several occasions previously, any objective assessment would suggest this would be the proper course. The foundations have been laid, the groundwork done, and all the indications are that the current proposal represents the views of the people and, by extension, will find favour with them. This is one of our functions, to interpret and represent the will of the people and turn it into legislative action.</P>
    <P>I want to make my position clear on this matter. I am totally opposed to abortion, whether carried out in Britain or any other jurisdiction, and equally opposed to such a service being available here. Those who hold this view are regularly accused of exporting our problems. I do not agree. This is the only jurisdiction for which we, in this House, have a responsibility and we can only ensure that what happens here is in accordance with the wishes of the people and the law of the land.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if women did not go to Britain or elsewhere for abortions. I would prefer if they were actively encouraged and assisted to stay in Ireland and bring their pregnancy to a successful conclusion. That would be in their best interests in the long run and that of their baby.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I also welcome the parallel proposal to establish a crisis pregnancy agency to help achieve this and I am pleased that the Minister has done this in advance of the current proposal. It is long past time that the voluntary agencies, funded privately and voluntarily or by the Churches, were relieved of some of the burden of dealing with crisis pregnancies. I have no doubt that, through their work during the years, they have not only prevented a great many abortions, but saved mothers the subsequent trauma which inevitably follows an abortion.</P>
    <P>We should formally thank them for doing this work, which was at least as appropriate to the State as it was to the volunteer bodies. There is no quantifying the work they have done and the misery they have prevented. We could well wonder whom among those young people who walk our streets, attend our schools or toil in our work<Col N="1155" /> places, might have been denied an existence but for the intervention of these agencies. That is what it boils down to, people alive today who might otherwise have been consigned to oblivion.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill indicates it is a positive measure. It is not couched in any anti-style of language, but proclaims that it is positively for the protection of human life in pregnancy. There is a new clarity, too, about what constitutes life before birth, which I also welcome.</P>
    <P>The legal and parliamentary mechanism whereby this provision is being inserted into the Constitution requires that similar legislation be enacted within six months of a successful referendum. I urge the Taoiseach to complete the business of having the legislation passed within the life of this Dáil in order that this difficult question can be solved once and for all.</P>
    <P>The public wants this matter brought to a finality and has indicated precisely in what fashion it wants this done. The current proposal fulfils that duty and I unreservedly support it.</P>

      <P>As a legislator, I, like many others, consider I should make a contribution to this debate. As I am not a family doctor, I do not have a qualification in that area.

As each wave of persuasion came, I tended to go in the opposite direction, such was the degree of passion, for want of a better description, delivered in the course of correspondence and debate.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is a more rational debate on this occasion. I distinctly remember it being said at the time that the debate arose as a result of a promise made by party leaders before an election.

      <P>Unfortunately, we are still making them. The sooner we come to grips with this the better for politics and our society.</P>
      <P>The debate evolved and at the time we were told that the amendment brought forward was the amendment of all amendments, that it was the one that would set aside everything, resolve all problems and eliminate the possibility of abortion at any stage in the future. It was a change from the original wording. It was agreed by the main parties in the House and eventually put to the people and carried. We all know what happened. The sad part is that it was not the amendment to end all amendments because it was breached in the first difficult case that arose. There were legal and medical experts on both sides who were able to argue everybody who spoke on this matter out of existence and said that debate would be the end of the argument. There are those &ndash; more power to them if they are correct &ndash; who will say today that this will be the end of the debate, but unfortunately it will not. For some reason this debate goes on and on.</P>
      <P>In the past couple of days I, like other Members of the House, received correspondence inquiring about the definition of when life begins. It is starting the debate all over again about whether implantation or conception is the correct interpretation of the beginning of life. I am not a theologian and I do not know if I am qualified to come to a decision in such a debate. I do not know that the lawyers are qualified either. I doubt that the Supreme Court is in a position to make an absolute definition, but only a judgment on the debate. I am a male member of society. A woman probably looks differently at that issue. She would look at it against the backdrop of perhaps having to make a decision. Again, I am not saying whether she should go one way or the other. That would depend on the compelling factors at the time. However, it could be difficult for a woman in a situation like that.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with cases, as have other Members, and will no doubt deal with cases in the future, where advice had to be given to people in difficult circumstances. One does one's best. I have not advised anybody to have an abortion or not to have an abortion. It is a matter for the individual. Obviously it has to be the woman who makes that decision as she is the person most directly involved. That then brings into focus the question of the unborn and at what stage life begins. We are thus back to the argument of whether it begins at implantation or conception. Where do we go from there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage an end to that argument. I listened carefully to this debate in the past. I distinctly remember when the so-called X case arose. The proposal before the House is to incorporate legislation in the Constitution and to interlink the two in such a way that they cannot be separated without another referendum. What happens in the case of a woman or girl who is a ward of court? I am aware of the argument that has taken place as to how this might be resolved <Col N="1157" /> but I do not anticipate an easy resolution if there is a division at the time such a case arises. The argument cannot be postponed for a couple of years so that it can be worked out. The decision has to be made and cannot be postponed. It may well be that whatever side one comes down on, one may be wrong. The critical issue is that in the event of such a scenario developing, what happens then? Where do we go for advice? Do we go to the lawyers, doctors or theologians? Can we expect that the advice available will be ultimately correct? I do not believe it can be.</P>
    <P>I hate to be judgmental, particularly in regard to situations in which I do not have to make a decision. It is not a personal decision so it is easy to give advice to others. It is easy to tell somebody what is the morally upright thing to do. I have to admit that I do not know how I would react if I were in that situation. For that reason, I hope I would be humble enough to admit to being a mere mortal and to try to get away from the usual judgmental advice that is handed to us, as it were, from some higher authority that we dare not question in relation to a subject about which we know little. After this debate, I hope there will be peace in the land in relation to this subject. I am not in favour of abortion but it is easy for me to say that since I am not likely to have to make a personal decision in relation to it.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the argument. The other side of the argument is the right to life, which I accept and endorse. I do not accept that anybody has a higher moral ground or stance. Each Member of the House is equal in their knowledge of the situation and of the circumstances likely to arise in the future. I do not believe, therefore, that we should be deferring to opinion, whether it be eminent legal opinion, the Supreme Court or medical opinion. We all have the right to make up our minds and to state our views. That is the best way to be fair.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we were told the referendum was the end of the debate. I am reliably informed by those who know such things that this proposal is also the end of the debate. I do not think so. In the event of a hard case arising &ndash; there are many variations of what would constitute a difficult case &ndash; what happens then? Who takes the decision? Do we have a referendum? Do we go to the Supreme Court? The Irish solution to the Irish problem is fine but I hope that whatever happens hereafter will be humane, compassionate and caring. Those are elements in the debate that were lacking in the past. I hope they are present in the current debate.</P>
    <P>What happens in the future when we might have to deal with the situation as it arises again? A couple of things can happen. We can do nothing. We can throw up our hands and say we do not want to discuss the issue further. If somebody is caught on one or other side of the argument, we can say &ldquo;tough luck&rdquo; and walk away. That would not be a compassionate or caring thing to do. I have no doubt that circumstances will arise at some stage in the future which will <Col N="1158" /> be so compelling as to make it virtually impossible for people to claim it does not concern them but is a matter for the law courts, the medical profession or for another referendum. I am not sure we can go down that road. Unfortunately, I fear it will come to that.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that arose in the landmark X case was the risk of suicide and the threat to the life of the mother creating a situation where the life of the unborn could be terminated. It is not an easy decision. Who is in a position to come to that judgment now? What has happened in the meantime to prove beyond doubt to the various professions involved that in such a situation the methodology of the proposed legislation is sufficient to address the issues raised? Nothing has happened. I hope I am proven wrong. In the event of that situation emerging again, what do we do? What will we do if a tragedy occurs? Will we have another referendum? Will we seek legal advice once again? What will we do?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has been castigated by Government Deputies. It is unusual for them to do so and I know it pains them greatly to embark on such a tirade. The leader of my party requested replies to a series of questions which were carefully considered and well phrased. The questions were mindful of the history of this issue. Some of the replies were vague and unsatisfactory, to say the least, so further information is required. I do not feel embarrassed that Fine Gael has not decided one way or the other just yet. By considering the issue, we are doing the right thing. There will be no time for reflection after the referendum. Therefore, before the referendum, there should be a full clarification of the matters raised by Deputy Noonan in relation to abortion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally claimed that the Independent Deputies who support the Government had nothing to do with the timing of this referendum, but that is not what they say as they claim to have been instrumental. The political question that automatically arises is whether the Independents are wrong. Have they told a fib? Are they spinning a yarn? I would be careful if I was a Government Deputy as I would not be able to rely on my Coalition partners. I would quiz them carefully to be absolutely sure of what is being said. Although we are approaching a general election, the landing may go wrong. Instead of suggesting that the Independents had nothing to do with the timing of this Bill, perhaps Deputy Kenneally could have admitted that it was brought forward and the Government is responding to the views of the Independents.</P>
    <P>I started by pointing out that I am a mere male Member of this House. I have the right to comment during this debate, but I do not claim to have the same knowledge or clarity on this matter as female Deputies. It is a normal and natural state of affairs. It is unlikely that I will have to make a personal decision in relation to this matter but I respect the views of those who have had to make such a decision. Compassion and understanding of the events that led to the problem <Col N="1159" /> should be demonstrated. Our society should support those who have made decisions and who may later have felt that the decision was right or wrong. Hindsight always brings clear vision, but we should be caring and compassionate to those who have to make difficult decisions. If we do not display such values, we have lost our way.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that this matter will not have to be revisited again. It seems extraordinary that a Bill and a constitutional amendment are to be linked. I assure the House that this will happen again, when people learn about the possibility. People on housing lists may call for their needs to be incorporated in the Constitution. Similar provisions may be made in areas like education and health, for example, for those looking for orthodontic treatment or for those on waiting lists. Why is it not written into the Constitution that such people may have recourse to the Constitution to have their needs addressed? It is a thorny operation and I hope the right decision will be made. This should be the last time we have to address the issue of abortion in my lifetime, but I am afraid that will not be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, which will provide constitutional and legislative protection for human life in pregnancy. It is a reasonable, comprehensive, fair and compassionate response to a difficult topic. The Medical Council's guidelines from 1993 and 1998 have provided a <i>de facto</i> legislative substitute in relation to abortion in recent years, which is hardly to the credit of this Parliament. Although we have waited for this Bill and the constitutional amendment, at least they are here now. Some of the criticism of these Houses that has been heard in recent years, especially since the X case, has been warranted. Certain issues needed to be addressed by the Oireachtas, but they were ignored. It was not as though the issues could be addressed in a day or a week or a shorter length of time and it is understandable that it has taken so long. I welcome the fact that comprehensive legislation, which includes a proposal for a referendum, has been brought forward.</P>
      <P>Taking up the point made by Deputy Durkan, there may well be merit in revisiting this legislative model in the future, although perhaps not for the issues he mentioned. There may well be instances where it will be desirable to enshrine legislation in the Constitution. It is something that future Parliaments may look at. I find it difficult to follow the logic of those who oppose the holding of the referendum and the discussion of the Bill on the grounds that they have not had enough time to absorb the issue. I could understand if somebody outside the Houses made that point, but it is difficult to understand why Members do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan made a good point when he said that politicians should be wary of making <Col N="1160" /> pre-election promises. It is good advice, regardless of the issue under discussion. Political leaders find it difficult to resist making such commitments when the battle has commenced and when rumours are circulating that other parties are about to make promises. Although we may consider ourselves to be clever parliamentarians, we have to admit that various lobby groups frequently outfox us. Despite the sophistication of party machines, individual candidates give commitments when adrenalin is running a couple of weeks before an election and they later find they are surprised to have made such promises. I do not make my comments with specific regard to the issue of abortion as the <i>status quo</i> could not have been maintained, even if no commitment had ever been made.</P>
    <P>I doubt if circumstances could have led to a better resolution of this problem than that proposed by the Government. There has been much debate on the matter in Oireachtas committees in recent years. Although many people will disagree with me, it is fair to say that a huge majority of those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the 1983 referendum disagreed with the subsequent Supreme Court interpretation. Many people were sympathetic regarding the specific case and may have understood the leeway afforded by the Supreme Court decision, but the overturning of the referendum, which was the <i>de facto</i> outcome of the Supreme Court judgment, was a step too far for many people.</P>
    <P>The question of whether male Members of the House or male members of society are entitled to hold a view on this matter has been raised and they are, but female Members of the House and female people in society have a valid but different perspective which they manage to put across to the men in their lives strongly enough for it to be taken on board. It is a very high standard to set for legislation or for a constitutional referendum that it should forever more comprehensively address the issue under consideration. It is not a fair benchmark to set for any legislation or constitutional amendment. The only reasonable requirement is that it should address the current situation as comprehensively as possible and provide for reasonably foreseeable circumstances. We would do well to take a commonsense approach to issues that come before the parliament and make the best judgment we can on the basis of current knowledge. That is what we are doing on this occasion and the great majority of people who have contributed to this debate have done so along lines of commonsense, compassion and justice in the interests of seeking to do the best that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to listen to the veterans of the campaigns of 1983 and 1992. Although I have been here quite a long time, I was not here for either of those debates and that gives me a different perspective.</P>

      <P>Many of the people involved in those debates were pursuing particular agendas. Even if I disagreed with some of them, I was prepared to allow that their beliefs were genuine and that they pursued their agendas with vigour and commitment because of those beliefs. In some respects this debate has been bedevilled, as perhaps all debates are, by people on opposing sides refusing to accept that what is said by people on the other side might be coming from some genuine base, perhaps fear of what change might bring or some other consideration. We need to be mature enough to accept that the considerations that inform contributions to a debate have validity in their own right. Deputies Barnes and Shatter were quite critical this morning, unfairly in some respects, of people who hold views broadly similar to mine. However, the arguments they presented were well thought out, clear and honest. Deputy Shatter frequently draws attention to deficiencies in legislation, even legislation passed by his own Government, as happened on one occasion. On that occasion it turned out that he was right in relation to legislation on marriage &ndash; I dealt with a few cases where difficulties arise because of that legislation. It is well to be open-minded and listen to the views of those who present clear and well thought out arguments, even if in the end one continues to disagree.</P>
      <P>One point which deserves further consideration &ndash; it is not central to this legislation but it is much more than peripheral to it &ndash; is the issue of adoption and the obstacles put in the way of Irish families seeking to adopt children. I can understand why it could not be centrally included on this occasion but it is a hugely important issue. The current situation reflects badly on us. We are far too mistrustful of those who are prepared to welcome children into their families. Part of the resolution of the difficulties of crisis pregnancy resides in the whole area of adoption. I hope we will deal with that much more comprehensively than we have done heretofore.</P>
      <P>Not having been here for the debates in 1983 and 1992 I believe the active protagonists in the debate laboured under the illusion that the debates were equally divisive outside this House and outside the milieu of the debates themselves. They were close to being irrelevant for the vast majority of Irish people. I was a reasonably well-informed 30 year old citizen in 1983 and the divisiveness passed me by entirely, as it did my friends, colleagues and family. We all weighed up the evidence and voted according to our best judgment. That is all we can expect of people on this occasion, and that is what will happen when this is put to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the paradoxes of modern liberalism &ndash; and I seek to be as liberal as I can &ndash; is that it sometimes seeks to marginalise and vilify people of orthodox Catholic background. Despite being in many ways considered a man of the world I <Col N="1162" /> attend mass and the sacraments. I strongly believe in the power of prayer and I find great support and consolation in my religion. At one time I could have said that with impunity, but I realise that nowadays those relatively innocuous statements make me almost a figure of ridicule for some in liberal circles because their liberality extends only to those who agree with them. There is a remarkable intolerance of people who do not share their views. Despite my pitiful status as an arch-conservative, I voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for divorce, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the right to travel, and &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for freedom of information. For all those things I might be at least equally vilified by people on the other side of the debate.</P>
    <P>In making these points I seek to bring into the debate a balance, or perhaps the perspective of the ordinary citizen in the street. All I have done on this occasion is to weigh the evidence. I followed the proceedings of the constitutional committee quite closely and found it enthralling. I listened to the arguments of the medical and the legal experts and found out many things I had not known. Having considered myself reasonably well informed, I was disabused of that notion early in the proceedings. Having had that opportunity to listen in, I believe the Bill before the House adequately addresses the outstanding issues, especially concerns about the life of the mother. I commend the Minister for having brought it to this stage.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bernard Durkan and several others who spoke today and previously, I am not burdened by any medical or legal training so I bring to the debate only the perspective of a lay person, at least on those points. The constitutional review committee did excellent work and produced an excellent report. I confess I did not read all of it. I found the bits that were of some importance and read them. Colleagues who served on the committee put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort on the kind of work that seldom gets noticed in the media and that will not bring them any political advantage when they face the people in the next general election. It is difficult to commit oneself to that kind of work in the House. Many other committees do similar work which is not recognised and which is greatly important in achieving a balanced outcome in terms of legislation. The level of participation by people who have been to the forefront on all sides in this debate was quite extraordinary and quite excellent. I listened to some of them and found them to be much more humane and sensible than my previous perspective of them would have judged. It was an excellent exercise for parliament to engage in and one that is to be commended. I hope the Members of the next Parliament will seek to continue it in relation to many issues where public participation can be facilitated and medical and legal experts, lobbyists and others with a particular interest in a subject can effect democracy in the old Greek sense that allows the people to participate in the work of the parliament. We are always wailing and <Col N="1163" /> bemoaning the fact that people do not vote in elections and are not prepared to sit in cold halls at branch meetings of political parties. We are always saying that people do not participate. Parliament has a role to play in encouraging participation.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the polls on this issue have shown that a substantial majority of people want the matter revisited in a referendum, although not all of them are in favour of the pro-life or pro-choice position. However, they want to have a say and there is good reason for taking account of that. There are good reasons for saying the current situation in relation to abortion and crisis pregnancy needs to be addressed. Many members of the public and the media distrust politicians. They feel they will have a greater say on this matter, regardless of the outcome, if it is put before them in a referendum, and that is true.</P>
    <P>We have tended over the years to make the mistake of not referring issues to the people on a frequent basis. Other countries, particularly Switzerland, have referenda several times a year on issues that Governments here would not dream of putting to the people. We have tended on balance to err on the side of excluding the people from decision-making. There are many issues we might usefully put before the people. Even if only 50% of people vote, as happened in 1983, or 40%, as in the referendum on the Nice treaty, they have the right to vote. Whether they exercise that right, they have made a decision. They have effectively participated by attempting not to participate. The essence of democracy is the right to extend to the people the possibility of participation in decision-making.</P>
    <P>I understand why people do not want this issue referred to the people. They consider it to be as divisive an issue outside the House as it is inside the House. While that is wrong, there is some validity in making that point. This debate is probably more political than it might have been 12 months or two years ago. We all know that everyone here, except those fortunate enough not to put themselves before the electorate again, will be knocking on doors in the near future. One's view of life is tempered by the fact that an election is imminent. No one can blame Opposition Deputies for not being able to resist the temptation to have a cheap or good shot at the Minister or the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. It is important to bear in mind that the political context is different from what it might have been at another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One argument which does not stand up is that the referendum is taking place because of the input of the Independents. It is fair to recognise and acknowledge that they have had an input, but other people have also had an input. If one was to take on board the views of people whose sup<Col N="1164" /> port was needed to keep the Government in power, would it not be better to do that earlier in the life of the Government to keep them on board? It does not matter if the election is in three weeks or in three or six months.</P>
    <P>The many people who support the pro-life view, as I do, must be more active than they have been in the past. The experience of the debate and the referendum on the Nice treaty was that most of the political parties assumed that because they were in favour of it, most of the people would also be in favour of it. Issues are usually more critically analysed by the people than we accept. This issue will also be critically analysed by the people &ndash; I hope it is a big number &ndash; who bother to make their way to the polls. It is important for those who have an interest in this issue to become involved and not to leave it to political people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency, although I do not have time to go through the details of it. The Minister said in his speech that last year alone 6,500 women who had abortions in Britain gave Irish addresses. There has been criticism that the agency should have been set up two, five or 25 years ago. Perhaps that is a valid point. However, it is useful to set it up in the context of this debate, the proposed legislation and the constitutional amendment. I hope it will have a strong impact on the lives of those with crisis pregnancies who must make difficult decisions.</P>

Sin an cheist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the great debate of the early 1980s there were two definite positions in Ireland. The first was that abortion was banned by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and the second was that doctors decided on the medical treatment needed by a pregnant woman even if this treatment led to the death of her baby. Why was there an amendment to the Constitution in 1983 which resulted in introducing legal abortion to this country? What have we gained from the 1983 effort? How much have we learned from it? Putting words into the Constitution to protect life was an attempt to adopt a belt and braces approach in case politicians went wild and introduced legislation to allow abortion. After approximately 20 years we are trying to get back <Col N="1165" /> to the stage where abortion is banned by legislation, as it always was, and doctors will make the necessary decisions. This is going backwards. Abortion is banned by our legislation without the need for any words in the Constitution. It is ironic that the inclusion of these words has left a loophole.</P>
    <P>I listened to almost all the debate today and while I respect everyone's views, I am amazed that some Members on the Government side seem to think this Bill is about having or not having abortion in Ireland. We are discussing a legal document. Abortion is banned in Ireland by the 1861 Act and doctors have the right to make decisions. That has always been the case. Is the Minister shaking his head?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>That will be made clear later, but it is a mistake. The wording of the 1983 Act was suspect from the time Dr. Garret FitzGerald was advised by the then Attorney General that if it was challenged in the Supreme Court it would lead to abortion. I was at the parliamentary party meeting when that advice was given. The challenge came in the 1990s. The warning was correct and, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, the effort to copperfasten an already copperfastened case managed to blow it wide open. As a result there has been legal abortion since the X case. Dr. FitzGerald did his best to prevent this by introducing different wording but he had to suffer outrageous insults from many who were not fit to tie his shoe laces. Those who held strong moral views can be forgiven for their genuine zeal but many politicians of the day hardly deserve the nation's thanks for playing politics with a serious problem.</P>
      <P>The question is whether we will be in the same position regarding the new wording. With greater potential for challenging even some of the words, will the scope for abortion be further widened? The members of the Supreme Court will interpret any phrase or word that is challenged and the intentions of the voters will mean nothing. What happened to the wording in 1983 must be recalled. The debate is about what will happen the constitutional amendment when it is challenged in the Supreme Court and not about who supports or opposes abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promising a referendum before an election may be a help in getting votes while doing so following an election may be a major help in acquiring the support of four Independents but promising a referendum without proposing definitive wording is akin to flying by the seat of one's pants. Inserting words in the Constitution has proved extremely difficult and, even though the <Col N="1166" /> Taoiseach knows this, he still promised a referendum five years ago without having any clue as to the wording.</P>
    <P>As proof of the ongoing difficulty the Minister for Health and Children stated when he opened the debate on behalf of the Government: &ldquo;The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which by itself will amount to a balanced, effective legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy&rdquo;. Almost five years since the Taoiseach said &ldquo;no bother&rdquo; and following continuous debate over the past 20 years, including the months of deliberation by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, there has been a realisation that it is not possible to arrive at the correct wording, yet we have been presented with fresh wording for another referendum.</P>
    <P>I am not making this contribution because I am leaving the scene and not seeking re-election. I experienced awful bitterness in 1983 when it was almost dangerous to move around in public because of the belief that the wording would be interpreted as it was ultimately. I am baffled that the Minister has announced it is not possible to draft the correct wording and it will be patched up. Botched wording was proposed in 1983. Will the same be proposed in 2002?</P>
    <P>During his contribution the Minister also stated: &ldquo;The proposals are aimed at achieving a reasonable compromise&rdquo;. There was no such thing as a compromise in 1983. It was a very black and white situation. One side spoke with the authority of God and the other was influenced by the devil. A compromise has been proposed. Who will be compromised? Will it be the pro-life lobby, the pro-abortion group, the Church or the Legislature? Are politicians playing politics with a serious problem once again?</P>
    <P>If some of the strongly held views of the past are no longer important, will there be apologies for the carry on in 1983, particularly for the way a good man such as Dr. FitzGerald was treated in his effort to do his best? He faced various accusations by people who were not fit to tie his shoe laces. When people realise that approximately 100,000 have travelled to England for abortions since 1983 they should ask themselves what effect had the 1983 referendum. Abortion was banned, doctors continued to make decisions and another referendum was introduced yet 100,000 women travelled abroad for abortions. What, as legislators, are we doing when we introduce various wordings?</P>
    <P>Some people miss the point. The Government and Opposition engage in a performance to insert wording in the Constitution that is supposed to be useful. What is the advantage of using compromised wording, knowing that the Supreme Court may be asked to define words and phrases such as &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;, &ldquo;the conception implantation difficulty&rdquo; or &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo;, which Deputy Gay Mitchell pointed out should be defined as <Col N="1167" />&ldquo;registered medical practitioner&rdquo;? I have received communications from the pro-life lobby, as I am sure the Minister has, questioning the definition of &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo;. They pointed out that an individual who has been struck off the medical register for misconduct could be a medical practitioner. The Minister will probably amend the definition on Committee Stage. However, a problem could result if simple wording such as this gets through in the legislation on an issue such as this where every word is important.</P>
    <P>The wording will only mean something when it is challenged in the Supreme Court, not when it is put before the people. The legislation can be challenged by both sides and the Supreme Court will sit in judgment. If the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; is not included in legislation what will we be faced with in future? If after all the deliberations such a fundamental mistake can be made in the wording, are we leaving ourselves wide open to further interpretation by the Supreme Court that will negative any plans we have?</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which sought an agreement on wording for the referendum, accepted a Fine Gael proposal to set up an agency to help pregnant women by giving them advice on their options. I am glad this agency will be set up. I hope it will help many women to change their minds about having an abortion in England and, above all, I hope the agency will give them help when they need it most. I have never tried to be subjective on this issue. I would not like to be a 16 year old girl who has been raped or pregnant in my innocence having to face my parents and make up my mind about what I will do. Those are awful situations for the female members of the community and I do not want to pontificate objectively because in the long run objective and subjective views are far apart on this issue.</P>
    <P>The provision of £5 million for the crisis pregnancy agency is to be welcomed as it provides scope for its establishment. Since the referendum will have no effect whatsoever on the number of women who travel to England each year, we can only hope that as the agency becomes established and women gain confidence in it, it will lead to a reduction in the number of abortions carried out on Irish women there. However, a referendum is not needed to establish this agency.</P>

Cén fáth gur ghlac sé chomh fada leis seo an Bille a thabhairt go dtí an pointe seo? Tá an Bille geallta le ceithre bliana.

É sin ráite, bhí sé mar aidhm ag an iar Aire Stáit Éamon Ó Cuív agus ag an Aire í féin go mbeadh an Bille seo againn chomh luath agus a bhí siad ábalta. Bhí orthu, áfach, athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chúpla rudaí sul ar mhol siad é don Rialtas. Ag an am céanna níl sé ceadaithe ag an Rialtas ach le cúpla mí agus tá mise ag déanamh gach iarracht go bhfoilseofar é go luath.</P>
      <P>Tá deacrachtaí ag Oifig na nDréachtóirí Parlaiminte mar tá brú milltineach orthu bhun Billí eile a fhoilsiú. É sin ráite bhí cruinniu ar maidin agam leis an Ard Aighne faoi dtaobh de, ag cur brú air chun go mbeadh an Bille os bhur gcomhair go luath.</P>

An mbeidh an Bille chomh láidir agus chomh cuimsitheach leis an mBille Teanga atá acu, mar shampla, i gCeanada nó sa Bhreatain Bheag.

Tá sé mar aidhm agam fosta go mbeidh sé éifeachtach agus sin an fáth go bhfuilimid ag caint ar choimisinéar a cheapadh. Roimhe seo bhí cruinnithe ag an Aire Stáit Éamon Ó Cuív le go leor daoine mar gheall ar an mBille Teanga atá sa Bhreatain Bheag, ar an rud atá ag dul ar aghaidh in Albain agus ar an mBille i gCeanada. Chas oifigigh na Roinne leo fosta. B'fhéidir nach mbeidh an Bille chomh cuimsitheach is atá an Bille i gCeanada ach seo an chéad Bhille Teanga againn anseo. Sa Bhreatain Bheag bhí Bille amháin agus rinne siad athbhreithniú air agus tá Bille úr acu anois. Beidh an Bille anseo cosúil leis an mBille úr a foilsíodh sa Bhreatain Bheag. Ní bheidh gach duine sásta leis mar tá gach taobh ar gach rud. I mo thuairimse beidh sé éifeachtach. Rudaí praiticiúla atá mise ag caint faoi. Beimid i dteangbháil i gcónaí leis na daoine eile a bhfuil Billí Teanga acu agus tá súil agamsa go mbeidh an rud céanna le feiceáil sa tír seo is atá acu sa Bhreatain Bheag maidir le húsáid na teanga mar tá sár-obair déanta acu san.</P>
      <P>Má chuidíonn an Bille Teanga leis an teanga a úsáid níos mó ar fud na tíre beidh mé thar a bheith sásta.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the steps she is taking to ensure full compliance with the habitats directive, having regard to the finding of the European Union Court of Justice on 11 September 2001; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to place the court finding in context. The judgment of the European Court of Justice essentially reflects the legal position prevailing in February 1998 concerning the transmission of candidate special areas of conservation to the European Commission. The court, in delivering its judgment, was precluded from considering progress made by Ireland in the intervening three years with regard to transmission of candidate SACs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1998 I informed the Commission that the delay in formally transmitting a list of candidate SACs was attributable to the wider consultation process which I instigated in Ireland. My position was, and still is, that the only long-term practical way of ensuring the conservation of these important wildlife areas is to acquire the <Col N="1170" /> co-operation of landowners and land users. To this end, I have insisted that additional consultation take place with those whose lands or land rights are affected prior to formal transmission of the sites.</P>
    <P>The European Commission agrees with my view that the success of the Natura 2000 network is dependent on the co-operation of landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. All those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation should be given an opportunity to pursue any objections they may have to proposed designations. To this end, I arranged for appeals to be examined informally by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I also established an SAC Appeals Advisory Board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and comprising equal representation from the landowners and conservation organisations, to assess appeals independently and advise me on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that Ireland has made considerable progress since 1998 regarding the transmission of candidate special areas of conservation to the Commission. On taking office in 1997 I found that no sites had been transmitted to the Commission. Since then I have overseen the formal transmission of 363 sites which cover some 9,907 square kilometres. Having regard to the number and extent of SACs that I have now proposed I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be found sufficient for most habitats and species at the second Atlantic region biogeographical seminar to be held early next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>I have decided, in principle, to propose new or extended SACs for the protection of salmon, but these cannot be formally proposed until surveys to define their boundaries have been completed. This work is now well under way. Although it is difficult to estimate an exact timeframe for completion of the survey work necessary to progress designation of salmon sites, I expect the final batch of candidate SAC sites to be advertised and transmitted to the European Commission in 2002. Ireland has fully implemented the habitats directive in law. The 1997 regulations which transposed the directive into Irish law provided for the sites to be protected from the time they are first proposed. These provisions have been reinforced by section 75 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. In effect, she is telling the House that the ruling of the European Court of Justice was out of date in as much as it was based on the situation in 1998. Will she quantify how matters have moved forward since February 1998? To what extent is Ireland now compliant? What improvements have taken place since the ruling by the European Court of Justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his sup<Col N="1171" /> plementary question. It is important to clarify the position as the court's ruling was based on a technical matter. It was a question of timescale.</P>
      <P>I have explained that when the Government took office not one site had been transmitted to the European Commission. To ensure the fairest possible procedures were put in place, I found it was better to take the time rather than rush the process and to make sure the liaison committees and the appeals system were put in place. Since then, 363 sites have been designated. That fulfils our objectives under the habitats directive with one exception and that is in regard to the protection of salmon. I decided, in principle, to propose newer extended SACs for the protection of salmon and work is now well under way. Although it is difficult to estimate an exact time frame for completion of the survey work necessary to proceed with the designation of salmon sites, I expect that the final batch of candidate SAC sites will be advised and transmitted to the European Commission in 2002.</P>
      <P>Ireland has, as I have said, fully implemented the habitats directive in law. The 1997 regulations which transpose the directive into Irish law provide for the sites to be protected from the time they were first proposed &ndash; it was not just a question of when the designations were made but when they were first proposed. As I said, the only outstanding matter is in regard to the protection of salmon and work is well under way in that respect.</P>

      <P>In the context of the overall <Col N="1172" /> responsibilities of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, for monitoring sites that are identified as being of ecological and conservation importance, particular attention is paid to the presence or otherwise of invasive weeds including the one that is commonly known as Japanese knotweed. I am pleased to say that my Department has not found any particular cause for concern in regard to this particular weed. Nevertheless, the position will continue to be closely monitored and any evidence of the existence of the weed will be dealt with in the course of ongoing management of sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people in my constituency refer to the Japanese knotweed as the coffee plant, as the Minister of State will know. I am sure the Minister must be very familiar with this plant because I read one of Michael Viney's articles in <i>The Irish Times </i>a number of weeks ago in which he said it is along the highways and byways of County Clare. This could be the ecological plague of the 21st century. It would be devastating if it got into our national heritage areas or our national parks.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in the UK it is illegal to plant this weed and that in Wales, there are knotweed inspectors whose job it is to identify and exterminate it? Is the Minister aware that Philadelphia spends £1 million per year eradicating it from the public parks there? If it was to get into some of our heritage areas, it would be devastating. I ask the Minister that everything possible is done to keep it out of these areas.</P>
      <P>It is growing very close to the national park in Glenveagh. It travels with soil. People dig up soil, throw it here and there and it hitchhikes its way along the roads and even along river banks. One centimetre of it is enough to cover acres if it is given time. It is taken seriously in Wales, England and America and I hope it will be taken just as seriously here because, as I said, it could be an ecological disaster &ndash; a plague &ndash; if it is allowed to spread. We should nip it in the bud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's genuine concern. When any species is introduced, it can cause havoc from time to time in different type of habitats. I am told by those who have much more knowledge on botanical issues than I that it is not at this stage of particular concern in Ireland. I take the point that where it colonises, it can do tremendous damage. The Deputy said that it can take hold along roadsides, in waste places and other areas such as refuse dumps, river banks and where garden rubbish is dumped. Where plants are found to be a terrible nuisance &ndash; for example, the rhododendrons in Kerry &ndash; we have very specific programmes in the national parks to deal with them. I am not saying we should await the arrival of a problem but this situation is monitored and it is not seen as a particular threat at this time.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the impending financial crisis being faced by RTE; the plans she has to save the national broadcasting service from insolvency.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for RTE in the first instance to arrange its financial affairs. Section 24 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provides that:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority so to conduct its affairs as to secure that its revenue becomes at the earliest possible date, and thereafter continues, at least sufficient&ndash;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a) to meet all sums properly chargeable to current account, and</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b) to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government decided in July of this year, based on my recommendation, to grant an interim licence fee increase to RTE. As I have previously explained to this House, the intention behind this decision was to enable RTE to continue to provide existing levels of service while maintaining reasonable cash reserves.</P>
      <P>I am aware that RTE has recently indicated that its advertising revenues for the current year have fallen below projections and that it is facing financial difficulties as a result. RTE has also placed on the public record a range of measures that its executive board has decided to take to reduce its cost base. While it is Government policy that public service broadcasting must be supported and strengthened, I reject the inference that can be drawn from the question that the television licence fee should be regarded as a cushion against the real world market realities in which RTE operates.</P>
      <P>When the Government approved the interim television licence fee increase last July, it agreed that it would consider a further increase when RTE got its act together in terms of the particular issues outlined in the Government proposal. RTE is aware of that decision and the work that needs to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises &ndash; indeed, she has admitted it in her reply &ndash; that there has been a drastic deterioration in the finances of RTE since the Government decision last July to grant a £14.50 increase of a licence fee application for £50. There is almost a weekly reappraisal of the downward income levels. Does the Minister realise advertising revenue will be down by £10 million this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with the rationalisation programme, where 330 personnel in RTE will be made redundant, it is now addressing a further number of compulsory redundancies &ndash; probably 150 &ndash; which would mean 480 redundancies altogether <Col N="1174" />&ndash; almost one-quarter of the workforce of RTE. Does the Minister agree that the situation in RTE, if allowed to continue, will almost reach the same crisis level in which Aer Lingus is at present? She promised to carry out a review of the licence fee application and the situation in RTE in 2003 but there may be no RTE in 2003 unless matters are checked. Are the Minister and the Government prepared to bring forward that review to the end of this year at the latest because RTE cannot tolerate the drain on its finances as it will be out of cash next year if matters are allowed to continue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy not to put words into my mouth. It is acknowledged that costs at RTE are too high. This is acknowledged within RTE which has planned for a transformation agreement. The proposals that the executive board will put to the authority have been detailed in the media. The authority has a specific role in law and there will be discussions between the authority and the trade unions. RTE must arrange its financial affairs and that is what the authority is there to do.</P>
      <P>With regard to the review, the Government decision was based on the fact that there were a number of issues that had to be looked at immediately. This has accurately been referred to as an interim licence fee increase. There were a number of other issues that needed to be addressed before that situation could be reviewed. I have said time and again that if those issues referred to in the Government decision are addressed before 2003, the Government will be delighted to hear from RTE. However, all of us know that serious issues must be addressed for the conditions set down by the Government to be satisfied, although RTE's financial difficulties in no way diminish what must be achieved. The licence fee should never be regarded as a cushion against the real world market realities in which RTE operates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm the status of the development plans that RTE had relating to its education station and digitalisation programme? In the light of the serious financial losses at RTE, can we expect our national broadcasting service to finance these ambitious development plans? The plans are necessary if RTE is to compete in the 21st century in the areas of digitalisation, education and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the work done by PricewaterhouseCoopers. In its report it was clear that much work needed to be done by RTE before any proposals could be brought forward with regard to digitalisation, for example. When we speak of possible licence fee increases we are speaking about public money, not an anonymous pot of money that people can dip into from time to time. If the Deputy is interested in seeing a further licence fee increase, perhaps he might advise the House on the <Col N="1175" /> increased amount that the believes people should pay.</P>

      <P>My Department received 180 applications for funding under the arts and culture enhancement support scheme known as ACCESS. I established an independent committee to evaluate all eligible applications, and this committee recommended 53 projects, equivalent to £45 million in grant aid, as worthy of support. However, the funding available for the ACCESS scheme comes to a total of £36 million, and I could therefore approve only 44 of the recommended projects, which accounted for all of the available £36 million. A table listing the grant aid offered in respect of each project will be furnished to the Deputy. Should any of the successful projects not proceed, I will consider the position regarding reallocation of funds to the remaining projects recommended by the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her answer. This was a very imaginative and excellent scheme, of which the proof is the high number of applications received from all areas of the country, amounting to 180 in total. Some 44 projects were grant-aided. Unfortunately, many who went to the trouble of applying were disappointed on this occasion. Will the Minister indicate if there will be another tranche of access funding or is this is a once-off measure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his generous remarks. Such a fund was necessary as there was no such fund in the Department for capital spending after the CDIS ran out in 1999. That was a successful scheme and it was important to initiate another that would continue to build up the infrastructure of arts venues around the country. The Deputy is right to say that there were 180 applications. If all of those had been grant-aided, it would have required £224 million for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 44 projects were recommended and all the money has been allocated. However, if there should be a situation &ndash; I do not know of this &ndash; where one or more of those projects should fall by the wayside and not be completed, and where money is therefore available for reallocation, I will look at those projects that were unsuccessful <Col N="1176" /> in coming through the independent process that I put in motion.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Does she agree that Clare, the native county of my colleague, Deputy John Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>, has been extremely fortunate in the disbursement of these funds? His native county had more projects sanctioned than any other and almost 10% of the entire allocation. I do not know if Deputy Browne had anything to do with the success of the county. Is it purely coincidental that Clare is the adopted county of the Minister in a political sense? Perhaps Clare had better applications than any other county, and these merited so many projects being grant-aided.</P>

      <P>We were able to facilitate some 23 counties in this particular round which assisted 44 projects. We tried to look at the geographical as well as the community element. There was a tough procedure and criteria that had to be fulfilled for these projects. Deputy Browne's native county is Clare and he will have been pleased to note that six projects were chosen that county. However, 14 applications were made from that county that did not get through the independent process. Any project that did not get through that process could not be and was not considered by me.</P>

      <Quest>if she will restrict the licensing of hunting weapons to members of bona fide hunting organisations, as is required in Scandinavia, to ensure effective conservation of protected species and proper records of species hunted.</Quest>

      <P>The licensing of weapons <i>per se</i> is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Firearms Acts. I have responsibility for the issue of hunting licences under the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended. There is no evidence to indicate that regulated hunting in Ireland adversely impacts on the conservation status of protected species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restriction of the issue of hunting licences only to those who are members of bone fide hunting organisations would require additional legislation and may not be tenable from a legal viewpoint. However, I am satisfied that the current suite of legislative measures available to me under the Wildlife Acts, 1976 and 2000, enable me to ensure the conservation of protected species. For example, orders made by me under the Wildlife Acts set out the range of protected species which may be hunted, the periods for which they can be hunted and the means that can be <Col N="1177" /> used to hunt them. These orders are reviewed annually following consultation with interested parties and the terms of the orders can be and are adjusted if necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000 enables me to make regulations regarding evidence of competency from individuals seeking licences to hunt protected wild birds or mammals. Section 29(10) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, enables me to request holders of licences to furnish details of numbers of wild birds and animals shot. While I request deer hunters to include details of deer shot in the previous season in their application for a licence, I do not consider it necessary to request hunters of protected birds to submit such details at present. I am satisfied that the hunting control measures currently in place are sufficient to ensure the conservation of protected species.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions she has had with the RTE Authority regarding the introduction of digital terrestrial television; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 43 on 29 May 2001.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the revised arrangements agreed by Government last year for the introduction of digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; in Ireland as provided for in the Broadcasting Act, 2001, is ongoing. These revised arrangements provide that the DTT platform will be established by two separate but inter-linked transactions: (a) the separation out and sale by RTE of the existing RTE transmission network as a going concern and subject to RTE being able to retain a shareholding of up to 28% in the new entity; and, (b) the selection of the DTT multiplex licensee, the DTT retail business, to be licensed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental project management group chaired by my Department and including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Public Enterprise is managing the process to select the DTT multiplex licensee. In June of this year bids were invited from parties interested in being selected as the DTT multiplex licensee. While a total of four parties expressed interest in applying, only one party submitted a proposal and that proposal was received by the deadline of 3 August. The proposal was submitted by a consortium named &ldquo;It's TV&rdquo; and discussions are taking place between the consultants engaged by me to oversee the process and the sole bidder to ensure full compliance with the conditions laid down for selection of the DTT multiplex licensee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the process that will lead to the sale of a <Col N="1178" /> majority stake in the RTE transmission network, I understand from RTE that it received a number of bids from interested parties in late October. RTE has invited a number of bidders to take part in the next phase of the process which will include access to a data room, a presentation by management and draft documentation on which to comment. Thereafter applicants will be asked to submit revised bids. Following the receipt of the revised bids a further shortlist will be determined. RTE expects the process to conclude in December.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in ongoing regular contact with RTE in relation to the implementation of the Government's objectives for the establishment of the DTT platform.</P>
    <P>The former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Frank Murray, is acting as process auditor to both the multiplex licensee selection process and the RTE transmission network sale process. The role of the process auditor is to verify that both processes have been carried out in accordance with normal criteria of openness, fairness and impartiality.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. Will the Minister give the House an assurance that reports that RTE is abandoning plans to go ahead with the digital terrestrial project are untrue and that the process is moving ahead within the station? Are the various proposals considered to be serious in nature? Does the Minister think that a December date for concluding the discussions is realistic? When does she expect us to have digital terrestrial transmissions within the State? </P>

      <P>If I may, a Cheann Comhairle, I will answer the last supplementary question first. Based on the current timetable the DTT services can be expected to be launched in the second half of next year. With regard to the other question about RTE, I have not been advised that RTE is taking a different view than the one that reflects Government policy on implementing DTT. RTE is going ahead with the sale of the transmission network, subject to its being able to retain a shareholding of up to 28%. RTE has said it expects its own process to conclude in December. Those are the timescales that have been indicated to me through the project management group and the consultant. At this stage, I believe those timescales will be upheld.</P>

Unfortunately, this project did not get through the independent process and, as such, it could not be considered by me. I understand that in many ways this is an exceptional project. The Deputy is correct in saying that it is an integrated, cross-Border project which is supported on a cross-party basis. He also referred to funds that might be available to the project because of its proximity to the Border. For all these reasons, I am doing my utmost to investigate the feasibility of securing additional funding so as to be able to deal with this specific case which I believe is one of merit.</P>

      <P>The National Museum of Ireland has a substantial number of artefacts of local interest on loan in a number of locations throughout the country. For example, artefacts are on loan for exhibition purposes at the county and city museums in Limerick, Cork, Tralee, Clonmel, Monaghan, Cavan, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Waterford and Ennis.</P>
      <P>A number of other local authorities are in the process of establishing county museums and I am actively pursuing a policy of encouraging the development of a county museum service in every county. This policy is aimed at facilitating the loan of greater numbers of artefacts from the national collections to an ever-increasing number of venues around the country.</P>
      <P>I have also designated nine regional museums for the purposes of acquiring and displaying archaeological objects on behalf of the State, which are primarily of local interest. This designation process has the effect of dividing certain legal powers under the National Monuments Acts and the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, between the National Museum of Ireland and local authority museums and their curators. The museums designated are: Cavan County Museum; Cork Public Museum; Kerry County Museum; Donegal County Museum; Limerick Museum; Louth County Museum; Monaghan County Museum; Tipperary South Riding County Museum; and Waterford Treasures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the existing premises of the national theatre are inadequate for the future needs of the theatre and the board of the national theatre society has made a number of submissions to me regarding options for the redevelopment of the theatre with Exchequer support.</P>
      <P>My Department asked the Office of Public Works to review the options put forward by the national theatre society and to furnish professional advice on the feasibility and cost of all options for addressing the enhanced accommodation needs of the theatre. The report has been received from the Office of Public Works and is currently being considered by me. When this consideration is completed, I will bring proposals to Government and will enter into further discussions with the board of the national theatre society.</P>
      <P>It is my stated preference that the national theatre should, if at all possible remain on Abbey Street provided that space and design constraints do not mitigate against this. One of the options explored by the Office of Public Works in its report is the possibility of acquiring additional site space adjacent to the existing site for the development of a new landmark theatre at this location.</P>

This is under consideration and when I have brought the matter to Government it will become a matter for discussion here and publicly. I am aware that the centenary is in 2004. However, this is a major decision. We know that conditions in the Abbey are anything but what should be expected in a national theatre and that needs to be addressed. It is important to take the time to address those needs in an adequate and comprehensive way so that we will have reason to celebrate in 2004. I hope, at that stage, we will have decided on the resolution and that resolution will be well under way if not completed.</P>

      <P>I have received correspondence from Coastwatch Europe on this matter. I am also aware of recent media comment on the importance of wetlands.</P>
      <P>I am committed to fostering an enhanced awareness and appreciation of all important habitats, including wetlands. The Deputy will be aware in that regard that the EU Habitats Directive lists habitat categories, some 60 of which exist in this country. Wetlands, which include marsh, fen, peatland, turloughs, rivers and estuaries, constitute one sub-set of these habitats.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has placed emphasis on increasing awareness generally on the part of land owners and local communities of the importance of habitats, including wetlands, situated in their locality. This process can best be advanced by the establishment of a liaison committee representative of the land owners involved. These committees are a useful point of contact for Dúchas and are important in facilitating two way communication. Eighty-eight such liaison committees for individual sites have been formed to date.</P>
      <P>Dúchas is preparing five year conservation management plans for all priority habitat SACs which will set out the conservation and management objectives necessary to maintain the favourable conservation status of these sites. I have insisted that Dúchas engage in a thorough public consultation process with landowners and the aforementioned liaison committees before these plans are finalised.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these measures are contributing towards heightening awareness of the importance of conserving all habitats including wetland areas. The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the national bio-diversity plan, which will be published in the near future, will deal specifically with wetland conservation issues.</P>

Does the Minister share the view expressed by Ms Karen Dubsky that the planning exemption for land reclamation should be abolished? There <Col N="1184" /> is still a danger to many of our wetlands which are very important habitats. I realise that planning matters are not within the Minister's remit but in view of her responsibility for the protection of flora and fauna, does she see an ongoing and substantial danger arising from this exemption?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>This is a separate matter as planning is not the responsibility of my Department. However, a liaison committee has been established between the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Education and Science to review the role of the education system in environmental awareness. We are doing similar work in my own Department through the education and visitor service of the heritage service. That service is responsible for interpretation and education with regard to the national heritage. That kind of interdepartmental approach is the best way of making people aware of the importance of our wetlands.</P>
      <P>Landowners and land users play a very important part in this and that is why the point of contact could be the liaison committees, of which there are already 88 in existence. These can act as very useful points of contact with Dúchas and in that way maintain an ongoing connection to ensure our wetlands are preserved.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals she has to join the international network on cultural policy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that international network on cultural policy &ndash; INCP &ndash; is an informal forum which has a current membership of 45 <Col N="1186" /> countries. There is a core membership of nine countries known as the ministerial contact group which sets the agenda and steers the work of the network.</P>
      <P>The idea of the INCP, which was established in 1998, was to create an informal international forum through which national Ministers for Culture could explore and discuss common policy issues. The stated aim of the INCP is to strengthen cultural policies to enable Governments, together with civil society, to create an environment that values diversity, creativity, accessibility and freedom.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention at this stage to pursue an application for membership of the network. The value of membership is limited in that the network is not a legal or a decision making body. Attendance at the annual meetings is limited to 25 places. The nine members of the ministerial contact group are invited to attend while the host country, which I understand is South Africa for 2002, decides on which other members should be invited to attend. The ministerial contact group also meets once a year. Relevant papers relating to these meeting are published on the INCP website.</P>
      <P>While I am not proposing that Ireland join the INCP at this time I intend to keep the matter under review.    </P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply but I am somewhat disappointed by it. The Minister says she has no intention of joining the INCP at this time but will keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>Bille na Gaeilge is to be published in the new year while a multicultural Ireland is developing as more cultures are represented in Ireland than at any time in our history. The purpose of the INCP is to provide a forum for ministers and political leaders to meet informally and discuss cultural issues and, in an informal milieu, to develop policies in the area of cultural diversity. Is it proper that we are not represented by a Minister or Minister of State at appropriate meetings of a body of this nature?</P>

      <P>This is not an appropriate time to pursue membership of the network. As I have said, it is not a legal or decision-making body. Its ethos is very positive in the sense that it promotes diversity, creativity, accessibility and freedom, to all of which we subscribe. However, the relevant papers relating to the annual meetings of the ministerial contact group are published on the INCP website so there is no question of not being able to access this kind of information. While the matter will be kept under review, at present there is no need to apply for membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The high level group has recently completed its report on the National Concert Hall and related matters. The group has presented its report to me and to the Minister for Education and Science and it is now receiving consideration at ministerial level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the report of the high level group being examined by several Ministers, does the Minister envisage this project and the new landmark national theatre developing in tandem or does she regard them as two separate and distinct developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While they are both very respected national institutions, they are separate and distinct developments in the sense that they cater to different audiences. It can be very useful to look at proposals in the light of changing circumstances such as changes to audiences or the numbers of people who want to access both institutions.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the National Concert Hall has been experiencing difficulties with accommodation, which is not suitable. The backstage accommodation is inadequate to say the least and the auditorium is not large enough. On-stage performance space, in particular, is very cramped especially if it has to accommodate large performing groups such as a full strength symphony orchestra. A second auditorium is also very much needed.</P>
      <P>This is the reason I wanted to ensure a high level group reported back to me. The Deputy will be interested in the composition of the group. It is small but prestigious, consisting of the Secretary General of my Department, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science and the Chairman of the Office of Public Works. Its composition demonstrates interest and expertise. Once I have had an opportunity to examine its recommendations and views, decisions will be made.</P>
      <P>The group consulted a wide range of people. Obviously, it met the board and director of the National Concert Hall. It also met the Dublin city manager and planning officials, the president of UCD and his advisers and the chairman and chief executive of the Higher Education Authority. We are trying to find out how best to address the ongoing issues for the National Concert Hall. It is opportune to congratulate those involved in the National Concert Hall for the work they have done in the 20 years since it moved to Earlsfort Terrace in 1981.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the State-owned site at Infirmary Road-Conyngham Road is still very much in the picture as a potential site for the relocated National Concert Hall? <Col N="1188" /> When does she expect decisions on the future of the National Concert Hall to be taken and implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I would like the matter to proceed as quickly as possible and the decisions will be forthcoming as soon as possible. The report is being considered not only by me but also by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, given that his Department is particularly interested in the position of UCD in Earlsfort Terrace. I confirm that the site at Infirmary Road-Conyngham Road is one of a number of options considered by the high level group.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the additional staff which will be provided to deal with the additional workload arising from the commencement of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[27151/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As is the case in many other areas, while additional resources could be put to good use in the area of nature conservation, my general approach to staffing this sector has been to build up resources over time to address the growing volume of work involved in safeguarding our wildlife and important habitats, including responsibilities arising in connection with enforcement of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>This gradualist approach has ensured that the sector is now better and more effectively resourced than ever before. To provide just one illustration, since taking office I have authorised the employment of an extra 30 conservation rangers which has significantly increased the strength of the corps to 90 rangers. The number of administrative and scientific staff supporting the rangers has been increased by 24 since I took office. This figure includes three regionally based ecologists who will be on site to deal with issues as they arise. I have also recently obtained approval to recruit six additional ecologists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, I take the view that the existing staff resources should suffice for the time being to deal with the special areas of conservation &ndash; SAC &ndash; designations and the Department's general functions in relation to wildlife and the management and supervision of other protected <Col N="1189" /> areas, including national parks, nature reserves and refuges for fauna.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the designation of NHAs will proceed on a phased basis in conjunction with SAC designations where possible and that staff dealing with SACs in their early phases of designation may be transferred, as their services become available, to deal with the ongoing process of NHA designation. This approach will ensure that the provisions of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, are implemented in an efficient as well as a timely manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, and its implementation. The important issues are enforcement and proper policing. Has an in-depth study been carried out in the Department on the manpower needed to police and enforce the provisions of the Act, including those on SACs and national heritage areas? My great fear is that, while the legislation is very welcome and well structured, it is worthless if we cannot police and enforce its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there have been staffing deficiencies they have been identified and I have addressed them. I caution against the idea that conservation is solely reliant on resources available to Dúchas, the heritage service. There are other State agencies with an important role to play in the process of preserving our environment. Enforcement is just one factor in the equation. In our earlier discussion of wetlands we referred to the importance of education. There has been a change in culture and the need for responsible and sustainable development has been realised and must be pursued.</P>
      <P>Following an organisational review of Dúchas by consultants an extensive restructuring package of proposals, including significant extra staffing was developed by management with considerable staff input. Unfortunately, one of the principal unions representing staff in Dúchas did not agree with the package. The consultants are continuing with the review in order to overcome any difficulties that have been identified. It is too early to anticipate the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that the enforcement and policing function for the environment does not rest with her Department alone or with Dúchas alone. Would she agree that there is a very strong case for maximising the effect of resources, that there should be a strong interdepartmental group to co-ordinate activities and to stretch the effectiveness of the various enforcement agencies, in the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the general principle of what Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister referred to as &ldquo; joined-up government&rdquo;. We should not have tunnel vision in this matter. I am sure the Deputy agrees there are <Col N="1190" /> many concerns and many responsibilities in all Departments. It is most important to make the connections and to set up any interdepartmental body that is necessary in order to pursue that agenda. Such interdepartmental groups and bodies exist for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are estimated to be as many as 30,000 ring forts or enclosures in the country. My Department's records show that since 1998, 127 excavations have taken place on or close to ring forts. These excavations would predominately relate to planning and development on land which would not be in the care of the State and therefore public access to view these sites would not be feasible. I remind the Deputy that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department provides visitors' services at more than 70 sites many of which deal with archaeological and historical themes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I am sure she would agree that these ring fort sites are of great archaeological interest and value. We must be careful and watchful because some of these sites could be obliterated as a result of development works. Can the Minister ensure that the programme of excavation is expedited and that none of these forts are obliterated? They may contain valuable information about our heritage.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if any of these sites are still under restriction because of the foot and mouth disease precautions which were imposed earlier in the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much development taking place throughout the country and we must ensure that there is proper conservation and protection of our heritage. We have often spoken in this House about the need for balance between the two. It is to ensure that balance that I have agreed a code of practice with the NRA. That code of practice has been very successful and very practical. I congratulate the NRA for its work. A number of archaeologists have been employed by the NRA to do the kind of work the Deputy agrees should be undertaken. I will investigate whether restrictions due to foot and mouth disease are still in place. This question deals with the excavations taking place on privately owned land and obviously in that case such access would not be feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the suppression of a teaching post in the Dublin 7 Educate Together national school, based at Henrietta Street, Dublin 7. This non-denominational national school had a staff of four teachers. The loss of the third assistant teacher post is a disaster for this rapidly developing school.</P>
      <P>The immediate effect has been to reduce four classes, two of 26 children each, one of 20 and one of 16, into three classes, two of 30 children and 1 of 28 children. This dramatic change has already had a significant impact on the progress being made by very committed teachers in a school based in temporary premises and which has 17 non-national pupils with special requirements and including a severely autistic child. Because of these circumstances alone, it seems quite unreasonable to suppress a teaching post at disgracefully short notice. This was done by letter which arrived three days before the teacher was removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find incredible is that this decision appears to have been taken based on an inaccurate assessment of the numbers in the school. The numbers required to maintain the third assistant <Col N="1192" /> teaching post in a developing school for the period of 30 September 2000 to 30 September 2001, is 87 children. The school had 87 children on the roll in September of this year as was required. However, two weeks before 30 September the number dropped by one to 86 children. That was the enrolment specifically on 30 September. One week later on 8 October the numbers in the school increased to 88 children, one child in excess of the numbers required. Despite this fact, the suppression of the post was not lifted.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree this is bureaucracy gone mad? How could any Minister stand over the removal of a teacher on the basis of a temporary reduction of one child over a two week period? Over the years I have brought the difficulties experienced by many schools to the notice of this House but I have not heard of a school being treated so shabbily or so unreasonably. I ask the Minister to urgently review the case that I have made for the Dublin 7 Educate Together school and to again sanction the third assistant post to the school.</P>
    <P>I have watched this school develop from being the aspiration of a group of committed parents in Dublin 7; I have seen them canvass support for that aspiration; I watched them fund raise to help bring their dream to reality; I saw them scour the length and breadth of Dublin 7 to locate a suitable temporary premises which they found in Henrietta Street. They have very praiseworthy plans for a permanent site in the Grangegorman lands currently held by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. All of their efforts have been voluntary based on a belief in an educational ideal for their children and the children of like-minded parents. This is no way to treat these parents, their children, their teachers and supporters.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the Minister may have a script prepared that may not take account of the facts that I have put before the House. As the Minister for Education and Science is not present today to hear my case, I ask the Minister to bring it urgently to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science and to convey to him my belief that an injustice has been done to this school and that the matter be reviewed urgently on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the inability of the Minister for Education and Science to have been present to hear the Deputy's cogent and well argued case and obvious concern for the position at the Educate Together national school at Henrietta Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has asked me to state that the staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by the Department of Education and Science if the school meets the defined criteria.</P>
    <P>The school concerned applied for two additional teaching posts on developing grounds for the school years 2001-02 based on a projected enrolment on 30 September 2001 of greater than 86 pupils.</P>
    <P>However, the two additional teaching posts were granted on a provisional basis only and since then one post has been sanctioned on a permanent basis. Unfortunately, as the enrolment required for the second post was not achieved on 30 September, the second post cannot be retained at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for Education and Science has asked me to state that he will arrange for an inspector from his Department to visit the school at an early date to assess the situation. I will bring to the attention of the Minister the case made by the Deputy, particularly his report that there was an inaccurate assessment of the number of children at the school at that time and to ensure that is taken into account in the review of the case when the inspector calls to the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is present to reply to this serious issue.</P>
      <P>Henshaws is a factory with a long history of providing good service to farmers. It is extremely unfortunate it has experienced financial difficulty. I understand a liquidator or receiver has been appointed recently. There are a number of farmers with cheques that are of no value as a result.</P>
      <P>These farmers did not choose to send their animals to Henshaws. Some animals are bought by the Department under the valuation scheme. Others are bought by the Department from the farmer as a result of a tender system into which the Department enters each week. It advises the factories the number of animals available and receives tenders accordingly. The Department decides which tender to take and organises for the animals to be removed to the meat factory.</P>
      <P>The animals bought under the valuation scheme are paid for directly by the Department. Those bought under the tender system are paid for partly by the Department under a grant structure and partly by the factory. The farmers concerned at no time make contact with the factory. In many cases farmers have requested that they be allowed send their animals to a factory of their choosing, but the Department has refused such requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 191 farmers nationally, who are in this position, are owed approximately £201,000. In County Monaghan, which I and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represent, approximately 54 herds are affected. Between 5 September and 4 October <Col N="1194" /> 155 animals were removed, which is an average of fewer than three animals per herd. Twenty one of those 155 animals were bought under the valuation scheme, the rest were bought under the grant system.</P>
    <P>The Department refused to buy the other animals under the valuation scheme because the regulations state that unless a farmer has more than six animals, the Department has to take them under the grant structure. Therefore, these farmers had no choice.</P>
    <P>How can it be that one farmer, whose animals were bought under the valuation scheme, might be paid in full while another farmer living on the same road, whose animals were bought under grant structure, might not be paid? The Department bought these animals and those farmers must be paid not just for the sake of the money but for the sake of goodwill if this structure is to continue.</P>
    <P>The valuation scheme was introduced under the PPF last year. Those farmers who can avail of it have major questions about it. A maximum payment applies for pure breed animals. The payment is £2,000 for females and £2,500 for males. A farmer told me recently that he had bought a female animal for £3,500 last year and although the animal is in calf now and much more valuable, £2,500 is the maximum he can be allowed for that animal.</P>
    <P>The main problem is there are not enough valuers to make this scheme work properly. My county has one of the highest records of TB, but there is no valuer in County Monaghan. A valuer should be based in a county such as Monaghan in order that this issue can be speeded up and reactors removed from farms as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Why were farmer applications for the valuation post not accepted? Was the Department worried that those people may know too much and be too sympathetic towards farmers? Why are valuers not allowed use their discretion or common sense? They must fill in 103 boxes on the required form. That does not allow for common sense to prevail. Many farmers are being told by valuers that they would like to be allowed use common sense, but the regulations tie them.</P>
    <P>This is a new scheme, but if we are to have the goodwill of those who suffer enough as a result of disease among their animals, we must review this scheme to ensure it is workable and farmers get reasonable compensation, no more and no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to reply. Under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, provision is made for compensation to be paid to farmers in respect of reactor animals removed for slaughter at designated meat factories. Under this system meat factories tender on a weekly basis for reactors and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development selects the meat factory or factories that are most <Col N="1195" /> financially beneficial in the prices they offer for different types of animals.</P>
      <P>Under the existing compensation scheme the payments to farmers are made up of two elements, one, the salvage value of the reactor carcase, which is paid directly to the farmer by the meat factory and, two, a reactor grant, which is paid to the farmer by the Department. However, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed between the Government and the social partners to introduce a new compensation scheme in the form of an on-farm valuation system. Under the new scheme the farmer receives the animal's market valuation less the salvage price paid directly to him by the meat factory. The valuation scheme has been phased in from February last following protracted negotiations between the Department and the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for compensation the farmer must avail of the reactor collection services, which is provided free by my Department, and comply with various other conditions. This collection service provides greater security in the movement of reactors between farm and meat factory and ensures higher standards of vehicle hygiene.</P>
      <P>It is important that I point out that at all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and, therefore, the contract for the salvage value is solely a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. Farmers are paid the salvage value of the animal directly by the factory. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate valuation or reactor grant compensation outside the salvage value.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as happened in the case of Henshaws, the recovery of moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between the farmers and the company's liquidators. While my Department will continue to meet its financial commitments by way of valuation or reactor grant compensation, the recovery of payments due in respect of unpaid salvage for reactors by Henshaws is a matter to be resolved between the farmers involved and that company's liquidators.</P>
      <P>Compensation under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes is a matter of ongoing review in the animal health forum and any modifications necessary from time to time are agreed at that forum. I will have reasonable requests for adjustment of the compensation schemes considered by the forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Celtic tiger and the boom have been squandered as far as children in need of residential and specialist care are concerned, and nowhere is this more poignantly illustrated than in the case of Kim O'Donovan. Will the Minister outline the Government response to the Kim O'Donovan report by Justice Peter Kelly and the action the Government is taking as a result of that report?</P>
      <P>On this occasion I reiterate my sympathy to Kim's family and friends. Everyone will agree that the death of Kim O'Donovan was a tragic and needless loss of a young life. It was also a shameful indictment of the State's handling of the child care services. Children in State care in Ireland are not guaranteed the basic rights which are their due under the Constitution. This became evident as the facts of the Kim O'Donovan case were exposed.</P>
      <P>Kim O'Donovan needed special care which ought to have been guaranteed by the State. She needed professionally trained staff, continuity of care, special support from the psychological services and suitable secure housing. It is clear the State failed in every respect. Her right to communicate with a High Court Judge was also denied. This failure may be attributed to the administration of Newtown House but the blame must rest with the health board and, ultimately, the State, which failed to equip this establishment with the necessary resources to cope with the needs of young women like Kim.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Peter Kelly in the High Court set out a number of undertakings which must be complied with by three health boards in the eastern region. He acknowledged the health board had seriously failed Kim by failing to tell the Garda of a letter written by her 13 days prior to her death stating that she was staying in bed and breakfast accommodation. He noted that this was a serious violation of her rights, stating that &ldquo;any incarcerated person must have access to the High Court by correspondence without hindrance&rdquo;. Highlighting the root problem, he added that this violation of fundamental rights was not deliberate but arose &ldquo;through a mixture of ignorance and poor training&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the problem is with the funding and running of many of these institutions. Justice Kelly set out two imperative undertakings. The first is that detention orders must not be varied without prior court leave, that is, children who have been living in a secure environment must not be allowed to leave one day at will without the judgment of a court, which will take into account the circumstances of the child and the progress which has been made by him or her and <Col N="1197" /> will rely heavily, I assume, on reports and expert advice from those who know the child best in the institutional setting.</P>
    <P>Second, Justice Kelly instructed that no impediments should be placed on any communications from children to the court. The health boards have agreed to fulfil the undertakings which relate to children in these circumstances. Justice Kelly's requirements are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>What is the Government response to this report? It must be addressed at Government level. It is utterly inadequate that the critical issue of provision and administration of secure children's facilities should be left to the courts. Clearly, it cannot be the case. The Judiciary cannot take proactive action in this area in terms of legislation. The courts are limited to dealing with these crucial issues as they arise. There still is a lack of planning and of legislation in this area. What action does the Minister intend to take so we do not see such a tragic situation arising again?</P>
    <P>The independent children's body, Barnardos, has called for a children's rights officer in every health board. This is an interesting idea and should be considered. It is astounding that this has not been developed, with a full comprehensive plan for a radical overhaul of the child care residential system. We need a new strategy in this area to be implemented over a number of years which will seriously improve the current archaic system.</P>
    <P>A report was published recently by one of our voluntary organisations on the experience of young children who leave care. It is an indictment of our system. They are more vulnerable to drug addiction, homelessness, prostitution and other problems. We must get a handle on our system of residential care. Facilities, training and expertise are badly needed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister launch a serious long-term plan to deal with the problems in the child care system? Does he plan to publish the report of the inquiry which the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, said some months ago she would initiate into the Kim O'Donovan case? Will the results of that inquiry be published and when will they be published? Will the Minister take action to reduce staff turnover, which was a huge problem in this high support unit, to maintain continuity of care? If there was continuity of care in these establishments, it would reduce the possibility of cases like that of Kim O'Donovan recurring. There are a number of other inquiries into allegations of physical abuse. At what stage are these investigations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is unable to be here as she is attending a meeting of Ministers for children in Brussels. This debate affords me the opportunity to outline the <Col N="1198" /> action the Government has taken following the tragic death of the late Kim O'Donovan. I assure the House of the Government's commitment to the child welfare and protection services.</P>
      <P>A number of developments have occurred since this Government took office. An additional £92.5 million revenue has been invested since 1997 in the continued development of child welfare and protection services. Of this, £39 million has been invested in the ERHA area. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1997 to a current total of 88, which includes the 24 place special care unit at Ballydowd which is being opened on a phased basis. Plans are under way to develop an additional 46 places. These places are due to become available by mid-2002.</P>
      <P>The Government established the social services inspectorate in 1999 to provide an independent inspectorate for the social services. In its first three years it is concentrating on child care and, in particular, residential child care services. To date, 39 inspections have been carried out throughout the country on residential children's centres operated by the health boards. The Department of Health and Children, in co-operation with the health boards and the SSI, has developed national standards for children's residential centres as well as standards for special care units. The availability of these standards, together with the SSI inspections, will help to ensure the implementation of high standards in residential care.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group on foster care was published in June this year. It addresses the range of problems currently being experienced by those involved in foster care and makes recommendations to further the development of services for foster children and their carers. The Children Act, 2001, which was passed in July, will bring about a major reform in the law relating to juvenile justice and vulnerable children in need of care and protection. The interim special residential services board, set up in April 2000 pending the establishment of the board provided for in Part II of the Children Act, has been looking at appropriate and effective utilisation of special residential care and of children's detention centres.</P>
      <P>The youth homelessness strategy was launched last month. It provides for a strategic and planned approach to address youth homelessness. The Government remains committed to ensuring that all staff in residential centres without formal qualification are facilitated to become professionally qualified. Significant pay increases have been awarded to child care workers in the health sector and the new pay arrangements which have been introduced recognise the importance of staff having professional child care qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The springboard initiative established family support initiatives in 17 locations throughout the <Col N="1199" /> country. These projects work intensively with children between the ages of seven and 12 who are at risk of going into care or getting into trouble. An evaluation of the initiative has found that it is an effective intervention for children at risk and their families.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Deputy Hanafin, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, asked the social services inspectorate to inspect Newtown House following concerns that were raised about the facility. Following the report on Newtown House, the Minister of State was concerned that good child care practice was not followed in a number of instances. Children admitted to residential care have experienced adversity and difficulties. It is important that such a vulnerable group of children receive services of the highest quality and their safety and care must always be our primary concern. Newtown House has been closed. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, has asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to take on board the findings of the report regarding residential care.</P>
    <P>In October, 2000 the Minister of State requested the Eastern Regional Health Authority to initiate a review into the case of the late Kim O'Donovan, to be carried out by an independent person. She has been informed that the review is nearing completion and should be finalised in the near future. The report referred to by the Deputy, which relates to the procedures surrounding this tragic case, has implications for child welfare and protection services, in particular when a child is detained under a High Court order. Each health board was informed of the report and the Minister has requested that they ensure the report is carefully considered and that appropriate measures are put in place.</P>
    <P>As regards the future handling of child care cases, the report recommends that children detained in secure accommodation on foot of a High Court order should not be allowed to leave the direct supervision of the health board without the permission of the court. It is recommended that all relevant information should be communicated promptly and that health boards should liaise effectively with the Garda in cases of children who abscond. It is also suggested that health boards initiate the appointment of a liaison officer to deal with cases of children who abscond. The report recommends that communications from children who are the subject of a detention order to the High Court must not be impeded.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and I are committed to ensuring that services for children are improved. She will continue to be an advocate for children. In this context, I add that the draft Bill for the establishment of an ombudsman for children is at an advanced stage of preparation. The developments that I have outlined are evidence of this <Col N="1200" /> Government's commitment to continue to provide appropriate services for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that fact can be stranger than fiction and the case I wish to discuss shows that can be the case. It is difficult to believe that no speech therapist is available for St. John's School for Special Needs in Dungarvan, where 17 of 45 children need speech and language therapy. Until this year, a therapist came to the school for one day each week, but the needs of the South-Eastern Health Board elsewhere have meant that the therapist's services have been withdrawn. St. John's now employs an assistant who is not qualified, but who is doing an excellent job in the circumstances. The Department of Health and Children merely suggests that the assistant telephones a therapist elsewhere if particular difficulties arise. That is the degree of service that is being provided.</P>
      <P>Having discussed this episode with the school authorities and having raised it in this House by way of a question, it seems there has been a disastrous collapse in therapy services as a result of a tug of war between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. I do not blame the Minister, Deputy Martin, as this problem has been developing for a number of years. The Minister and I have both worked as teachers and we know the area of special needs was not really seen as a problem 20 or 30 years ago. Perhaps problems always existed, but the situation has evolved from when children were classified as slow learners. We now face a critical problem and there are not enough qualified people to do a necessary job.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Bacon report has advocated that the numbers of therapists being trained be quadrupled within 15 years, but schools like St. John's in Dungarvan, where no therapist is available, face immediate difficulties. It is incredible that the therapist that worked in the school for a day each week has been withdrawn. The division of authority between the Departments must have broken down, as one tries to pass the problem to the other. For the sake of the children, I would like to see a resolution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children knows that modern procedures are aggravating the problem. Children with a mild handicap are being absorbed into mainstream schooling, which means that schools for children with special needs tend just to cater for disruptive children. Schools are not doing the jobs they were initially established to do. I do not know if the Minister accepts my point that difficulties have emerged as a result of the absorption of well behaved children with special needs problems into regular schools. Special needs schools are left to cater for the dis<Col N="1201" /> ruptive element which is not accepted by mainstream schools. The disruptive nature of many pupils means that each class now needs an assistant to help teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence. I believe the Minister has the best will in the world to deal with this critical problem. As politicians during the last 20 or 30 years, we did not foresee this difficulty, although we should have. The problem has got the better of us and we are unable to cater for the needs of children with special needs. Will the Minister do his best to see that this problem is redressed as quickly as possible? The situation in Dungarvan should be dealt with immediately. Although the school has advertised, it cannot afford to wait another year for a teacher, as a year has already been lost by the children of St. John's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this issue and for his sincere and constructive comments. He has outlined the problem and indicated the solution, to a certain extent. While this Adjournment debate relates to the unsatisfactory situation with regard to the provision of specialised services for the children at St. John's School for Special Needs in Dungarvan, it is clear the Deputy is particularly concerned about speech and language therapy services. Part of my reply deals with services other than those mentioned by Deputy Deasy.</P>
      <P>While health boards have for many years provided certain specialised supports for school children with special needs, there is clearly an increasing demand for such services. A similar demand was not apparent a decade ago, although there was a similar number of children in special schools. The issue of allied health professionals, such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists has become a greater priority in recent years. Increased funding has been made available to health boards in recent years to provide health related support services for children with intellectual disability and those with autism. Since 1998, about £8.5 million has been made available to health boards for services like diagnosis, assessment and pre-school and outreach support for children of school going age with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the South-Eastern Health Board that a liaison nurse for children with intellectual disability calls to St. John's School when required. The school receives medical services from the area medical officer and the school nurse, based in St. Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan. Psychology assessments are accessed through school medical services. Occupational therapy and physiotherapy may be accessed through the community care clinics in St. Joseph's <Col N="1202" /> Hospital. As Deputy Deasy rightly pointed out, the school had a speech and language therapist, but the therapist's availability for just one day each week does not seem like a great provision. The health board has informed me that the suspension of the therapist's visits to St. John's is temporary and results from a shortage of therapists. The board provides a grant to the school to meet the care needs of the children.</P>
    <P>The special schools in the Waterford area have applied for nursing services to be made available to them by the board. A survey in relation to this matter has just been carried out by the area co-ordinators. I understand that information was received from St. John's School on 7 November. All applications for additional funding within the intellectual disability services must go through the local consultative committee and be prioritised by them. An application has been submitted for funding to provide nursing services to all the special schools in the Waterford area, including St. John's.</P>
    <P>Many health boards and service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.</P>
    <P>In response to my ongoing concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage on short-term, medium-term and long-term bases. These include an assessment of workforce requirements up to 2015 which outlined the increases required in the number of course places required by the therapy professions and a concerted recruitment drive at home and abroad. I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as a matter of urgency. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. That bidding will involve setting up new schools of speech and language therapy in addition to the one in existence. We have only had one for the past 30 years, in Trinity College Dublin, producing about 20 therapists. Now the endeavour is to provide more schools of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and, most especially, of speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>We have also responded to the expert group on various health professionals and gave £10 million for the implementation of its recommendations. In the interim we have authorised the health boards to go abroad to recruit as many specialists as they can in the short-term. Even though substantial funding was given last year, the health boards were unable to utilise all of it because of inability to get staff. I will look into the situation in St. John's to see whether we can</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> do something in the interim to provide a speech and language therapy service to the children there. It is the one issue that is holding us back in terms of giving the comprehensive service that children with special needs require, and it is one <Col N="1204" /> that is very frustrating from my point of view because I know it is the bugbear of all the various providers of such services across the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 November 2001.</P>

      <P>On my initiative, the Minister for Finance has sanctioned the construction of new offices for the National Archives entailing redevelopment of the existing site at Bishop Street subject to the Office of Public Works investigating the feasibility of delivering the project as a public private partnership venture.</P>
      <P>I understand that Office of Public Works have now reported the outcome of their investigations to the Department of Finance and are awaiting their decision. The matter of a timetable for the redevelopment project is for the Office of Public Works to draw up once definitive sanction to proceed is given by the Department of Finance.   </P>

      <P>Tá cúram forbartha na foclóireachta agus na téarmaíochta i measc dhualgais reachtúla Fhoras na Gaeilge. Anuraidh ghlac an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh Theas le moladh ó Fhoras na Gaeilge go bhfoilseofaí foclóir nua Béarla-Gaeilge. Tá an obair ullmhúcháin ar an tionscadal sin ar siúl faoi láthair. Tuigim ón bhForas go bhfuil sé i gceist go bhfoilseofaí leagan leictreonach agus leagan clóbhuailte don Fhoclóir nua sin. Mar eolas tá leagan leictreonach de mhórfhoclóir Gaeilge Béarla Uí Dhónaill ar fáil agus is féidir leas a bhaint as an leagan sin mar áis Bhéarla-Gaeilge chomh maith.</P>

      <P>The shortcomings in my Department's accounting procedures identified in the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriations Accounts for 2000 are attributable in the main to an outdated accounts system which will be discarded as soon as a replacement system being developed under the management information framework initiative has been installed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, remedial action as follows is being taken to ensure that my Department will provide an effective and accurate financial service within the existing constraints.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Review of Structures and Staffing</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>A full internal review of the structures and staffing in the accounts branch of my Department has been carried out. A lack of professional accountancy expertise has been identified and this is being addressed in the short-term through consultancy help &ndash; Deloitte &amp; Touche.</P>
      <P>A further outcome of the review was the identification of a lack of resources at middle management and general clerical level. Two extra appointments have been made and a further six are envisaged.</P>
      <P>Turnover of personnel has been a contributor to problems in the accounts area of my Department and efforts are being made to manage this, in so far as is feasible.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Manuals and Documentation of Procedures </i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Manuals have been drafted that document procedures, and outline the steps that must be carried out, on a daily, monthly and annual basis, with particular emphasis on recording receipts and reconciling monthly with the PMG, the issue which gave rise to particular concern in the audit of my Department's accounts by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Training</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Most of the initial training for accounts personnel is in-house, with the help of consultants. This is the only realistic approach given that most of the major problems arise from our accounts sys<Col N="1208" /> tem. We are also looking at the options for general training for accounts personnel going forward and this will be followed up in the context of the performance management and development system process.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fixed Assets Register</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>An interim fixed assets register system has been put in place on a spreadsheet basis. My Department recognises that recording capital assets in a spreadsheet format is only a short-term solution, which must be superseded by fixed asset software. It is recognised that the procurement of assets management software is a priority. My Department, in conjunction with external consultants, is working on the drawing up of a specification at present. When the most appropriate software is identified and acquired, a considerable amount of checking and inputting will be needed before the system is fully operational. It is the aim to have a computerised central assets register for the 2002 Appropriation Account.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Internal Audit</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The internal audit function of my Department has been strengthened to ensure that we will in future have a more robust system of internal checks and balances. The unit is undertaking a major risk evaluation project in relation to all of my Department's responsibilities in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>In the light of these and other connective measures taken, I am confident that my Department will meet the challenge of providing a first class accounts service into the future.  </P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 33 of 11 April 2001, no survey or research has been carried out on the level of interest in archaeological excavations of medieval Dublin. The historic core of Dublin is of international importance. This is something that I believe is well known not only amongst academics and others with a specific interest in the subject but also amongst the general public. The knowledge and understanding of medieval Dublin gleaned from archaeological excavations has been very valuable in allowing my Department and others to devise strategies for the protection of archaeological heritage generally. Where my Department does commission research on heritage sites it invariably feeds into the interpretation of the site and such research has generated positive feedback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the archaeological excavation in Dublin in recent years has been development-led. The priority with such excavations is to preserve <Col N="1210" /> archaeological remains by record. I understand though, that Temple Bar Properties, who carried out the most recent excavations in this area under licence from my Department, have produced a series of summary reports on the results of their excavations. This publication is entitled Archaeology in Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>Artefacts from various medieval excavations are included in the permanent exhibitions on findings from the Viking period in the National Museum of Ireland. Material is also on display at a number of sites around the city including St. Audoen's Church in High Street, which is in the care of my Department, the Undercroft at Dublin Castle and Dublinia and the Viking Adventure Centre, the later two being operated by Dublin Tourism. Primary and second level students from all over the country visit these exhibitions and displays regularly on school and educational tours.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Museum of Ireland has been engaged since 1985 on a project to document particular collections, including the preparation of an inventory catalogue on computer.

I am unable to provide a precise indication at this stage as to what percentage of the overall museum collection this represents given the absence of reliable data on the size of the collection which I understand, however, may be as much as five million objects, many of which are recorded in older inventories which have for the most part not been converted to computer databases.</P>

      <Quest>if civil servants have met with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary; if, following discussions between both parties, it was agreed that action would be taken to ensure that the Government would make funds available in the forthcoming Estimates to provide for the development of the seven acre site in north County Dublin which would provide a suitable and secure seal sanctu ary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In 1999 I met with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary at their request to discuss their future plans for the sanctuary and officials from my Department later examined their draft development plan. The Irish Seal Sanctuary has made many approaches in the past for aid in running its existing facility at Garristown but the fact remains that the proposed new sanctuary is a rehabilitation facility, which would cater for a relatively small number of injured seals rather than contributing to the overall conservation of the species, which is my concern.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear on previous occasions in this House that my responsibility under the Wildlife Acts is to protect seals and other species to ensure the conservation of the species as a whole. The work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary is primarily of a welfare nature, and as such does not come within the remit of my Department. While I recognise the continuing excellence of the work carried out by the seal sanctuary, such work does not, from a conservation point of view, impact significantly on overall seal numbers. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the question of funding from my Department does not arise.</P>

      <P>The preparation of the national biodiversity action plan involved an extended formal public consultation process. Public notices were placed in the national press inviting submissions from interested parties or individuals. Submissions were also invited directly from relevant organisations, including third level institutions and NGOs, representative of both conservation and sectoral interests. Officials of my Department met with key NGOs and explained in considerable detail the format and general approach of the plan. Approximately 50 submissions were received, quite a number of which were very comprehensive. These were reviewed and incorporated, as appropriate, into the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan is now finalised and I am in the process of seeking Government approval for its publication. Depending on this approval I hope the process of publication will be under way by the end of the year. I believe that the public interest would best be served by having the plan published and its contents taken into account as soon <Col N="1214" /> as possible. When published all stakeholders will be free to participate in the process of ongoing monitoring and review which is an integral part of the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 157 of 25 November 1998 my Department has no funds at its disposal for the restoration of properties other than those where I, as Minister, am the owner or guardian. As I am neither the owner nor guardian of Lismore Castle I am not in a position to fund the restoration of its west wing.</P>
      <P>Some public funding is however available for heritage-related projects. One source of such funds is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance &ndash; including financial assistance &ndash; in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that as part of a package of measures jointly launched by me and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in 1999 for the protection of the architecture heritage, a grants scheme was established for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority, Waterford County Council in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect <Col N="1215" /> of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The fish counter in question was installed in mid-2000 by AZTEC consultants on behalf of the Marine Institute at a cost of £55,000. During the remainder of 2000 the company undertook extensive trials of the counter that included gathering test data and generally assessing the suitability of the site chosen. This work cost in the region of £20,000. I have been informed that because of unusually high water levels encountered last spring on the River Suir the equipment was removed to avoid damage.</P>
      <P>I understand that additional work is still necessary on the counter to ensure the dependability of fish counts. I have therefore requested the Marine Institute and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board to work together to ensure that the counter is made fully operational as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A figure for the estimated cost of providing broadband communications to the inhabited off-coast islands is not available. Údarás na Gaeltachta has commissioned a report on telecommunications in Gaeltacht and island areas and a summary of this report is available. While the report does not cost the delivery of broadband services to these regions, it does discuss the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. The cost of providing broadband connectivity to a particular area or community would depend on the size of the area involved, its distance from existing networks and the type of technology being employed, be it fibre optic, DSL, wireless or satellite. Beyond infrastructure build costs, any private entity delivering broadband services would also need to take into consideration ongoing business costs such as maintenance and marketing.</P>
      <P>My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nation-wide were supported and are now nearing completion. The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to 200 million.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid £2,937.84 on 26 October 2001 under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 41.97 hectares of more severely handicapped land &ndash; lowland. His average headage payment in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 was £3,784, and under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission, farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based scheme were to be paid an additional sum equal to 90% of the difference between the average headage payment and the amount payable under the area-based scheme. Because of the reduction in area of the holding of the person named from 52.09 hectares in 2000 to 41.97 in 2001, the compensation element of the area-based scheme was not included in the basic payment. In such cases the intention is to make a compensatory payment which takes into account the fact that the overall forage area has decreased in 2001. The person named is entitled to be paid compensation of £570.60, that is, 90% of the difference between the average headage payment and the area-based <Col N="1220" /> payment of £3,150 which would otherwise have been payable if no reduction in land occurred. Payment of the amount due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In 1997 a review of mountain-type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain-type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain-type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in <Col N="1221" /> sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain-type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £2,263.25 on 25 September 2001 in respect of 8.61 hectares of more severely handicapped land &ndash; lowland &ndash; at £70 per hectare and 36.90 hectares of mountain-type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average payment of £1,125.76 in the three years 1998 to 2000.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare, subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The protocol on direct payments to farmers, agreed with the farming organisations, sets out the application arrangements for the various direct payment schemes as well as payment target dates. Details are as follows:</P>
      <P>It was agreed under the protocol that payments under the new area based compensatory allowances scheme would commence on 21 September 2001. Payments commenced on that date and are still ongoing as queries relating to area aid applications and minimum stocking density requirements become resolved.</P>
      <P>The target date for commencement of payments as specified in the protocol is that payment of each instalment will commence within seven days of publication of the regulation setting out the rate of payment and all eligible applicants will be paid within two weeks. The position with regard to the ewe premium scheme 2001 is that the EU regulation setting the rate of payment for the first instalment of premium was published on 31 May. In normal circumstances payments would issue within the targets agreed in the protocol. However, due to the discrepancies which were highlighted during the cull of sheep in the Cooley Peninsula and because inspections could not have been carried out during the foot and mouth disease crisis, further enhanced controls agreed with the European Commission had to be applied before payments could commence. While a number of query cases were still unresolved payments commenced on 20 July and £20.7 million was paid on that date. The regulation setting the rate of the second instalment was published on 12 October and payment commenced on schedule on 19 October. On that day 93% of all applicants were paid some £10 million. Overall a total of £37.7 million has been paid under the 2001 ewe premium scheme to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed under the protocol that advance payments of 60% under special beef premium, suckler cow premium, slaughter premium and national envelope scheme would commence on 16 October of the year of application as provided <Col N="1223" /> for in EU rules. However, following my strong representations, the European Commission agreed to increase the rate of advance payments from 60% to 80%. When the increase was agreed it necessitated a new regulation to give effect to the higher rates and this regulation was published on 26 October 2001. Payments involving £144.5 million began to issue on that date. While the change involved a slight delay in the commencement of payments because payments could not commence until the regulation was published, the overall effect in terms of a significant increase in payments would have been beneficial to all farmers involved.</P>
    <P>Payment of Arable Aid in eligible cases is to be made in the first payment run which will commence on 16 November, the earliest date allowed by EU regulations. In cases where there are still outstanding problems with the application payment will, as provided in EU rules, be made by 31 January provided that the applicant has responded to any queries from the area aid unit and provided that the response is sufficient to clear all outstanding difficulties. Payments under the 2001 scheme are scheduled to commence on target.</P>
    <P>Apart from the delay in commencing payments of the first instalment under the 2001 ewe premium scheme for which I have given details already, all payments under other livestock schemes have commenced on target and within EU rules.</P>
    <P>The vast majority, both of initial REPS applications and of applications for subsequent annual payments, are processed and paid in conformity with the target set out in the protocol. The target provides for processing valid applications within a period of 12 weeks where pre-payment inspection is not involved and 14 weeks where pre-payment inspection is required and the issue of payment within a further month.</P>
    <P>The earliest date from which payment of the Early Retirement from Farming pension can commence is the date on which a valid application is received in my Department. The processing of applications under this scheme is completed in accordance with the targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. These provide for processing of valid applications within ten weeks where pre-payment inspection is not involved and within 12 weeks where pre-payment inspection is required and issue of payment within six weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Sections 598 and 599 of the Tax Consolidation Act, 1997, deal with what is commonly known as capital gains tax or CGT retirement relief. Section 599 deals with the disposal to a child of the individual owner while section 598 deals with disposals to other individuals. The sections in their original form were introduced in section 26 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. The aim of the relief is to facilitate the lifetime transfer of a family business or farm where the potential CGT liability might otherwise be substantial. While known as retirement relief, actual retirement of the individual owner from his/her business is not a condition for obtaining the relief in all cases.</P>
      <P>This relief is available to persons over 55 years on the disposal of qualifying business-farm assets, including shares in family companies, subject to certain qualifying conditions. The relief is restricted to aggregate disposals of up to £375,000 or 476,250 where the transferee is not a child of the transferor. Where the disposal is to a child of the transferor there is no limit on the proceeds of disposal or gain which may qualify for relief. The child must hold onto the qualifying assets for a period of six years otherwise there will be a clawback of the relief.</P>
      <P>The nature of CGT retirement relief is that it is allowed on assets used for a trade by the person carrying on the trade, not for personal investments. The type of assets covered by the legislation would include land, buildings, plant, machinery and goodwill held for the purposes of a trade, farming, a profession, an office or employment. These assets must be owned by the individual and be chargeable business assets throughout the period of ten years which ends with the disposal. Assets not covered are shares, securities or other assets held as investments as distinct from shares in a family business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the business is carried on by way of a company instead of as a sole trader, the assets <Col N="1226" /> held outside a business do not qualify for capital gains tax relief. A number of difficulties have been identified in relation to any broadening of the scope of CGT retirement relief to allow such assets held outside the business to avail of relief. The main issue to be considered is the fact that an individual and his/her company are distinct legal entities from a taxation viewpoint. When an individual decides not to put an asset into the company but rather to allow the asset to be used by the company, then that asset is being held as a personal investment which is protected from any claim by the company's creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>To extend CGT retirement relief to assets held in a personal capacity by an individual and let to the individual's company would allow grounds for arguing that retirement relief should apply to all personal investments.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of such personal investments from CGT retirement relief is not considered anomalous and I have no plans to make any changes to the legislation in this regard.</P>

    <P>*These figures are net of tax on accounts that have ceased.</P>
    <P>It is too early to predict the actual outcome, with any certainty, on the final take-up of the scheme. Only when the scheme is closed to new participants, after 30 April 2002, will one be able to reasonably project the annual cost to the Exchequer over the remaining life of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards my expectations for the scheme, I am pleased with the level of interest to date and I look forward to getting details of the actual number of participants in the first eight months of 2001 when these figures become available after 28 February 2002, as I have already referred to.</P>

      <P>The Government interventions in the housing market over recent years have been designed to increase supply, reduce pressure on house prices, and afford greater access to the housing market for first-time purchasers. It is clear from a variety of indicators, including house completions, price data and new house grant applications, that these interventions have been effective.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank's Winter 2000 Bulletin indicated that the mortgage repayment burden as a percentage of average household disposable income stood at 28% in 2000 compared to 33% in 1992 and 49% in 1982. This reflects a number of complex components such as average size of mortgage, obviously related to house prices, the rate of interest charged which has fallen substantially in recent years as well as disposable income which has also improved considerably during this Government's term.</P>
      <P>Comparative data on housing affordability in EU member states is contained in Housing Statistics in the European Union 2001, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commits the Government to the development of teleworking throughout the economy. This is essential if we <Col N="1229" /> are to ensure the continued development of Ireland as a centre for information technology.</P>
      <P>The programme also commits the Government to introducing teleworking options into mainstream public service employment. In April 2000 the Government approved a code of practice on teleworking or e-working and also agreed that Ministers would consider ways of encouraging these new methods of working within their Departments and agencies. The code of practice has been endorsed by the social partners and was launched by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Noel Treacy, who has special responsibility for science, technology and commerce.</P>
      <P>A number of Departments are actively considering proposals for the introduction of teleworking. Some Departments are already operating informal or <i>ad hoc</i> teleworking arrangements to meet the needs of individual members of staff or to accommodate certain types of work which are particularly suited to teleworking. Some public sector organisations have also introduced teleworking on a similar <i>ad hoc</i> basis. No figures are available for the numbers of staff involved or the expenditure involved.</P>
      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas are considering the introduction of a formal pilot scheme for some of their staff. The pilot scheme will provide a valuable guide to the introduction of teleworking in the wider Civil Service. Under the arrangements established under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme, the Department of Finance and the staff unions are discussing what immediate steps can be taken to promote teleworking in the Civil Service and to improve working conditions for staff, while ensuring the efficient operation of Departments.</P>

      <P>Subject to certain transitional arrangements, section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, provided that interest on borrowings used on or after 23 April 1998 in the purchase, improvement or repair of a residential premises could not be offset against rental income in arriving at the taxable rent or allowable loss in respect of that premises. It also applied to interest on borrowings in respect of investment in residential properties outside the State from 7 May 1998. While the cost of reintroducing the relief is difficult to estimate and would be dependent on a number of factors, the cost to the Exchequer in tax foregone on rental income could be in the region £40 million or 50.8 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, which provides financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport. It is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after the age of 66 as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met: be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the disability related allowances which come under its aegis and are administered by the health boards. All aspects of the mobility allowance scheme are being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 to 73, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The provision of rheumatology services for people residing in County Mayo is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. Data on out-patient waiting lists for rheumatology services are not routinely collected by my Department. My Department has, therefore, asked the board's chief executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the data requested on rheumatology waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I have provided in the 2001 non-capital determination to the Western Health Board in excess of £400 million, which includes acute hospital service development funding of approximately £3 million.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that it is currently in the process of drawing up a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services in its region over the next five year period.</P>
    <P>The board sought the views of Comhairle na nOspidéal on the organisation and development of rheumatology services in the region in the context of Comhairle's policy document on rheumatology services. The board has received comments from Comhairle. The board's draft strategy is now being amended to take account of Comhairle's comments.</P>
    <P>I understand that when the draft strategy is finalised it will be considered by the board's acute services standing committee, following which it will be presented to the board for formal adoption.</P>
    <P>The board has recently submitted an application for an additional consultant physician with a special interest in rheumatology. This post will be considered for 2002 in the context of the availability of development funding and the board's overall prioritisation of its development requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Diabetes is not a notifiable disease and consequently national statistics are not routinely submitted to my Department. Some health boards do have registers of diabetic patients which contain details only of diabetes sufferers who receive treatment through those boards. My Department has asked the chief executive officers to forward any details in respect of such registers directly to the Deputy. As there is no national register it is not possible to say if the incidence of diabetes is increasing in Ireland. Information from other countries shows that the incidence of diabetes is increasing in western countries for reasons which are not fully clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of plans to deal with this condition, <Col N="1233" /> the cardiovascular strategy highlighted the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Diabetes will be considered in the context of the proposed programme for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as patients with diabetes are at high risk of such diseases.</P>
    <P>National lottery funding of £65,000 was granted to the Diabetes Federation of Ireland in the year 2000 towards the cost of a helpline to provide information for people affected by diabetes. The health promotion unit of my Department has provided £10,000 for the federation since the beginning of this year. A request for further funding is currently being examined. In addition, my Department has provided funding under the GMS research and education grants scheme for a randomly controlled trial and economic evaluation for the North Dublin Diabetes Shared Care Project.</P>

      <P>The pilot doctor-on-call projects in the North-Eastern and South-Eastern Health Board areas have been independently evaluated and the report has highlighted the fact that the initiatives achieve their objective to provide an enhanced level of service for patients in the areas in which they are situated. A major qualitative and quantitative evaluation is also being undertaken on these projects by Professor Tom O'Dowd and this report should be available in early 2002.</P>
      <P>The newer projects which have started in other health board areas took account of the recommendations of the evaluation conducted by Conal Devine and Associates and adapted their plans accordingly. A series of guidelines which refer to out-of-hours projects was issued to all health boards by my Department last year. These guidelines, which must be complied with by all boards with projects, emphasise accountability and the need to secure approval from my Department in advance of the commencement of a project.</P>

In the case of Newcastle West, County Limerick, this responsibility rests with the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>As with each of the other boards, the Mid-Western Health Board has been notified of the annual indicative funding available under the national development plan for the period 2001 to 2006 to facilitate the financing of capital projects, including health centres. The identification and prioritisation of projects which may proceed within the indicative funding are matters for the board.</P>
      <P>The board has advised me that there are 22 staff employed in the Newcastle West health centre, that there are 13 rooms available to staff and that if an office is required for a private interview with a member of the public the meeting room in St. Ita's Hospital may be used by prior arrangement. No office accommodation in the health centre is designated for private interviews with members of the public.</P>
      <P>The board has also advised me that it is currently looking at alternative accommodation options in the Newcastle West area which would free up existing office space in the health centre which could be used as an interview room. These options include renting private accommodation which, of course, will be subject to availability and resources.</P>

      <P>Foster care allowances are paid in respect of children who are placed in foster care or relative care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order. Under the regulations a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unit costs used in developing health service capital projects vary greatly depending on the function of the numerous departments which may be included in any particular facility. For instance, departmental construction costs at present day prices vary from about £1,000 or 1270 per mf7&gt;2 to over £6,000 or 7618 per mf7&gt;2, to which must be added on costs reflecting the nature of the particular site. On costs cover, for example, horizontal and vertical interdepartmental communication, phasing of works and decanting of facilities, roads, car parks, etc. These can add between 35% and 100% to the departmental cost depending on the individual site. Equipping costs range from about £100 or 127 per mf7&gt;2 to about £27,000 or 34,283 per mf7&gt;2 depending on the facility in question. All these costs are exclusive of VAT. Fees, miscellaneous and land costs are also additional.</P>
      <P>In relation to the planning of the project examples indicated by the Deputy, the overall facility costs are estimated by my Department as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>New 300 bed regional hospital on greenfield site</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>£150 million (190 million) excluding land costs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New 300 bed regional hospital on site of existing hospital</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Varies significantly depending on site and re-use of existing facilities.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New 100 bed local hospital on greenfield site</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>£35 million (44 million) excluding land costs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New 100 bed rehabilitation or non-acute facility on greenfield site</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>£15 million (19 million) excluding land costs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New 30 bed day hospital</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Varies significantly depending on the range of treatment facilities that may be shared with an adjoining in-patient hospital. At the low cost end it may be little more than ward type accommodation, that is a day ward, whereas in a stand alone unit a wide rage of expensive treatment facilities would be required.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the examples outlined are based on order of costs amounts and assume a typical range of treatment facilities located on sites which require on cost additions of less than 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> The following figures detail the estimated revenue cost only of additional beds. This cost was identified as part of the recent bed capacity review using case mix costs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Estimated recurring cost per in-patient bed (no particular specialty)</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>These costs are derived from the national specialty costs programme of the Department, which is undertaken as part of the national case mix programme. The costs are based on an average of all the costs in the 32 hospitals which participate in case mix. These hospitals account for 73% of all acute hospital activity nationally and encompass the urban/rural split; teaching and non-teaching hospitals, specialist and non-specialist hospitals. Costs cover the full treatment and care costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first meeting of the National Blood Strategy Implementation Group &ndash; NBSIG &ndash; is taking place today, 8 November 2001. The NBSIG comprises a number of persons with particular interest and expertise in blood utilisation. I am confident the National Blood Strategy Implementation Group will play an important part in supporting the development of blood policy. I express my appreciation of the efforts which the group is making and will continue to make in carrying out its remit, which is to support the development of best practice with regard to blood utilisation in hospitals. In particular, the group will address the following issues: the impact of the Irish Blood Transfusion's donor deferral policies on the blood supply; improvements to blood stock management throughout the health services; the implementation of the guideline for the transfusion of red blood cells in surgical patients issued by the National Blood Users Group; the implementation of alternatives to allogeneic blood transfusion, allogeneic transfusion is blood transfused from one person to another; the implementation of further guidelines to be issued by the National Blood Users Group. For my part, I will ensure that the group is supported in implementing its remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable developments are taking place in blood transfusion. Since the implementation earlier this year of the new deferral policies in relation to persons who resided in the UK for a cumulative period of five years during the period 1980 to 1996, the IBTS has recruited more than 10,000 new donors. Despite the fact that the new deferral policy has resulted in a loss of 5% of previously eligible donors, which is significant given the continual pressure on the IBTS to meet demands for blood <Col N="1242" /> supplies, the service has maintained an adequate blood supply. This is due in no small measure to the generous response of donors to the Blood for Life Week which I launched on 24 September 2001. The IBTS will continue its efforts to further improve the blood supply and increase donor support.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures to address the blood supply, a significant initiative in the area of blood usage was undertaken earlier this year when I announced a new guideline for transfusion of red blood cells in surgical patients. The guideline provides specific advice to clinicians in relation to best practice in transfusion and the application of strategies which reduce or avoid transfusion as part of the management of patients requiring surgery. The guideline recommends that the use of proven strategies to reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusion should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological techniques to reduce blood loss.</P>

During the period from March to December 2000 a total of 155 enforcement cases were initiated. Some 52% of all cases investigated involved the sale of prescription only medicinal products and involved both the supply of licensed products normally available by prescription and products manufactured without any authorisation. Other categories investigated included availability of medicinal products by mail order, unauthorised wholesale supply of medicinal products, breaches of the advertising regulations and the marketing of certain categories of slimming products. The Irish Medicines Board will continue to be proactive in safeguarding the public health interest and in investigating breaches of medicines legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; that it is aware of one case, which occurred in August of this year, where a patient had to be referred to <Col N="1244" /> Belfast for treatment due to a capacity problem at that time in the Dublin maternity hospitals.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have been identified by the ERHA as contributing to the pressure on the Dublin maternity hospitals. The number of births in the eastern region has increased from 20,646 births in 1996 to 22,813 in the year 2000 with a further increase expected in 2001. This includes a high number of asylum seekers availing of obstetric services in the eastern region. It is expected that there will be about 3,000 births relating to asylum seekers in Dublin in 2001.</P>
      <P>A further contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the region. The ERHA advises that 10% of the workload in the Dublin hospitals relates to women from outside the region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that, in general, referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the women's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds. The ERHA is also contacting other health boards with a view to facilitating women to access maternity services in their local areas in keeping with a policy of regional self-sufficiency. However, services will continue to be provided to patients living outside the region who require access to specialised obstetric services. The ERHA has also set up a working group with the three maternity hospitals to develop proposals for immediate, medium and long-term solutions to the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the Dublin maternity hospitals in relation to the recruitment and retention of midwifes. Information recently received by my Department indicated that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is actually 54 posts, when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses employed by the hospitals. The forum includes representatives of the three Dublin maternity hospitals, my Department, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the nursing unions. It held its first meeting on 19 October and has been asked to report back to me as a matter of urgency. This forum will build on a number of initiatives already taken to recruit and retain midwifes.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality obstetric service for the eastern region will continue to be of the utmost priority.</P>

      <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council is the body charged with regulating medical registration. Under the Act a person who wishes to become a registered medical practitioner must first obtain a certificate of experience from the body that granted them their primary degree &ndash; section 28 (1) of the Act. To obtain a certificate of experience the applicant must have been employed in a training hospital as a medical resident, or intern, for a period specified by the Medical Council. The training hospital must also be approved as such by the council.</P>
      <P>Section 37 and the Fourth Schedule of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, require that the primary qualification required to qualify for internship must be obtained from an Irish university.

      <P>Cases of AIDS have decreased in recent years. This is most likely due to the availability of new treatments which slow down the progression of HIV and delay the onset of AIDS. However, despite this cases of HIV have risen with 342 new cases being reported for 2000, the highest number since reporting commenced. I agree when it is suggested that we must not become complacent.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and my Department will work to implement these recommendations through the NASC.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 additional funding has been provided each year to health boards to address the problems of drug misuse and HIV-AIDS. Intravenous drug misuse is one of the main routes of transmission of HIV. To respond to this health board services include methadone treatment and needle exchange in the range of services for drug misusers. These services have seen significant expansion in recent years, particularly in the health boards in the east where the majority of drug misusers reside. Health boards have developed a range of interventions among the gay community including supporting a gay HIV prevention strategies project, aimed at lowering the incidence of HIV among this group. With increasing numbers of people presenting with a range of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, a priority in 2001 is the appointment of two new infectious diseases consultants in the Dublin area and one in the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> Our first line of defence must be education and prevention. My Department continues to produce a range of materials and literature and to run awareness campaigns to inform the public, especially young people, about the dangers of HIV-AIDS. Specific messages have been placed in third level colleges and some night clubs and pool halls. My Department is also a partner with the Department of Education and Science in the implementation of social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; at post primary school level. The relationship and sexuality education programme is an integral component of SPHE.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to comment on the remarks reportedly made by the chief executive officer of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. However, I note that the comments referred to by the Deputy were a minor part of a major article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> on the substantial achievements of the IBTS over the last few years and on the challenges which the service will meet going forward.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the debate on testing has taken away from the major achievements of the service in recent years. The debate attempts to portray the organisation as split on geographic lines and seems to visualise Dublin and Cork as separate and competing entities. As I have advised the House, this is not a basis for achieving a truly national organisation. The board exercises its governance function regardless of geography, and it is essential that this function be respected.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the IBTS in March 2001 based on a recommendation from its chief executive officer and national medical director agreed to establish a three person committee of international experts of standing in the field of blood transfusion to review the decision of the board of July 1999 to consolidate testing at its national headquarters. The IBTS and the Southern Health Board are to nominate one expert each and the third to be jointly agreed.</P>

      <Quest>if he has sought an explanation from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service on the reason for the delay in the implementation of their new computer system; the reason for the delay; and when they propose to have the new computer system in place.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given to understand that a significant delay in the implementation of the new computer system was due to a specific problem with the new software which had quality assurance implications. This problem was identified during the rigorous testing programme which the Irish Blood Transfusion Service undertook on all facets of the new system. This required modifications to be carried out by the supplier and there was a delay while this was being resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> More recently, a further delay in the implementation of the system arose due to a claim for re-grading by certain grades of staff within the service. This issue has been the subject of intensive negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and was referred by the LRC to the Labour Court. A further meeting with the Labour Court is scheduled for Wednesday, 14 November. The IBTS will be in a better position to indicate the date for the switch over to the new system following the outcome of the Labour Court hearing.</P>

      <Quest>if he will comment on a reported statement by a person (details supplied) that the only way to raise the additional 12 million required for running the blood transfusion service was to increase the Irish Blood Transfusion Service's charges to hospitals; and if he will ask the Irish Blood Transfusion Service the way in which they can justify another major increase in the cost of a unit blood.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service derives its income from charges to hospitals for the blood components, blood products and services it provides. The IBTS has sought a significant increase in charges in 2002 to meet anticipated increases in its cost-base, including the following: costs associated with the continued implementation of the service's redevelopment plan together with its blood quality and safety programme; costs arising in respect of measures to minimise the risk of transmission of vCJD, including the replacement of plasma and cryoprecipate with imported products; the loss of income arising from the reduction in the demand for red cells through the introduction of blood conservation strategies in hospitals; costs of new mobile clinic in the western region and fixed donor clinics; increased donor recruitment and advertising costs; new HIV and hepatitis B core tests to enhance blood quality and safety; pathogen inactivation of labile blood products; and increased pay costs under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the submission of the IBTS in the context of resources for the health services for next year. Notwithstanding the necessity to continue to improve blood safety in line with international developments, there is also a requirement on the IBTS to deliver its services in a manner which ensures efficiency and value for money. This is particularly so as any increases in charges in 2002 will be paid out of hospital budgets.</P>

    <P>It is a priority that sufficient numbers of physiotherapists are employed in the public health service to ensure that all persons requiring treatment receive treatment within a reasonable timeframe. In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions and the delivery of therapy services nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including a doubling in the number of physiotherapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 25 course places for physiotherapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for <Col N="1254" /> a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond quickly to the training needs identified in the study.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the grade of therapy assistant to the health service was among a number of recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on various health professionals. This new grade is intended to complement the roles of the major therapy professions, including physiotherapy, and its development and introduction will be progressed by my Department as part of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>
    <P>My Department is not currently involved in sponsorship arrangements of the nature outlined by the Deputy. The implementation of both the recommendations of the Bacon report as set out above and the expert group report is expected to make a significant contribution to alleviating the serious recruitment and retention difficulties currently affecting the provision of physiotherapy services in the health sector. My Department will, of course, be monitoring the position on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that these measures prove effective.</P>

      <P>Class 4 of the Second Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, provides that the erection of a wireless or television antenna on the roof of a dwelling house or the erection of a satellite television signal receiving antenna on or in the curtilage of a dwelling house is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission. This exemption is subject to certain conditions and limitations which include that: not more than one antenna can be erected on or within a dwelling house; the diameter of <Col N="1255" /> such antenna shall not exceed one metre; no such antenna shall be placed erected on or forward of the front wall of the dwelling house and no such antenna shall be erected on the front slope of the dwelling house or higher than the highest part of the roof of the dwelling house. The enforcement of these provisions is a matter for each planning authority.</P>
      <P>Class 4 has been reviewed by my Department as part of an overall review of the exempted development regulations. New draft regulations have been prepared and sent on an informal basis to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Oireachtas approval of the regulations is required and I hope to be in a position to make the regulations shortly with a view to bringing them into force early in the new year. The current regulations apply to satellite television signal receiving antenna while the draft regulations also include transmission antenna reflecting changing technology including interactive television and Internet services.</P>

      <P>The Government has implemented a range of measures to improve housing affordability, particularly for first-time buyers and low income house purchasers, including the following: revised stamp duty thresholds and rates to ease the burden on first-time buyers; measures to discourage speculative demand; the provision of affordable housing under the affordable housing scheme, and in future under Part V of the Planning and Development Act; and significant improvements to the terms of both the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years a combination of factors have assisted housing affordability including high levels of economic growth which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable incomes, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates, low inflation and moderating house price trends. The increasing share of first time buyers in the market is evidence of the positive effect of measures taken to improve affordability for low income house purchasers. Taking all mortgage holders into account, the mortgage repayment burden as a percentage of average household disposable income stood at 28% in 2000, compared to a peak of 49% in 1982.</P>
      <P>Exclusive comparative data on housing affordability in EU member states is contained in Housing Statistics in the European Union 2001, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Local authorities have similar powers in respect of non-national roads. Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ministerial approval is no longer required for toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters have been brought fully within the remit of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively and I have no responsibility for these matters.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing, based on user-tolling. That approach is now being taken forward by the NRA. The annual revenue which will be generated from tolling of new roads or sections of road will be determined by the volume of traffic using the tolled road and the level at which the toll is set. The level of toll for each new national tolled road will be set out in the relevant tolling by-laws, which are a matter for the NRA.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>One of the main conditions for receipt of the carer's allowance is that the person being cared for must be so invalided or disabled as to need full-time care and attention. A person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention when s/he is so disabled or invalided that s/he requires from another person: continual supervision in order to avoid danger to him/herself; or, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with his-her normal personal needs, for example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, wash, bathe or dress.</P>
      <P>In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled or invalided as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of at least 12 months. When a care recipient takes up employment, that person is asked to submit a medical report from their doctor. This is examined by the chief medical adviser of my Department who decides if the care recipient still requires full-time care and attention. If this is the case, the carer's allowance remains in payment, subject to all other qualifying conditions for receipt of carer's allowance being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>In addition, a carer continues to be regarded as providing full-time care and attention where the person being cared for is attending a non-residential course of rehabilitation training, or a non-residential day care centre approved by the Minister for Health and Children. The estimated full year cost of increasing the current income disregards for the carer's allowance by £100 is £18.5 million &ndash; 23.5 million &ndash; annually. This assumes an increase of £100 and £50 for a couple and a single person respectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current personal rate of payment for disability allowance is £85.50 &ndash; 108.56 &ndash; per week. This rate has applied since the beginning of April last and represented 24.3% of gross average <Col N="1260" /> industrial earnings, as published by the Central Statistics Office, in relation to March 2001.</P>
    <P>Budget 2001 provided for an increase of £8 &ndash; 10.16 &ndash; per week, or 10.3%, in the weekly rate of disability allowance. This increase was substantially ahead of the increase in the cost of living, representing a real increase of 5.6%. The increase was also ahead, by 1.7%, of the projected increase in earnings in 2001.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to make substantial progress over the period to 2003 towards a target rate of £100 &ndash; 126.97 &ndash; per week for the lowest social welfare rates. The budget increase for recipients of disability allowance in the last budget was fully in line with this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the rate of qualified adult allowance payments, including that applying to disability allowance, to 70% of personal rate in 2002. My priorities for budget 2002 will include making further progress towards implementing these commitments and responding where possible to the various proposals and concerns brought to my attention during the course of the budget process, having regard to the available resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, as already announced, increase in rates of weekly payments will be brought forward to the beginning of January next year. This will mean that increases in all weekly payments, including disability allowance, will now be payable a full 23 weeks earlier since this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>In determining entitlement to old age non-contributory pension account must be taken of all income, including UK or other pensions, for means assessment purposes. Under the Social Welfare Acts, pensioners are required on an ongoing basis to notify my Department of any change in circumstances which might affect their Irish pension entitlement. The Department also carries out periodic reviews to ensure that pensioners are receiving the correct rate of payment in accordance with their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned &ndash; a married couple &ndash; are each receiving an old age non-contributory pension of £47.50 &ndash;  60.31 &ndash; per week based on <Col N="1261" /> means of £53.63 &ndash; 68.10 &ndash; derived from British retirement pensions. Following a recent review of their claims, the old age non-contributory pensions of the people concerned will be reduced to £11.50 &ndash; 14.60 &ndash; per week from a current date. This reduction reflects a higher income of £90 &ndash; 114.26 &ndash; from their British retirement pensions since they were last assessed in 1993.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions relating to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce. To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility criteria for participation are considered reasonable and necessary in order to ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need. Since the scheme was first intro<Col N="1262" /> duced in 1990 the minimum period for eligibility purposes has been progressively reduced from 15 months &ndash; 390 days &ndash; to 12 months &ndash; 312 days &ndash; to the current requirement of six months &ndash; 156 days.</P>
    <P>To ensure the continued relevance and effectiveness of the back to education scheme the Department plans to initiate an independent review of the scheme which will focus on all aspects of the programme, including eligibility criteria. It is not proposed to make any fundamental changes to this programme until this review has been completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has two contributory pension schemes, retirement pension payable from age 65 and old age contributory pension payable from age 66. The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 for contributors who retired at age 65. The pension was designed to bridge the gap between retirement and the qualifying age for old age pension, which at that time was 70 years of age. Eligibility for retirement pension is conditional on a person being fully retired from employment and or self-employment. A person is regarded as being retired if his or her earnings from employment or self-employment are less than £30 per week or £2,500 per annum respectively.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions and the first phase of this review was published in August 2000. Phase 2 of the review, currently under way, is looking at the structure of the retirement and old age contributory pension schemes, including an examination of the qualifying ages for both schemes. It is expected that the phase 2 report will be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of reducing the qualifying age for old age contributory pension to 65 years is £57 million per annum &ndash; 72.38 million. The equivalent cost for old age non-contributory pensions is £33 million &ndash; 41.9 million. Any knock on effects to other parts of the social welfare system would increase the costs further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Any reduction in the qualifying ages for pensions would have to be considered in the light of the significant additional costs involved and the demographic projections for the ageing of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 &ndash;  6.35 &ndash; per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3 &ndash; 3.81 &ndash; per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8 &ndash; 10.16 &ndash; per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3 &ndash; 3.81 &ndash; per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>As announced in last year's budget, the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season was extended by two weeks in April and now also commences one week earlier in October. The current fuel season commenced on 1 October 2001 and will finish on 19 April 2002.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of this Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, the increase in primary payment rates implemented in the three budgets following the review of the scheme have given a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation. The increases in primary payments of £8 &ndash; 10.16 &ndash; to £10 &ndash; 12.70 &ndash; per week that I brought into <Col N="1264" /> effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it to be the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the living alone allowance, as the Deputy is aware, this allowance is an additional payment to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone. The allowance has remained at its current level since 1996.</P>
    <P>In the review of the action programme for the millennium the Government reaffirmed its commitment to caring for older people by advancing the goal of bringing the old age contributory pension to £100 &ndash; 126.97 &ndash; per week and by extending the £100 &ndash; 126.97 &ndash; commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2001 further significant progress was made towards achieving this goal following significant increases in social welfare pension rates. With effect from the first week in April 2001, the personal rate of old age contributory pension was increased to £106 &ndash; 134.59 &ndash; per week. The equivalent rate for old age non-contributory pension was increased to £95.50 &ndash; 121.26 &ndash; per week.</P>
    <P>As with the fuel scheme, these measures reflect the emphasis placed on improving the personal pension rates of older people which the Government consider is the most effective and equitable way to ensure that their position is improved.</P>

      <P>My Department has not undertaken any studies regarding the possible floodlighting of Tagadoe Round Tower and Church. As indicated in the reply to previous questions on this matter, Parliamentary Questions Nos. 266 and 267 of 5 July 2001, because of pressures on conservation works at sites in State care the floodlighting of monuments is not a priority in the drawing up of work programmes or in the allocations of funds.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. The number of structures that are so protected in County Kildare is a matter for the planning authorities there.</P>
      <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection afforded under the planning Acts covers both the interior and exterior of the <Col N="1268" /> protected structures and, in the absence of a declaration from the planning authority outlining any works which are exempted development, any future building works will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observations. The strength of these provisions is sufficient to safeguard the architectural integrity of the protected structures in County Kildare.</P>

      <P>There are five castles in County Kildare which are in State ownership or guardianship. These are Kilteel Castle, Rathcoffey Demesne, Grange Castle, Jigginstown House and Maynooth Castle. There are a further five castles listed on the record of monuments and places for County Kildare.</P>
      <P>Kilteel Castle and Rathcoffey Demesne are regularly monitored by my Department and I am satisfied that both sites are in a good state of preservation and, as such, there is no need for work to be undertaken at either at this point.</P>
      <P>In the case of Grange Castle a major conservation and presentation project was commenced under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. I fully expect that this project will be fully complete and open to the public in 2002.</P>
      <P>With regard to Maynooth Castle the Deputy will be aware that major adaptation and conservation were completed recently at this site. Once this site is fully operational in 2002 my Department will make a determination as to the level, if any, of additional works required to ensure its successful operation.</P>
      <P>In relation to Jigginstown House I have provided funding of £500,000 under the national development plan to allow a major conservation project to be undertaken at this important site. In advance of any conservation work it is necessary to complete an archaeological assessment of the site. A contract for this work has been placed and I fully expect work to commence at an early date.</P>

Work on the exhibition to be installed in the castle is on target for completion and installation in the 2002 season.

      <P>The total spend to the end of September 2001 on the works to Maynooth Castle is £993,000. As indicated previously, I am satisfied that the project undertaken can be completed within the available budget of £1.5 million.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of excavations relating specifically to heritage projects being carried out <Col N="1270" /> throughout the country. However, as the Deputy may already be aware, archaeological investigations and excavations must be licensed by my Department. So far this year, a total of 1,095 excavation licences have been issued most of which relate to planning and development.</P>
      <P>Among the recent excavations conducted by my Department are Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, and Skellig Michael, County Kerry. Both of these sites are open to the public. An excavation was also carried out on the gatehouse at Cahermore in the Burren and it is proposed to open this site to the public in the near future. As most other excavations relate to planning and development on land in private ownership, the opportunity for the public to access and view these sites is not feasible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that there are normally five or six research excavations dealing with specific sites of interest throughout the Republic. These are funded by the Government and administered by my Department on the advice of the national committee for archaeology of the Royal Irish Academy. I would like to remind the Deputy that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, provides visitor services at over 70 sites, many of which deal with archaeological and historical themes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in 1998 the Government decided on a new framework to protect the architectural heritage of the State which placed the primary responsibility in this regard on planning authorities. I should emphasise that my role is mainly to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. Funding was subsequently made available for the planning authorities to recruit conservation officers. A scheme of grants for the conservation of protected structures was also introduced. The new system was given legislative effect through the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the <Col N="1271" /> owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>It is, accordingly, a matter for each planning authority, in the first instance, to take whatever action it considers appropriate, consistent with its new powers, to protect the architectural integrity of the relevant structures, including the setting thereof. The new Act also places a responsibility on the owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure that the structure or any part of it, which contributes to its special interest, is not endangered in any way.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded under the Planning Acts covers both the interior and exterior of each protected structure and in the absence of a declaration from the planning authority, outlining any works which are exempted development, any future building works will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observations. I believe that the strength of these provisions is sufficient to safeguard the architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the guidance offered by me, I intend to issue, in the near future, draft architectural heritage protection guidelines for planning authorities for public consultation. In the case of properties in the care of my Department, the Deputy will appreciate that I am quite satisfied with the standard of work carried by my officials in carrying out conservation and improvement works.</P>

      <P>The EU Habitats Direc<Col N="1272" /> tive &ndash; 92/43/EEC &ndash; requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation for the conservation of listed habitats and species and to protect their favourable conservation status. The directive was transposed into Irish law in February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. A total of 363 sites covering almost one million hectares of land and water have been formally transmitted to the Commission.</P>
      <P>It has been the experience of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, that the most common cause for complaints in respect of SACs has emanated from landowners who objected to the proposed designation of their land. To deal with these complaints, I have placed emphasis on initial notification and consultation, wide publication of proposals, the provision of a comprehensive appeal mechanism, including the establishment by me of an SAC appeals advisory board chaired by the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, setting up local liaison committees and the provision of compensation to those suffering actual losses as a result of the designation. To date, a total of 756 appeals in relation to SAC boundaries have been lodged. The vast majority of these have been resolved through informal review by Dúchas staff. A total of 136 appeals have been referred for consideration to the SAC advisory board. To date, I have accepted all the board's recommendations on SAC boundaries.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to him on 11 October and 25 October last in relation to these cases. In determining whether to make a deportation order in respect of a person regard must be given, <i>inter alia</i>, to the family and domestic circumstance of the person. Section 3(6)(f2&gt;c) of the Immigration Act, 1999 refers. In these cases the normal procedures were followed and the deportation orders made in respect of the persons referred to by the Deputy are valid. Having regard to all the circumstances in these cases it is proposed to continue with the enforcement of the deportation orders made. The Deputy should be aware that the persons concerned were requested to present themselves to a member in charge at Naas Garda Station on 2 November last to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. Both persons failed to do so and are now considered to have evaded the deportation orders made in their case and may be arrested and detained without warrant in accordance with section 5(1) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that there are three vehicles currently <Col N="1275" /> assigned to Lifford Garda station &ndash; one ford transit, one patrol car and one detective branch vehicle. I am also informed that Lifford Garda station operates on a 24 hour basis and in the event of a personnel shortage for whatever reason the station has a local arrangement with Castlefin.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that a mobile patrol usually operates out of Lifford Garda station, but in the event of there being insufficient personnel from either Lifford or Castlefin to man this vehicle cover is provided by a mobile unit from Carrigans. Both Castlefin and Carrigans also operate on a 24 hour basis and are in close proximity to Lifford. The Garda authorities consider that the mobile patrols at Lifford are adequate to meet current requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Until such time as the relevant local authority or VEC has decided on an application, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment, CE, schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to providing secretarial and caretaking services for schools. An equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system has been put in place, for which my Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 101.58, per pupil over this school year and the next. The grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil with immediate effect and this will be further <Col N="1282" /> increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the schools referred to by the Deputy will receive a further payment towards the cost of ancillary services before the end of this month. I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based community employment participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. The phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain participants may be entitled to continue working in schools up to the end of 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent practice has been to increase reckonable income limits for maintenance grant schemes in line with changes in the average industrial wage and to increase maintenance grants at least in line with inflation. The calculation of the effect of these increases is a complex exercise and the cost of an increase of £8,500, 10,793, in the income limits is not readily available. However, based on the 2000 reckonable income limits, the Economic and Social Research Institute has carried out an exercise for my Department which estimates that the cost of increasing the reckonable income thresholds for maintenance grants by <Col N="1283" /> 50%, i.e. by about £10,100 or 12,824, would be £124.4 million, 158 million.</P>
    <P>Based on maintenance grant levels for 2001, the estimated cost of increasing the non-adjacent and adjacent rate of the grants to £1,500, 1,905, and £3,000, 3,809, respectively, in respect of the four student support schemes, would be approximately £54 million, 68.6 million. The estimate assumes that other variables, such as the numbers of grant holders, remain unchanged.</P>
