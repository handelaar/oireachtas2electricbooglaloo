      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was making the suggestion that this House is hardly the appropriate place to discuss the technical details of agriculture. Quite a considerable period of time was wasted on discussions regarding Friesians, Jerseys and Guernseys. Might I suggest to the Minister that agriculture is a very involved and comprehensive matter and that it ought to be dealt with, particularly in regard to these technical aspects, by its own parliament?  I would suggest that, during his period of office, the Minister should take the necessary steps to set up a national agricultural council, where all these technical matters as <Col N="432" /> they affect farmers, could be discussed and decided upon by the people who are competent to discuss them and decide upon them.</P>
      <P>That organisation might extend through regional councils right down to the parish council.  The parish council could be the responsible unit for dealing with the machinery that is to be provided on a co-operative basis for the farmers.  I feel that, if that were done, agriculture would be entirely in the hands of the people best able to deal with it.  I make that suggestion&mdash; the only contribution I intend to make to this debate&mdash;to the Minister as a method whereby farming and agriculture could be removed entirely out of the ambit of ordinary Party politics.</P>

      <P>There is a certain atmosphere of impatience, particularly on the Minister's part, on account of the protracted character of this debate.  It is not as long as debates on this Estimate were on various other occasions I can remember during the past 15 years; but it is no wonder that the debate would be of a very wide character and embrace many subjects pertinent to the agricultural industry, in view of its nation-wide importance. I want to confine myself to a few points that particularly interest the people of my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to dairying, there are two aspects of the problem which must be faced by any Minister or anybody who wants to improve matters.  The first aspect of vital importance is the cattle breeding policy for dairying.  When the Minister came into office, he acted with undue precipitation.  Within 24 hours of taking office, he ended something that his predecessor had done; and anyone judging by the precipitancy with which the Minister acted could only come to the conclusion that he did it out of sheer crass prejudice and sheer pique, simply because his predecessor did something else.  He did something that was altogether at variance with the ideas and views the Minister himself expressed on various occasions when he was on these benches in opposition.  Deputy Corry quoted one extract from a speech made by Deputy Dillon, as he was then, in connection with cattle breeding.  I cannot <Col N="433" /> claim to speak with any authority on this and the only views I am giving are those I have collected from different wise, sound, far-seeing farmers in County Limerick with whom I have discussed this problem on various occasions for years past.</P>
    <P>I admit at once that there is no unanimity, even amongst dairy farmers, with regard to this problem. Anyone who looks back over the years since the Livestock Breeding Act came into operation in 1925 must be convinced and admit that there is something wrong with the policy for which the Minister has now made himself responsible. Numbers of farmers with whom I have discussed this told me very emphatically that there is no such thing as a dual-purpose cow and that that whole business is a monstrosity&mdash; that you cannot have beef and milk, that if you want to have milk you must breed for milk.  That was the attitude that was taken up by Deputy Smith&mdash; that he had given the matter serious consideration and serious examination and had consulted the people concerned. I protest on behalf of a very important dairying district&mdash;the County Limerick&mdash;which was for years in the first place in regard to production. I protest against the precipitancy of the Minister's change of front in regard to this matter.  I think that this matter should be re-examined, and that the interests that are concerned should be consulted.  I know that there are other interests that are in favour of the Minister's attitude, but these are interests that have been depending on the dairying districts since dairying became established as it is in this country to provide them with the stores, with the raw material, for their industry, which is the cattle export trade.</P>
    <P>As I said before, if we want to have milk we must take the necessary steps to get it.  I remember that when I was a young lad&mdash;it was before the Livestock Breeding Act was passed and before we had all these inspections and all these high-class bulls&mdash;there was an old breed of cattle amongst the farmers of the County Limerick that were very good milk producers.  I do not want to say at all that the same <Col N="434" /> difficulties that are there now for dairy farmers did not operate then. You always had trouble about disease in dairy cattle and you always had trouble about abortion.  I remember when I was a young lad, away back 35 or 40 years ago, hearing discussions on these matters.  I grew up in this atmosphere of dairying and I claim to know something at any rate about the people who are engaged in it and who make a living out of it.  They are people who live by that industry and who have no side lines.  They cannot afford to go out into a fair and buy the best cows possible if they find that they have a dud or a weed which they want to replace.  They have to do the best they can to improve their herds by their own breeding methods&mdash;by trying to keep and to rear the best heifer calves they produce on their own farms and in that way to replace their stock.  They have not big financial resources at their command and they cannot replace the bad elements in their herds at any time they like as a lot of theorists in this country can do who have plenty of money under their control.  They have to carry on as best they can with the resources that are available to them.</P>
    <P>Now, the milk produced from dairy cows has gone down since this Live-stock Breeding Act came into operation. It is probable that the Act improved the beef qualities of our cattle, but it has not by any means improved the milking qualities, and that is the important thing that we have to consider with regard to this in the future.  As I said earlier, you cannot have the two things.  That is the conclusion that I have come to from the various discussions and the information that I have gathered from responsible, sound and sensible dairy farmers in the County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister made some reference to this in his opening statement. He spoke very scathingly of the people who go in for Friesians and other types of dairy cattle that we have in this country.  The general consensus of opinion amongst the farmers in County Limerick, as far as I can gather, is that the Shorthorn should be the basis of our dairying industry, and that the <Col N="435" /> breeding of stock with a milking strain should be based on the Shorthorn.  But there are some farmers in the County Limerick who go in for the other breeds.  Of course, that is a matter for themselves, and it is open to them, if they think that it is in their own best interests, to go in for the Friesians, or the Jerseys or the Guernseys as they see fit, and they should not be open to the sneers cast upon them by the Minister in his opening statement that they are only old cranks and old women if they did so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has committed himself on previous occasions in regard to this subject.  Deputy Corry, in the course of his speech on this Estimate, gave some interesting quotations from previous debates on agriculture in which Deputy Dillon, as he was then, took part.  I have some other quotations from speeches made by Deputy Dillon, now Minister for Agriculture, when speaking here on the question of breeding.  I propose to quote from Volume 93 of the Dáil Debates, column 431, of the 21st March, 1944.  The Minister on that occasion said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hear a lot of talk about the dairying industry.  There were few men in the public life of this country for whose opinion I had a profounder respect than the late Mr. Patrick Hogan, our first Minister for Agriculture. I confess that I am beginning to wonder whether the dairying industry as an industry can ever be successfully established on the basis of the dual-purpose cow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to read the whole quotation. Neither do I want to take the Minister at a disadvantage by quoting out of the context or by selecting any excerpts that would suit my own argument. Later in that speech he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My experience all over the world is that what we call the Friesian cow appears to be the best type of beast for an exclusively dairy district.  It is true that in the early stages of the evolution of that breed you did get a tendency to a very low butter fat content in its milk.  But I am informed now by those who know that that difficulty has been largely overcome, <Col N="436" /> that you now get on an average from any well-bred beast something between 3 and 4 per cent. butter fat content.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another portion of the speech which is very interesting in view of what the Minister said in his opening statement on Friday last about zoning.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I suggest that, if we are to maintain the dairying industry in this country we have got deliberately to review the convictions on which we have been operating during the last 20 years, and the review I suggest to this House that ought at least to be considered&mdash;because I do not want to profess myself as yet convinced&mdash; is that the country should be zoned &mdash;I am not advocating compulsion&mdash; and that in the dairy zone the Department of Agriculture's assistance and propaganda and development schemes should be founded on the Friesian cow.  Let another area of the country be zoned for beef production and in that area let the whitefaced Hereford beast be the foundation of our planning.  Then in another very large area of the country&mdash;the congested areas&mdash;let us realise that the mixed farming of our fathers is probably the most efficient method of farming small holdings.  In those areas let us concentrate upon raising the Shorthorn breed to the highest possible standard that skill, research and breeding can achieve.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On that occasion, in the Deputy's opinion, as he was then, the people interested in Friesians were not cranks, old women or soreheads.  Further on he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe that the reason the dairying industry stands so often in need of assistance it because we have got on our farms far too high a percentage of cattle which are not economic&mdash;the 300- and the 350-gallon cow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Everybody will agree with that statement.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I want to pass to certain matters of detail in regard to the live-stock industry.  I have always strongly advocated, and do now strongly advocate, the substitution of the pedigree well-bred bull for the scrub bull, but I think we ought to consider this plain fact.  There is no use in closing our eyes to it.  In certain parts of the country you can send your cow ten times to the pedigree bull and she comes back unmoved.  Send her once to the scrub bull and she has a calf nine months hence... I absolutuely refused to allow any of my cattle to go to the scrub bull.  I insisted on their going to the pedigree bull. They went to the pedigree bull until their hooves were worn.  In that situation I had either to sell them and get new stock or give way to the view of the countryman who works my land.  He said: &lsquo;Before we sell them, let us bring them once to the scrub bull.&rsquo;  They went to the scrub bull and every one of them is a comfortable matron to-day.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unfair.  There is another quotation from that famous speech:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like to see every bull in this country a bull which would be entitled on its merits to the premium of the Department of Agriculture but there is unquestionably a strong prejudice being created in the minds of the people against these bulls by the frequency with which cattle have to go to them before they can be got in calf.  I have no doubt that that failure to get cattle in calf may be partially due to some condition in the cows.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are all interesting excerpts from previous pronouncements of the Minister on the subject of the breeding policy in view of the statement he made <Col N="438" /> when introducing this Estimate and in view of the action he took 24 hours after going into the Department in setting at naught the arrangements made by his predecessor.  It was precipitate and an instance of what the Minister said he did not want to do when he made his statement that he did not want to act &ldquo;like a bull in a china shop&rdquo;.  I seriously suggest that with the views of men who have given serious thought to this matter, men who have worn their teeth in it in trying to develop their cattle herds and dairy stock, this matter should be re-examined and that the Minister should call up the consultative council established by his predecessor on the subject and go into the matter.  He should reverse that decision if he is advised to do so because he acted without due consideration and, in fact, without examination of the subject at all.</P>
    <P>The precipitancy with which he acted proved that.  This policy will not give us more milk, and more milk from every individual cow for the creameries is what is required.  The breeding policy that has been in operation for all these years will not give it to us, and that has been substantially proved by the deterioration from year to year during the past 25 years.  That system which was introduced under the Live-stock Breeding Act of 1925 has failed and another system should be given a chance.</P>
    <P>The next thing which is bound up with this question of dairying is the question of price.  I am dealing altogether with the creamery industry and I am not going to touch on the supply to the towns.  I have always taken a moderate point of view with regard to this and I think the dairy farmers would be wise to do the same.  I have never made this matter of the dairying industry, and I never will as long as I am on these benches, a question of politics.  It is an issue which is too important, too vital to the agricultural industry of this country to be made a shuttlecock of politics, as it was during the past 15 years.  I notice, though, that the people who were so vocal during that period are very quiet now and have very little to say for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> A demand was made for an increased price for milk supplied to creameries of 1/6 a gallon in summer and 1/8 in winter.  The Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that the present price was a very good one. I agree to the extent that relatively it is a good price.  The price which was fixed by Deputy Smith early last year is the highest price for milk supplied to creameries ever received by dairy farmers in this country.  The price trend during the last 25 years is very interesting.  I got some figures in answer to a Parliamentary Question some years ago from, I believe, the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is in charge of statistics: &ldquo;The price of milk supplied to creameries fell from 13.33 in 1920 to 4.47 in 1941,&rdquo; a disastrous fall.  At the present moment as a result of the action of the previous Minister for Agriculture last year, it has reached the highest figure in its history, but the dairy farmers say that with all the increases in the cost of production, with all the accumulated difficulties that they have had to contend with, the price is not sufficiently high yet.  I believe in moderation with regard to this matter. The Minister says truly that it takes a subsidy from the Exchequer of £2,250,000 to provide this price that was fixed some time in 1947.  The subsidy was raised to that figure in order to provide the price of 1/2 a gallon in summer and 1/4 in winter which is available at the present time in ordinary well-worked creameries, and at the same time to provide that creamery butter could be sold to the consumers at 2/8 a lb.  I know and appreciate the difficulties of the Minister and the Government in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There are only two things they can do.  They can increase the price and increase the price of butter, but of course that would be unheard of in the Government as it is at present constituted. They cannot allow the cost of living to increase if they can prevent it and an increase in the price of butter would mean increasing the cost of living.  I hold, however, that butter is still, even at its present price, one of the cheapest foods on the market and I would not hesitate to advocate if it <Col N="440" /> is necessary in order to give the dairy farmers a better price, increasing the price of creamery butter to 3/- a lb., and I did not hesitate to advocate it before when it was not popular.  Everybody is trying to have it both ways. They want dear milk and cheap butter but you cannot have the two.  There is the easy way out of a State subsidy, a further increase in what the taxpayer is contributing to help this fundamental part of our agricultural industry.  By taking either way, I admit that the Minister is in serious difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a third way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh O Briain Donnchadh O Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh O Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>There is grass. Mair a chapaill agus gheobhair féar. After all the treatment, it might not grow in places here and there.  You have to take that into consideration also.  But, for practical purposes at present, these are the two alternatives open to the Minister.  If he proposes to provide any increase for farmers supplying milk to creameries, he will have to do either one or the other so far as I can see.  We have been told on various occasions that dairying is declining, decaying and dying.  There has been in County Limerick and all over the country a decrease since 1946.  After the floods of that year and the terrible winter which followed it there has been a decrease in dairying stock.  But the number of milch cows is more or less static, since figures became available for the cow population, around the 1,200,000 mark.  Sometimes it went over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1936 it went up to the highest figure it ever reached in the history of the dairying industry.  It went up 1,380,000.  But to say that there is going to be a collapse of dairying altogether is not stating facts.  I have heard that stated every year in County Limerick by certain people for the last 15 years&mdash;&ldquo;if such-and-such a thing is not done dairying is going to collapse and farmers will go out of milch cows&rdquo;. They cannot go out of milch cows. That is the trouble.  They have to stick to dairying whatever the conditions are. They had to stick to it all down through the years from 1920 to 1931, <Col N="441" /> when the price of milk sent to the creameries fell from 1/1½, roughly, to 4½d.</P>
    <P>This talk of dairying herds being sold by auction every year in County Limerick is all moonshine.  There are, of course, auctions of dairy stock every year.  There have been such auctions as long as I remember and there will be auctions as long as we are in existence. But only on very few occasions did the farmer get out of dairying because he was not working it successfully.  One farmer got out because he had disease in his herd which he could not get rid of.  Another farmer got out because he could not get his cows milked as his sons and daughters had gone to professions or to work in shops or at something else and he had nobody to do the work.  Another farmer got out because he and his wife had got old and thought they should have the easy time to which they were justly entitled.</P>
    <P>Another thing was that the competition of the live-stock trade during the past six or seven years militated against dairying to a certain extent. Certain farmers with large tracts of land found it more remunerative to go into the live-stock trade altogether. But there are farmers, and they are the majority, who will always remain in dairying, and these are the small farmers with eight, 10 or 20 cows.  They have not large tracts of land to enable them to turn over any time they like to the bullock.</P>
    <P>What I am pleading for is this.  In view of the increased costs of production since the last price was fixed by the previous Minister&mdash;Deputy Smith&mdash; I think it must be admitted that there is a claim in reason and justice for an improvement in the price of milk to dairy farmers.  There is another aspect of the situation which should be considered also, and that is a flat price all the year round.  There are differences of opinion as to that.  That is a matter which could be hammered out.  If there is a price fixed, I think there should be a flat price all the year round.  I do not know whether it is desirable to continue the variation of price in summer and winter.  There are, as I said, differences of opinion about that, but I have given my personal view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> The next matter I want to refer to is the poultry scheme.  I want to know where we stand with regard to that at the present moment.  A number of poultry keepers are confused about it. Certain parts of the scheme are being administered by the county committees of agriculture and another part, a vital part, is administered from the Department offices so far as I understand. There are hundreds of poultry keepers and would-be poultry keepers who have applied for grants to improve the present housing facilities or to build new houses and who do not know where they stand.  They have not been told by the county committees or by the Department what the position is.  I do not know if the county committees understand it very well themselves. There is confusion as I say, and I think the Minister should clear the whole thing up.</P>
    <P>This scheme was promulgated last November I think, and it did not meet with the approval of the Minister then I believe.  I do not think he was very enamoured with it.  He criticised it very severely I believe.  Be that as it may, the scheme is there and I believe he approves of it now.  I think, however, that it would be dangerous to go too far with it.  We should remember the prospect in future of a glut of these commodities.  &ldquo;The old and valued customer&rdquo; might not be altogether so generous then.  The farmers and poultry keepers experienced that in 1930 and 1931 when the famous slump occurred and all down through the years following.  They are not likely to forget it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should go too far, push ourselves over the precipice, so to say, with regard to this scheme. There is, of course, need for reasonable development carefully planned and thought out.  But we should have none of this wild talk which we have been hearing from the Minister.  In any case, I want the Minister to clear up the confusion that exists in the minds of people with regard to this important scheme for the erection of suitable houses for poultry.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to mention is the ground limestone scheme.  I understand the Minister is trying to get <Col N="443" /> that produced in various parts of the country by private enterprise.  I know parts of Limerick very well in which there are plentiful deposits of limestone. I understand, from a reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some weeks ago to a question put to him by my colleague, Deputy Collins, that investigations in regard to Limerick limestone proved to be unsatisfactory.  That may be so, but I would point out that in the town of Askeaton there is a very fine and efficient and successful lime works known as &ldquo;Southern Chemicals&rdquo;.  If the Minister is anxious to do something in County Limerick in that regard I would suggest to him that he might bear that works in mind, although it may not be suitable for his requirements.  I should say that I have not consulted the directors of Southern Chemicals in that connection.</P>

      <P>As things are at the moment, that works is operating on a very large scale.  It employs 70 people and hydrated lime is being sent from there to the West of Ireland and, in fact, to all parts of the country. That very satisfactory industry was developed in 1934 or 1935 in place of the derelict lime industry which had gone out of production during the previous regime.  I do not know whether these people would be prepared to touch it or not because, as I say, I have not had any communication with them about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some explanation in regard to chocolate crumb.  I understand that it is the raw material from which chocolate is manufactured.  I read in the newspapers recently that exports of that commodity to Great Britain from this country, for the completion of the process of the manufacture of chocolate, have been greatly increased.  It is a pity that we could not complete that process here if there were an export market for the finished article. However, I am anxious to know the position with regard to the amount of milk that is being used in the manufacture of this commodity&mdash;milk which <Col N="444" /> would otherwise be turned into butter. From what I have gathered from the newspapers, some of these factories in England had, on instructions from the Ministry of Food, to cease production because milk for the manufacture of chocolate crumb could not be provided until the requirements of higher priority milk products had been met. I should like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, by how many thousand gallons of milk he has increased the quota of chocolate crumb manufactured in this country and whether the increase that has taken place will have any effect upon the future butter ration.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came into office he did away with the restrictions on the sale of cream.  Will that have any effect on the future of the butter ration?  After all, there has been a great deal of talk to the effect that cream is more or less a luxury because it is mainly used by the confectioners, hotels and catering establishments.</P>

      <P>It looks small but in view of all the talk we heard from those Deputies who are now on the Government Benches about tourists coming to this country and eating the food which is so badly needed for our own community I would point out that the Minister is not being consistent.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was introducing his Estimate he spoke about the growing of wheat.  I am not going to develop any point about wheat growing as that has been spoken of already.  He then spoke about the minority having rights.  He was referring, of course, to this particular Party, although it is the largest and the most important Party in the House and in the country. The Minister must naturally have certain feelings and certain regard for minorities because he is in a minority of one in this House.  He has been a minority in this country for many years past and he is a very pronounced minority in the constituency which he represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> I did not say anything about the fitness of the Minister for the post he occupies.  I am saying, without any intention of being hurtful to the Minister, that I think it is a disaster for the future of agriculture in this country to have that man in the position which he now occupies.  If rumour speaks true it is an awful pity about the swop which took place between himself and Deputy MacEoin.  We do not want to hear any of his condescending talk to us about minorities.  We are perfectly fitted to look after ourselves.  We are, as I say, the most important and the biggest Party in this House and in the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will reexamine this question of policy with regard to cattle breeding in so far as it affects the dairying industry and also that he will consider the position in regard to prices.  If half the pressure from Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan and the other Parties which was exercised during the past 16 years were utilised now that these Parties are in a position to press in regard to this question of milk prices I think they would get results.  However, I am afraid that these people are speaking with two voices.  I also hope that the question of milk prices will be re-examined from the point of view of giving some compensation to the dairying industry just as other sections of the community have got compensation for the increased costs that have accrued to their industries since the last price was fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one reference to a particular scheme which is of very great importance to the people whom I represent.  I refer to the scheme known as the Kerry cattle scheme in the Kerry cattle area.  Under the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925, certain regulations were made whereby that area was scheduled as a special area.  Provision was made that only bulls of a certain type could be allocated to that area and those were described as Kerry bulls.  Subsequently these regulations were amended and the Department allocated other types of bulls to that area.  As time has gone on we now realise that it was a mistake. The farmers of South Kerry want me to make a special request to the <Col N="446" /> Minister that they will be allowed to choose their own type of bull whether it be the Kerry bull, a Shorthorn or any other type.  So serious was this matter that Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, went down to Caherciveen and met a deputation of all the farmers and interests concerned. Having heard their case, he promised certain adjustments but nothing has been done.  I pay this much tribute to Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture. He was the first Minister who consulted with these people and who listened to all the arguments for and against.  Nevertheless nothing has been done in the interval.  The matter is a very serious one and calls for immediate attention.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the so-called special-term bull into this district has only produced a mongrel type of cattle. Strange as it may sound to some Deputies in this House, the Kerry cow is unique.  She is especially suited to the environment of the Kerry mountains. She thrives in that area; she produces good milk and good beef.  No other type of dairy cow would prosper or be an economical proposition for the farmers in this area.  Even if you remove her out of her environment into Dublin, Kildare, Meath or Limerick she will still thrive and give an excellent return.  She is practically 100 per cent. free from tuberculosis.  I would appeal to the Minister to take special steps to preserve that breed from extinction. In my opinion the money spent on the special-term bulls, so far as Kerry is concerned, is so much money wasted.  I have a letter here from the secretary to the Farmers' Association in Caherciveen:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The point I want to make for us is that every farmer in the Kerry cattle area should be free to keep any type of bull he wishes....  The money spent by the Department in supplying the special-term bull to the area is showing no result....  The best results can be obtained only from pure breeds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some pockets in South Kerry where special-term bulls are suitable provided they are mated with the purebred Kerry cow.  That is not being done at present.  These bulls are given <Col N="447" /> haphazard all over the area at the moment and they are not mated with the proper type of Kerry cow.  That is the crux of the whole scheme.  Its success will depend upon proper mating. It is also mentioned in the letter that: &ldquo;The scheme for the supply for special-term bulls as it is operated at present is producing only mongrel cattle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He makes the further suggestion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been hammering at the Department for some time to initiate some small scheme to induce and help farmers, by a small subsidy, to retain in the area good quality Kerry stock for breeding purposes.  This would result in producing good quality heifers which would give increased returns in milk yields and in store cattle.  Besides some such scheme is necessary to get the full benefit from the money now spent on the special-term bull scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will do his utmost to meet our wishes in this respect.  Nothing has been done since Deputy Smith, as Minister for Agriculture, visited the area and consulted with the local farmers.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Ó Briain has said, from my experience of the present Minister and my contact with him, I am confident that he will run the Department&mdash;instead of letting the Department run him, as did Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;for the benefit of the country and the farmers.  I have every confidence because of the way in which he approaches his responsibilities that the Minister will make a success of his job.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate in this House, one would think that the present Government is responsible for the scarcity of milk and butter.  If we are honest with ourselves we must admit that that is not so.  If we want milk and butter we must have increased production.  The way in which to get increased production is by paying the farmer a better price and giving him a guaranteed price for his produce. Farming is our principal industry and the men who run it and the men who work in it should be well paid for their labour.  We sit here then and listen to men &ldquo;talking through their hats&rdquo;. <Col N="448" /> That is what the debate amounts to on this Estimate.  The present Government has been only a few months in office and during that time they naturally could not produce spectacular results. We shall have to give them an opportunity during the next five or ten years. It is ridiculous sitting here waiting for the possibility of a snap division.  We should think first of all of our country and we should have the interests of our country at heart if we are genuine and sincere.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies said that we have ranches in this country.  We have not. We must have fairly big farmers competent to take the yearling cattle off the hands of the smaller men.  We should all co-operate with the Government. Fianna Fáil did the best it could. The present Government must be given its chance.  I think the country as a whole is glad that there has been a change of Government.  Some of the Fianna Fáil Party are getting old and they could not hope to run the country for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>There is one point which I wish to raise but I do not think it comes within the scope of this Estimate.  It relates to the Liquor Bill.</P>

I can assure the Minister that I know very little about agriculture, but I am interested in one matter, and that is the milk supply to Cork City.  The Corporation of Cork have sent resolutions to the present Minister and to the former Minister asking to have the milk board area extended.  We have always been told that there is no necessity for it. There were resolutions from various local authorities sent to the Cork Corporation on this subject.  I have personal experience of children having no <Col N="450" /> milk for their breakfast.  I know the Minister has not power to compel farmers to deliver milk twice a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They wanted to extinguish us yesterday, but they were not successful.  I do not mind the swelled-headed Minister, because we all know his opinions.  Deputy Corry is a member of the Cork Milk Board, but the Cork Milk Board also have applied for an extension.  They applied on the 28th March, 1947, when Deputy Smith was Minister.  I have here a letter from the chairman of the Cork Milk Board to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about the Cork milk area is that there are 205 registered producers, who were supplying milk before the board was formed.  Every winter there are 50 producers called in to supplement the supply.  Those 50 producers are not subject to veterinary inspection; their premises are not subject to the veterinary inspection the other people are subject to.  I am informed that outside the Cork Borough area the veterinary inspection is carried on in a very haphazard way, with the result that within the past five or six weeks we have had prosecutions for sour milk. It was about the first time we had them in the Cork District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> When I approached the former Minister he told me he was quite willing to extend the area.  The Cork Corporation and other local authorities have applied for an extension, but apparently the people in Dublin seem to know more about Cork than the Cork people themselves.  That is the position.  The suggestion was made at the Cork Corporation that the consumers should be represented on this milk board.  We have the producers and the retailers on it and the suggestion was made that the consumers could be represented either by members of the local authorities or someone else.  While nobody can compel farmers or retailers to deliver milk twice a day, I am sure if there were consumer members on the board they would be able to come to some happy settlement.</P>
    <P>I have had experience in my own house in four or five instances this summer of milk being sour.  There was no milk for the breakfast.  That is the aspect of agriculture in which I am interested. Where I stay in Dublin the milk is delivered by 7 o'clock in the morning.  It is either pasteurised milk or cooled milk.  I have been speaking to some of the 50 outside producers who supply Cork during the winter under permit and they tell me that if they were registered they would instal cooling apparatus or some other modern contrivance that would help the milk.  They are called upon, when the least profit is available to them, to help the winter supply of milk in Cork City.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should accede to the request made by the Cork Corporation and the Cork Milk Board to have the area extended.  If he grants that request he will be doing a great day's work for the children and the people of Cork City.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter at least in which I find myself in agreement with the Minister&mdash;and it is very rarely, indeed, that I am in agreement with any of his statements.  I have in mind his reference to the Young Farmers' clubs.  I agree that these are very valuable institutions.  They are bringing the young farmers together <Col N="452" /> and helping to educate them so as to make them better farmers.  Lectures have been and are being arranged throughout the country by officers in the Minister's Department and by officers of local authorities.  These lectures are keenly looked forward to by those young men and, as the Minister said, so long as they avoid politics and maintain their independence I believe there is a bright future for them; but the moment they enter politics and become tied, as it were, like a battered tin can to some political Party's tail, as has happened to every farmers' Party founded in this country, then they will cease to serve any useful function.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the Minister armed himself with all the necessary information&mdash;and accurate information at that&mdash;which is available to him, and that when he comes to make statements in this House these statements are accurate in so far as it lies within the power of the Minister to secure that accuracy.  One of his statements when introducing this Vote is recorded in col. 2588 of Vol. III of the Parliamentary Debates for the 9th July, 1948.  It is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The first consideration to which I have to direct the attention of the House is that at the beginning of this year we find ourselves in the remarkable position that the live-stock population of this country has fallen to the lowest levels that have ever been known in our recorded history.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume that before making that statement the Minister sought the necessary information to confirm it. What are the actual facts?  According to figures supplied in detail by the Minister, the total cattle population was 3,948,061.  That is from the recent census.  In 1931&mdash;that is going back 17 years to the end of the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal régime&mdash; the cattle population was 4,029,084.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reduction of 81,000, but the Minister did not give any further figures nor did he give any explanation as to the possible cause of the recent reduction in the cattle <Col N="453" /> population.  If he wanted to be fair and to inform the House, he could have given a few more figures without going too far back into ancient history. He could have gone back to 1946 a year previously, or to 1945 just two years previously.  I propose to take him back these few years.  In 1946, the cattle population was 4,210,840 and in 1945 4,245,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only surmise and my surmise might be as good as that of the Minister.  Possibly the Minister has forgotten that there was a very severe winter in 1946-47, one of the severest the world has ever known, and that the cattle mortality in consequence was very high.  I think that can scarcely be contradicted.  That is one cause, if not the major cause, for the sudden drop in the cattle population between 1946 and 1947.  The Minister may smile.</P>

      <P>We are back on the calves again but we shall deal with that.  The Minister used to be the loudest to proclaim the rights of every Deputy, no matter how obscure, to stand up here in Leinster House and express his views and used to say that while Deputy Dillon was sitting on these benches he would insist on that right, but the moment a member of the Opposition now gets up to express his views, the Minister, like his colleague the Minister for Finance, by these interjections, thinks he is going to throw him off the track, but if he thinks he is <Col N="454" /> going to throw me off the track he is making a mistake.  Deputy Sweetman may laugh.  I have been in politics perhaps since Deputy Sweetman was born and I will not be so lightly put off my track as the Minister or Deputy Sweetman thinks.  I cannot quite understand what Deputy Sweetman is saying.  If he wants to interject, he should speak in an audible fashion. The only occasion on which I remember meeting the Deputy was on one occasion in my native constituency when I obliged him with my platform. I think the Deputy should now extend the same courtesy to me and that I should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>

I hope that the Minister in replying, will advert to these figures and that he, in turn, will give an explanation of the fall in numbers between 1921 and 1931.  But that is not the point I was seeking to make when I got on my feet.  The Minister is very careful, but Deputies of all Parties in the House will have reason to doubt the accuracy of his statements.  He said that the live-stock population had reached the lowest levels that ever have been known in recorded history.  Is that true?  Is it founded on fact?  In 1911, the cattle population was 3,947,718.</P>
      <P>In 1901, a little further back but still in this century, the cattle population was 3,867,891 and that is in recorded history, although the Minister stated that the numbers at present were the lowest ever recorded.  I do not want to delay the House by going back further, but if the Minister wants to check up, he can look up the figures back to 1861 when statistics began to be recorded and he will find that that statement which he made to the House is not true and is not founded on fact.  So much for the accuracy of the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which he referred was soil fertility and, in that also, I presume he was equally accurate.  &ldquo;We <Col N="456" /> have reached a degree of degradation lower than has been known for 100 years past.&rdquo;  I do not want to read the whole passage, but I do not think I am being unfair to the Minister when I take that extract from it.  If he or the House wishes, I will read it all.  It is in column 2589 of Volume III, No. 19, of the Official Reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard a colleague of mine say any such thing. The Minister does not say where he got the information, but the Minister is basing his information on the fact that a number of his friends down the country who are hostile to the wheat-growing campaign continued to sow wheat on the same land year after year, until the land became wheat-sick, and then he comes in here and tells us that soil fertility has been reduced appallingly. Of course, it has, in those particular areas.  Deputy Davin adverted to that fact last night and he went further than even Fianna Fáil proposed to go when he suggested, without actually stating, that there should be some form of compulsion to make these people do their duty in regard to cultivating the land as Deputy Davin would wish them to do it.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to restore this soil fertility by means of the application of chemical manures.  Perhaps it was a mere coincidence or an oversight on his part that he did not advert to what is an even more important factor, as every farmer knows, the use of farmyard manure.  Why did the Minister or any of the spokesmen behind him not advert to that factor?  Surely farmyard manure is at least of equal importance, but there is no one to boost farmyard manure and no one to give big dinners and make after-dinner speeches in favour of farmyard manure. If there were, we might have a higher appreciation of it in certain quarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear what the corncrake said, but I did not catch the remark.  I was referring to the fact that the Minister hopes, by the use of chemical fertilisers, to restore the fertility of the soil.  I submit that <Col N="459" /> that is impossible, and that the Minister, in making that statement, overlooked many vital factors.  Chemicals alone may restore the chemical composition, but they are no substitute for farmyard manure for the restoration of the physical condition of the soil. Rather should they be used in conjunction with farmyard manure.  The judicious use of chemical fertilisers, in addition to farmyard manure, is what the Minister should recommend rather than to confine his remarks to the use of chemicals alone.</P>
      <P>I am not decrying the use of certain manures, such as phosphates, potash and so on.  I am aware that most of the land in this country is deficient in phosphates, potash and other essential fertilisers.  Consequently I do not decry their use but we should not over-emphasise the use of chemicals and at the same time neglect the production of farmyard manure.  That is the point I am coming to.  In order to produce farmyard manure you must have housing and that is why the Minister sought to divert me from the course I was proposing to adopt in dealing with this matter for he knew that I was going to refer to the fact that he had abandoned the farm building scheme in order to save £250,000 instead of going ahead with the erection of farm buildings to enable the farmers to house their live stock and thus produce the manure so essential to their economy.  He did not explain, of course, that he had abandoned that very useful scheme or, rather, he gave two different explanations, as is characteristic.  First and foremost, it was scarcity of cement. Contractors could not get cement, he told us, to plaster the gable end of the House of God and surely it should not be expected that an ordinary farmer could apply for and get cement.  At a later stage he prophesied that if he got Marshall Aid everything would be all right and that he could go ahead with the building scheme.  I will have to leave it to Deputies to draw their own conclusions as to which of these he meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is also going to erect lime kilns on a large scale all over the country. <Col N="460" /> Again I do not want to be misunderstood nor do I want to misquote the Minister or to convey an impression different from that which he sought to convey.  But, there is an old adage that we all heard in our youth&mdash;too much lime without manure will make the farm and the farmer poor.  When I say that I do not deny that over the larger part of this country lime is absolutely essential but what the Minister did not advert to, and what no other speaker has adverted to, is the fact that in certain parts of the country where the land is highly alkaline, the use of lime is a poison rather than a manure.  Before embarking on the large scale use of lime every farmer would be well advised to make sure that the land is in need of lime by having a chemical analysis carried out or by other means.  The ordinary agricultural instructor in the area would be able to advise him at a glance having regard to certain herbs and plants growing on the land whether it is or is not in need of lime.  It is only right that a warning voice should be raised lest farmers would waste their money putting out lime where it is not needed and perhaps deny the land other fertilisers for which it is crying out.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to those who have appealed to the Minister to reconsider the whole situation regarding the Livestock Breeding Act and its effects on the cattle population.  It is obvious to everybody that good quality milch cows are in scarce supply and have been for some years, despite 25 years of the operation of that Act which was brought in, without a shadow of doubt, in the best interests by those who sponsored it.  The intention was to improve the live stock of the country but it has not worked out that way.  It has not worked out in the way that those who sponsored it hoped.  That being so, after 25 years' experience of the Act, I would suggest to the Minister that he would be well advised to consider the whole situation and see how much further we will go along that road or if it is not time to cry halt and to see what can be done to improve the cattle population and so make more milch cows available to the farming community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The milch cow is the basis of our economy.  Our whole agriculture depends on the number of these cows in the country.  Unless a satisfactory price is given to those engaged in milk production, the cow population is bound to be reduced.  Without cows, we cannot have calves; without calves we cannot have stores.  Our whole live-stock industry depends, therefore, on whether a satisfactory price is given to those engaged in milk production.  I do not envy those who are engaged in that production.  I would not enter it at any price.  I think the community will have to come to the rescue of those who are engaged in it and give a price that will compensate them for the very arduous work which is involved, so that the people who are not using as much milk as is necessary, particularly people in the towns, will be able to get adequate supplies.</P>
    <P>As a result of a drink-more-milk campaign in England, consumption of milk has gone up enormously.  It would be useless having a drink-more-milk campaign here until we are in a position to supply but, if we were in a position to supply increased quantities of milk the market could be got for it at our doors.  The first essential is that those engaged in the production must be given a fair price.</P>
    <P>As one-half of our farmers are engaged in milk production for the manufacture of farmers' butter, I think it was a terrible mistake on the part of the Minister to abolish the subsidy on farmers' butter because that will discourage the farmers.  It was the farmers who were engaged in the manufacture of farmers' butter who also went in for calf-rearing on a large scale. After a few years the Minister will probably see that he has made a serious error of judgment in taking that action against those farmers.  Deputy Fagan, of course, who comes from the Midlands, and who is generally regarded as a representative of the live-stock industry, has told us that he is going to go in for milk production and, as a natural corollary, we presume, to cut out fat cattle altogether.  We shall see but, as the Scotsman says: &ldquo;I ha'e ma doots.&rdquo;  I do not think Deputy Fagan for all the innocence he professes in the House, is so foolish as all that.</P>

    <P>I would like to refer to the limitation of our exports of fat cattle to the Continent. Under the recent agreement, the number of cattle which it is possible to send to any country other than Britain in the future will be limited to 10 per cent.  We have <Col N="463" /> developed in recent years a growing and valuable market on the Continent. Any Deputy who looks up the figures will find that that is so.  In 1947, we sent to Great Britain 51,529 head of fat cattle valued at £1,682,744 and in the same year we sent to the Continent 58,104 of a total value of £2,451,736.  The difference in price per head amounted to approximately £10.  We have there developed a market of a total value of approximately £2,500,000.  This market ought not lightly be thrown away, for it took a good many years of hard work to build up that market.</P>

If the Deputy has not a more intelligent remark to pass, he should allow me to proceed.  That market, of £2,500,000 on the Continent of Europe is to be limited in the future to 10 per cent., irrespective of what our cattle may be on the British market, irrespective of the fact that it is quite within the bounds of possibility that in the immediate future a market would develop on the other side, in America, for Irish fat cattle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I shall ignore all future interruptions.  I was going to refer to the possibility that a market for live stock may be developed amongst the teeming population of the Eastern States of the United States of America.  That may sound fantastic to some people, but we must not forget <Col N="464" /> that we are almost as near geographically, and that it would cost less, to send cattle from here to New York than to take them from Chicago to New York, so great are the distances in that mighty country.  It is well within the bounds of possibility that that market could be developed. Many years ago, people would sneer, and did sneer, at the idea of our having a market on the Continent of Europe, but a market to the tune of £2,500,000 has been developed so far. Those who know the Dublin Cattle Market&mdash;and I think Deputy Fagan would not contradict me in this&mdash;know that it was the purchases for the Continent during the past 12 months that kept the cattle prices in the Dublin market at the peak figure they reached during that time.  We should not surrender our right to send cattle to America if we wish.  We all remember that when a certain agreement was made between the British Government and the Argentine, the American Government showed their resentment and showed they had an interest in the importation of cattle from outside sources.  We are at least as near to New York as the Argentine is to New York.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement some time ago, when referring to this matter, described those purchasers on the Dublin market as fly-by-night gentlemen. We are not so well off that we can afford to despise any customers, much less these very valuable customers.  I do not think Deputy Fagan or others in that particular trade would approve of that description being applied to those very valuable customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin said he knew of a man who sowed 19 barrels of wheat and the produce amounted only to 18 barrels, and that he felt a certain amount of resentment.  He said he would not advocate compulsion.  No one likes to do that and it is not a very popular thing.  He left the House under the impression that he would take strong steps to see that that man would not be allowed to carry on in that way. Every reasonable person will agree with that attitude, but the Minister has burned his boats by stating that while he is Minister no inspector of his Department, gaitered or otherwise, would <Col N="465" /> be allowed in on the farmer's land. There will be no &ldquo;pip-squeaks&rdquo;; they will be kept far away.  How, then, is Deputy Davin, who supports that Government, going to bring the rancher, as he describes him&mdash;the wheat rancher, if you will&mdash;to order, to compel him to cultivate his land and produce for the community the food which it is the duty of every owner, with or without compulsion, who is fortunate enough to possess land, to produce in the interests of the community?  Those people cannot be induced&mdash;and when you speak of inducing some of these gentlemen whom I know to grow wheat, you must remember that they actually have decided to abandon that portion of the land which they were compelled to till, abandon it as dead land and cut their losses.  Some of them even sowed, scattered broadcast, turnip seeds, pretending that that was cultivation.  What are you going to do to bring these people to book?  Will the responsible Minister permit that misuse of land to continue, merely because it is a popular thing to say that there will be no interference with the farmer?</P>

      <P>We used inspectors for that laudable purpose in order to provide food for our people.  If another emergency similar to this arises, if the Minister who occupies that bench as Minister for Agriculture does not do his duty, the people will have to put someone there who will.  The Minister for Justice, for instance, has to do some very unpopular things, but he must not shrink from his duty and refrain from punishing criminals, simply because it is unpopular.  A Minister must face up to these unpopular things.  Our Ministers have done that and perhaps that is why we have the gentlemen sitting opposite.  We will leave them in full possession of the temporary popularity they enjoy, but they will not be doing their duty if they fail to keep the people supplied with essential foodstuffs, in so far as it lies in their power to do so.</P>

    <P>We heard some very adverse criticism from members of some of the smaller Parties last night, but it is not much good their criticising if they <Col N="466" /> merely criticise so as to have their statements read by their supporters down the country.  Unless these statements are followed by action, then their criticism is pretty hopeless.  They say that every country gets the kind of Government it deserves.  What has this unfortunate country done to deserve the Government it has to-day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to have any practical experience of agriculture, but I desire to speak in this debate from the particular slant of the working people who elected me, a large number of whom are agricultural workers in the County Waterford.  I consider it necessary to put their views before the Minister.  From all sides of the House there has been loud praise for the agricultural community and a recognition of its importance to the country.  I think we are all agreed that the agricultural labourers form the backbone of the agricultural industry. They, with the farmers, constitute the most important unit for the success of our agricultural policy.  During the emergency, the farmers and the farm labourers were classified as front-line troops.  The agricultural labourers, as we have heard here during the last few days, have been lauded to the skies as the most skilled workmen in the country.</P>
      <P>I was present at a conference yesterday at which it was suggested to raise the wages of creamery workers to the level of £3 5s. per week.  The statement was made to the deputation that it would cause a blaze of indignation throughout the country if anyone was paid a wage higher than that paid to the agricultural worker who was doing such tremendous work, such hard work, and who was doing it so skilfully.  After all that wonderful talk, what is the agricultural worker paid in my county? He has 55/- per week.  He has to rear a family on that, to house the members of it, to feed them, to clothe them and to educate them on a wage of practically 1/- and a fraction per hour per week.  If he works on Sundays he is not paid double time like the industrial worker; he has no half-day, and if he works overtime during the week he is not paid at the rate of time and a half as the industrial worker is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> Is it any wonder that the wage they are receiving is driving our farm labourers from the land to the cities and the towns?  But that is not all.  If an agricultural labourer grazes a goat on the land of his employer he is cut 2d. per week; if he grazes a donkey on his land he is cut 6d. per week, and if he grazes a sheep on the mountain he is cut 1d. a week.  Is there any other class of worker in the country whose wages have been so finely calculated? I suggest that the farm labourer will continue to flee from the land unless this fine calculation of his wages; this measuring of his wages in terms of pennies and two-pennies and six pennies per week is stopped.</P>
    <P>I understand that the farmer-Deputies say that they would have no objection to pay more provided they were able to do so.  That may be correct. I am not a farmer and I cannot say whether it is true or not.  What I do know is that the farmers in Great Britain are able to pay good wages to their agricultural labourers.  If our farmers are correct that they cannot afford to pay higher wages to their agricultural labourers&mdash;a living wage of at least £4 a week&mdash;then the money which the State is giving to the farmers by way of subsidies might as well be thrown down the drain because there will be no increased production in the country.  Anybody, even though he is not a farmer, who has studied this question of production, must realise that, unless the land is worked you cannot produce, and so unless the workers in the most important of all our industries are paid such a wage as will encourage them to remain on the land, that industry cannot be a success.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that, with my colleague, Deputy Dunne, I will judge this Government by its attitude towards the farm labourer.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that it was his intention to lift him from his present position so that he would be able to compete with any industrial worker in the country.  I trust the Minister will do so, and that he will succeed.  If he does then we can say that we have a good Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing agriculture we can consider that it is, in the unanimous opinion of this House, the main industry of this country, and I start off by expressing my complete and absolute sympathy with the view of Deputy Kyne that as it is the primary and the real basic economic industry of the country, the worker on the farm should be, not in a position to compete with industrial labour, but on a level slightly higher.  Unless we realise that the worker is as integral a part of the production drive as the farmer and the land, we are not going to get very far on that production drive.  I feel myself, and I have always felt, that there is a certain amount of cheap foppery and cheap snobbery throughout the country regarding the agricultural labourer.  To some extent he is a person who will be described as a &ldquo;caubog&rdquo;.  Unless that stupid attitude is dissipated and unless the country is made to realise the real worth of the farmer and his men, talking on agricultural Estimates will be idle, because it is contentment for the farmer and his men that is going to get a production drive.  That brings me to the argument that I wish to address to this House.</P>
      <P>Farming is a business and the main attraction of any business is the ultimate profit to the man who puts his money and his work into it.  I welcome the statement of the new Minister and his drastic change of policy, because I feel myself that individual effort and individual initiative on the farm will be the criterion by which the farmer himself, with his labourers, can improve his farm and the profit-earning ability of it.  I welcome in no uncertain way the removal of compulsion because I have always advocated, as a farmer's son, that the man who best knows how to run a farm is the farmer himself.  He understands the peculiarities and difficulties of his own immediate job, and I do not think, with all the good-will in the world, that any technical expert or any civil servant sitting at his desk would be able to give him any direction and should not be allowed to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three things are necessary in the agriculture of this country at the <Col N="469" /> moment.  The first is the ordinary simple law of nature that you cannot take out of the land more than you give back to it.  I welcome the fact that the new Minister hopes to be able in some way to offset the insane stupidity of the Administration that allowed a constant drain and eating in of the capital value of the land which was continued over a period of years. In spite of this fundamental and simple law of nature there has still been this draining on the land, although it may have been necessary to some extent owing to the emergency.  It is going to take a tremendous amount of hard work, of artificial manure and farmyard manure to put heart back into that land, and to give us land that can give us production.</P>
    <P>I am not going to enter into an argument on the merits or the demerits of certain branches of cattle breeding.  I feel that in this country you have an ideal situation in which you can breed cattle for milk supply and for the fat market.  I do not think we should allow anybody to give any predominance to one or the other.  Each should be given a fair test in an open market and let the farmer himself judge the results on the profit that will accrue. It may be suggested, as some Deputy did, that the milch cow is the centre-piece of our agriculture, but I do not accept that theory.  In certain parts of Ireland, undoubtedly, that may be true, but in other parts it may be equally true that fat cattle or store cattle are the centre and base of agricultural economy.  What we must do is to build up an agriculture that is itself on a sound basis.  Deputy O'Grady, in a distortionate manner, has tried to twist the reality of the situation, and the situation is a simple one.  There is no farmer in the country, whether he be in Cork, in Galway, in the West or anywhere else, who will not put his back into farming when he can see for himself that he is getting a genuine return.  I welcome the Minister's attitude of giving certain assurances and certain assured prices to the farmer, because he can then sit down and analyse for himself his approach to his own individual farm and decide where he can best make profit for the ensuing year.  A haphazard, sketchy <Col N="470" /> policy of agriculture is no good.  If you start an industry you plan on a broad basis and you have capital to cover certain periods before the returns from production begin to show a profit.  To deal with the primary industry of this country you must approach it on the same basis.  You must give the farmer the basis on which he can build his own individual economy and for that reason I have no hesitation in wishing every success to the present Minister in his approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>A lot may be said for and against certain things, but I do not think that anybody will disagree that unless agriculture is built on a basis of having each farm self-supporting within itself, you are not going to get very far.  I want to see agriculture back on the sound, solid basis that the late Paddy Hogan, God rest his soul, once had it. I want to see again the farmer throughout the country growing his rough cereals to improve his stock and to feed his fowl and his pigs so that each little farm throughout the length and breadth of the country will become an industry in itself and each individual unit a unit of pride to this nation. I have often said before, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we have had in this country&mdash;and rightly&mdash;a lot of indignation about our constant continued struggle against Britain.  If there is one way I can conceive to recoup this country for what we may have suffered at their hands, it is to produce as much as we can and to make as good and as fair a profit as we can out of them, so that the Irish people can build up their nation again.  There is no good in sitting down here in a deliberative Assembly like this to offer what I might describe as grotesque, stupid and, in fact, completely lunatic criticism such as was offered by the predecessor in office of the present Minister.  This Dáil expects something more, and has a right to expect something more, from people who have held office and administrative responsibility and who have been in charge of a Department than such a grotesque pantomime performance which lasted longer than any pantomime I was ever at.</P>
    <P>Unless we get down to the problem of putting this country where it really <Col N="471" /> should be, where the primary producer of real fundamental wealth of the country is encouraged and helped in every possible way by the Government to do his job better and better that the nation may go on, it is only idle, petty nonsense to debate agriculture at all. Let us in this deliberative Assembly show our appreciation of the work of the farmer and his men by getting together, not in a spirit of acrimony but in a constructive, honest way, to produce something that will help the farmer to better his position.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to refer to the flax industry in my constituency. I ask the Minister, when dealing with flax and the marketing of it, to try to ensure for the future, if flax growing is to continue, particularly in West Cork, that the price which the North of Ireland people will pay for it in Clonakilty will be the same price as they have to pay in Ulster.  Like other Deputies, I want to see the co-operative movement developing.  What I say may be unpopular, but I want to see the co-operative movement develop for the purpose of encouraging agriculture and helping farmers to get the maximum production and for the purpose of processing and marketing farm produce. I want, however, to see a line drawn in the co-operative movement so as to confine it to agriculture and the processing of agricultural goods and to leave the provincial towns and little villages their normal trade.</P>
    <P>I think that if the farmer and the co-operative movement concentrated on their own job in the development of production and the marketing ultimately of their production and left to the shopkeeper in the small towns and villages the selling of boots and shoes, laces and other things there would be a healthier feeling between the people in these towns and villages and the farmers, a development of prosperity and wealth in provincial towns and in farming communities and a realisation of the idea of one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item in this Estimate of £400,000 for the development <Col N="472" /> of the poultry industry.  I should like to know what proportion of that sum the Minister hopes to spend in the present financial year.  That is an important matter for the poultry keepers and the would-be poultry keepers.  At the end of last year a big drive was started to increase the poultry population and it has gone on since that time. So far as I can see, no portion of that £400,000 has been spent up to now and, as things look, there will be very little of it spent before the end of the financial year.  Every Deputy hopes for the success of that scheme and will do everything possible to make it a success. It was initiated by those on this side of the House when they were the Government Party and was brought into operation by them.  The Minister did not approve of it at the time but, now that he is Minister for Agriculture, I am sure he is putting his best efforts into it.</P>
      <P>As to the farm buildings scheme, the Minister's Department, about March of this year, sent a circular to committees of agriculture asking them to abandon schemes which they had for the erection of poultry houses and telling them that these schemes would come under the farm buildings scheme in the future.  We have statements from the Minister that he had no hope of any construction taking place this year under the farm buildings scheme. In effect, that means that schemes such as were put in operation by committees of agriculture in previous years for the erection of poultry houses will not be proceeded with and no poultry houses will be erected this year under such schemes.  That is a very important and a very serious matter.  I speak on behalf of one committee of agriculture and they had a scheme in operation for the last three years for the erection of poultry houses under which they gave grants of £15.  That has been dropped at the instance of the Department of Agriculture.  Nothing is being provided in its place.  There is no money allowed to be spent and the Minister is not going to spend any money under the farm buildings scheme this year.  I hope the Minister will see that committees of agriculture are allowed to give grants for the erection of poultry houses as they were in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> All kinds of excuses have been put up as to why farmers cannot take advantage of the farm buildings scheme this year.  The Minister has told the House that there are no materials available. I want to tell the Minister that at least one-third of the cement manufactured in this country is on the free market and any farmer can buy it for the purpose of improving his farm buildings.  But the Minister, in order to save £300,000 for the Minister for Finance, is not going to allow this scheme to come into operation in the present year.</P>

There are a great number of ways of killing a dog besides choking it with butter.  The Minister has killed the farm buildings scheme this year on the excuse that there are no materials available.  I want to tell the Minister that farmers all over the country every year expend a considerable amount of money in improving their outbuildings.  All that work was held up this year awaiting this grant which was promised by the Minister's predecessor.  The scheme was advertised and 22,000 applications came into the Minister's Department.  There was not a single thing in the world to prevent the Department of Agriculture putting that scheme into operation. They had officials down the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He had inspectors down the country who were in charge of farm improvements.  They were there for a number of years.  These were all experienced men quite capable of supervising the farm buildings scheme.  I hope the Minister, if he ever brings the <Col N="474" /> farm buildings scheme into operation, is not going to set up a new group of inspectors in his Department to supervise the scheme because there is no necessity for it.</P>
      <P>The farm improvements scheme, which has been in operation over a long number of years and which the Minister discovered in the month of July, 1948, was a proper and a good scheme.  He took good care, however, when he got charge of the Department, to set out to kill that scheme for the year 1948 to 1949.  Formerly it was the practice to have that scheme advertised in the month of March and to invite applications in that month.  This year, under pressure from the Minister's supporters, the Government supporters throughout the country, and from people all over the country, the Minister for Finance decided, in the month of July, that he would give the Minister for Agriculture the money to finance that scheme.  I want to tell the House that very little of that money is going to be spent this year.  It is now the 15th July&mdash;the middle of July&mdash; and the advertisement appeared last week in the local and daily papers telling the farmers of the country that if they wished they could apply under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before any work can be done, however, there are a lot of preliminaries to be gone through.  The work has to be inspected by the Minister's inspectors and reports made.  The Department, after having considered these reports, issue certificates enabling the work to start.  Before all that is done there is a considerable time lag.  The result will be that in the financial year 1948 to 1949 little or none of that money will be spent.  The Department of Agriculture will not be called upon to pay any portion of that money&mdash;or only a very small portion of it&mdash;in the present financial year.  The Minister for Finance, with a view to saving the Exchequer that expenditure and of balancing his Budget in the present year, refused to give the Minister for Agriculture any money under the farm improvements scheme until the middle of July.  For the past two years we have had very bad weather in the spring and early summer.  This year, <Col N="475" /> fortunately, we had a very fine spring and the farmers got their crops sown early.  They were free during the month of May to carry out work under the farm buildings scheme or the farm improvements scheme but neither was in operation.  The farm improvements scheme is now being brought into operation with the approach of the harvest season when the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for Finance are well aware that it will not be possible to carry out any work under this scheme.  I do not know what excuse the Minister has.  I am sure he will tell the House that he has no inspectors to carry out the farm buildings scheme.  He has the inspectors down the country.  These officials of the Department of Agriculture have been doing nothing for the last three months.  They are standing around in the towns and villages throughout the country.  That is absolutely true.  I do not make these statements without knowing that they are true.  They had no work to do whatever because of the fact that the farm improvements scheme was not advertised as usual in the month of March.</P>

    <P>In his statement to the House of what was to be the agricultural policy in the next 12 months the Minister made some rather extraordinary remarks.  The Minister is well known by now.  He was known for making outlandish remarks and statements before he became a Minister.  This country, however, expects from the persons who occupy posts as Ministers at least some type of decency.  If it can be expected from the present occupant of the post of Minister for Agriculture the people expect that in his statements he will not call the people who grow crops in this country fools.  If there is one thing more than another that everybody resents it is to be called a fool.  The Scriptures have something very strong to say of a man who calls another a fool.  I would ask <Col N="476" /> the Minister to cease calling people fools.</P>

      <P>If a man wants to grow wheat in this country he should not be called a fool.  If a man wants to grow beet he should not be called an idiot.  If people wish to grow tomatoes they should not be termed as &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;.  People who keep Friesians are not cranks.  If praiseach happens to grow in a farmer's field of corn that does not mean he is a lazy farmer.  He cannot prevent it from growing there. If people come here from other countries&mdash;from Belgium, Holland or any of the other continental countries&mdash;to buy cattle in our cattle market they do so because they have the good-will of the Government.  They are not fly-by-night men and they should not be designated as such.  We just wonder what the Minister will say next.  The people down the country buy the daily papers to read all the funny things that the present Minister for Agriculture is saying.  He is looked upon now as the Harold Lloyd of Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Minister said very little in his opening remarks about his policy on the future of dairying or what he proposes to do about it.  Is he satisfied that, at the present price which the farmers are getting for their milk in the creameries and for the raw milk they sell for human consumption, they are going to continue to keep cows?  Does he think that the cow population is going to increase under the present price that the farmers are receiving?  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that the present price is such that it will encourage farmers to increase their cow population.  I am afraid it is not.  The present price of store cattle is much more of an encouragement to them to go out of dairying and into the raising of store cattle.  The Minister should look into the matter or very soon he will find that his cow population is still further reduced.  That would be a tragedy in this country.  He made great play in his opening remarks of the fact that our cow population had gone down.  I would suggest to the Minister that <Col N="477" /> there are very apparent and definite reasons why the cow population has gone down.  Many reasons have been given in this House but I suggest to the Minister that the real reason is that the farmers are selling off their cattle because they find that the profits from that industry are not sufficient to pay all the expenses of the industry. Dairy farmers at the present time are forced to reduce their cattle.  I would like the Minister to consider the problem from that aspect.  I would also draw his attention to the fact that the present high prices for store cattle mean that there will be less and less incentive to the dairying farmers to remain in dairying.</P>
    <P>Store cattle are a much easier means of livelihood; store cattle are less expensive in regard to upkeep; store cattle are much less trouble and a much more remunerative livelihood can be obtained from store cattle at the present than can be obtained from dairying cattle.  The trend towards reducing dairying herds is a serious one and it will be a very serious problem in the future.  Unless the Minister takes steps to make it more remunerative than it is at the present time for farmers to remain in dairying and increase their herds live-stock production will be very slow, if not retarded altogether.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention is the fact that because of the present high price for store cattle there is bound to be a serious reduction in the number of in-calf heifers in the coming year. It pays the farmer better at the moment to sell the heifer as a store. The three-year-old heifer is more valuable from the money point of view than the three-year-old heifer springing down to calf.  The farmers are fully alive to that.  On the 1st of January of this year we had 8,000 in-calf heifers; on the 1st January next year I am very much afraid that we shall not have anything like that number.  How the Minister will remedy the position I do not know.  One method would be by giving a better price to the people who supply milk.  The taxpayers at the present time are subsidising butter to the tune of <Col N="478" /> £2,500,000.  The dangerous tendencies in existence now must be arrested.  If they are not arrested we are merely piling up trouble for ourselves in awaiting the result.  I know farmers in my own constituency who formerly milked their cows and who have now turned them loose with calves on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy's indictment that I have put the price of cattle too high, or is it Deputy Corry's indictment that I have knocked them down by £10 per head?  Which is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not cavilling at the price.  I am not charging the Minister with anything.  The Minister had nothing to do with putting the price of cattle too high; I am not charging him with that at all.  From the point of view of the farmer it is not a bit too high.  The Minister has mentioned the question of price and in that connection it is possible that if the price of beef is kept at its present high level it might have serious repercussions in the future.  One hundred years ago famine stalked the land.  We are told that at that time there was more wheat grown in Ireland than would feed the entire population; but it had to be exported in order to pay the rents to the landlords. It is a good thing to have exports but we might export our beef at the expense of our own community. Our own people have first call upon the produce of our land and it should be made available to them at a price within their compass.  I do not think there is anything incorrect in that premise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to dairying then, it is in a precarious position at the present time.  The Minister was responsible for fixing the price of milk for Cork and Dublin.  That price was fixed last March for the ensuing 12 months.  He made April a summer month and fixed the price next April as a summer price. I emphatically protest against that.  It is only in one year out of 20 that it is possible to get a fortnight's grass in the month of April.  The present year was the first year for at least 12 years past when it was possible to put cows on grass in that month.  April is usually cold and wet.  Feeding stuffs are scarce and expensive.  I think the Minister should reconsider the position in <Col N="479" /> fixing the price of milk as far as April is concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, in fixing the price of milk for the Dublin area an allowance of 2d. per gallon was made over a certain mileage; I think it was 40 miles distant from Dublin.  Certain milk purveyors in Dublin have come down to my constituency and canvassed for milk.  They have offered a price of 1/6 during the month of May and June plus 1d.  As an incentive to the farmers to provide them with milk they are paying a portion of the carriage allowed on that milk which makes the price higher than that fixed.  The result is that in small towns milk is becoming scarce because the people who formerly supplied the local towns are now sending their milk to Dublin because they are getting a higher price in Dublin than they would in their own local towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out to the Minister that these people are doing something that is irregular in paying portion of the carriage.  There is 2d. a gallon allowed for 40 miles and they are giving 1d. extra to the farmers over and above what they can get in the local town and they are taking it from the local towns to Dublin.  Deputy McGrath mentioned the Cork milk area.  There is no necessity for any boundary for either Dublin or Cork. The whole Twenty-Six Counties should be left to the Dublin and Cork milk areas.  Let the people send their milk to Dublin or Cork and let the Dublin or Cork wholesalers go as far afield as they wish.  The Minister will have a serious problem in the coming winter to get sufficient milk for Dublin and the small towns will have a big problem too, a more serious problem than they have had in any winter yet.  Every milk purveyor can see that, even in the month of July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that it will be the Minister's job to get a solution for that problem.  He is being warned beforehand.  I am not doing this for the purpose of introducing <Col N="480" /> adverse criticism of the Department. I am pointing out what is happening in the dairying industry, and it will have a serious effect.  I know any amount of small towns from which there is no milk going to Dublin and the people in those towns are finding it difficult, even in the flush time of the year when there should be plenty of milk, to get sufficient to supply their needs.  Milk is coming to Dublin from many parts of the country, is converted there into ice cream and is sent back again to those areas in that form.  Meanwhile the people are being left short of milk.</P>
      <P>We want to see increased production in every direction.  The members of this Party are interested in increased production. We know it is absolutely essential in the interests of every section that we should have increased production in agriculture and in every other possible direction.  We on this side of the House will not hesitate to work for that increased production. Politics apart, we are all interested in the future prosperity of the country, whoever brings it about.  I am sorry to refer personally to any Deputy, but as regards the present occupant of the office of Minister for Agriculture, he should mend his hand and have more respect for the people of this country, more respect for his predecessors in office, who worked to the best of their ability and were put there by the people. Instead of spending his time belittling his predecessors in office in every possible way, if he would plan to improve the lot of the people and of agriculture it would be far better for the country.  He should mend his hand in the matter of his outlandish, foolish and uncalled for statements, and the sooner the Taoiseach puts somebody else in his place the better for agriculture and the country.  I have no personal objection to the man.</P>

      <P>The country deserves something better than what it has received from the Minister since he took office.  The Minister did not tell us his policy with regard to tillage.  He made announcements earlier here and he said that he was abandoning compulsory <Col N="481" /> tillage this year.  I expect we are to take that as an absolute change, that he is definitely abandoning compulsory tillage and this is the last year of it.  Be that as it may, the Minister has a big responsibility in the matter of food production.  I am sure compulsory tillage would be abandoned some time.  It was the policy of the previous Government to have a small percentage of compulsory tillage.  I think that was their policy as outlined in a White Paper issued about a year ago&mdash;to have something like 15 per cent. by way of compulsory tillage.  The Minister for Agriculture is opposed to tillage, according to all his pronouncements up to now; he has been opposed to tillage in every respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are not slow in picking him up.  There are many who have been tilling for years against their will.  Many who had to till during the emergency were tilling against their will and they will be very quick to abandon tillage.  They are only waiting for the word.  There was more land sown down this year as a result of the change of policy than there has been sown down for the last ten years.  As a result of the change of Government policy, we will have a lot more unemployment this year in the rural areas. Every farmer knows quite well what will happen.  There were big numbers of farmers employing men at tillage. They will now get out of tillage and do without these men.  That will happen especially in the non-tillage areas.  It will not happen in tillage areas like Wexford, where the people will remain in tillage, but in Meath and other non-tillage counties you will have a big increase in unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister in some of his perorations said that the farmer who ploughed his land with horses in the future should be locked up in a mental hospital. He made that statement.</P>

The Minister treated the small farmers and the middle-sized farmers of this country as so much dirt and showed the contempt he had for them on that occasion.  The statement was published in the Press.  It brought a blush to the cheek of every farmer, to think that we had a Minister of Agriculture or a person who occupied the post of Minister for Agriculture, who would make such statements as the Minister made on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few other matters to which I should like to refer on this Estimate.  One is the horse breeding scheme, under which provision is made for sire horses and thoroughbred horses on loan throughout the country.  In recent years I understand that the Department found it very difficult to acquire the number of horses which they would have liked to have purchased.  I want to suggest to the Minister that more money, if necessary, should be provided, as the breeding of those half-bred horses has been a remunerative business for farmers in the past.  Nothing should stand in the way of making available these thoroughbred sires to the farmers who keep half-bred mares or mares of the Irish draught type.  I know certain parts of Wexford in which horses of the hunter type were extensively bred in the past.  Farmers have to travel up 25 miles at present to get the services <Col N="485" /> of one of these thoroughbred sires.  I want to put it to the Minister that he should try to acquire in the present year more of these sires.  They need not necessarily have records.  The Minister knows the type that is required throughout the country.  They are getting very scarce and something will need to be done, otherwise the breeding of the half-bred hunter type will soon be a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>I read in the paper during the week &mdash;the Minister, of course, had to give it a little publicity&mdash;that the Minister had made a deal or a swop with the Minister for Agriculture in a neighbouring country.  There was an exchange of sires, and it appeared in the daily papers this week or last week. If there is one attribute that this Government possesses, it is that individual Ministers try to get all the publicity they can.  It appeared in the daily papers some time in the last week that the Minister for Agriculture had made a deal with his opposite number, Mr. Tom Williams, under which they had agreed to exchange sire horses.</P>

      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister again that there is a serious need in the present year to consider the question of the price of milk. There is also serious need for him to consider his policy on tillage and what the fruits of the policy on tillage are going to be for the country.  It may be from the Minister's point of view &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to grow wheat, but I want to tell the Minister that there are a great many farmers throughout the country who will continue to grow wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad for one thing that the Minister has adopted the Fianna Fáil policy of giving guaranteed prices for wheat for some years and that he will give the people an opportunity of producing wheat in this <Col N="486" /> country.  The Minister has made some statements that will do serious damage to the country in the matter of wheat growing.  We are trying, and I am sure the Minister for External Affairs is doing his best, to provide this country with dollars so as to enable it to buy wheat from that same country. Without these dollars, we will be unable in the coming year to buy the wheat we need.  The previous Government had to bend all their energies to trying, by way of loan, grant or some other way, to provide sufficient dollars for this country, and while that was going on, we had the man who now occupies the position of Minister for Agriculture making wild statements about the madness of growing wheat in this country.  I am sure that will not have a good effect in other countries, and I appeal to the Minister, in the critical times we live in&mdash;we are not all the way out of the wood yet; there is a scarcity of food all over the world, so that we will get only a portion of what is available&mdash;to do everything possible to encourage the growing of wheat in the coming year. It is too dangerous a policy to abandon wheat growing, or to discourage people from growing it, and there is no use in saying to a farmer: &ldquo;Here is £4 5s. 0d. a barrel, but you are a fool or a &lsquo;cod&rsquo; if you grow it&rdquo;. One thing which we can all pray for is that this country and its agriculture may be saved from Dillons, knaves and cods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I listened very carefully to the speeches made on all sides since the debate opened last Friday, and I can truthfully <Col N="487" /> say that, after the first six or eight speeches, every speech made was a reiteration of what had been said half-a-dozen times before.  Every Party here realises what the farmer means to this country.  To me, at any rate, the farmer is the source from which the wealth of this country springs, and one would imagine from the gloomy speeches we have heard here during the past few days that the farmers and the country generally were down and out.  I come in contact with farmers practically every day of the week and the impression conveyed to me is that they were never in a happier frame of mind than they are at the moment.  The farmer is a conservative type of individual who wants to run his farm in the way he thinks best.  He is happy to know that the day of the inspector is over, and, the farm being his property, he wants to run it in accordance with his own desires.  We know that the present Minister has made that perfectly clear to the farmers of Ireland and he has certainly lifted from their shoulders a weight which had been placed on them some years ago.</P>
      <P>I come from the centre of a very successful agricultural community, an area in which wheat, oats and barley are grown to a considerable extent.  Wheat has been their principal crop there for the past six or seven years, and it was with a great amount of worry that I heard the Minister's statement the other day that we are reaping less than we sowed for the last few years, which proves conclusively that the land is starved.  What the people mainly need in order to put back into the soil the fertility it formerly enjoyed are fertilisers, but it will take us a long time to get the land back to the condition of richness it enjoyed six or seven years ago.  That is one point which I want to impress on the Minister who, I feel certain, is the man to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone realises what we owe to the farming community.  If the farmers during the emergency years had not responded to the call made by the then Government, many people in the country would have gone hungry.  That <Col N="488" /> day is over now, and I feel that, under this Minister, there is a very bright future for the farmer, and certainly nobody deserves a brighter future than they, who are toilers over the years from early morning until late at night. If the farmer is happy, every other section of the community is happy, and if the farmer gets a decent return for the labour he puts into his land, he is enabled to give to the man who works with him, the agricultural labourer, a better wage.  That, I think, is what has been responsible for the flight from the land for years past&mdash;that the returns in profits to the farmer did not enable him to give an adequate wage to his worker, so that he could bring up his family in a reasonable degree of comfort.  That day is over.</P>
    <P>I should like to request the Minister to forge ahead as soon as he possibly can with the poultry scheme which he envisages for the country.  In my area there are lots of small cottiers who, out of their half-acres, can make a nice little living, and their wives, if they have a few hens, can make a little &ldquo;dough&rdquo; on their own without having to divulge to their husband what they have made.  That is one scheme which I should like the Minister to go ahead with as soon as possible.  I have no doubt he will, because the Minister strikes me as being a cheery personality, notwithstanding what some of our friends in the House may think of him, and the cheerfulness which he exudes here spreads amongst the people whose Minister he is.  Every farmer I meet seems to be very happy at present, and I urge our colleagues on the other side to give him all the co-operation he is entitled to because a very serious duty devolves on any man holding a Ministerial post.</P>
    <P>One of the finest speeches that I have heard in this House during the last four or five days was the speech of Deputy Coburn.  His speech literally oozed with sincerity in his appeal to everyone.  Every Deputy represents Ireland and all Deputies, on all sides, are imbued with a great affection for their native land.  If we could forget the pettiness of politics and the scoring of little points, one off the other, <Col N="489" /> we would be much happier.  That is a subject that one could develop and talk about at great length, but I want to be very brief.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the way he is going at the present time.  I feel certain that in the next two or three years the policies which he is advocating for the farmers will bear fruit and will redound to his credit and will make everybody much happier.  I realise that if the farmer is down and out every other person is down and out.  If I were to say any more I would be repeating what has been said 40 times already by other Deputies.  In my constituency of East Cork the people have confidence in the Minister, and I have no doubt that when his term of office comes to an end, which I hope will not be for a long time, the benefits that he has conferred on the people will reflect credit on him and on the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to speeches from Fianna Fáil Deputies who have been here for the past 16 years and who in their time interchanged Ministers.  After all the changes, the people in the Twenty-Six Counties found themselves without bacon, butter, eggs, milk and farm produce.  Now they are asking the present Minister what is the cause of all this.  We have been on this side of the House since February.  I have been sent here by all sections&mdash;small farmers, big farmers, labourers and business people.  The farmers of County Wexford are greatly relieved that compulsory tillage is at an end and that inspectors will be checked from driving the farmers into an intolerable position.  Not very long ago a young inspector took over a farm near Deputy Allen's place.  The owner brought him to court and got an injunction against him.  That was reported in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen came with me with three deputations to three Ministers for Agriculture.  He came with me to Deputy Dr. Ryan, with a deputation from the Macamore farmers.  He came with me with a deputation to Deputy Smith, asking for exemption from compulsory tillage.  He came with me to <Col N="490" /> the present Minister with a deputation of the same farmers.  The only time that the farmers of that area left Leinster House any way happy was on the occasion that they had had a conversation for about one and a-half hours with the present Minister for Agriculture.  They went home happy in the knowledge that they would not be forced to till land that was not suited for tillage, hundreds of acres that always had been used for dairy purposes and that were not fit for wheat.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Corry the other day and to the insulting remarks that were flung across the House from a man who should know better&mdash;Deputy Smith&mdash;who, after speaking for four hours, was in a fury, and was asking for drinks of water and shaking his fist across at the Minister saying, &ldquo;I have you where I want you.&rdquo;  It is a disgrace to have all that appearing in the papers and it is not good for the people sitting in the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>

      <P>It is very bad procedure to be allowed to take place. The Minister has a reputation behind him and his family.  These insulting remarks should never have been used. Other Deputies spoke about a guaranteed price that the Fianna Fáil Government gave to the farmers.  I can say here, and it is on the records of this House, that during the threshing season of 1947 and 1946 very few farmers got a guaranteed price, either 50/- or 55/-.  I produced evidence in the House where a farmer got only 46/-.  Where was the guaranteed price there?  &ldquo;Not up to malting content&rdquo;, was the reply of the Minister.  According to Deputy Ryan, the then Minister, any farmer who saved his wheat in good order would get his price.  Everyone in the City of Dublin and people all over the country had to volunteer in that year to save the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Walsh speaking of the flour mills being kept working. I have had experience as a flour mill worker for 25 years.  I did short time under Lloyd George, under Presion <Col N="491" /> dent Cosgrave, and under President de Valera; we were put out on the streets.  But now they tell you, &ldquo;We kept the flour mills working.&rdquo;  There are only 36 flour mills in this country. Fianna Fáil gave the richest people in this country, the flour millers, a subsidy of £2,000,000, and there were less men employed.  During the emergency two men and a packer were packing flour, pollard and bran into one bag. The men in the pollard room and the offal packers were at home.  There was less employment in the flour mills. There are only 2,000 people employed in that industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister putting into operation his statement that the agricultural labourer would be brought up as near as possible to the industrial worker.  The man in the flour mill and the man on the land are both equally important in handling wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the statement of the Minister in regard to horses.  Deputy Allen knows as well as I do that there are hundreds of small farmers who have no horse at all and who depend on their neighbour's horse. In my town the co-operative society hires out a tractor to the small farmers and it is a great service.  What I understand from the Minister is that we must follow the march of events. Take any of the big farmers in the country.  How many horses have they? It is only the small farmer that has been able to keep a horse.  All the bigger farmers have two or three tractors in their fields.  The system now is to have a tractor and a thresher going around, doing it all in one day. The big farmers can afford to do that. That is progress.</P>
    <P>There is a state of unemployment in the country.  Why have we unemployment? Because the majority of the farmers, who have no banking account, cannot afford to keep the agricultural labourer.  They are not in the way to make money.  After all the promises that were made in 1932.  16 years later the farmers are no better off than before Fianna Fáil came into power, although they would tell you that they had guarantees for everything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> An Act that was passed in this House has had the effect of reducing the supply of milk.  I have experience of that in a district where people kept a few cattle and used to supply their neighbours with milk.  They were put out of business when the Milk and Dairies Act was brought in and certain people were allowed monopolies. Deputy Allen asks where the cattle have gone.  Did they not export the heifers and cause a scarcity?  A few months ago, in reply to a question, the present Minister gave me the number of calves slaughtered in Cork.  It shows the outrages against nature which took place.</P>
    <P>In regard to farm workers' wages, how can a man in rural Ireland to-day live on £2 15s. a week, which is the wage in Wexford?  Why is there a higher rate in Dublin, resulting in the farm labourers going to County Dublin to get £3 or £3 5s. and probably better conditions?  We hear a lot about the flight from the land.  If you go to country centres even in winter time, you will ask what is to keep a man in the country.  Nothing.  No life; they have to go five or six miles to the pictures on Sunday.  The agricultural labourer is the slave and the next&mdash;the servant girl&mdash;is worse again.  There is no law made here for those people, who have to work day in and day out for a miserable 5/- or 6/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We should see that we vote in the right direction.  The farm buildings scheme has been played up here.  What did the last Government <Col N="493" /> do?  How many houses were built in the last five or six years under that scheme?  Then there is the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I know farmers who have applied for a grant to buy a horse or cow and are told the corporation regret they cannot give a grant.  The farmer sees nobody and is not told why he is turned down.  He believed his land and holding was good security for £40 or £50.  These are the people we want to help, as they are oppressed by high prices for seeds and have to endure bad harvests that leave these small farmers bankrupt.</P>
      <P>On the milk question, no one has told us the price at which the institutions are getting milk.  The price has been increased from the 1st July by the man passing down by my own home, but these people are putting milk into institutions at a much lower price than that which they are charging the public, and they are making money and bringing the milk in in jeeps.  Some people in my constituency will not till and have given out all the land by conacre and gone into cows, as they are making more money, although they supply only mental hospitals, county homes and other institutions in the area, and they are quite satisfied.  The whole cry here is for a better price for milk.  Who is to pay that but the poor people?  The extra halfpenny or penny goes on the poor.  There is more milk coming to the city to the ice cream vendors than would supply all Dublin. Deputy Allen spoke on this and brought down some of the Dublin people into the Gorey area and got that area extended, so that milk could come up to Dublin, and he is in the milk business himself.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy on the far side referred to the statements made by the present Minister, but forgot those made by their own Ministers and by my own colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who said, &ldquo;Thanks be to God, the British market is gone, and gone for ever.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would have got it, had I known the Deputy wanted it. That was his slogan.  A Deputy opposite spoke about sending cattle to New York.  They looked for alternative markets and put the cattle on the boat at the North Wall and shipped them to German and other ports.  Where was the market?  They went over themselves and could not get the concessions the present Minister got, namely the extra 5/-.  Why did they not do that and get the same price as the English farmer?  I happened to be in Kilmuckridge a couple of weeks ago, with a deputation from the technical schools, and we were shown a fowl house being erected for eighty birds.  That was carried out under the technical teachers and pupils, yet Deputy Allen says the scheme has been done away with, though it is going on up against his own home.  Of course, Deputy Allen and others do not like to admit the truth.  I have seen that scheme in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Coburn in saying that if we want to help the country and the farming community&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Administration failed after 16 years of a trial&mdash;we should give the new Minister our co-operation because that is going to be for the betterment of the country.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said last night that compulsory tillage was a war-time measure and that they were going to do away with it.  I say it is an insult to any farmer to be sending young men from the colleges as inspectors of their holdings.  The farmers are very sore about that.  Some of those inspectors come along and ask them what they have growing in this field and what they have growing in that field, but when the crop is above the ground they do not know whether it is barley or oats.  That is how the best farmers in Ireland, the County Wexford farmers, were treated.  They do more tillage than the farmers in any other part of the country, and yet that county was flooded with inspectors going around and annoying the farmers.  It was a God-send for the <Col N="495" /> people when the Minister said he would not send inspectors in on any farmer's land.  The County Wexford farmers never wanted inspectors, but we had to have them to make jobs for some members of the Fianna Fáil clubs.  We had the jobs and the jobbery.  The Macamore farmers and the Bridgetown farmers in the County Wexford are very proud that the Government was changed, and in particular that we are not to have compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>It was said from the opposite benches last evening that there were more farmers in their Party than were to be found on this side of the House.  Where are all the farmers in the Fianna Fáil Party now?  They will not come in and listen to the views of people on this side.  It is a shame and a scandal that there are only three there for this important Estimate.  After all the fury of the ex-Minister, we have only three members there now, and I do not know whether they are farmers or not.  I do not believe there is any farmer on the Fianna Fáil side listening to the debate.  What did those opposite do during the last 16 years?  They walked into the lobby, no matter whether a thing was right or wrong, and followed the leader&mdash;whether it was to put the farmer in the oil-hole, in the county home or in Mountjoy.  It did not matter, it was all right.  Now they are finding fault with the new Minister, who has been in office only six months. They are all afraid that he is going to act, and act quickly, and do something for the people.  The longer the Estimates are held up the longer will the old-age pensioners and the widows be without their increase.</P>

      <P>I will keep to the point.  We have to thank God that we have gone away from dictatorship and that the farmers, workers and the general public are now living in free air.  We had not that in this House, or in the country, over the last 16 years. I hope the Minister will do all he can to improve the condition of the workers whom I represent.  The workers got a lot of praise, but they got no pay from the Fianna Fáil Party for all they did during the emergency.  I hope the <Col N="497" /> Minister will compensate the farmers by giving them such prices for their produce as will enable them to pay their men well.  They could not do that while they were held in by the late Government.  When the people hear tell of the men who went over to meet the British to get a price for the farm produce of this country they should be overjoyed, because the whole world is vying for the British market.  We all realise, no matter what republican ideas we may have, that our nearest market and our best market is the British market.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very outspoken in the statement he made here on the opening of the debate on Friday.  He made no bones of what he was going to do and gave an assurance to the farmer of guaranteed prices for the next four or five years.  This is encouragement because the people know what they are going to get. During the previous 16 years they did not know.  The price was only a matter of one year and they did not know each year whether they were even going to get as much as last year.</P>
      <P>I think I will not delay the House any longer.  Some other Deputy may be anxious to say a few words and we are all anxious to hear the reply of the Minister.  Not alone this House, but the whole country, is waiting to hear the reply to this debate of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope, after hearing Deputy O'Leary, that this Government will be in office this time next year because he will then have to talk about something else besides the sins of Fianna Fáil, and I am quite sure that he will be dumb if that occasion arises.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Gorman state that the farmers are not in the miserable position that some Deputies, particularly of the Labour Party, represented them to be in. Nobody who knows the facts can deny that the farmers have been in a happy position since 1938 and not in the bondage which Deputy Beirne represented them to be in last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge any Deputy in any constituency where there is land for letting, <Col N="498" /> 11-months' land, land for conacre or land for grazing by head, to say that that land has been left idle.  There was competition for land in every place I know, in Leinster at any rate, and in a good part of the West.  There has been competition for conacre, for cattle taken in on the head system, for 11-months' land.  Prices have soared continuously since 1938.  The second point I want to make is that in 1938 the arrears of land annuities due to the Land Commission stood at well over £2,000,000, but it is much less than half that to-day.  The arrears of rates due to county councils during that period have successively decreased every year and we have 97, 98 or sometimes 99 per cent. warranted reduction in each county.  The bank deposits for rural areas, for the Joint Stock Banks up and down the country, have all increased because farmers had money to lay aside on deposit.  Any one of us who is familiar&mdash;as we have to be familiar&mdash;with the financial position of the farmers in our constituencies, knows that in the last ten years mortgages and debts have been wiped out. All of us, irrespective of the side of the House we are on, have engaged in negotiations with banks for the liquidation and reduction of these debts.  Farmers have been put on their feet again.  They have gone ahead and have not looked back.  Therefore, the miserere we have heard about the farmers is not justified and I am glad of the honesty of Deputy O'Gorman in facing this problem and stating that there was no justification for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in introducing this Estimate, on column 2590 of the Official Report of the Parliamentary Debates of 9th July, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am prepared to offer words of encouragement to those who live not only upon the land and have their living directly from the land, but to every other section of the community which depends on the farmers for its existence&mdash;to the doctors, to the lawyers, to the businessmen, to the trade unionists and the distributive workers and to everybody else whose means of livelihood would disappear overnight if the income of the farmers dried up&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> I resent that statement of the Minister. Society does not consist of farmers alone and the other sections of society are not drawing their living from the farmers.  If you take away the labourers, the mechanics, the railwaymen and the divers going down to make the harbours of the country, the farmer will be left high and dry and will go back to the primitive state of the caveman.  Each section has equal rights and each are as important to the community as the farmer.  They depend on the other sections and without them cannot carry on.  Therefore, to represent us all as a number of drones hanging out of the farming community is wrong.  All are interdependent and the well-being of all of us should be of equal concern to the State as that of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he will not let an inspector on to the farmer's land except by invitation.  Deputy Dr. Ryan dealt with that last night and I am not going to cover the whole ground again.  He was interrupted by my colleague, Deputy Fagan.  When Deputy Dr. Ryan referred to the Livestock Breeding Act, Deputy Fagan intervened, &ldquo;Will not the Guards go in?&rdquo; Is that not interference?  Is that not inspection?  What is the difference between a Guard and an inspector?  If a co-operative factory is inspected by law, if the workers in a co-operative factory are subject to laws, rules and regulations, I do not see why the farming community should be singled out to be put above everyone.  That is the kind of thing that brought about revolutions and gave rise to that terrible thing, the destruction of the Kulaks in Russia, over which I do not stand.  To make one section of the community above the law, to say: &ldquo;You have no rules or regulations; you obey no one; you are absolute; you are monarch of all you survey,&rdquo; is a dangerous doctrine and a wrong policy for the Minister for Agriculture to embark on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne talked about compulsion and compulsion.  I would like to point out to Deputy O'Leary that days were spent when they were in opposition in criticising the Vote for Agriculture <Col N="500" /> and what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If you were entitled when you were in opposition to spend days in criticising the then Minister for Agriculture, we are entitled to criticise, and we give constructive criticism.</P>
    <P>When the debate on agriculture and on compulsory tillage was on, we pointed out, and I, iu particular, pointed out that the neglect of one big farmer in County Meath would be of more consequence and bring more disaster on the nation than perhaps half the West of Donegal.  If a man with 1,000 acres&mdash;and that is not uncommon&mdash;of the highest-valued, richest land in Europe in County Meath did not do his tillage quota, the result would be hunger in the cities and hunger among the poor that Deputy O'Leary is so much concerned about.</P>

      <P>There should not be one set of rules for one farmer and another set for another&mdash;you never had to compel the small farmer, he always did his duty.  I was glad to hear Deputy Davin, who was not doing the &ldquo;yes man&rdquo; that Deputy O'Leary is doing to-day, speaking independently and agreeing with me on this particular subject.  Deputy Davin last night pointed out that in his constituency of Leix-Offaly these big landowners threw a barrel of wheat into a certain acreage of land and then came along and said that wheat could not be grown there, that the land did not lend itself to it.  We who were in the national movement in the Midlands know all the tricks and turns of these gentlemen.  I subscribe to the doctrine that the sooner the land is taken off these ranchers and given to those who will work it the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fagan spoke about farmers' butter and said that he could bring so many lbs. per week in his car and sell it at 3/- per lb. in Dublin.  I accept his word as to that, but that is only scratching the problem.  In Westmeath and Longford the farmers bring in their butter to the grocers' shops in the small towns in order to cash in on it. These are not dairying counties.  There <Col N="501" /> was very fine weather in May and the cows gave an abundance of milk. Therefore, butter was turned out by the stone in the farmers' houses and brought into the grocers' shops. Farmers were treated with contempt by a great number of shopkeepers.  In some cases they gave 1/6 a lb. for good butter and in other cases they refused to take it.  There was very much more butter involved in these cases than Deputy Fagan could bring up in his car.  It was wrong for the Minister to take the control off the price of farmers' butter.  These people are suffering from that now.  Any compensation they might get, if this policy continues, from dearer butter in the winter when butter is scarce and there is a black market in it will not compensate them for the loss they are suffering now.</P>
    <P>In an agricultural community when we introduce social services I know that if we are to have good government we ought to go &ldquo;canny.&rdquo;  I do not agree with those who talk about the people on the other side.  We have not the income here.  There is one thing I would advocate, however, and that is that the Minister should be more liberal in his expenditure in connection with the veterinary scheme operating under the county councils. There are too few veterinary surgeons in the counties.  The number should be trebled and each should be given a dispensary area.  In that way you would do away with the big mortality in cattle.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister state that lack of phosphates and other things in the soil was the cause of a number of deaths amongst live stock.  I submit that there is another cause.  The prevalence of liver fluke since 1946 has caused tremendous losses of live stock. I am a butcher by trade and I know something about this matter.  I do not think 15 per cent. of the livers of animals slaughtered in the last few years were free from fluke.  I had that confirmed by people in my trade all over the Midlands.  I had confirmation on it indirectly from the veterinary officers in Birkenhead.  I saw a practical demonstration of the effect of dealing with liver fluke in cattle, as it <Col N="502" /> is dealt with in sheep, for instance, in Deputy Donnellan's constituency, where they methodically dose sheep every autumn to prevent the incidence of liver fluke.  I think that that will also have to be done with cattle.  I saw two sets of cattle, one of which was put on middling pasture and given two doses over a period of a month for liver fluke.  The other set was put on good land.  There was a death amongst the cattle put on the good land.  The cattle put on the middling land that got a double dose of male fern came off it with sleek coats.  That proves that this problem which has become widespread since 1946 requires to be tackled.  The only way to do it is by an effective veterinary service.</P>
    <P>Then you have mastitis which has 101 complications.  I suppose there are 30 or 40 kinds of that disease.  According to the veterinary service that presents a very big problem.  The knowledge gained by the veterinary service will probably lead to the eradication of this very dangerous disease which is thinning out our cow population. Then you have timber tongue and other diseases.  A poor man cannot afford guineas for a veterinary surgeon every time an animal becomes affected. If you treble the veterinary service in every county it will pay in the long run.  The farmers will be able to pay the extra rates necessary to keep these veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne talked about extending rural electrification so that the farmers' sons could go and pulp turnips at night.  I think the Deputy is living in the 18th century.  Rural electrification is necessary to provide amenities in rural districts such as are provided for people in Boyle and Roscommon. No matter what may be the good intentions of any Government, the flight from the land will continue. One would think that was only taking place in Ireland.  It is taking place in every country in the world.  It is taking place in Australia, the most thinly populated continent in the world and they do not know how to tackle the problem.  Rural electrification will be of benefit to the people in the rural districts after a day's work when they want a little enjoyment.  You will not <Col N="503" /> encourage them to stay on the land by getting them to pulp extra turnips.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he does not mind being called the Minister for Grass.  In that connection I do not know whether a complete feed in silage or a mixture of silage and hay is the best, but experienced people tell me that a mixture of silage and hay is the best.  That might not seem contradictory to an intensive grass policy.  I want again to refer to the particular people I have dealt with under the heading of compulsory tillage.  The Minister need not think that these people will go out with their ploughs and sow shamrock seed for him.  They will graze the land as their fathers before them grazed the land, and they will keep large cattle.  I realise that intensive cultivation of grass should go hand-in-hand with the tillage policy. While farmers will go to grassland meetings and toast the Minister's health devil a bit of them will put a plough in the County Meath to grow shamrock seed for him.  I can assure him of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very hard on the butchers and he has said untrue things about them.  In the course of his remarks he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... let no self-seeking profiteering minority imagine for one moment that by bluff, slander or propaganda they will force this Government into inaction, when, for the purpose of lining their own pockets, they seek to strike at the live-stock industry and the farmers of this country, upon whom all sections of the community depend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the old cry again.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we may not like the task of challenging the racketeers, but those who choose the road of racketeering do so at their own peril....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the butchers have a case. I realise that this matter involves both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture. I say, however, that this organisation, which is a very old one in this country, is prepared to submit evidence of their accounts to the Minister&mdash;particularly in the last six months&mdash;which <Col N="504" /> will change his opinion of them and refute his statement about their being racketeers.  If other sections of the community such as lorry owners and others in particular posts are entitled to be received by the Minister, this respectable section of the community is also entitled to consideration.  These people should not be brushed aside by anybody in this House with what I call slanderous statements.  We are not against the farmer getting his good price.  We are not against the housewife paying an economic price for what she needs for the household but we do feel that this section of the community, which is as good as any other, is entitled to a fair profit just as the farmer is.</P>
    <P>We all sympathise with the farm labourers.  I want to say, however, to the members of the Labour Party who talk about them that the farm labourer has no broken time.  I would say to them, however, that when they are making a case for the farm labourer they should not exaggerate it.  He is paid his week's wages, whether he is resident on the farm or not, even if the six days of the week are wet.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from my own experience.  I do not know anything about County Wexford.  I know that there is a problem in that respect.  I have studied this matter and I would recommend to the House now, as I have done in the past, that, in the case of the farm labourer, the children's allowances should be doubled, and should apply to the second child.  I also recommended that the free milk and the free boots scheme should automatically operate to his benefit.  We could also make provision for special scholarships for his children. In that way we would meet the farmers' difficulty in regard to the position of the farm labourer.  Of course, there would require to be a clear definition of the term &ldquo;farm labourer.&rdquo; The problem of making the farm pay is one which will tax the Minister's ingenuity.  They have a pattern in the West and in the north-west of Ireland &mdash;in Connemara in the Glenties and in <Col N="505" /> County Meath.  To get a ruler and divide the areas into squares and dump a certain number of families in each square will not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Allen who said that the price of cattle could go too high.  I agree with that statement. Even if you have a four-year agreement &mdash;and that will be discussed on another occasion&mdash;some fine day there is going to be a slump unless there is another war, which God in His mercy forbid. I think that we should try and get a ceiling in prices in anticipation of that day, because no matter what agreements we may make or whatever else we may do the slump will come, the collapse in prices will come, and all the subsidies in the world will not save us. For that reason it is vital to prepare for it.  If we get a ceiling in dry stock then we must try to adjust the presentday price of milk with that end in view. When the Fianna Fáil Government was in power I often had occasion to marvel at their meticulous care in regard to the price of milk.</P>
      <P>It may be an overstatement on my part but I would chance saying that a pint of milk is worth the price of a pint of porter and that it is ten times more valuable.  The food value of milk and the food value of butter will have to be considered by somebody sometime, and very soon at that.  I say with all sincerity that, even at the risk of more taxes, the Minister should consider the question of a better price for milk to the creameries and milk to the consumers in the towns.  I believe that in towns in the midlands such as Mullingar, we will be up against the problem this winter of a proper and adequate milk supply.  The only way to face it is to give an increased price for milk. Therefore, in order that the milk may be available I advocate that the increased price for milk in the coming winter be fixed now.  Milk depôts have been mentioned but I understand they are available for infants only.  Whether it would be wise to legislate for them for the public is a question I have not examined and on which I have no information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to refer to agricultural education.  My own committee <Col N="506" /> of agriculture have been asking me for some time past to request the Minister to receive them because they want an agricultural college established in County Westmeath.  Last night Deputy Beirne advocated an agricultural college in each county.  I do not agree with my own committe of agriculture on that subject and I do not agree with Deputy Beirne because I do not see the need for a lot of such colleges.  We have enough of them already.  There is an agricultural college at Ballyhaise, near where I live, and we have an excellent agricultural college in County Meath also.  We want to get into the people's heads that these colleges are primarily for the training of farmers' sons to be the coming farmers instead of being instructors for the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I have had the idea in my mind for a long time and I have advocated it more than once that where there is a vocational school in a rural area it should acquire a farm of five or six acres.  Complementary to its size farming should be taught as a practical subject. There should be a cow, a sow, a pig and hens on that embryo farm so that practical instruction in these could be given to the student in the particular vocational schools.  They should be taught how to look after the animals and the poultry.  In that way, one would inculcate into them the practical husbandry of good farming. Sin an méid a bhfuil agam le rá.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Estimate was introduced on Friday I have listened to the different speakers taking part in the debate.  No matter what our views may be individually it is the practical situation of the farmers which is the important thing.  To my knowledge the farmers are satisfied with the new Minister for Agriculture. He has given new life to them and new hope.  He has brought about this agreement under which the farmers are guaranteed prices for four years. Instability of price has always been a major drawback as far as farmers are concerned.  Since hostilities ceased farmers did not know exactly where they stood or what the future was likely to hold for them.  The Minister has now given them a ray of hope. <Col N="507" /> They have four years in which to take advantage of the opportunities that offer.  Proof of their satisfaction is that they are prepared to co-operate fully with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The farming industry in this country may be divided roughly into three categories, covering three different areas.  In these areas farming is carried on according to the needs of the locality.  We have the dairying industry; we have the grassland area where cattle are fattened; and we have the small farmers under £15 valuation. I happen to come within the last category. The people on these small farms did excellent work during the emergency. They did that work without any compulsion.  They turned out the maximum produce they could turn out.  They grew oats, barley, wheat and potatoes. They turned out eggs, poultry and bacon.  Under this new agreement they now have a golden opportunity of continuing their good work in the expectation of a satisfactory return.</P>
      <P>Proof that the people are satisfied with the agreement as far as the cattle industry is concerned is the fact that young calves to-day have doubled their price.  That goes to show that the people are taking advantage of the future as far as the cattle industry is concerned.  Pigs, poultry and eggs are to a large extent supplied by the third category also&mdash;that is, the farmers with the low valuation.  The pig industry was the staple industry so far as these small farmers were concerned.  So, likewise, were poultry and eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig industry was neglected by the previous Minister for Agriculture and his predecessor.  Legislation is largely responsible for having the industry in the position in which it is to-day.  It was not merely emergency legislation which has brought about the present low production.  It was legislation prior to that that killed the pig industry in this country.  We had legislation in operation from 1935 to 1940 and the pig raisers did not know where they stood. They did not know what class of pig to sell or when to sell her.  A farmer would have his mind made up to have a pig of a suitable weight.  If he <Col N="508" /> brought that pig to the market and it did not reach a certain weight it would be unsaleable and he had to bring it home.  If the pig was over a certain specified weight for the factory and did not reach a certain grade, the farmer would get only a second-rate or third-rate price.</P>
    <P>There was another regulation, that if the pig did not turn out number one grade so far as bacon was concerned, the price given for her would be only second-rate or third-rate.  Then we had controls and quotas.  For a period of two or three years I remember the streets of my own and other small towns being flooded out with pigs.  We had buyers there, but there was no market for the pigs.  The factories were allowed to take only a certain quota, weekly, fortnightly or monthly. When the quota was filled the factory could take no more.  When the pigs were offered for sale there was no market for them.  They would be brought to the fairs and then brought home.  That condition of things was responsible for killing the pig industry. That is why we have a low pig population to-day.  That is why we are without bacon in practically every shop.  If the quota of bacon arrives on Thursday the shopkeeper will have it sold on Saturday night.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will be able to put into operation some plan that will bring back the pig industry.  I see his trouble.  He will not bring the industry back in two or three months. It is doubtful if he will bring it back inside 12 months, but by then he will have gone a long way to reach his goal. He will have to give some encouragement to the farmers to go in for breeding sows.  He should endeavour to adopt some scheme that will encourage the farmers to rear breeding sows.  The difficulty will be the price.  I am satisfied the price now in operation is reasonable at certain periods of the year.</P>
    <P>I submit there is no farmer who can breed pigs and rear them at the same cost over the full year.  The way to get back to pig production is by some method of a two-period price.  The farmer can raise pigs more cheaply <Col N="509" /> from October to March than from April to September.  From October to March he has the grain crops on his land&mdash; oats, barley and possibly rye.  He also has waste potatoes during this period and in the ordinary way he will purchase maize meal But when March comes and the seed is down he has not the same resources for feeding.  I suggest that whatever is the price over a certain period there should be a special price to meet the cost of production from April to September.  If you are to encourage the farmer to keep in pig production for the whole year you must give him a special price during this period.</P>
    <P>I will come now to the poultry population and the egg industry.  As to poultry and eggs, there is not a housewife in any part of the country, from what I can hear, who has not gone straight into it, and I have no doubt that inside six months the Minister will be quite satisfied with the results of his policy.  I believe that next November and December you will not have eggs rationed.  You will have sufficient to meet the needs of the people in the cities and towns this winter, and it is possible we shall have a surplus for export.  That is something that has not happened for the past five or six years.</P>

If it is any information for the Deputy, people were going with vans from the city into various places in the country prepared to pay any price for eggs; they paid a price for them much higher than the controlled price in the city. In my opinion the scheme adopted by the Minister, and now in operation, is working so well that you will not have that situation next winter.  You will have sufficient to meet the needs of the people and possibly you will have enough for export.  That is a big change, seeing that the Minister is only <Col N="510" /> three months in office.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>The Bill was handed in to the Dáil on the 13th May and on the following day I called on the Deputy at his own business premises.  I told him that the Bill had now gone in and that he was the seconder.  He said: &ldquo;Right, Martin, I am very thankful to you.&rdquo;  The Bill has been from the 19th May last on the Order Paper in this House and at least on two or three occasions I wrote to the Deputy because of various hopes I had of introducing the Bill at an early date, telling him that the Bill would probably be introduced on the Wednesday following and to be in his place.  I again left him a note in his business premises on Monday last telling him that I had now got a guarantee that the Bill would be introduced on Wednesday and asking him to be here in case it would require to be seconded.  The Deputy was here when that Bill got its First Reading.  The Deputy was in his place in this House, and he surely had an opportunity of saying anything he wished to say about it.  Even after that I sent a note to the Deputy asking him now that the Bill was through: &ldquo;Can we celebrate by backing your horse <i>Immaterial</i> tomorrow?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I suppose the horse was to be pulled, like the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the poultry population and egg production. I am satisfied that, with the method adopted by the Minister, he will have got over his difficulties in a very short time, and definitely by the end of this year.  With regard to the pig industry, it will take the Minister some time to bring the industry back to anything like the condition in which it was some <Col N="517" /> time prior to the emergency, and I believe that some sort of encouragement by way of a loan&mdash;I was going to say a free grant, but I confine it to a loan &mdash;should be given to farmers, because it will encourage farmers, and especially small farmers, to get back to the foundation of the industry, the keeping of a breeding sow.  It may involve anything from £8 to £10, but I suggest that there should be some scheme under which a farmer could borrow that sum and under which the Minister could see to it that the money was used for the purpose for which it was borrowed, for the purpose of keeping a breeding sow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or if a sow were provided on credit for the farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainty would be one of the ways, but I do not like it. There was a breeding sow subsidy scheme some years ago and it did not work successfully at all, because the terms were not at all suited to farmers. There were all kinds of regulations and orders, and the farmer did not know when he was going to get the sow; when he got her, he did not know how long he was to keep her; and when he had her for two or three years, he had to dispose of her, so that he did not know exactly where he was.  I should like to see some scheme whereby the farmer who is not in a position to put in a breeding sow, would be able to get a loan repayable in three or four years&mdash;perhaps four years would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Six litters of bonhams to pay a £10 loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be at least a year or a year and a half before he got any return.  By means of a loan the farmer who could not afford to put in a breeding sow would be encouraged to do so.  The loan would be repayable in four yearly premiums, starting from the year following the year in which he borrowed the money.  In that way, I believe it would be possible to bring back an industry which existed for years, without assistance from anybody and which was capably worked <Col N="518" /> by the small farmers.  The Minister is giving freedom to the farmers in the matter of different methods of working and I should like him at the first opportunity to restore the connection which originally existed between the farmers and the pig factories.</P>
      <P>If the farmers and the factories get working together as in pre-emergency days, I believe that the pigs will come back, and in a very short time, to the level at which they were five or ten years prior to that emergency.  The factories, the machinery and the workers are there.  The farmers are the suppliers, and there would be no necessity for the factory, if the farmer were not in pig production.  If we could achieve a position in which all the activities connected with pig production were left as between the factory and the farmer, I believe we could achieve success.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has taken under his Department this matter of field drainage.  Field drainage is very important and in practically every part of Ireland, even on the best land, field drainage schemes could be undertaken with advantage. I believe the Minister will make a great success of it, and, from what I can hear, he will have a job in coping with the numbers of applications he will get.  He will possibly find that in a very short time these applications will come in as the applications under the farm buildings scheme came in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers of this country know when their bread is buttered and they know when their bread is not buttered.  Every farmer knows where he stands as regards the future plan and the future price for his cattle, sheep, poultry, eggs, potatoes and everything he can grow on the land.  There is a guaranteed price for potatoes of £10 13s. 6d. a ton from October to February, and £11 8s. 6d. a ton after February.  That is a better price than the farmer got for potatoes for the last five or six years.  The guaranteed market for potatoes will help the farmer to produce and raise pigs.  If the farmer saw a danger of not having a market for potatoes, he might go out of potato growing.  He now has a market for potatoes in bulk and if he does not wish to take advantage of that, he can go into pig production. Therefore, the guaranteed market for the potato crop is one of the greatest things the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>I want to join with other Deputies from this side of the House in congratulating the Minister on the terms of his agreement and on the plan.  He has given new hope to the farmer and, as far as I can see, every farmer will make up his mind as to what he will do and the Minister can rest assured that they are going to take full advantage of the schemes he has put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has changed his mind so often in connection with matters affecting agricultural policy that it is difficult to know to what he is going to stick.  The last speaker suggested that the arrival of the Minister in his present Department meant new life and hope for the farmers.  It certainly means new life and hope for the ranchers because, if there is one thing that is consistent in an otherwise inconsistent Minister it is his policy to make this country a heaven for ranchers and to reverse the whole economy of this State so that we will be changed from our former position into a cattle ranch for the production of cattle for the British market at the British price.  That is not only my view of the Minister's policy.  It appears to me that all his life, or at <Col N="521" /> least as long as he has been in this House, the Minister has persistently and continually thrown slurs at and discouraged tillage in this country.</P>
      <P>He suggested to Deputy Allen to-day that he did not make the remarks he was alleged to have made about people who use horses on their land for the purpose of tillage, but it is on the record of this House, on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture in 1944, that he poured scorn on the holding of ploughing matches throughout the country and he entertained us by painting a picture of, as he said, country yokels plodding after horses at ploughing matches to the applause of the former Minister for Agriculture, and he suggested&mdash;it is on the record of this House&mdash;that you might just as well have a competition between nail makers in this country in producing hand-made nails as to have ploughing competitions.  I do not know how that could be interpreted other than as a suggestion that it was absurd for the farmers of our country to till or to have horses, that it was absurd to endeavour to encourage the healthy competition that we had throughout the ploughing matches that were held over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With horses.  The Minister evidently sneers at horses, which is a very strange view in a man who should be familiar with the West of Ireland.  Does he imagine that we can have ten-ton tractors driving across the bogs of Mayo or Roscommon or Galway or any of the western counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  Suitable tractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's view.  I do not mind the Minister's flights of imagination about ploughing matches, but what I do mind is the fact that he has always consistently opposed any tillage policy in this country and every public utterance of his, even since he became Minister, has gone further in that direction.  He has resurrected his old slogans about <Col N="522" /> its being a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to grow wheat and a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to set beet and he has set out on this campaign of turning this country into a ranch to supply cattle to Britain, culminating in the recent trade agreement that has got a certain amount of publicity recently.  Evidently outside this country the present Minister for Agriculture is also regarded as a rancher's advocate and presumably it is the policy both of the Minister and of the Government of which he is a member.</P>
      <P>A publication that is generally rather impartial for a British newspaper gives an account of the Minister's visit to the other side in connection with the recent trade agreement.  In the issue of <i>News Review</i> for June 24th they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irishmen are basically either farmers or ranchers, tillers or cattleraisers, and as such are interested in raising wheat and farm produce for home consumption or beef and dairy produce for export.  The farmers are smallholders, not particular about a connection with Britain, but the ranchers have great tracts of grazing land and look on Britain as a customer with whom they should have the closest ties.</P>
      <P>Under 15 years of Eamon de Valera's rule, the farmers were on top.  Wheat, beet and potatoes were the basis of Éire's agricultural economy, and the cattle-ranchers had lean years.  But with John Costello as Prime Minister, and James Matthew Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, the ranchers are coming back into their own.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They proceeded to say that last week an Irish delegation arrived in London on behalf of the ranchers of this country.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If Mr. Dillon can come to terms with Britain, increased imports of eggs, bacon and beef should lead to the progressive raising of the ration-level, the doubling of the meat ration within two years, and its abolition by 1953.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>And outside people take the view that we are now compelled to take, that the Minister's sole concern is with the ranchers of this country. Wheat growing and beet growing, according to the Minister, as a policy are a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and we must get back by relying solely on the amount of cattle we will export to Britain, and <Col N="524" /> we are tied now under this trade agreement hand and foot to give our produce to that one market.  I wonder does the Minister realise the position that he has walked the country into on this agreement.  I do not want to go into it in detail at this stage, but there was never a time when a Minister for Agriculture went to make a bargain on the other side and had a greater opportunity of ensuring the agricultural future of this country, by insisting that the type of economy that suits us be carried out by them.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about an unlimited market.  Of course, there is, through the British people being half starved and having been so for some time.  They are prepared to take our eggs, beef, butter and bacon, and anything else we can give them to raise their ration. It is equally true that the same is the position all across Europe.  The Minister is well aware that Europe was denuded of cattle during the war years. This is the time when the Minister&mdash; if he had this idea in mind that we should kill as many of our own cattle as we possibly could&mdash;should have insisted on getting a greater quota of canned meat into the British market.</P>

He had an opportunity, now that they want our stuff, and are crying out for it, of endeavouring to break that Birkenhead ring that, irrespective of what Government is in office, will try to insist on our live stock going out on the hoof.  He had an opportunity of getting them to this position of increasing our volume of exports of meat in tins and thereby creating employment here and securing the various offals <Col N="525" /> that would be useful for other industries as well as the hides that would give further employment.</P>

They were never in so much need of our produce as they are at present.

      <P>The Minister is well aware that his own agreement sets out the figure of 10,000 tons that we are <Col N="526" /> to sell them.  That is the amount we are entitled to give them.  The Minister knows that the amount of tin we will get to produce the tins to send out that 10,000 tons comes from there. The Minister knows we are rationed in that way, that unless we get the tins we cannot send out the canned meat. The Minister need not try to hoodwink the House by suggesting that we have an unlimited market for canned meat. It is in the Minister's agreement, as far as the announcements in the Press go, that 10,000 tons is the quota we have there.  The Minister, when replying, will presumably get an opportunity to explain that away, if he can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, I am entitled to assert that it has always been the position, as far as the relationships between this country or any other country and Britain are concerned, that the British always bought in the cheapest market available to them. They are buying from us now, not because they are &ldquo;an old and valued customer&rdquo;, as the Minister would like to describe them, but because they can get the stuff here.  That is the only reason.  It is not for any love of us that the British are taking our stuff, whatever love may be manifested on the Minister's behalf in presenting our stuff to Britain cheaper than he is prepared to give it anywhere else.  I never heard of a countryman going to a fair and proclaiming to the world that he was prepared to sell his cow to the lowest bidder and not to the highest bidder.  The Minister, before going across, thought fit to do that. He has such a great regard for the people across the water that he would prefer to sell the stuff more cheaply to them than he would to any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day will come when the country will seriously regret the Minister's view.  It is true that, for the next four years, we can anticipate world shortages for the articles we are able to produce and export as agricultural produce, but immediately that the British can get stuff cheaper elsewhere they will do with us the same as they always did.  We will have either to sell our surplus produce to them at depressed prices or they will not take anything from us.  According to the Minister and the policy he is adopting <Col N="528" /> and pursuing, we will now be committed to changing our whole economy back again into that one single channel.  That would leave us solely dependent on the whim of any British Minister for Agriculture.  It would put us back in the position that, immediately, for instance, the Dutch were able to produce cheaper eggs our prices would be depressed as they always have been.  I do not intend to go into egg prices&mdash;that question was discussed by a number of other Deputies&mdash; except to say this, that nobody should imagine that on this question of poultry we are the only people going in for intensive egg production.  The scheme that is being fostered by the Minister in connection with poultry and egg production in the country comes direct from the Dutch, and it is correct, I think, to say that the British are financing the Dutch to a larger extent than they are financing this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not blame me for that.  Deputy Smith made that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind who made it.  I would ask the Minister to try and contain himself until I have finished.  What I was saying was that the same poultry and egg scheme is being fostered by the British in those other countries, and that immediately they can get cheaper eggs and a sufficient quantity of them from those other countries they will take them. Immediately that position arises, irrespective of our production here, the British will stop buying our eggs if they find they are dearer than the eggs they can get from other countries. I want to point out to the House the great danger there is of committing the country to a long-term policy of that kind.  It would put us back into the position in which we would have to rely solely on one buyer and that buyer could inflate or deflate prices at his whim as it suited his book to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of dairy cows has been dealt with at some length by other speakers.  I want to say that dairy herds, particularly in the vicinity of country towns, are disappearing.  The question of milk supplies to country towns is becoming a headache for the <Col N="529" /> people who live in them.  I think one of the great difficulties is that of getting agricultural labour.  I am not dealing now so much with the creamery areas because milk production in those areas is made easy for the producers.  They leave their milk in a churn at the gate and it is collected from them by the creamery. That type of man can produce when it suits him.  The cows give a good supply of milk during the summer season when they are being grass fed. At the approach of winter he can sell off his surplus cows and even if he does it will not interfere very much with the kind of economy he practises.</P>
    <P>The ordinary dairy farmer who is supplying milk to the country towns cannot do that.  He has to maintain his customers the whole year round. No matter what it may cost him, he has to keep up his supply during the winter months.  That may involve him in great loss, because the price that he is getting for his milk during the winter period may not be sufficient to cover his outgoings.  It is also true to say that that type of man has to employ agricultural workers to milk his cows and to keep them the whole year round.  He has to pay them well because the conditions under which they work are altogether different from those that prevail in the creamery areas.  The men have to be out at 6 o'clock in the morning to milk the cows so that they may be able to leave on their delivery rounds at 8 o'clock.</P>
    <P>There is another big difficulty which this type of milk producer is faced with.  If his cows go dry during the winter months, when prices are at their maximum, he has to replace them by fresh milkers, irrespective of price, because if he fails to do so he is going to lose his customers.  Therefore, during the months of November, December and January, when milch cows fetch the highest price, this man has to buy them irrespective of what the price may be.  All these things contribute to increase his costings. The result of all that has been that it is steadily but surely driving those people out of milk production.  That <Col N="530" /> position is quite apparent in various country towns, and from what I have heard, the situation is becoming more or less universal.</P>
    <P>I think that situation is dangerous and that it is a bad sign for agriculture as a whole, because it is unnecessary for me to stress how much the dairy farmer is the keystone in the agricultural fabric of the State.  A case has been made for increasing the price to the dairy farmers who sell their milk to the creameries.  I think that is a case that should be listened to.  As I have said, I do not propose to deal with the creamery side of this question, but I do say that a very good case can be made for the man who is supplying milk to country towns because his costings are certainly far more, and his difficulties far greater, than those of the ordinary dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that farming as a whole is an expert job.  I am one of those who believe that, if possible, we should have more agricultural colleges than we have.  We should have some method whereby the farmer's son who intends to remain on the land should be technically trained and fitted for that calling.  I think it is agreed by most observers that what is mainly responsible for the success of our competitors from Holland and Denmark is that 90 per cent. of their young people who attend agricultural schools or colleges go back to the land.  I do not know how far it would be possible, in the case of our rural schools, to give the curriculum not only an agricultural bias, but to arrange for the holding of regular courses in each parish each year so as to keep the young men, who intend to make a living from agriculture on their fathers' holdings, abreast of the different developments in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not so much concerned with the larger agricultural colleges, because, invariably the people who attend them and who, ultimately, take a degree in agriculture, do not intend to go back to the land.  They intend to make their livelihood either as teachers or in some other job away from the land.  I think the Minister should direct his <Col N="531" /> attention to the provision of educational facilities in agriculture for our young people who intend to live on the land and to make farming their vocation in life.  These are the people that I am principally interested in.  I do not know how far it may be possible for the Minister to provide for them the facilities which I suggest.</P>
    <P>I notice that recently the Minister's Department sent out a circular in connection with the propagation of grass seeds.  I think that is an idea that could only have originated in the mind of the present Minister for Agriculture. We are solemnly asked in the County Mayo to produce these experimental grass seeds on the mental hospital farm tended by the lunatics resident in the mental hospital, and I presume that the other counties throughout the country got the same request.  The Minister should be aware that the lands attached to mental institutions throughout the country are made use of by the authorities from the point of view of occupational therapy for the patients and the crops produced on these lands are produced by patients who may one day work on them and pull them up the next unless they are carefully watched.</P>
    <P>Of all the people to ask to propagate grass seeds, to ask unfortunate mental patients is the most extraordinary thing that I or anybody else has ever heard.  We had this request from the Minister.  Whether he has himself gone off the rails on this question of grass or not I do not know, but it is an extraordinary thing to ask us to carry out grass experiments in a mental hospital.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has finished jeering at people of unsound mind we might pass to another topic. This is not a very edifying spectacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not the best judge of what is or is not an edifying spectacle.  I have listened to him for a long period and if he would forget for a moment that he is James Dillon and act as Minister for Agriculture we could get on more peacefully in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> One matter I would like to dwell on briefly is the provision of veterinary services, particularly in congested areas.  I would like to point out to this House that the practice and economy of our country has mostly developed on the provision of stores for farmers up the country by the smallholders of the congested districts. It is true that these people may not be able economically to avail of veterinary assistance when they require it, but it is equally true that not alone thousands but millions of pounds are lost through disease in our live-stock industry.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should make a start by providing a veterinary service free in the congested areas to ensure that the people would produce good stores, because stores are what they specialise in as far as cattle are concerned and it would combat some of the diseases that we get in these areas.  Such a scheme would, I think, pay for itself in a short time and it would be money well spent.  I have stated in this House on another Estimate that something could perhaps be done by this Minister for the free tuberculin testing of dairy cattle.  Until the Minister does that and gives an enhanced price for cows reported to be suffering from tuberculosis in order to get them destroyed, he will not achieve what we all want to achieve, the stoppage of the spread of bovine tuberculosis in our dairy herds.</P>
    <P>I want to nail one of the falsehoods which was spread widely by the Minister when he was an opposition Deputy in connection with the bacon industry.  I listened very long and very patiently to the Minister over a number of years stating from these benches that the Fianna Fáil Government had killed the bacon industry.  A very short time before the Minister came into office we heard him holding forth in this House and outside it, telling all and sundry how the then Government had destroyed the pig and bacon industry. The Minister, of course, knew at that time that it was untrue, and the Minister was not a fortnight in office when I listened to him state at a consultative meeting of the Agricultural Advisory Body that it was solely a <Col N="533" /> question of feeding stuffs.  The Minister was well aware of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has recently become a director of a bacon company. Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he wanted to put over for his own political purposes that the cause was something that should be attributed to the Government of the day.  Now, at all events, the Minister admits that it is a question of feeding stuffs and of cheap feeding stuffs.  We all know that you can get the pig population back and increase production if you can get feeding stuffs and more and cheaper maize than we got pre-war.  The number of pigs will increase in proportion to the price and availability of the maize that the Minister will be able to get.  I do not know if he has stated so far the amount of maize he will be able to get and the prices at which it will be available, but it is by all these factors that an increased pig population can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The Minister, with a great blare of publicity, proceeded to suggest to all and sundry that he would put rashers in the shops and make them available for every housewife in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are very disappointing from the Minister's point of view.  The number of pigs that came into the factories in the week ending 5th July, 1947, was 4,089 and in the week ending the 3rd of July of this year the number of 3,574, practically 500 down on last year.  If we take the 27 weeks ended 3rd July, 1948, the number of pigs delivered to the factories in that period, roughly six months, was 102,185 and the number in the period ending 5th July, 1947, 122,008.  Comparing the two sixmonth periods, we find that the number of pigs delivered to the factories is 20,000 down on last year's number.</P>

The pigs delivered to the factories these last six months would be the result of the sow services of the last six months of 1947.  We understood from the Minister with all his thunder and fury that he would produce the bacon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly has not produced the bacon so far.  The Minister, of course, knew that he will not get bacon in this country until feeding stuffs are available and at a cheap rate.  With all the waving of his flags about this matter has he set about endeavouring to procure feeding stuffs?  I think that would probably go a long way to make a better attempt at solving the difficulties of the bacon shortage.  The Minister further stated that the curers had thousands of tons of bacon in cold store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most extraordinary statement we ever heard from any Minister, because the Minister knew from his own officials the amount of bacon in cold store.  There could not be one ounce of bacon in cold store without the Pigs and Bacon Commission knowing about it.  The commission undoubtedly had to inform the Minister and he had these figures available to him.  But, knowing that any bacon in cold store was known to be there officially&mdash;I should say that the small quantity of bacon in cold store was only there for the gammon and shoulder trade and the Minister was well aware of that&mdash; he tried deliberately to create the impression <Col N="535" /> that the bacon curers had an enormous quantity of bacon hidden away in cold store in anticipation of some removal of controls.  Everybody knows that the price that had to be paid for pigs was exorbitant and that the curers were running their business uneconomically.  Everybody knows that the pigs were so scarce we had this competition for them between the different curers.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that the bacon curers had to pay such high prices and were turning these pigs into bacon and getting shut of them as fast as they could, they could not meet the huge demand for bacon throughout the country. If, for some extraordinary reason known only to the Minister, bacon curers had hidden away thousands of tons of bacon, where is that bacon now?  Why did not the Minister get these thousands of tons of bacon, if they were there, on the shop counters?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that since the Minister started his ramp bacon is scarcer than ever before in the shops? The Minister deliberately tried to create the impression that by some underhand method bacon was hidden away in some illegal manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should know that there was no bacon hidden away illegally, because the Pigs and Bacon Commission were aware of what was in cold store.  Of course it was good publicity for the Minister while it lasted.  The Minister purports to be a lover of Great Britain, and, more particularly, to have a soft spot for the axe.  He should ponder on the maxim that deeds speak louder than words. When he gets the bacon into the shops it will be time enough for him to start waving the applause flags and get encomiums from the newspapers which are supporting him.  I do not know how far the Minister is responsible for the prices fixed for the butchers.  Possibly the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an equal responsibility, if not the greater responsibility, for that.  I do not want to dwell upon it except to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is an oversight on somebody's part.  That is one of the grievances of the butchers whom the Minister referred to in this House as racketeers. Like every other section of the community, the butchers are entitled to have their side of the case heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very good at making bets.  I ask him to wait and see.  He will find that when <Col N="537" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along with his Estimate I shall deal with the question of the butchers.  I want to make a suggestion in connection with a sum of money held up by the Pigs and Bacon Commission for some time.  I refer to the Stabilisation Fund, which was paid in by the curers to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  It is still held by that commission and I understand nobody can get it.  So far as I remember, it was in the region of £20,000 and, with the accumulation of interest, it should now be in the region of £34,000 or £35,000.  If the Minister is going to accept the suggestion of some Deputies as to the provision of a sow scheme to be administered by the committees of agriculture, there is a sum of money which could well be devoted to that purpose.  It was paid in for the purpose of price stabilisation, but I am sure the curers would be agreeable to having it ploughed back into the industry.  As it could not be used now for the purpose for which it was originally subscribed, if we go according to the doctrine <i>cy pres,</i> it could be used for a similar purpose, and the best purpose I can suggest for its use would be some scheme administered by the county committees of agriculture to be financed out of this particular fund.</P>
      <P>If we suggest any scheme like that to the Minister, or to any Minister of the present Government, we come up against the economy axe.  The Minister is not prepared to find money to finance them.  I listened to a number of Deputies complaining about the holding up of different schemes for which the Minister is responsible.  They need not have wasted their time referring to these schemes because the reason for the hold up is quite apparent.  They have only to turn to a statement made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech when he stated, as reported in column 1040 of the Official Report of 4th May:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am also taking account of further reductions in expenditure totalling £1,122,000, which I am closely pursuing and confidently expect to capture, but of which it would be premature to give particulars <Col N="538" /> until they are safely in the net.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That £1,122,000 has been kept in the background.  But, if any Deputies want to know the reason why the schemes that were in operation under the former Minister for Agriculture are being held up, such as the poultry houses scheme, the farm improvements scheme, etc., I suggest to them to consider these sinister words of the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Agriculture is carrying out his part of the Coalition bargain.  He is going to do his own share in finding this £1,122,000 for the Minister for Finance.  That is the explanation in connection with this Estimate and every other Estimate for the dilly-dallying, for the putting off, for the sabotaging of these schemes for which our farmers are crying out.</P>
    <P>Let those people sitting on the benches opposite who talk about continuing self-sufficiency examine their consciences when they come to vote with the present Minister for Agriculture on this Vote when it is referred back.  Let them examine the condition which existed in this country when Fianna Fáil were in office and consider the outlook of the Fine Gael Party which is expressed by their old henchman, Deputy James Dillon, who now occupies the position of Minister for Agriculture.  They have an opportunity now of undoing the harm that has been done.  They have their opportunity on the Vote for this Estimate to show that they do not want to turn this country into a cattle ranch for Britain.  If they do not accept it the responsibility will be on their shoulders and they will not get out of it by shedding crocodile tears down the country when they find we are back again, lock, stock and barrel, inside the four walls of British economy to produce all our exports for the one market at whatever price the British choose to pay us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the four days this Estimate has been under discussion criticisms, proposals and suggestions have been directed from every angle of the House for the purpose of improving agriculture in this country. Fortified by all that information the Minister will, no doubt, have a very <Col N="539" /> busy time during the coming year coordinating them.  I should like to reiterate some of the points which have already been made by other Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy B. Maguire mentioned that the Department of Agriculture has not been helpful to the poorer areas in the country.  It can be said with equal truth that it has not been helpful in areas where the land is richer.  For that reason I welcome the optimism of the Minister in that he feels competent to depart from compulsory co-operation on the part of the farmers.  I think that, with certain protective methods, that voluntary effort will be justified.  To make agriculture really successful it must be made popular and there is no doubt that it is not as popular as it ought to be.  Deputy Kyne, in his valuable contribution to the debate this morning, referred to the popularising of agriculture.  The workers in the agricultural industry must be made more prosperous and more contented.  They should be enabled to secure a decent livelihood in the country rather than have their eyes on the cities and towns.  That can be achieved by giving them better conditions of employment and reasonable remuneration.  The farmer must be prosperous and the agricultural labourer must be prosperous.  If that is done, agriculture will be prosperous and popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After so many years of necessary compulsion as a result of the emergency farmers are now being allowed to utilise their land in whatever way they think it is most suitable to utilise it.  Compulsion was understandable during the emergency period, but in normal times it would be an uneconomic and an unsound policy.  The farmers will now have an opportunity of going back to the proper utilisation of their land. Surely a man who was born on a holding, which was worked by his father before him, knows the best use to which it can be put.  The patriotism of the farmers is beyond all doubt.  Canon Sheehan said that the farmers' patriotism did not extend beyond the boundary wall, but conditions were different then, and during the emergency tributes were paid from all sides to the spirit <Col N="540" /> of co-operation of the farmers.  Patriotism and not compulsion was the mainspring of their magnificent co-operation.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the time when economic prices will be paid for the various types of agricultural produce. I look forward to the time when the man who is now producing wheat will be enabled to return to the production of milk.  I believe they will appreciate that.  I think, however, that some steps should be taken to prevent a recurrence of what happened before ever the emergency took place.  I refer to the large landowners who did not even till sufficient for their own requirements. I had the sad experience of seeing in the City of Limerick owners of the richest land buying agricultural produce in competition with city workers and traders.  That is the other extreme. I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that the man who has land will shoulder his responsibilities in that connection. I believe that farmers, after years of compulsory tillage, will shoulder their responsibilities without compulsion and in that way the dreadful fear that was expressed in this House yesterday will not materialise. There will be no necessity, either, for the inspector to pay visits as frequently as heretofore if the farmers get down to their jobs and they will do so if they are guaranteed a remunerative price for their produce.</P>
    <P>I was amazed by the statement made by Deputy Moran in regard to the illegal curing of bacon.  He asked the Minister if he really believed, as he was asking the public to believe, that illegal practices were taking place in regard to the curing of bacon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing how innocent we can be when we want to. Deputy Moran's mind must have been in Mars or somewhere else when he asked that question.  Everybody in the country knows that not alone has the pig population decreased but that many of the pigs that should be available never reach the bacon factories. I know for a fact that at a particular fair 60 per cent. of the pigs disappeared&mdash;the <Col N="541" /> other 40 per cent. reached the curers.  Where the 60 per cent. disappeared to remains to be seen.  The carcases of the 40 per cent. were inspected by inspectors to ensure that they were free from tuberculosis and any other infection.  The 60 per cent. were killed unseen and there is no doubt that they were able to command any price.  Deputy Moran says that the Minister is wrong in suggesting that there is any such thing as illegal curing of bacon.  The few prosecutions that give the lie to that are infinitesimal in comparison to the extent of the racket which is going on not alone in Dublin but throughout the length and breadth of the country. I want to advert to a particular point of local interest.  In a statement made by the Minister recently, he indicated his intention of dispersing in the near future some of the holdings and assets of the Dairy Disposal Company to certain co-operative creamery institutions. I have no quarrel with that.  I think the Minister is merely reverting to the original intention for which the board was set up to put certain creameries on an economic basis and hand them back to the farmers to work as a going concern.  In the absence of a more detailed statement of his intentions, a certain amount of anxiety and alarm has been created in the minds of the employees of a very considerable industry in Limerick, the condensed milk company and toffee factory.  The employees are a bit scared as to whether they are going to be dispersed in common with the other interests of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy not one single one of them need be in the slightest degree apprehensive about his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. This is a very old industry and one of the biggest in the City of Limerick. When it first came into being, it was operated both as a dairying concern and condensed milk.  Now it is only dealing with condensed milk and it is dependent for its supply on Tipperary and Knocklong and Drumree.  It is a co-ordinated unit and it is essential that the industry should be kept alive <Col N="542" /> for the benefit of Limerick.  I am glad to have the Minister's assurances in that respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Grady closed his speech to-day by a quotation from, I think, Stewart Mills to the effect that &ldquo;every country gets the Government it deserves.&rdquo;  He piously asked, &ldquo;What has this country done to deserve its present Government?&rdquo;  I can only suggest that God and the people, having recognised the fact that we had endured 16 years of Fianna Fáil, thought the country richly deserved this, or even a better, Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a sense of confidence in rising to speak on this Estimate, because, as most people in the country know, in spite of the statements made by members of the inter-Party Government that the last Government was thrown out by the farmers of the country, a very brief study of the figures at the election will reveal that, however we suffered defeat by a very small margin, it was not in the farming areas.  It is quite evident that we have a natural right to ask the Minister to pursue what we believe to be the best aspects of Fianna Fáil policy because, as I have said, the farmers indicated in no slight degree their generous support of that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister for Agriculture has a better opportunity of enabling production to be increased than any Minister for Agriculture in the history of this country.  For the first time he will have more normal conditions in which to improve production than have ever been the case before.  We went through the fight for independence followed by the civil war. No Minister for Agriculture, Republican or Free State, could have been expected to launch a large-scale scheme of agricultural development at that time.  No sooner were these events terminated, than agricultural prices the world over began to fall and, whatever the shortcomings of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were, it would have required more than the courage they showed to start a large-scale development of agriculture at a time when prices were falling year by <Col N="543" /> year.  In the middle of that depression there began the economic war and the permanent and long-term policy of the Fianna Fáil Government was to a considerable degree twisted by necessity owing to the fact that the economic war had to be fought and the economic war had to be won.  Many items of that policy were either not put sufficiently into operation or had to be modified to suit the circumstances of the time.  No sooner was the economic war over than the second world war began and brought with it shortages of machinery, materials and fertilisers. Now if the Russians behave themselves, the Minister for Agriculture has no political war to fight, no world war to fight, and he anticipates an increase in supplies of agricultural machinery. He anticipates greater supplies of fertilisers arising from the resumption of more normal trade conditions between this and other countries.  There is no major political dispute in this country in which the farmers have to take the front line trenches, as they did for so many years.  I think that the Minister will honestly admit that he has a chance given to no other Minister to bring about an increase in agricultural production. He will not mind my suggesting that his modesty in prophesying a great increase in agricultural production in so far as he might be responsible for it is not noteworthy.  The Minister is prone to make ebullient statements, and certainly sometimes we find it difficult to understand his policy when outlined at after-dinner speeches and when given to the House in connection with his Estimate.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan that, bearing in mind we have inadequate information, the Minister for Agriculture in many ways is following Fianna Fáil policy and expanding Fianna Fáil policy.  We doubt his views about tillage and about the future of the dairying industry, because he has not made them sufficiently clear.  But it is quite evident that he has adopted the vast majority of the plans we had in operation when the Government fell.  We ask the Minister to relate his statement on the close of this Estimate to some of the wilder observations he made in the <Col N="544" /> course of a number of public functions. I failed to understand them.  To give an example, the Minister for Agriculture showed a contempt for the horse in one of his after-dinner speeches as a means of transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of traction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the occasion of one association dinner while, at the same time, he indicated that farming to some considerable degree was to be mechanised.  I think he made an extreme statement.  Granted there must be a great deal of mechanisation of farming, I think at the same time he was going beyond reason in what he said in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>I have noted one thing.  Once again we find that all the new Clann na Poblachta policy is to be put in abeyance. I listened with eagerness to hear whether any of the high-sounding and grandiose promises made by that Party were going to be implemented by the Minister.  I find that that Party in return for some nebulous concession &mdash;I know now what it is&mdash;have sacrificed every single one of their special policies with which they so successfully bribed the farming electorate.  We did not hear of the £130,000,000 free of interest to the farmers; we did not hear of the vast supply of absolutely free artificial manures.  We waited, in vain, to hear the Minister recommend that farms in this country be not greater than 50 acres and that all holdings in excess of 50 acres be divided up among the population.  We find that the Minister is not faced with the problem of reducing the cost of living by 30 per cent. by means of subsidies on agricultural produce.  We find that he is not faced with the impossible task of raising agricultural prices, according to Clann na Poblachta standards, and, at the same time, seeing the food produced in this country sold at a 30 per cent. discount on the market by means of subsidies which at current prices would cost no less than £50,000,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And so we find that, once again, a great deal more of this strange new policy is put in abeyance, and, listening to the Minister, it seems to me as though it is more or less permanently in abeyance.  I heard Deputy <Col N="545" /> McQuillan make a foolish apologia for the new Party.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are waiting and watching the new Minister, and if he can succeed in arresting the flight from the land, we will be prepared to abide by his decisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the flight from the land continues, then we may anticipate a resumption of our freedom in order that our special policies can be put into operation. It is true that Party succeeded in gaining very few seats in the country.  Maybe it was that the farmers did not believe what they were told and did not believe the promises would be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We have also noted in this debate a refreshing absence of comment on the way of life in New Zealand. Apparently members of the new Party and of the Labour Party have discovered, since the election, that to compare agricultural conditions in an under-populated country, where the grass in winter is almost as green as in summer and where 1,700,000 people occupy a land four times the size of ours, is neither judicious nor sensible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what he now believes to be the proper policy in regard to sugar-beet growing. We heard much condemnation from him in the past and I should like to ask him whether he favours beet as the future long-term policy, particularly in regard to the necessity of maintaining security measures.  As has been indicated in previous Estimates, the Government have done little to prepare this country for a possible war.  The present inter-Party Government are probably the only Government that are not taking measures to protect our interests should the tragedy of a war be our lot.  Does the Minister regard the preservation of the beet factories, even if he does not believe in growing beet, as wise from the standpoint of security if not from the standpoint of bringing an income to the farmer?</P>
    <P>He gave facts in regard to agricultural production, but in order to gain a political point he did not go far enough in describing agricultural production in this country over the past 25 years.  The volume of agricultural production and the population of our <Col N="546" /> live stock have been virtually stagnant since 1912.  The percentage of alteration in the density of live stock or in the volume of production has not been notable.  Whether prices have collapsed or increased the figures have remained virtually the same.  Even during the economic war, when the farmers suffered severely, they suffered from low prices but at the same time it can be noted that the actual volume of their production remained very stable. The character of production changed in regard to certain classes.  There was an increase of tillage of about 5 per cent.  Although production suffered modification and there were a number of other adverse repercussions, the actual volume of production did not vary very considerably.  I do not know whether the Minister mentioned that during the war the total of our live stock actually increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with our sheep population, has the Minister noted the change in other countries and does he consider that Fianna Fáil is responsible for the decline in the production of sheep?  Does he consider that the inevitable compulsory tillage, with the difficulties affecting sheep arising from it, contributed in not a large measure to the reduction of the sheep population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his policy. A very large amount of it is Fianna Fáil.  In connection with some other items we still await the Minister's answer and we also await his ultimate beliefs.  We presume the Minister will continue to protect the home market from imported food where it can be produced here.  That policy brought the Irish farmer a market worth many millions.  We presume the Minister will welcome the maintenance of relief of agricultural rates which totals no less than £3,000,000 this year, and is a very considerable contribution in <Col N="547" /> relief to the farmers.  In the case of holdings of a certain acreage it means they are paying a smaller rate than a few years ago.  We presume the Minister will not recommend to the Minister for Finance that there should be any change in the levy of the annuities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general encouragement of tillage, the Minister was not so precise.  He spoke of bringing over an expert on grass-land.  I take it he subscribes to the Fianna Fáil belief that in a great part of the country mixed farming encourages the production of good grass, but there are certain lands where it may be argued the pasture should be left permanent.  I take it the Minister does not stray far from the Majority Report of the Post-War Commission on Agriculture.  In that regard, although he may make many modifying statements, necessary in particular circumstances, I take it that in general he will agree with Fianna Fáil that tillage of any kind&mdash;we are not discussing wheat&mdash;improves the grass in many areas, gives employment and should be given every reasonable encouragement.</P>
    <P>Reading his observations in regard to barley, oats and potatoes, I take that as his policy.  I take it he subscribes to that aspect of Fianna Fáil policy and that it is not true, as might be gathered from listening to some of his speeches, that he is in fact a rancher type of farming advocate. Deputy Dr. Ryan assumed that the Minister agreed with the Majority Report in regard to that matter, and I follow Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear more about the grass-land expert.  Any expert who comes here should have some preconceived notions on how to direct farming policy and grass-land policy in a country with our humidity, rainfall and average temperature.  We have heard that this man is to come from New Zealand.  Unless he has studied where the climate approaches ours, and adopts a modest attitude, he may take us far off the track. There are 100-acre farms in New Zealand where there are 70 cows but no bullocks and where a man and his wife have no hired labour <Col N="548" /> whatever with which to produce milk or butter for the market, where the grass is perpetual and is treated with artificial manures, where the fields are big and where the temperature in winter is higher than here.  I trust the expert will not be prejudiced in his attitude.  It will be interesting to hear the opinions of this expert.  It is important that we should not have a man who arrives with a big prejudice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is continuing the farm improvements scheme, and I would like to ask him to consider a suggestion which I made while the previous Government was in office and which, I think, was being considered by the Minister at the time.  The object was to increase the number of farm improvements schemes in the area where paid labour is employed.  If the Minister examines the figures of the number of grants issued in the bigger farm areas he will find they are a very small percentage of the total holdings in those areas.  He will find a great concentration of the scheme in the congested areas, the areas where the person getting the grant receives cash for labour he has performed.  If he examines Carlow, Wexford, Wicklow or Louth, he will find the scheme at a low ebb in these counties.  It might take a considerable amount of complicated and perhaps annoying administration. Perhaps the Minister could give a larger grant, up to 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the labour value, for farm improvements schemes where the farmers employ labour.  I ask him to consider that.  I know it was being considered when the last Government fell, and I should like to draw attention to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about an improved quality of seeds for this country.  I understand that under the last Government, measures were in progress for securing the best seeds that could be provided for the renewal of our crops.  I understand that was going on before the Minister took office.  So far as the provision of artificial fertilisers is concerned, I understand the previous Government were ransacking the world for artificial manures and that there was no duty <Col N="549" /> on them.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is continuing that policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> what has been said before but in common with other Deputies I should like the Minister to give us some indication of what he believes the price of creamery and other milk should be in comparison with the price of cattle generally.  I think it was Deputy Lehane who said that the only good thing Fianna Fáil did during their term of office was to initiate the farm improvements scheme.  I believe Deputy Lehane comes from a dairying area and I always understood that Fianna Fáil saved the dairying industry from complete destruction by the introduction of subsidies for butter.  Even if there was no economic war, such a measure was highly desirable and should have been introduced at least 12 months before that.  I do not know whether Deputy Lehane remembers that but perhaps his memory is too short.  I trust the Minister will give careful consideration to the question of ancillary industries such as casein and allied products, tanneries, etc., the raw materials of which are provided by agriculture.  I understand that there are a number of industries, for which the raw materials are agricultural products, which are awaiting the decision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to their protection. The question of protection has not yet been decided upon and I trust that the Minister for Agriculture will encourage the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to a decision at an early date.</P>
    <P>Of course, the former Government assisted farmers to improve or provide roads to their residences by initiating the farm improvements scheme, and I trust the Minister will put that into operation as soon as possible.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether he considers that the subsidies which we gave for fertilisers and manures, which were still further increased through the supplementary budget, are sufficient.  We are not going as far as Clann na Poblachta, who desired that manures and fertilisers should be given away to farmers, but we recognise the necessity for an extended use of these <Col N="550" /> fertilisers.  Is the Minister satisfied that the subsidy is now large enough? Conditions have changed even since the last Government left office.  Is the subsidy large enough or does the Minister consider that the Minister for Finance might allow him even a loan under which higher subsidies for artificial manures could be provided for the next five years?</P>
    <P>We are not allowed to discuss the agreement made with Britain, but I should like to point out, in passing, a fact that seems to be forgotten by some of the Deputies opposite that we did make a preliminary agreement with the British which was a step forward, and I have no doubt that if the former Government were still in office they would have improved on that agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to supply us with some further information about the improvement of veterinary services.  I understand that matter was under consideration by the former Government and that one of the difficulties lay in the training of the necessary number of vets.  Does the Minister favour the veterinary dispensary scheme wherby a vet. would be in a certain place on a certain day where he could be reached by the farmers without difficulty?  Is he in favour of a change in the method of administering the veterinary service or is he merely going to increase the number of vets to give them every encouragement or to plan some sort of veterinary insurance or some veterinary assistance scheme?</P>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Minister whether he would give us some information as to the publicity he is going to undertake in connection with the soil analysis service.  The arrangements for that service were commenced by the former Government.  As the Minister may know, some 10,000 samples are sent for analysis every year by the level-headed farmers in Scotland.  The figures are very small for this country, as far as I know.  It seems to me that we should initiate an advertising campaign in this connection in a way which the farmers would understand.  Farmers are loth to <Col N="551" /> engage assistance for a purely technical service of this kind and I should like the Minister to say if he would think it wise to advertise that service.</P>
    <P>Speaking about improvements schemes, the Minister will be aware that there are areas in the Gaeltacht in which schemes were operated which were largely devoted to bog roads and accommodation roads.  In connection with these schemes it was sometimes found very difficult to find adequate work.  There are areas in Galway where by-roads and small roads of that kind have been undertaken and where there is a great deal of unemployment. I would suggest that the farm improvements schemes and the unemployment schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;might be operated jointly as a permanent feature.  I do not know whether that matter has come to his attention.  The Minister speaks of improved production and in the course of his observations he said that money was being provided to improve the quality of grass seed.  Does he not believe that it would be advisable to offer a subsidy for grass seeds of an approved quality.  There are areas in Longford where only half the farms sow grass seed of any quality upon land as an under-cover crop after a four years' rotation.  A very large proportion of the farmers take what they find in the hay barn.  Even if the price of good seed were much dearer, it would be still worth while in encouraging farmers to buy good seed.  Does the Minister not consider it high time to make available a grant or subsidy for grass seed of approved quality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said a great deal about inspectors.  I have views which are entirely my own and which do not belong to any particular Party on the question of propaganda in regard to production in this country.  The Minister said that he is never going to ask an inspector to enter on a man's land. I think it is time we adopted an entirely different administrative method for conducting propaganda operations in the Department of Agriculture. <Col N="552" /> I do not believe that civil servants, working under Civil Service rules, are going to help the farmer to improve his production.  I believe there should be an agricultural production council set up, quite independent of the Department, a council which should be given a policy and given money, and the people who work for it should not be called inspectors&mdash;I do not know what they should be called&mdash;but they should be people who would go around amongst the farmers and help them to improve their production by every means possible.  They should be welcomed by the farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they should be able to go inside a man's gate and help him, without having to adhere to strictly Civil Service rules&mdash;something like a glorified young farmers' club in operation throughout the country.  I believe that something of that kind should be considered by the Minister. We have already delegated to boards a number of important activities, such as the giving of industrial credit, the giving of agricultural credit and assisting the tourist industry, but the propaganda work of this Department is still in the shadows, in which it must be, of Departmental routine.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that, excellent as the Department is, if he were to change that method, he might have far better results.</P>
      <P>In connection with agricultural education, during the lifetime of the former Government, it was extremely difficult, at least during the war, to procure mobile film units.  I should like to know whether the Minister considers that the winter classes for agricultural instruction would be much better attended if there were always films available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to procure six such units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister has adverted to that matter, because, if you have the type of film which can be stopped while the lecturer proceeds with his lecture and a hall of sufficient size, the attendance <Col N="553" /> at these winter classes, which are so useful in connection with demonstrations in the summer, would be far greater.  The attendance in County Longford in past years has been not more than 10 per cent. of the farming population at any time, and although it is hard to ask young farmers to come out on the long nights, in winter weather, to attend these classes, I have met a great many who did and who say that they gained great value from them.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has made it sufficiently clear to the House how he intends to use the increased maize supply.  He has spoken of exporting the surplus potatoes to Great Britain, and I should like to ask him how he thinks that will affect pig production, and having regard to the present price of maize, £27 per ton, if there are largely increased supplies of that product, even if it comes down slightly in price, will it affect pig or poultry production more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that that price includes the Fianna Fáil margin of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever margin it includes, will it affect pig or poultry production more?  The Minister has taken over the scheme started by Fianna Fáil for increased poultry and eggs and he is very anxious to increase the production of pigs.  How does he think the increased imported feeding stuffs will be utilised?  Has he had regard to what the average price of compound feeding stuffs for pigs will be when the proportion of maize is very largely increased, due to its total greater importation, and what does he think the result will be in connection with pigs and poultry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, in very large measure, adopted the Fianna Fáil policy and is uncertain about other policy.  I trust that he will clarify the issues before the House when he replies and that we may know what we have to face in the future.  The Minister for Lands, in the course of his speech on the Estimate for Lands, stated that he foresaw the complete disappearance of all large farms in the Midlands.  He was asked afterwards whether that means the farm well worked by a large <Col N="554" /> number of workers would be divided, and he said no.  The question was still left undecided as to why he made such a prophecy.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In intervening in this debate, I am under the double difficulty that I am not a farmer, or in any way an agricultural expert, and that the time factor and the desire of the House to conclude the debate on this Estimate makes my intervention, of necessity, brief.  I had not the privilege of hearing all of Deputy Childers' contribution, but what I did hear of it was sufficient to increase for me the puzzle as to what constitutes Fianna Fáil agricultural policy, because his major premise, so far as I could understand, was that the present Minister was merely extending the policy of Fianna Fáil, except in so far as that policy had been somewhat curtailed or amended by incidentals like the economic war and the intervention of the world war; but, on the whole, I took it from him that there had been no radical departure in the agricultural field.  This occasioned great surprise for me, in view of the acrimony with which the Minister's Estimate has been assailed by his Party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, so far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we take cognisance of the fact that this is an inter-Party Government, and that the present Minister in presenting his policy is presenting a policy which is a compound more or less of the policies of the composite parts of the Government. It is not a Labour Party policy and there is therefore no necessity for us to defend the policy as a whole. Fianna Fáil policy was examined and analysed by the Labour Party on various occasions and our policy was <Col N="555" /> very fully announced as far back as 1943, but the Labour Party as a whole has not had an opportunity of examining or analysing the policy of the present Minister.  We must therefore speak with a certain amount of restraint and reserve on this matter. So far as the Labour Party policy was announced by Deputies Dunne, Davin and Kyne and, to a certain extent, Deputy Keyes, I am in accord with their presentation of it and with their concern for the agricultural worker more especially, and their request, if it was not more, to the Minister to reexamine this question of compulsory tillage, in so far as it relates to increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>More than that I do not want to say, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to an item of local interest in my constituency.  I would not have intervened had Deputy Aiken made reference to the matter but unfortunately he was more concerned with matters which naturally interest the Opposition, such as election posters and promises, rather than with raising this matter, which is of vital importance to a very large agricultural section in my constituency. That relates to the question of Cooley potatoes which are under certain restrictions as black scab potatoes.  The matter is long-standing, and with the advent of a new Minister for Agriculture many people concerned with the production of potatoes in the Cooley peninsula hope for a reorientation of policy in that matter.  In this area there is a very high productivity of potatoes.  The farmers there feel that the prevention of the export of Cooley potatoes to the Dublin market is not motivated on scientific grounds or by a desire to protect the seed potato export market, but is an unfair discrimination against them.  I suggest that the matter should be re-examined by the Minister.  If the contention of the farmers of Cooley is correct then a great injustice is being done, not only to the farmers but to the consumers in the Dublin market.  The farmers maintain that their productivity is so high that they could supply to the Dublin market sufficient potatoes to reduce <Col N="556" /> substantially the price in the Dublin market, and that, by reducing the price there, they would bring the price nearer to the price at which potatoes would be useful for pig feeding, and thus aid the production of bacon.</P>
    <P>On these matters I am speaking second-hand.  I do not pretend to any agricultural expertness, but there are certain aspects of it to which I would direct the Minister's attention.  There is a degree of smuggling from that area to the Dublin market due to the great difference between the price at the alcohol factory, to which they are compelled to send the potatoes as the only outlet for their produce, and the price in the Dublin market.  Smuggling has gone on for a considerable time and there is regular imposition of penalties and a certain amount of trouble is caused in the area.  That would be obviated if there were some way of increasing the price for Cooley potatoes even in that area or of permitting export to England or of reducing the difference between the price at the alcohol factory and the Dublin price.</P>
    <P>If one examines what happens the smuggled potatoes which are seized, the matter acquires a certain amount of mystery.  On seizure, the potatoes are brought in to the town of Dundalk and it is found that they are railed somewhere to the south and apparently are used in some institutions under Government control in such a manner that the danger of black scab occurring in the area in which they are used is avoided.  The thought naturally arises that if these smuggled potatoes can be used, as there is no doubt they can be used, for human consumption, there should be some means of regular Government control of the potatoes so that they would be washed or chemically treated and allowed on to the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>The contention of the Department of Agriculture is that it is not the potatoes that are the source of contamination but the earth adhering to the potatoes which contains spores of a disease which could spread black scab to other parts of the country and, therefore, exportation of potatoes from this black scab area is a very serious <Col N="557" /> matter, particularly in regard to the export seed trade.  That export trade is of considerable value to the country and certificates have to be issued in respect of seed for export that the seed was not grown in any place within twenty miles of a black scab area. While there is this very stringent regulation in regard to seed potatoes, there seems to be no regulation whatsoever in respect of the exportation of beet or other crops from that area, which obviously carry the same earth. There is no decontamination squad attending to the potato workers, or those who work in the field and carry this earth on their boots from that area into Dundalk and the surrounding district and as far down as Dublin or anywhere else they may go.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this matter that seem to indicate that the whole question should be reconsidered. At one period there may have been some necessity for cutting off the whole Cooley area.  There may have been a case for it in the past and because that case was made out by the Department at that time&mdash;on scientific grounds, I have no doubt&mdash;it seems to me that they have gone on from year to year and that the matter has never been re-examined.  Although promises were held out by various Deputies in the past that the Fianna Fáil Government would reconsider the matter, that was never done.  The Cooley farmers now confidently hope that the new Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government will take steps to have the question re-examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to appeals from most of the speakers on the opposite side of the House for cooperation and assistance for the Minister in carrying out his policy.  I listened to Deputy Coburn yesterday making a very impassioned appeal, telling us it was our duty to assist the Minister to get the people to produce wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and all crops at the prices that have been guaranteed by the Minister.  It is hardly necessary for any Deputy sitting behind the Government to-day to make appeals to this side of the House, because one outstanding plank on <Col N="558" /> Fianna Fáil's programme is its agricultural policy.  Since the first day Fianna Fáil took over the reins of Government, their every-day effort has been to try to make the people purely agricultural minded.  It was not merely in the days of emergency that that effort was made.</P>
      <P>We have heard many speeches regarding statements made by the present Minister.  I cannot describe them as other than mischievous statements made by him during the emergency, at a time when the people had no hope of getting any food anywhere except that which could be produced by the farmers.  Then this particular Minister was as obstructive as he could be and did his utmost to smash the food drive.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech, he said that Fianna Fáil were responsible for giving Guinness £2,000,000 last year.  Let me take one item and see what the Minister thinks about it.  We are to get a guaranteed price of 55/- a barrel for barley, that is, £27 10s. 0d. a ton.  The experience of everybody, especially of Deputies from the barley-growing districts, is that when Guinness gets a certain amount of barley he puts his foot down and says: &ldquo;Thus far will I go and no further.&rdquo;  That means that, if we have a surplus of barley above his requirments, it will have to be converted into animal food.  That will cost £6 per ton, bringing the price of barley meal up to £33 10s. 0d. per ton. I would like the Minister to tell us how it will be economic to produce pigs fed on barley meal at £33 10s. 0d. a ton.  I do not think it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been charged from this side of the House with having drawn the pen across the farm buildings scheme.  Although he had 25,000 applications, he did not try to realise that that showed the urgency for reconstruction and erection of out-offices all over the country.  If he were satisfied with doing away with that particular scheme for the time being and helping to save the £350,000 that the Minister for Finance is seeking, we would not be so worried, but he has not been content with that.  He has gone into the farm improvements scheme, to which he paid a very high tribute in his opening speech, when he complimented <Col N="559" /> Deputy Dr. Ryan, who was responsible for introducing it, and told us that it was the greatest monument that could be erected to any mortal man.  He was not satisfied with leaving the farm buildings scheme in abeyance, but he draws the Fine Gael economic axe right across the farm improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who have been loud in their praise of the Minister's action have not gone to the labour of finding out what exactly he has done.  I have here before me the form of application being sent out at present to those who wish to make application under this scheme.  Do you know what this Minister is doing?  He is cutting out the construction of water tanks, of liquid manure tanks, of silos, concrete stands for corn stacks, piers, cattle enclosures and a whole number of things that were carried on for years and years by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, by the man whom this Minister complimented and whose scheme he described as his greatest monument. He has drawn the Fine Gael economic are across it, and now the only schemes for which you can get grants under the farm improvements scheme are drainage and other improvements purely on the land.  The people who stand behind the Minister and who are not prepared to have this Estimate referred back, until such time as the Minister gives at least as much effect to the old farm improvements scheme as had been given by Fianna Fáil, are not doing their duty by the farming community or by the people who sent them here to represent the farming community.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are not entitled to criticise the Minister.  If that is not a reason for criticising him, I do not know where we are going or that we are doing our duty towards those who deserve more from us than anybody else, that is, the agricultural community.  I can clearly understand the Minister doing things like that, as he has not been sent here by any section of the farming community.  As far as I know, he has no association with any section of the farming community.</P>

      <P>If you can manage to keep the Minister for Lands in his place, Sir, I will keep to the Estimate. We heard a lot said about the Department's inspectors and the way that they jumped in on top of farmers here and there.  I want to say that I happened to be one of the Deputies who, during the emergency&mdash;I was not in the same position and my mind was not focussed in the same direction as that of the present Minister for Agriculture &mdash;and prior to it was interested in seeing agriculture carried on as I think it should be in this country&mdash;that is, that the land should be used mainly for the production of food for the people.  Time and again I made reports to the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I <Col N="561" /> am sure the Minister will find some of them in the Department&mdash; regarding people who were prepared to ride rough-shod over the regulations governing compulsory tillage.  There were farmers&mdash;and this must be known to Deputies no matter what county they come from&mdash;and not small farmers either, who sowed wheat, barley and oats, and because they possess a destructive type of mind, and probably because of advice given to them by the present Minister for Agriculture, they turned their cattle and other stock in on those crops and allowed them to destroy them, rather than put them on the market to feed the people during the emergency.  If inspectors went in and tried to make those people do their job, I think they deserve a little more credit than they have received from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position this year?  Some farmers cannot be blamed for what they are doing, because I do not think anyone could blame the farmers of the country for taking the advice that was given to them by the present Minister for Agriculture.  He was only a few weeks in office, as a matter of fact only a few days&mdash;indeed I could almost bring it down to a few hours&mdash;when one of the first announcements he made was that compulsory tillage was going to disappear.  Now, a wise Minister coming in new to an office would take his time and see where exactly he stood in connection with compulsory tillage. He would have had plenty of time during, say, the coming 12 months, or we will even say six months, to make such a statement after he had examined the records of his office and the whole position.  When he had done that, it would be time enough for him to make such a statement.  Immediately the Minister made this announcement a few days after taking office there was a rush all over the country by farmers, not, I say again by small farmers, but by the bigger type of farmer, to collect any and every sort of hayseed to throw it on the soil.  The result has been, as I know myself, that even in this very year I have had to report people for not having complied with compulsory tillage so far as wheat growing is concerned. No action, of course, was <Col N="562" /> taken, and those people have not grown the wheat.</P>

He must be a man who was employed in turf production in 1947.

      <P>If the Minister wishes, I can go down the alphabet, O.P.Q., but what I have said is so.  In 1945, there were men producing turf who perhaps went to England, or somewhere else, in 1946.  Does the Minister think that the men who produced turf in 1946 were the same men as those who produced it in 1945?  Is he going to try to convince me that he is so innocent as to believe that the men who produced turf in 1946 were the men who produced it in 1945, and that the men who produced it in 1947 were the men who had produced it in 1946?</P>

      <P>Since we have come in <Col N="564" /> here as an Opposition, day after day we have listened to statements from different Ministers and from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that when they tried to put schemes into operation they could not do it because there was no unemployment. Those are not the statements we listened to during the elections although the peat scheme was in operation then, and surely, since the peat scheme was dropped there must be more people unemployed.  I want to tell the Minister that there are unemployed, but his scheme was deliberately drafted so as to convince the unemployed that they are working.  A man who was 17½ years of age in 1947 would be 18½ years of age in 1948; he was not entitled to employment in 1947, so surely he would be entitled to it in 1948.  Is there common sense in that statement?  Are there not hundreds and thousands of such men in the country who cannot find employment? But the Minister comes along and says we have no unemployed.  They are there, but you will not let them work. They are there, but you will not make any effort to find employment for them. I hope that what he has said with regard to the employment and the drainage scheme will be amended so as to give employment to those men who are looking for work and who are anxious to secure it.  We have, as the Minister, I am sure, is aware, during the last three or four months more young men going to England and more young men and young women, too, going to America than in any similar months or in any three months for a number of years back.  If you go to the different labour exchanges to find out whether what I am saying is correct or not, you will be convinced that that is so.  I come from a constituency where I am alive to the conditions of employment and where I am alive to the conditions that exist regarding the people who are making a effort to get to England because they cannot get employment.  The Minister's statement that there are no unemployed will, I am afraid, be true in the very near future, because there will be nobody there to be unemployed; they will all be gone</P>

    <P>One other matter I would like to <Col N="565" /> refer to is that the technical schools which we have all over the country are not, to my mind, being used for the purposes for which they were really intended.

      <P>Deputy Smith had nothing to do with the farm buildings scheme.  Now the poor Minister is feeling very worried.  Mr. Smith or Mr. Fianna Fáil can be blamed for everything, but Mr. Smith cannot be blamed for cutting out the farm buildings scheme.  The man who cut out the farm buildings scheme should have said at least: &ldquo;I will allow the people to carry on with the works that Fianna Fáil had on their programme <Col N="566" /> and allow the people who had started a farm improvement scheme to carry on to the same extent as heretofore.&rdquo; But you have not done that.  It is the Minister alone who has drawn a pencil through this scheme.  It is not Deputy Smith or any other Deputy in this House.  It is the present Minister for Agriculture who has cut out the farm buildings scheme which Fianna Fáil had on their programme for the improvement of these things.  When you decided to leave it in abeyance for a year you could at least have allowed the people to carry on with schemes they had undertaken.  That would not have been too much for the Minister for Agriculture, and I hope he changes his mind about it.  Seeing that we are not to have the farm buildings scheme for another year or so, I hope that this thing will be rectified and remedied so that people will be able to avail of the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to be very brief on this Estimate, but I will commence with the concluding remarks of Deputy Killilea, who complains that the Minister for Agriculture put in abeyance the farm buildings scheme and the farm improvements scheme. The Deputy realises as well as anybody in this House that there is a cement <Col N="567" /> shortage and a keen demand for houses at the present time and that the Government has to choose between the provision of cement for pig sties and the provision of cement for houses for the Irish people.</P>

      <P>There is a difference between the slaughter of calves now which has not the Minister's blessing, and the slaughter of calves under the Fianna Fáil policy when every farmer who could prove that he had murdered a calf received 10/- on producing the skin.</P>
      <P>He referred to the wheat scheme under the Fianna Fáil Government.  It would have been better if Fianna Fáil had left the compulsory wheat scheme until the war came about when we would have had more fertile soil for better crops.  When the war came we had what you might call a dust bowl in which to attempt to grow the necessary wheat in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate appears to be something in the nature of a post-mortem on the agricultural industry.  The Minister's statement on the Estimate is encouraging because he has indicated his plans for the future.  He has encouraged the farmers to take the long view and plan for the future and not be planning from one day to another. <Col N="568" /> We find the Minister standing alone amongst the shattered ruins of the agricultural industry and wondering which way to look so that he can bring some form of prosperity to that industry, which ought to be the main industry of the country.  I know that he has a colossal task before him.  I also know that the policy of Fianna Fáil has not been in favour of agriculture. It must be admitted by the Party themselves that the Fianna Fáil policy had a completely industrial bias, that if industry was to be put on its feet, agriculture had to suffer, and it did suffer.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, spoke for something like four and a half hours on this Estimate.  He abused the Minister and accused him of being unbalanced and irresponsible.  He based those observations on some after-dinner speeches made by the Minister.  No doubt, these speeches were made off the record: they were not official statements, and speaking after dinner the Minister was expected to give some form of topical expression to whatever matter was under discussion.  I do not think Deputy Smith was justified in adopting the rôle of alienist in this matter. I think that people are able to form their own opinions, especially the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be let away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He is getting away with nothing so far as we are concerned. The farmers do not forget the bullying methods adopted by the previous Minister for Agriculture. They remember well his statement at Navan.  That goes further into the minds of the farmers than the present Minister's expressions on some occasions after dinner.  The Deputy complained that the farmers were conservative, which goes to show that they did not indicate any kind of reliance on the Fiana Fáil policy.  Farmers are conservative and they certainly will not run into any stunts which might seem crazy to them.  The calf population at present is the lowest yet recorded.  That is a desperate position when we consider that in Great Britain and Europe there is an almost <Col N="569" /> unlimited demand for fresh meat at the present time.  I realise that the Minister has a difficult task before him to devise methods which will increase the calf population to a reasonable level within a short time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith also in the course of his prolonged attack on the present Minister scorned modern farm methods. He implied that a stick tied to a donkey's tail is good enough for the Irish farmer, decrying the Minister's statement that he would prefer to see modern methods employed rather than the broken-winded horses which are used on various farms.  He also said that some farms range from one to 20 acres.  I do not see how Deputy Smith could see his way to feed two broken-winded horses on a five-acre farm.  It is not economic.  He could have something in the nature of a light tractor or machinery to till that land.  In Rush there are farms of not more than five acres and the farmers there have tractors for tilling the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very busy farmers. They are market gardeners and I can assure the Deputy that they are able to get three crops out of their land in the 12 months.  They are able to use tractors efficiently on less than one acre of land.  Besides the four-wheel tractors, Deputies opposite should know that there are also the smaller machines which could be purchased by small landowners instead of attempting to feed horses on a small area of land.  Deputies who are familiar with farming methods will agree with me that the cost of feeding a horse is something like £2 a week.  The feeding of a useless broken-winded horse is not good economics, even though it may be argued that the manure could be put into the land, whereas with a tractor it is just a question of using the fuel.  We would have been lucky in this country if we had succeeded in importing a sufficient number of tractors in 1938 or 1939 when they could have been got at a reasonable price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that during the war tractors dating back to the years between 1915 and 1920 were sold at something in the region of £400 each.  That shows the grave need there was during the emergency years for machinery instead of horses.  Deputies who are aware of the conditions on the larger farms, on looking back, will see that the farmers with the larger farms were compelled to replace teams of horses by tractors because the tractors were able to do a greater amount of work, as efficiently as horses, in a shorter period of time. The British and the Northern Ireland farmers during the war years received subsidies.  I will mention specially the potato subsidy.  Agriculture in this country has not been subsidised to any such extent.  In fact, we pay rates on agricultural land and that is not the case in Northern Ireland or Britain. Therefore the overhead charges in this country are far higher than they are in Britain.  Light tractors can work quicker and better on these small farms that I have mentioned.  I hope the Minister will devise a scheme whereby he can make such machinery available to farmers in a locality who cannot afford to buy it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, with knobs on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some indication by the Minister that it was possible that in the future, tillage might be dispensed with.  I would rather see a reduction in the tillage quota, even if it were a very drastic reduction, than a complete abandonment of the scheme of quotas.  There is the possibility that some farmers who are not inclined to give employment will take advantage of it, whereas the ordinary farmer will carry on in a reasonable way.  There are tillage contractors who have purchased anything from £1,000 to £5,000 worth of machinery.  I have in mind a farmer who has three threshing-mills, six tractors and four lorries in operation. If compulsory tillage is abandoned he will lose.  His machinery will become useless, because he carries out the tillage on other people's farms.  He carries the tillage out on the farms of persons who cannot afford to till them themselves and who are not suitably <Col N="571" /> fitted, as he is, to till.  If compulsory tillage is completely abandoned these landholders will not let the land in conacre to this man who is carrying on as a tillage contractor.  I have been informed that some farmers in Meath, rather than equip themselves to carry out compulsory tillage quotas, pay a contractor £1, £2 or £3 an acre to take the land from them and comply with the tillage regulations by tilling the necessary quota.  That matter was mentioned in this House by a Deputy. This is an example where unemployment would be caused.  The farmer whom I have just mentioned employs about 60 men for a period of four months.  If the land is to be put into grass again, the question as to whether farmers have sufficient capital to fully stock their land arises.  If they have not sufficient capital, especially in view of the shortage of live stock and the present high prices prevailing, it would seem that the land would not be producing and would not be giving employment either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the abolition of compulsory tillage so far as dairy farmers are concerned&mdash; especially farmers who have a holding of normal size, having regard to the acreage of the farm and the number of cows on it.  When it was indicated that, to some extent, compulsory tillage might be abolished in the future some farmers decided that they would not give any further employment. Luckily, that is not typical of the general farmer.  He carries on mixed farming rather than give no employment at all.  It is necessary that the Minister should devise a scheme whereby the quality of grass will be improved.  Any Deputy who goes along a road and looks across the broad acres of land can see at a glance that the grass is not of good quality.  The land needs to be treated in some way or other&mdash;probably by lime or phosphates &mdash;to produce a good class of grass.  It is the same as anything else&mdash;an acre of land will produce more grass if it is a good type of grass.  I understand that there is a farm in County Dublin which makes grass meal.  The particular machine concerned mows the grass, processes it and sends it out in <Col N="572" /> the form of meal all in the one operation. It is not disputed that grass meal, especially if it is of good class, has a high feeding content.  For that reason I am anxious that the Minister will take active steps to improve the class of grass growing in our grasslands.</P>
    <P>The sheep population at the present time is very low.  There is a strong demand for mutton outside this country as well as inside it.  It seems to me that the most desirable action that the Minister could take in this matter is to prevent the slaughter of ewe lambs because in the near future it might be one method of increasing the sheep population.  That brings me to the question of wool prices.  Farmer Deputies of this House will agree with me when I say that the price per pound for wool given to farmers bears little or no relation to the price of wool when it issues as a finished product.  I should like to see the Minister devising a scheme whereby the price received for the raw material would bear some relation to the cost of the finished article.</P>
    <P>The pig position is pretty bad at the moment.  We must remember that, besides the farmers, the farm workers participated in the past in the production of pigs and the ultimate production of bacon.  I should like to see the Minister bringing forward some kind of scheme that would encourage agricultural workers to feed pigs and have them for sale periodically as they did in the past.  Bacon quotas in the shops apparently do not satisfy the demand that there is for bacon at the present time.  On inquiry I have ascertained that the shopkeepers are receiving their full quotas.  Illegal curing destroys any effort the Minister or anybody else may aim at in the matter of increasing pig production.  I would urge the Minister to put down all classes of illegal curing because it is the most destructive method that can be adopted so far as the destruction of the pig population is concerned.</P>
    <P>The wheat price of 62/6 per barrel over a period of five years offers a good business to the farmers.  Taking the long view, the farmer will be in a position to calculate what return he will <Col N="573" /> receive from any particular acreage. He will be able to choose the number of acres suitable to himself &mdash; the acres that he can have properly fertilised and treated for the production of a good paying crop.  Besides farmyard manure, fertilisers have proved to be very valuable so far as wheat is concerned. In fact, it is true that the application of fertiliser increases a wheat crop to the extent of 50 per cent. on reasonable land.  That is a very considerable measure of improvement when it comes to reaping the crop and balancing the farm budget.</P>
    <P>There is an unlimited scope for agricultural production at the present time. In the development and in the stepping-up of agricultural production, I believe that the machine will have to take a very prominent part.  For that reason I hope that the Minister will take some steps to equip farmers with all classes of useful instruments.  I am sure that that work can be done through the various county committees of agriculture. If the Minister succeeds in creating prosperity amongst the farming community the farmer will be in a position to pay better wages to his farm workers.  Nobody disputes the fact that the standard of pay of farm workers, having regard to the skilled nature of their work, bears very little relation to the wages received by employees in other occupations.  The farm worker is a very skilled individual.  He has to be a veterinary surgeon, a mechanic and a scientist all at the one time.  That is why I say that he should be regarded as a highly skilled individual and paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is reassuring to know from the Minister that he proposes raising the barley price from 45/- to 55/-.  It is a step in the right direction.  It is a step nearer to the world market price.  It is desirable that as far as prices for agricultural goods in this country are concerned, and especially having regard to the demand for produce outside this country, we should get as near to the world market price as possible.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of costings.  The Minister will, I am sure, agree that if some form of costings were in operation it would help the farmers as a guide in their own <Col N="574" /> budgets.  Even if such costings were only crudely done and even if they did not fully represent normal conditions they would be of considerable assistance.  These costings could be done on the model farms.  It might be argued by the ordinary farmers that conditions on the model farms are very different from the conditions on the ordinary farms.  At the same time such costings would fill a gap in farming economy generally.</P>
    <P>The sugar beet position is not as encouraging as it might be.  There are some drawbacks in the growing of beet.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should confer with the Minister for Finance as to the possibility of increasing the price of sugar by 1d. per lb.  That extra 1d. would give a good return to the growers and it might in time have the effect of bringing about the abolition of the rationing system.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism has been levelled against meat prices at the present time.  I believe the present high level of prices is bound to continue so long as the demand is greater than the supply.  When conditions return to normal prices will fall because the world market will then bring to bear once more its influence in the sphere of competition.  So long as there is a scarcity there will be difficulty in regard to retail prices.  In the coming year we shall find it difficult to meet the full demand of the British market for meat.  So long as that position obtains the retail price of meat in this country will create difficulties and problems for the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>So far as the dairying industry is concerned, I am convinced that in our particular farming economy the dual-purpose cow is the most valuable animal we can have.  I believe that the dual-purpose cow is a definite asset when we come to consider which particular class of live stock we should cultivate in this country.  We must take the long view.  For that reason I am in favour of the double dairy cow.  If it comes to the point where the Minister has to decide in favour of one class of live stock as against another, then I say that he should definitely take the dual-purpose animal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I would appeal to the Minister to take immediate steps to prevent the slaughter of calves.  In various hotels and restaurants at the moment veal is available on the menu.  It is our endeavour to increase the live-stock population. If we permit the killing of prime veal calves we cannot expect to bring about the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera said that the price of vegetables was too high. So far as the farmers of County Dublin are concerned, the retail price of vegetables bears very little relation to the price the farmers get for their produce in the markets.  So far as vegetables are concerned it is, therefore, a question of marketing.</P>
    <P>I feel that some steps should be taken to make provision for the inclusion of instruction in agriculture in the curriculum of the rural schools.  It must be appreciated that the majority of the children attending these schools will eventually be either farmers themselves or agricultural labourers.  Systematic education in agriculture is important from the point of view of future generations.</P>
    <P>I know it is the Minister's intention to give a square deal to the farmers. I know it is his desire to put our main industry on its feet.  If he succeeds in restoring our live-stock population and the fertility of our soil, thereby increasing the volume of agricultural production, he will create a measure of prosperity in the country such as it has not heretofore known and that prosperity, in turn, will percolate to industry, commerce and the professions.  We all know that, fundamentally, prosperity comes from the soil.  We have a fertile soil capable of development. We have a soil that will react favourably to proper treatment.  I am convinced that the Minister will succeed in his determination to restore the fertility to our soil, thereby assuring us of prosperity in the future.</P>

Ní cainteoir leadránach mé agus déanfad mo dhicheall gan a bheith leadránach an iarraidh seo; ach ní féidir liom an <Col N="576" /> ócáid seo a ligint tharm gan tagairt a dhéanamh do chúis gearáin amháin. Chualamuid trácht ó gach taobh den Teach ar mheasaisíní, tractors, cruithneacht, earnan, eallach reamhar, ba bainne, im agus eile, ach, fairíor, ní bhaineann ceachtar de na rudaí sin ro-dluth leis na ceantracha cúnga, bochta, iargulta.  Níor chualamuid glór na Gaeltachta fós sa díospóireacht. Is minic a deirtear go mbíonn an iomarca cur i gcéill i dtaobh na Gealtachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach ní raibh aon chur i gcéill ag an bhfear a bhí in áit an Aire atá anois ann&mdash;An Teachta MacGabhann &mdash;nuair a bhunaigh sé na tithe gloine; agus ní raibh aon chur i gcéill ag an Aire nuair a dúirt sé gan frapa gan taca ar a chéad mheastacháin go raibh sé lena stopadh.  Bhí an Teachta MacGabhann i ndearmad, áfach, nuair a dúirt sé gur athraigh an tAire a intinn i dtaobh na ceiste ar iarratas toscaireachta a tháinig aniar chuige. Tamall i ndiaidh an toscaireacht i gcomhairle leis, chuireas-sa ceist Dála air ag iarraidh air cúigear iarrthóirí a thoghadh in ionad cúigear eile a tharraing siar as an Scéim.  D'fhreagair sé is dúirt nach dtoghfadh, mar gur dóigh leis nach raibh sa scéim ach caimiléaracht déisteanach.  D'fhiafraíos annsin de cad chuige, más amhlaidh a bhí, nár chuir sé deireadh ar fad leis an scéim, agus dúirt sé go gcuirfeadh marach go raibh gafa ro-fhada léi ag an Aire a bhí ann roimhe, agus go raibh a lámha ceangailte mar gheall air.  Ní raibh aon mhuga-magadh aige faoi.  Is mór an truaigh nach mbreithneodh an tAirn scéim ar a fiúntas fhéin.  Má fhaghane sé blas nó boladh Fhianne Fáil ar rud ar bith bíonn déistean air dó.  Tá an oiread sin gráin aige don scéim seo gur dóigh le gach duine a bhfuil baint ar bith aige léi nach féidir rath a bheith uirthi.  Chualas scéal greannmhar le goirid faoi seo.  Bhí oifigigh de chuid na Roinne ag cur spréála nó rud éigin as buidéil ar na planndaí.  Bhí amhras ar chuid de na daoine gur rud nimheanta a bhí ann a dhéanfadh dochar do na trátaí agus bhíodar idir dhá chomhairle ar chóir dóibh bac a chur leis na h-oifigigh.  'Séard a deirtear freisin. go bhfóiridh Dia ar na h-oifigigh, mara <Col N="577" /> bhféachfaidh siad chuige go loicfidh an toradh.  Ar ndóigh is caint ráiméiseach í, ach sé mochtadh intinne an Aire cionntsiocair leí.  Cé go bhfuil an tAire in aghaidh na scéime ba chóir dó, ós rud é go gcaithfear dul ar aghaidh leí, a theaspáint do na daoine, agus go mór-mhór do na h-oifigigh, go mba mhaith leis go n-éireoch léi thar cionn. Tá ré na míorbhuilt thart, ach síltear go mba mhíorbhuilt é dá n-éiriódh leis an rud seo agus an tAire ina haghaidh.  Bhí sé, scathamh, ina Theachta do Thír Chonaill agus tuigeann sé comh cruaidh is tá saol na Gaeltachta, agus ní h-é an doicheall a beifí ag súil leis uaidh roimh rud ar bith a dhéanfadh a leas nó a d'fhreagródh dóibh.  Níor dochar ar bith dó dá ngabhfadh sé siar agus dá míníodh sé do na daoine an t-údar a bhí aige leis an gcaint a rinne sé sa gcúis seo, agus dá míníodh sé céard tá faoi a dhéanamh dóibh ina háit.  Idir gheáitsí an Aire faoi na tithe gloine agus stopadh obair na móna, ní fhéadfadh muintir na gceanntracha bochta gan a bheith den tuairim nach í an Ghaeltacht atá ag déanamh imní don Rialtas seo, ach a mhalairt.</P>
    <P>Tá scéim eile a rinne an-leas do na ceantracha cúnga agus sí sin Feabhsú na bhFeilm.  Tá aicme daoine, áfach, nach bhfuil buntáiste na scéime seo ag dul dóibh agus sin iad na lanúna óga a dhéanas botháin amuigh ar an gcimín.  Ní bhíonn teideal faoin dlí acu chuig an talamh.  Is amhlaidh a phósas mac le tionónta amháin, iníon le tionónta eile, agus ní chuireann aon tionónta in aghaidh an lanúna óig nuair a shaothraíos cuid den chimín agus a chuireas siad fúthu air.  Sé mo thuairim gur fearr iad a fheiceál ag fanacht ar an tuaith ná dul isteach i seomraí i nGaillim nó i mbaile mór eile agus a bheith ag braith ar chúnamh poiblí.  Tá na daoine óga seo ag déanamh obair mhaith agus ag saothrú droch-thalamh nach saothrófaí ar aon bhealach eile.  'Sé m'iarratas ar an Aire go ndéanfadh sé pé athrú is gá chun go mbeadh buntáiste na scéime ar fáil ag an dream seo atá ag saothrú na talún chomh maith, agus béidir níos cruaidhe, ná talmhaithe ar bith eile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said during this debate regarding the production and price of milk.  I have a few remarks to make in that connection which I hope will not unduly delay the House.  The greater part of the constituency which I have the honour to represent is catered for by two large co-operative societies and the Dairy Disposals Company.  These three organisations constitute the only market for milk in that huge area and the plea I wish to make here is on behalf of farmers who cannot avail of any of these organisations to market their milk.</P>
      <P>I wish, first of all, to pay a very well-deserved tribute to the Dairy Disposals Company for the enormous amount of work and organisation that they put into the provision of a market for milk in the Beara peninsula.  There is no doubt that they did a very decent job there.  In a short time, they built up an organisation that catered for every gallon of milk in that remote and difficult area.  Their efforts have been crowned with success, one of the most successful undertakings we have seen operated by that or any other organisation in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years I have been exhorting the officials of the company to extend their efforts to the Glengarriff area.  It would be a very easy matter for them when they have a travelling creamery on the road from Castletownbere to Droumgollane to continue a few miles further on to Glengarriff, take up the milk there and separate it.  They have failed so far to connect with that district.  They had one excuse or another&mdash;the scarcity of lorries and machinery&mdash;during the war, but I think this should not hold any longer.  There is no reason now, with machinery and lorries available, why that area could not be catered for, either from Castletownbere or from Kenmare from which a travelling creamery comes to Bonane to within a few miles on the north side.  I know the quantity of milk available there is small but I am satisfied, from my experience, that a travelling creamery, even with small supplies, would provide a market where none exists at the moment.  During the time that <Col N="579" /> the Dairy Disposals Company have been operating travelling creameries in the Beara peninsula they have given satisfaction to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about costs of production and the price of milk generally over the country, but I think the first thing our farmers want is to have a market for the milk.  Milk is being produced at the moment in a few areas in which there is no market for it, more especially since the subsidy was removed on home-produced butter.  These people were able to get a fair price for home-produced butter up to recently but now they require this market more than ever.  They also require some organisation to assist them in the poultry scheme there.  It is true that about 12 months ago the Dairy Disposals Company started this industry in the area.  They set up a hatchery and purchased a farm to raise stock.  I think they should go a bit further and they should be empowered to give credit to their suppliers where it is required for the purchase of stock such as poultry and cattle.  That is one great fault that I have to find with them in that area, that they do not give credit to their customers to purchase commodities which they do not sell themselves.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to place on record my horror at the company's entering into competition with local merchants in the sale of any kind of retail goods that they have not hitherto sold.  In other words, I do not think that the company should be allowed to go into the retail trade of goods which they have not been retailing in the past.  If they are allowed to do that, it would certainly be to the detriment of local merchants and the local towns eventually.</P>
    <P>There is some kind of unwritten law by which co-operative societies had, more or less, a monopoly or a right to trade in a particular area for themselves. I am sure that is done after consultation with the officials of the Department.  At any rate, there are boundaries beyond which one co-operative society may not enter into competition with another co-operative society.  The same applies with regard <Col N="580" /> to the co-operative societies and the Dairy Disposals Company.  I have in mind an extensive area where there are 300 or 400 farmers, good, hardworking, industrious farmers who can get more out of an acre than farmers in any other part of the country.  These people have no market for their milk.  There is a stretch of country extending from Glengarriff to Kealkil where there is a branch of the Drinagh Co-operative Society's creamery, and there is also a branch in Bantry, but the whole area from Snave, Coomhola, through the Borlin Valley to the Kerry border is absolutely unprovided for.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Dairy Disposals Company have time and again given the excuse of shortage of lorries and machinery.  Like the Glengarriff area, I hold that these excuses can apply no longer, and that the Drinagh Co-operative Society should get instructions to provide creamery facilities for that area or the Dairy Disposals Company should provide them.  It would be very easy for one or the other to put a travelling creamery on the road from Bantry or Kealkil.  The Drinagh Co-operative Society could put a travelling creamery on the road to take in all that country and return to Kealkil with the cream.  If they refuse to do that and say that this valley does not belong to their area, I think the Dairy Disposals Company should be asked by the Minister to proceed with the work there.  They could very easily work it in from Kilgarvan, over the hill to the Borlin Valley and on to Glengarriff and back to Kenmare or Castletownbere.  I trust that steps will be taken immediately to provide creamery facilities for that area which appears to be no man's land, in so far as the co-operative societies are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another similar area which is right in the heart of the Drinagh Co-operative Society's territory, if I may call it so, the Mealagh Valley. The end of this valley is only about eight miles from the creamery itself and the people on both sides of the Mealagh River have not been given proper creamery facilities.  They are hard-working and industrious farmers who have been producing milk and are <Col N="581" /> anxious to produce, but cannot get a satisfactory market for it, being too far away from the creamery.  It is clearly the duty of the Drinagh Co-operative Society to put a travelling creamery in that valley and so give the people there an opportunity to market their milk.</P>
    <P>This co-operative society has another area in its territory which is worthy of more consideration&mdash;Whiddy Island, in Bantry Bay.  This island has a very industrious, intelligent and hardworking population of farmers.  They have excellent land and very good cattle.  Time and again, we have made representations to the Drinagh Co-operative Society to provide some creamery facilities on the island.  What they want is a separating station, so that the cream can be brought across to Bantry by the boat which plies with the post every day.  The Drinagh Co-operative Society's officials have examined this matter and they have given various excuses, but during all the years no creamery facilities have been provided for Whiddy Island.  It is within two miles of Bantry town and has good farmers, good land, good cattle and a good supply of milk.  I trust that the Minister will be able to renew representations to the Drinagh Co-operative Society and, if they still refuse to provide the facilities, that some arrangement will be made by which the Dairy Disposals Company will collect the cream there.</P>
    <P>On the southern side of that constituency, the Dairy Disposals Company have been operating for the past couple of years and have succeeded in providing a much-wanted market for milk in the Goleen area.  This was also a very remote area for which co-operative societies refused to cater, and the people of the area have expressed their satisfaction with the provision made by the Dairy Disposals Company; but I am not satisfied that the company has done as much organisation in that peninsula between Skibbereen and Mizen Head as they could have done in the past 12 months or two years.  It is quite true that they have provided this very much-wanted market for milk in the Goleen area, but they have built a centre at Aughadown and have not yet <Col N="582" /> succeeded in organising the areas in between.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, either, with the way the company has handled the area around Ballydehob.  As the House is aware, the Dairy Disposals Company took over the interests of creamery proprietors in that area and they have been dilly-dallying too long with the Ballydehob area.  In my opinion, they have not played fair with the local creamery proprietors while they have entered into competition with them in taking milk from that area.</P>
    <P>The farmers of that area have long been requesting that a stop for a creamery will be provided there and they are still awaiting the provision of a stop for a travelling creamery which would be central in that area.  With all the speed made in earlier years by this company, I cannot understand why they have not succeeded in organising that area to a greater extent and with more efficiency.</P>
    <P>The position regarding all these areas that I have mentioned is really urgent and could be remedied with very little loss of time if the company got down to it.  The position of the farmers who were depending on marketing their butter in the past is now definitely very critical, and the only way they can be helped is to provide a market for their milk.  I trust the Minister will consider the position regarding the areas I have mentioned and remedy matters in the way I have suggested or, possibly, in some better way, with the least possible delay.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal goirid a rá faoin scéin tábhachtach sin a chuir Rialtas Fianna Fáil ar bun i nGaeltacht Thír Chonail anuiridh nó i dtús na bliana sco.  Táim ag trácht ar an scéim chéanna a ndearna an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin tagaint di, scéim na dtithe gloine.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go raibh brón agus íontas orainn go léir nach raibh an tAire sásta dul ar aghaidh leis an scéim sin nó leis an scéim a mhéadú nó a leathnú ar  na Gaeltachta go léir.  Sin í an intins a bhí ag Rialtas Fianna Fáil, go raibh siad leis an scéim a leathnú ar fud na Gaeltachta chun cuidiú le saol na ndaoine sna límistéir sin.  Ba mhaith liom insint don Aire go bhfuil an scéim <Col N="583" /> sin ag dul ar aghaidh go h-an-mhaith i dTír Chonaill.  Gach aon duine atá baint aige leis an scéim, tá sé íontach sásta leis an dóigh a bhfuil sé ag  aghaidh agus táid den bharúil gur cheart an scéim a leathnú agus na tithe gloine a chur ar bun ins na háiteacha nach bhfuil an scéim sin ag obair go fóill.</P>
      <P>Tá brón orm, dá réir, go bhfuil saol níos measa ag muintir Thír Chonaill i mbliana nar mar a bhí de blianta.  Tá níos mó imithe ón Ghaeltacht ná d'imigh le 20 bliain.  Tá scéim na móna críochnaithe agus, mar is eol don Aire, níl an talamh ansin maith go leor le daoine a choinneáil sa bhaile agus caithfidh an Rialtas scéimeanna den tsort seo, scéimeanna cosúil le tithe gloine, a chur ar bun le cuidiú leis na daoine ansin gléas beatha a bhaint amach ins an phairt sin den tír.</P>
      <P>Má tá an scéim ag dul ar aghaidh go maith i dTír Chonaill, tá mise den bharúil gur cheart don Aire a rá linn go bhfuil sé fá choinne cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht agus na tigthe seo a chur sna háiteacha nach bhfuil siad ann go fóill.  Tá mise den bharúil go bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh mar sin agus gur cheart don Aire smaointiú ar aon Ghaeltacht nach bhfuair na tithe sin go fóill agus cuidiú leis na daoine annsin sa dóigh céanna a chuidigh Rialtas Fianna Fáil le paráiste chloich Chinn Fhaolaigh, i dTír Chonaill agus paráiste eile i gCo. na Gaillimhe.  Tá sé íontach deacair a thuiscint go bhfuil an Rialtas &mdash;mar tá an Rialtas&mdash;ag dul ag sábháil airgid ar scéimeanna den tsort sin san am céanna iad ag iarraidh daoine a choinneáil beo ins an nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Cloisimid cuid mhaith de na Teachtaí ag cainnt faoin nGaeltacht agus chomh tábhachtach is atá sé scéimeanna a bheapadh leis an aos óg a choinneáil sa chaile agus saol na ndaoine d'fheabhsú. Ba cheart don Aire dul ar aghaidh leis an scéim a chuir an Rialtas deiridh ar bun.  Níor thug sé seans éigin don scéim sin agus ba cheart dó amharc isteach sa cheist agus, má tá sé ag dul ar aghaidh go maith, insint don Dáil agus do lucht na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé fá choinne an scéim a mhéadú agus a leathnú ar fúd na Gaeltachta go léir.</P>

      <P>It appears, according to the Deputies who belong to the Fianna Fáil Party that the law that I have just read out of the Constitution&mdash;&ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with the law&rdquo;&mdash;is to be the fundamental right of only such citizens of this State as are not farmers.  I have just said that these words are taken from the Constitution but they first appeared upon the standards of the Land League.  We invoked them and those who went before us invoked them to establish the principle that the people of this country who live and get their living on the land would have the right to stand upon their threshold and forbid any man to cross it until they invited him.  There was a good deal of blood spilt in this country and a good deal of suffering undergone to establish that no landlord and no land-lord's bailiff would force his way into any kitchen in this country until the farmer, large or small, ten acres or 1,000 acres, invited him in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very well; I believe that that is just as true to-day and just as well worth fighting for in 1948 as it was in 1878, and I want to re-establish the doctrine in this country that, on the holdings of our people, no officer of my Department, from the Minister down to the most junior officer, shall have the right to enter uninvited.  If the people of this country want a different rule of law, then they must have a different Minister because, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, no officer of my Department will use my name to force his way unwanted, in the ordinary discharge of his duty, on to the holding of any free citizen of this country.

    <P>There is no Government, foreign or domestic, that will keep our people on the land in the position of hewers of wood and drawers of water.

That day is over.  The farmers of this country are now the big men, the farmers of this country are now the people that matter and it is the interest of the farmers of this country which will be the first charge upon the Government that we now have.  Is that clear to everybody?  When I say &ldquo;the farmers of this country&rdquo;, I mean the men and women who live upon the land and get their living on the land, whether they be tenant purchasers of their land or the agricultural workers, moving with dignity about their work, hoping that they some day will also enter the privileged ranks of those who are to be farmer-proprietors in due time.  There is no step forward that the farmers of this country can make in prestige or comfort that may be made with justice unless those who own the land and enjoy its fruits remember that, as their prosperity progresses, they have an obligation in justice to share it with the workers who work for them.</P>

      <P>Now, Sir, I cannot find it in me to resent Deputy Burke's intervention, because I am conscious of not having been guiltless myself, in extenuation of which I direct to your attention that on the first day I sat in this debate for four hours, on yesterday I sat for 14 hours, and to-day I have sat for nine hours.  Fifty-four speeches have been made upon this Estimate, and I confess that I was not born a patient man&mdash;and we cannot be other than what God made us.  I glory in the fact that there were 54 speeches made.  This is one of the last free Parliaments in the world.  God keep it so.  I do not think Deputy Smith did himself much credit in speaking for four hours, but he had the right to do that if he wanted to, and there is something glorious in the knowledge that there is a Ceann Comhairle presiding over our proceedings who will defend that right and maintain it, whether the Deputy who does speak for four hours sits on the Front Bench or in the least significant seat this House provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have been, on occasion, less <Col N="587" /> placid than the Chair would have wished, I must plead in extenuation nearly 30 hours' listening, with an introduction of four hours by Deputy Smith, whose peroration on the first day was: &ldquo;I am a wonderful man, there is no doubt about it, and there is not a member of this Party of mine who does not believe it.  That is the main thing about it.&rdquo;  When he got up again for another two hours the next day, he said it was a source of amazement to him that the radio did not report anything he said and the evening paper did not print anything he said&mdash;and when you read the Official Report since, is it any wonder, when they tried to make out of that something to put on the radio or in the evening paper, do the best they could, they could make neither head nor tail of it?</P>
    <P>Some charitable soul, sitting up overnight with a wet towel around his head, endeavoured to make something of it for the morning paper and, to the eternal credit of the Press, I must say that, apart from some of his wilder extravagances, it did appear at least coherent, which it most unquestionably was not for those who heard him.  I plead again, in extenuation, that I was constrained to listen to lamentations for the decline in the number of calves, from the greatest calf butcher in history, Deputy Dr. Ryan.  There is no man whose arms are more deeply steeped in the blood of calves than Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I then was obliged to listen to a Fianna Fáil T.D. up there who worked himself into a passion because the neighbouring woman could get only 1/9 or 2/- for her farmers' butter.  In the next breath he accused me of having started a black market in butter at 3/6 per lb., and thought it was nothing wonderful to say these two things in two consecutive breaths.  Then I had to listen to Deputy Walsh spluttering about the value of the fat cattle that went to the Continent last year and that compared with the fats that were sent to England, the reason being that his own colleague, Deputy Smith, went over to London last November and after great craving and begging there got the <Col N="588" /> British Minister for Agriculture to increase the price of fat cattle by 5d. a lb., on the strict understanding that it would be cut to 4d. on the 1st of March.  When the increase was given the fats went to England.  They had been sitting on the land because they could not get out, and it was because they could not get out that Deputy Smith went to London last autumn.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to deal categorically and exhaustively with the measure of my offending according to Fianna Fáil.  I understand it comes down to the glass-houses, the inspectors and the farm buildings scheme.  These are my principal crimes, I understand.  I sometimes think they are mad because they must know I have the files and the documents to answer them.  Do they think I am a fool or that I am going to allow them to blackguard or misrepresent me when I have the particulars here in front of me?  A time must come, sooner or later, when they will so exhaust my patience that I will read out the whole file.  That is what I am going to do now in regard to the glass-house scheme.  Connemara is dying about the glass-house scheme.  Poor Deputy Smith and Deputy Ryan and their lovely glass-house scheme!  What is the history of the glass-house scheme?  I will tell the House.  It begins with a letter, &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo;, and then, of course, it is all in English.  Next, Proinnsias Mac Aogáin drops a hint to the then Minister for Agriculture that he would appear to be overlooking his duties and making &ldquo;a slight suggestion that he should invest a considerable sum of money in building glass-houses in Connemara&rdquo;. After a great deal of excogitation in the Department, An tAire Talmhaiochta replies on the 25th June, 1946, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Frank,</P>
    <P>You wrote me last September about a scheme for glass-house culture in Gaeltacht districts with particular reference to the growing of tomatoes and I replied to you giving you my opinion on the scheme a few days afterwards and promised to get the observations of the Department.</P>
    <P>I expressed the opinion in my <Col N="589" /> letter to you last September that outside tomatoes the prospects were much less hopeful.  I still think there is a small market for cucumbers.  We tried some years ago to encourage the production of grapes by putting on a tariff against the imported crop. We got no response and the tariff was dropped.  The Dublin market is very sensitive as regards peaches. The opportunity for expansion of peach-growing can be dismissed as negligible.</P>
    <P>The full merits of the scheme could, therefore, be assessed at a capital expenditure of £400,000 to £500,000 benefiting 1,000 growers with the possibility that these 1,000 producers would after a few years need a permanent subsidy to keep them in production and the strong probability that the full capital expenditure would never be repaid.  If your committee think that we should, notwithstanding, proceed I am prepared to ask the Department to go ahead.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no &ldquo;mise le meas&rdquo; in that letter.</P>
    <P>Here is the technical opinion given to the Department on the 10th September, 1946:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The arguments which can be advanced in support of the scheme are, we find, few and unconvincing whilst the objections are many and seemingly overwhelming.  A most important point for consideration is whether in view of the relatively small number of farmers to benefit an ambitious scheme involving such a considerable expenditure of public funds would be justified in view of the attendant risks of failure and loss to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1946.  Then the business went to sleep for a year, but it was dug up again.  I next find that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister had before him an officer's record of the conference held on the 12th instant in which the scheme was discussed in detail.  He said that he had little hope that this scheme would be a success if the Department had to impose conditions in regard to the repayment of cost of the houses as contemplated at conference <Col N="590" /> referred to.  He went on to say that in his opinion it was far more preferable to be prepared to lose entirely the cost of the erection of these houses rather than to impose conditions which would result in making it almost impossible to get people to take them up or if they are taken up to have the conditions such as would impair the success of the scheme.  He directed, therefore, that the Department should envisage the erection of these houses almost as a free gift and that for a number of years at least the owners should receive the total proceeds of the tomato crop less such expenditure as would be incurred in supervising the scheme and marketing the produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a very encouraging forecast.</P>
    <P>Twelve months later up she bobs again on the 20th June, 1947, but this time there is an interesting addendum: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance is to be kept fully informed through the private secretary to the Minister for Agriculture of progress and development.&rdquo;  It becomes increasingly clear that every time this comes up to the Department of Agriculture it is put to bed, and every time they put it to bed the Minister for Finance digs it out again.</P>
    <P>Then we proceed to the stage in which we are to acquire the land for the central station.  In Knock-Carraroe area it was found on investigation, however, that there was only one site of approximately half an acre that was really suitable.  Following negotiation, we secured this site at the rate of £400 per acre.  It is nice to keep the wheel turning in Carraroe.  But not to be outdone, we went to Gortahork and we located a suitable three-quarters of an acre there, and we took it for a 25-year lease at an annual rate of £20 a year.  As long as people can get £20 a year for three-quarters of an acre of land in Gortahork there is no need for tomato houses.</P>
    <P>That is the position with which I was confronted when I came into office. As far as I could find out, the general impression in my Department, as far as expert opinion was concerned, was that there was no prospect whatever of these people being able to earn on these tomatoes sufficient money to pay <Col N="591" /> back the capital commitments for which they made themselves liable under the agreement.  The amount, I think, was £150 in respect of each house constructed.  I foresaw a situation in which, when the time came for the people to pay it back, they would not be able to do so, and instead of conferring a benefit on each of them they were being saddled with a burden under which they had been urged to go.  I did not think it was just to allow a situation to develop in which, to my mind, they would seriously embarrass themselves, and I recommended that the scheme be stopped.  Father Moran came up here and shouted at me very loudly and I shouted at him.  Next, Father Eaton came along.  Father Eaton is a young curate there.  He said to me: &ldquo;Minister, these people, rightly or wrongly, believe that they have a claim in natural justice to the performance of what they understood to be a promise of a Minister of State to carry out the undertakings they had been given.&rdquo; Rightly or wrongly, I replied: &ldquo;Father Eaton, if these people believe that they have a claim in natural justice to the performance of what they understood to be the promise of a Minister for State, that is an argument I cannot resist.  Communicate with those persons who did not get a glass-house built for them as a result of the direction I have given and tell them that if they write in and say that they believe that in natural justice that they have a claim to the performance of the promise of a Minister of State, I will direct a glass-house to be built for them.&rdquo;  Most of them wrote in, with the exception, I think, of three, and the houses were built.</P>
    <P>The Deputy from Connemara and Deputy Breslin seemed to suggest that consequent on that I did my best to frustrate the scheme.  That is an unworthy kind of misrepresentation.  Far from that being so, I directed the officer appointed by my predecessor to supervise the scheme to be whole time with explicit instructions that nothing in his power to do should be left undone in order to make this a success if it could be made a success, and if any additional help or alteration <Col N="592" /> should be brought into operation in order to make it a success, not to hesitate to let us know, and if it was humanly possible to do it, it would be done.  The same applied to Gortahork. The matter that must be rectified now is the sale of the tomatoes.  I got offers for them and I do not think those offers were fair.  I would be obliged to the Deputies from these constituencies if they could do anything to get better and fairer prices.  If I cannot sell them locally I will bring them to the Dublin market if need be.  One thing is certain, however, I am not going to let anyone get away with the idea that because the fruit happens to be in Connemara or Gortahork, it can be bought at rubbish prices, because it can not.  If necessary I will bring it to Dublin and sell it in the usual way on commission in the market as any other dealer would sell it.  But it should be possible to sell it in Galway or Sligo or in towns in Donegal and get a reasonable price.  It would be better to sell it locally as it would save on transport, but it will not be sold at rubbish prices.  If any distributor thinks he has got a soft bargain there let him think again.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will permit me I would like to ask one question. From listening to what he has said, it might be thought that the Minister would have some trouble with people who have glass-houses.  I understand, however, that there is a clause in the agreement between the Department of Agriculture and the grower, the man upon whose land the glass-house is, that in the event of his not paying, the Department has the right to remove the structure, and in the event of the grower saying that he does not want to go ahead, he can ask the Department to remove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say to the Deputy, and that I may say it with the full approval of the Government, that the people engaged in this scheme are not going to be salted.  We will do our level best to make a success of it.  My advice to them is to do their best to make a success of it, but that they are not going to be left in a state of serious loss as a result of its success or failure. <Col N="593" /> That is what both the Minister of the Deputy's Party and my Party intend whether it is in the agreement or not.</P>
      <P>That is the story of the tomatoes. There is nothing I have done which, if I had to do it all again, I would not do exactly as before.  I think the scheme is a thoroughly rotten one and I wanted to protect as many as I could from becoming involved in it, but when it was represented to me that they believed they had a claim in natural justice to the performance of the promise of a Minister of State I could not resist that representation and accordingly I changed my mind.  If it is a crime to yield to that kind of argument, I committed that crime of changing my mind under the coercion of an argument which I felt I could not deny.  If I had to do the same thing at the present moment I would do it without the slightest hesitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next iniquity I am accused of is the question of inspectors.  I have said 100 times that I strenuously object to the system of sending out inspectors to snoop around our people's homes telling them to do this or that.  A vicious piece of misrepresentation was started by which the Fianna Fáil Party sought to create the impression that the strictures that I passed on that system were aimed, not at the inspectors who considered themselves or who wished to think of themselves as the masters of our people, but at the instructors of the Department of Agriculture, the overseers and assistant overseers who have moved among the people and always helped them in their work.  It is true technically that they are all known in my Department as inspectors, but the best way, perhaps, to express the difference between them is that it is the same as the difference between &ldquo;múinteoir&rdquo; and &ldquo;cigire&rdquo;, and it is the &ldquo;cigire&rdquo; I am talking about.  But I want to say that when we spoke, when I spoke, in terms of stringent condemnation of the system of sending inspectors here and sending them there, as I have said on many occasions, those strictures should not fall on the inspectors themselves, but upon the system that has called them. For that we in this House are responsible.  We made the law, we <Col N="594" /> sent them out.  I do not believe that they enjoy, any more than any of us would, breaking in on their neighbours' land and interfering with their neighbours' day-to-day work, but we told them to do it.</P>
    <P>It was the system we created and by which we sent them out that I have always been concerned to denounce and destroy.  I am glad to think that the day has come when I have the power to destroy it and, please God, it will never raise its head again.  But let me add this.  Tillage inspectors have been appointed every year since compulsory tillage came into force. For the last five years when June and July came all the tillage inspectors were dismissed.  I would not permit the dismissal of a single one of them until I first found out who were the married men amongst them and recommended that every married man should be kept on as long as it was possible to keep him.  The second category was those men who had qualifications, who had shown a desire to get on and improve themselves.  For the remainder of single men without family responsibilities the rule was to apply rigidly&mdash; last man in, first man out.  No one was to be dismissed until we published an advertisement in the papers asking anyone who wanted a land steward or a farm manager to send in an application so that we might recommend some of these young men for interview with a view to getting them employment rather than kicking them out the door. These are the facts.  Yet I am represented as not looking after their welfare having a personal animus against them and desiring in any way I could to humiliate them before the public. In fact I am the only Minister for Agriculture who has ever concerned himself about their welfare or sought to secure employment for them.  I am continuing at the present moment to do all I can in that direction and shall continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about farm buildings.  I am told that I came in here to mislead the House and that my concern was falsely to suggest that the reason why the farm buildings scheme was being held over for the constructional work until next year was because there was a shortage of supplies.  The <Col N="595" /> most strident accuser was Deputy Smith.  The only difference between Deputy Smith and me in regard to this matter is that I came in and told the House the truth and that Deputy Smith came in with exactly the same information and told them what was not true.  Deputy Lemass is now as quiet as a mouse.  Why is he as quiet as a mouse?  Because I have a letter from him forbidding Deputy Smith to put a stone upon a stone in 1948, and I am going to read it:</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;9th December, 1947.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Paddy,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reply is being sent by this post to your Department's minute of 4th December regarding your scheme of grants for the improvement of farm buildings.  You will see that the reply sounds a note of warning regarding cement supplies.  Though the cement factories are in full production the demand is more than the supply and difficulty is being experienced in getting cement for the building and engineering work at present in progress. The shortage will, I fear, be more than a temporary one.  We shall try to make supplies available but it would be impossible for us to give you an assurance that you will get your full requirements for your scheme even on the restricted basis which you propose for 1948-49.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am held up as an iniquitous criminal for coming in and telling the House that the Minister for Local Government had stopped all building except the building of houses for residence and had bespoken all the supplies of cement available; that, in addition to that, we had a strike in the cement factories&mdash;I did not know that when I spoke first; that is only a recent development;&mdash; that I was warned by the Minister for Local Government, and rightly warned, that he has first claim on all cement; that after that certain essential industrial requirements were necessary and that there were certain categories of work for which cement would not be released.  Like a simpleton, I came into the House and told the truth. Wait until you hear what the former Minister for Agriculture told the House.  He is not such an innocent as <Col N="596" /> I am.  He knows how to put a gloss upon it.  Listen to this evidence of frank, open, ingenuous, Parliamentary procedure. Deputy P. J. Burke on the 11th December asked the Minister for Agriculture when he intended to introduce the scheme for grants for the improvement and reconstruction of farm outhouses and in reply the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A scheme for the improvement of farm buildings has been prepared by my Department and I hope to be in a position to announce it soon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we get these pink documents the way they are made up is this: There is the question and there is the answer which we read out and here are the secret bits.  If they come at you again, here is your ammunition.  Down at the foot of this, with a star in front of it, is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce has now replied pointing out that progress under the proposed scheme must be restricted to the rate justified by cement supplies, which are expected to be barely sufficient in 1948/49 for the continuance of building and engineering work on the present scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ammunition was kept in the pouch that time.  Maybe Deputy Burke had something whispered in his ear behind the Ceann Comhairle's chair, but the voters in the impending general election did not hear it.</P>
    <P>Now a great miracle took place about this farm buildings scheme; one of the greatest miracles since Moses struck the rock.  This farm buildings scheme, after two years' fermentation, suddenly blossomed forth from the head of the Minister for Agriculture.  Do you know when the egg was hatched, when the bird stepped forth?  About three weeks after the by-elections.  Then the correspondence was resumed.  Then the scheme was formulated.  Deputies know the procedure of getting a scheme formulated, circulated to the Department, commented upon by the Department and referred to the Government. Even the youngest Minister knows the dreary tedium of that procedure.  But, my gracious me, the procedure was streamlined on this occasion.  It went <Col N="597" /> through like a knife through a cheese. Do you know the day the advertisement was published?  The 31st December.  I do not believe that in the history of Great Britain or Ireland for the last 400 years was there ever a Government notice published on the 31st December.  But this had to be published as quick as lightning.  Why? So that the forms could be stereotyped and sent out to every agricultural overseer and every assistant agricultural overseer throughout the country to tell them that we were going to rebuild every barn and hay shed and everything else on the holding of anybody who did what was necessary on the fatal day.  When that advertisement was published there was neither staff, organisation, plan nor idea of how they were going to handle the work that was inevitably going to develop.</P>

      <P>I think it is just as well to let matters of that kind rest.  It is disgusting for one Minister to be reciting the peccadilloes of another and God knows that I have not said anything sensational about that scheme since I came into office.  I said I could not go on with it this year.  Is that not so?  But there is a limit.  I have been jibed at and I have been held up to ridicule of a fair and reasonable kind from time to time.  However, when the whole debate of the Agricultural Estimate, 27 hours, is devoted to proving that I am a fraud and a liar&mdash;when in my hands is resting the proof of the fact that my only sin is that I told the Deputies the truth while my predecessor in office came in and told them what he thought it would be prudent to tell them&mdash;I think, in justice to myself and my colleagues, I ought to speak out. It is a vicious, mean thing to go round the country misleading decent, simple people.  That is what Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have been doing. They have been out to tell the people that the farm improvements scheme is abandoned.  It is not.  Every single penny appropriated for that scheme will be spent on it&mdash;as much more next year and the year after until every <Col N="598" /> penny that is necessary to reclaim every acre of the land of this country that requires reclamation has been spent.</P>
      <P>I am not going to promise and I cannot promise that it will be done like that if we have not the money.  We must do it in stages year by year with our resources.  I do say, however, that I am quite satisfied that if Marshall Aid came to us by way of grant and we were allowed to use that grant money inside our economy a great part of it could be added to our annual resources to expedite the work.  That is why I said that with Marshall Aid it could be done in five years but that if we have to depend on our own resources we may have to spread it out over 25 years.  But whether it is 25 years or five years, if we remain in office, we will keep at it until the work is done.  In saying that let me record that when we finish that work it will be right and proper to look back and remember that, by whatever inspiration or advice or encouragement he may have got, it was Deputy Dr. Ryan who started it.</P>

The Deputy must excuse me if I sometimes suspect him of intervening not in good faith and if I give him a sharp reply.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he is now intervening in good faith.  We will spend every penny that is appropriated now.  We will appropriate next year, I hope, the same amount, if not a larger one, and the next year and the next year and the next year and as many years as we are the Government of the country until the work is done.  If into that picture there should be injected the Marshall Aid money then we will be able to undertake a very much <Col N="599" /> larger scheme so that the work to be done will be done more rapidly and that the whole area of the country will be restored to productivity much sooner than it can be if we only have our own resources to depend upon.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Two ghosts are now laid low.  I shall now deal with the specific questions that were put to me.  Great play was made here to-day about what I said at the ploughing dinner.  This is what I did say&mdash;let us get it accurate.  I said that but for the fact that I believe in individual liberty I would make it illegal to plough land with a horse in this country. Is that clear?  If anybody misunderstands it I shall repeat it.  The agricultural worker has a minimum wage throughout the greater part of this country of 55/- a week.  Frankly I am ashamed to name it.  Fifty-five shillings a week!  He is the lowest paid worker in the English-speaking world and that is something of which I am bitterly ashamed.  There is no means that I know of to get for that highly-skilled craftsman an adequate wage if we do not put into his hand the modern implement that will enable him to use to the limit of his capacity the gift that God gave him.  The industrial worker is working with the machines and implements of 1948.  The agricultural worker is using the same horse and the same plough that was being dragged through the soil of this country 80 years ago.  Eighty years ago!  He is being paid in 1948 on the basis of a performance capacity which his great-grandfather had 70 years ago.  That man working a fair day will plough half an Irish acre with a pair of horses and a plough.  Put him on a Ferguson or a Fordson tractor and he will plough three acres of the same land.  Now, if he does six times as much work simply by changing the implement that is put into his hands surely to God there is nobody in this House or this country who will suggest that he will still get 55/- a week.  Am I right or am I wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now do you see why I said that but for the fact that I believe in individual liberty I would make it illegal to <Col N="600" /> plough land with a hand-plough and a horse?  Was I not right?</P>

      <P>Now, Deputy Smith referred to a story that was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> about my intention of taking all the controls off the bacon. I am a great believer, when a fight is over, in letting the dust die down&mdash; forget it and get on with the job.  But I am not in favour of letting a bone go with any dog; and, if Deputy Smith wants to open that up again, I shall give him his answer.  If Deputy Smith wants any information about that I would invite him to go and have a chat with Deputy MacEntee, because he knows a lot about it.  I know a lot about it, too, that Deputy MacEntee does not know I know.  Deputy Smith, poor fellow, never knew what was going on at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into office there was a certain warrior in this country and I knew well that he had been forcing up the price of pigs to create an impossible situation and, at the same time, to draw into his bacon factory the bulk of the pigs to be slaughtered.  All his competitors were saying: &ldquo;What the devil is X on to; he is paying 210/- and 215/- for pork and the fixed price for bacon is 200/-; what in the world is he up to?&rdquo;  X knew well what he was up to.  I was not long in office until there was a hullabaloo; the poor bacon curers and the pork butchers were &ldquo;kilt&rdquo; and the solution of the whole thing would be to take all the controls off and in about a month everything would settle itself.  But in that month one particular warrior would have disposed of 4,000 cwts of bacon at 5/- per lb.  It was that same warrior that pedalled that article that appeared in the <i>Irish Times,</i> first to the <i>Irish</i><Col N="601" /><i>Press,</i> but &ldquo;old faithful&rdquo; would not publish it; he was too cute.  Then it was brought around to the <i>Irish Independent</i> and they would not publish it; and out it came in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  There was great hope that the golconda was about to open up for the warrior that had the nest egg, but he got a golconda that he was not expecting.  I shifted the nest egg and I distributed it over the rest of the curers in the country; and I met him&mdash;as the bulk of the curers wanted to do.  I found the vast majority of the curers honest, straightforward men, just as anxious as I was to put an end then and there to the rotten transactions that were going on and which were attributable to a very small minority of their number.  Every pound of that bacon came out of the nest egg and was freely distributed.  I am glad to tell the House that I was able to say to the bulk of the curers: &ldquo;If I leave the fair operation of this business to yourselves to run it voluntarily will you give me your word of honour that, whatever bacon we can gather in, will be equitably and honestly distributed?&rdquo; That has been in operation for about six weeks and it has operated fairly and justly and honourably and, I believe, not infrequently at considerable expense to the curers themselves.</P>
    <P>I think it is due to them that I should say that and I think they have done that in the belief that I am doing my best to increase the supplies of pigs and feeding-stuffs and that they will benefit from that when their trade returns to normal; and that it is up to them to lend a hand until we can restore the pig industry.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that there were more pigs on offer in Clonmel last market day than have been there for the past ten years.  There are certain other indelicate statistics I could give but I think propriety requires me to give them individually and privately to Deputy O'Leary.  I may say, however, that they are of a rather reassuring character and give promise of an early bacon increase.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I want to turn is the suggestion that I am entirely indifferent to the price of milk.  I am not.  But here is an issue joined&mdash;if <Col N="602" /> there is an issue&mdash;between me and some of the representatives of the dairy farmers.  I said to them: &ldquo;Satisfy Oireachtas Éireann that the cows kept by suppliers of milk to dairies or to creameries have a reasonable milk output of from 500 to 600 gallons and I will request the Government, of which I am a member to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the people producing milk from these cows will get a fair price for it; but I am not going to ask our people or our Government to give a price for milk in order that you improvident farmers, whose cows yield 300 gallons per lactation, will get a good profit, because it cannot be done.&rdquo;  It is a waste of land.  It is a waste of a farmer's skill and it is a waste of time to try to operate the dairying industry on 300-gallon cows.</P>
    <P>I have asked the co-operative creamery societies throughout the country to set up cow-testing associations and to come to me with a plan. If I can possibly help them, or facilitate them in getting them money, or maintaining them, I will, in order that we can get a pretty general average of between 500 and 600 gallons of milk from every cow whose milk is going to a creamery; and I will guarantee, if we arrive at that point, the Government of which I am a member will see that the farmers who keep those cows get a price for their milk which will entitle them to carry on with a reasonable margin of profit for the work they do.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say two things.  I am ashamed of my life of the conditions under which the supervisors of the cow-testing associations work. They are doing invaluable work for the dairying industry of the country and for the agricultural industry as a whole.  They are scandalously paid. When I met them in Mallow three or four months ago I promised them that I would look into their case and try to work out a scheme which would enable us to employ them on reasonable terms. I have to confess that I have not yet been able to get around to that.  It was not for want of the will; it was for want of the way.  I was not physically able to do it.  It is something which we ought to do.  It is something I do not see we can do without the help of the <Col N="603" /> co-operative societies.  I wish that I could find one co-operative society that would come to me and say: &ldquo;We will require every supplier sending milk to our creamery to join a cow-testing association.&rdquo;  If I can find one society to do that I will ask the Government to authorise me to give them generous financial assistance so as to enable them to employ supervisors on a fair and reasonable basis, to look after those cattle.</P>
    <P>Some of these are married men with families.  They earn a few pounds a week.  They are barely able to live, struggling around on bicycles in all sorts of weather and, as a result, chucking the job.  I regard that as a great misfortune.  It is a matter in which I would be very glad to have the help of some co-operative society in order to bring it to an end so that by that example others might be induced to do something along the same lines.</P>
    <P>Now, a lot of people have said that one of the difficulties about the creamery business is that you cannot get fellows and girls to milk cows.  I think that that is true and I do not blame them.  Why should they take work sitting under a cow and getting slapped in the face with the cow's tail if they can get a good job in the town? If we want people to do agricultural work we have to make that agricultural work as agreeable as rival forms of occupation.  It is perfectly possible &mdash;there is nothing marvellous or extravagant about it&mdash;to aim at providing any dairy farmer with 15 or more cows with a portable milking machine that can be pulled on to the field where the cows are and have the cows milked by machinery on the field.  There is no need to have any elaborate installation or anything else.  It is as common as kiss my hand all over England.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a single cow in New Zealand milked by hand&mdash;not one&mdash;and many of them are 12, 14 or 16-cow men.  It is a detail to which people do not attach much importance, but there is not a single cow in New Zealand stripped by hand, because it was discovered there, under the pressure of shortage of labour, that if cows are accustomed to be milked by <Col N="604" /> machine from the first lactation, stripping by hand becomes unnecessary. That is a detail, but it is that kind of thing that makes all the difference between agricultural work being slavery for a young person and analogous to regular industrial employment, which permits of people having regular hours and a reasonable respite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne was very wicked when he was talking about agricultural labourers.  I agree with Deputy Dunne. I think agricultural labourers ought to have a weekly half-holiday and seven days' holiday every year.  But the majority of the people do not think that&mdash;and this is a democratic country. I am doing what I can to persuade the majority of the people to come to our point of view.  I am trying to do what I can to encourage the majority of the people to put in an installation and equipment that will make such a proposal practical politics, because if we do not do it young people will not stay on the land and we may make up our minds to do these things when it is too late and the young people are gone off the land.</P>
    <P>But there is no use in Deputy Dunne and I believing that we can take the whole population by the throat and make them do what we want.  We shall have to persuade them that we are right and that they would be wise and prudent to accept our view.  I am doing my part; let Deputy Dunne do his.  But he does not help when, in order to make Deputy MacEntee's flesh creep, he says &ldquo;I would be in favour of municipalising the milk supply&rdquo;. There are a whole lot of men in this Dáil and, when you say that, their hair stands on end and they say &ldquo;He is a Bolshie&rdquo;.  By municipalising I do not know what he means, and I do not believe that he does either.  Does he mean that the municipality is to own 15,000 cows and milk them morning and evening?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be allowed to explain?  I meant to convey that I believe the true solution for the present scandalous state of the milk supply in the City of Dublin is the municipalisation of the distribution of milk.  There is nobody here appreciates more keenly than I do the difficulty that would be <Col N="605" /> entailed by the municipalisation of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I know what the Deputy means, but I have not such a love for bureaucracy as to believe that that is going to work.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee who distributes the milk, provided the people get it clean and at a low price.  I know of no way in which I can get milk into the poorer sections in Lower Dominick Street or Gardiner Street in a clean and cheap condition except by pasteurising.  In theory, if we have tuberculin tested grade A milk herds we ought to get milk without any tuberculosis or contamination; but if, in effect, we succeed in getting that, it would be cheaper to give the people mulled claret because the cost of producing that high standard of perfect cleanliness would be prohibitive. The precautions necessary involve expense which would bring the milk to such a price that the people could not afford it and it would be absolutely out of the question.</P>
      <P>By careful supervision we must do the best we can to see that milk is handled in as clean a way as possible. We must pasteurise it to see that no tubercle bacilli shall survive and reach little children.  One of the most important things is to make illegal the cardboard cap for the milk bottle.  I would require every milk distributor to use a paper cap for the reason that I have often seen fellows in the back streets of Dublin coming up with a tray of empty bottles which they have collected in exchange for full bottles; they fill them out of a can, take a handful of discs out of their pockets, and pop one on each bottle.  If they have to put a wire and paper cap on each bottle it will tighten them if they do not carry a machine with which to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best method of all is one I expect the new milk distributing body to employ, and that is to use nonreturnable, destructible cardboard containers.  These cannot be used again and they must be thrown away.  That is the best way.  I can assure the Deputy that municipalisation will not get rid of much, because the municipaliser is as liable to go up the back street and fill the bottles out of his <Col N="606" /> neighbour's can as is the base, bloody and brutal capitalist.</P>
    <P>I do not want to leave the inspectors without putting on record that I regard the agricultural instructors in the service of my Department and in the service of the county committees of agriculture, together with the overseers, the assistant overseers and the other instructors, as some of the most valuable servants this community has and, incidentally, some of the worst paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan complained that people find it hard to get fertilisers in sufficient quantities on credit.  I am amazed to hear that.  I have been for 25 years a shopkeeper in a small country town, Ballaghaderreen, and I had to put a shingle out calling on the people to buy manures from me on credit.  Any fellow I believed had the intention&mdash; even the intention&mdash;of paying, I took a flying leap at him.  Some of the best intentions misfired when it came to paying, but even if I believed they had the intention, I would give them the manure on credit.  To their eternal credit be it said that 99 per cent. of them paid.  Some were a bit tough and slow, but they paid in the heel of the hunt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Devil a much I got out of it.  I got 3d. a cwt. out of super, cash or credit&mdash;3d. on super and 6d. on fertiliser, and it was not philantrophy.  If I did not give it my neighbour would and I wanted to prevent him going to the neighbouring shop.  The same is true of all parts of rural Ireland. Where there is a commodity that everybody buys, competition is the boy to keep the price down.  If they come in for super they will buy tea.  In the country we do not go in for these grand shops where you have one place for super, another for tea and another for silk stockings.  But we are hopeful that when a man comes in for a bag of &ldquo;super&rdquo; he may buy a pair of silk stockings, a lb. of tea or maybe a teaset before he goes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera intervened and cautioned me that, although I was Minister for Agriculture, I owed a duty <Col N="607" /> to the citizens of the State and that I must be very careful not to push up the price of agricultural produce so as to leave the people of the towns and cities hungry and without the things they should have&mdash;the white-collar workers.  And this was going on within the ten minutes of Deputy Smith having torn passion to tatters and having advanced against me horse, foot and artillery, because I had not raised the price of everything high enough!</P>
    <P>Somebody asked me about the user of the Clare deposit of phosphate.  I should be glad to use the Clare deposit of phosphate if I knew how.  So far as I can find out, scientific research has established that the only means of using it or activating it is by raising it by some chemical process to a temperature of 380 degrees centigrade.  If anyone will propound a procedure whereby I can raise it to 380 degrees centigrade, without an expenditure which will make it dearer than gold dust by the time I have made &ldquo;super&rdquo; of it, I shall be glad to know of it.  I exhort any private enterprise which thinks that Clare phosphates can be activated without undue expense to turn their attention to it and exploit it so that it can be used for the benefit of the country.  I understand there is a prospect of developing a considerable lime deposit in the neighbourhood of the Clare phosphates.  If there is I shall be delighted to hear of it.</P>
    <P>I deal with Deputy Madden's trouble by saying that if he will produce the 500-gallon cow I shall go on campaigning to get a price for milk now and for all time which will yield a reasonable profit to the farmer.  A Deputy said that the £2,250,000 subsidy for butter is not a subsidy to the farmers of this country.  If the community as a whole will release butter and say to the farmers to go and sell where they like, we shall sell it on the foreign market without a penny subsidy.  The subsidy paid on butter is a subsidy to reduce the price of butter to our own people; but if our own people do not want to eat butter, if our own people say to the dairy farmers of the country that they are to sell their butter where they can get the best price, I can sell all the <Col N="608" /> creamery butter elsewhere without a subsidy and not reduce the price of milk by one farthing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned a case where he said some local officer of a county committee was pursuing an investigation regarding aphosphorosis and that we had stopped him.  The Deputy is mistaken in that because we provided a grant of £500 for further investigation in that area.  If that grant is not sufficient more money will be provided to carry on the inquiry to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Somebody said that a great solution of the milk production problem was to get proven bulls, that what has happened is that the Livestock Breeding Act has broken down and that beef-type bulls are being used, with the result that the average milk yield of cattle is declining.  That is quite a mistaken view but I agree that the only way by which you can be certain that you will raise the milk yield of your cattle is to use only proven bulls.  The difficulty of that is that you cannot satisfy yourself that a bull is a proven bull until he is seven years old.  You cannot start using him until he is over a year and you cannot know whether he is a beast of a quality to increase the milk yield until his granddaughter calves.  By that time the bull may be sold off because of the difficulty that most of our farms are small farms and a seven-year-old bull is a pretty unmanageable beast on a small holding where you have not got a large staff. Many bulls of that age get cross and are hard to manage.  All I can do is my best.</P>
    <P>I cannot shorten time.  I can only tell the House of a plan which I hope will produce results in time and it is this.  We have a place called Chantilly where we have a farm and keep imported beasts for a while and rest them before they are sent out to the country.  I am trying out a plan by which Chantilly will constitute a considerable dairy farm in which there will be from 40 to 50 tested cows.  Each bull we bring in we shall mate with a certain number of these cows and record the results.  When these bulls are sent down the country we shall keep track of them.  If the granddaughters <Col N="609" /> of a bull prove to be the progeny of a bull possessing the quality of an increased milk yield we shall recall that bull.  If artificial insemination proves to be as satisfactory and as successful a procedure as it seems likely to develop, we shall bring that bull to an artificial insemination centre for the three or four years of its useful life that remain and the maximum number of cows will be put into calf by what we know to be a proven bull having the faculty of passing on the milk yield quality.  It may take time to start and we may not get any more than three proven bulls in each year, but let us assume that it is possible to get 1,000 services from each bull.  In the first year you would have three, in the second year six and the third year nine and you then reach the point where you have 9,000 dairy cattle served by proven bulls.  That plan can be extended interminably but it will take time to work out.  In the meantime, the farm can be used as a dairy farm to provide Dublin with liquid milk and as a means of measuring whether the prices fixed for milk sold in Dublin are fair and equitable, bearing in mind the costings of a well-run dairy farm supplying milk to the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles spoke of the potentialities of Muinntir na Tíre and asked me to assist the formation of co-operative societies and activities of that kind among rural communities. Anything I can do to assist in the formation of co-operative societies of that description I shall gladly do whether it be in equipping them with farm machinery, or helping them to build a hall.  Any activity of a social character like that I shall be delighted to help. There is nothing further I can do.  I cannot be expected to go down to a parish in the country, take the people, as it were, by the back of the neck and tell them that if they do not form a co-operative society they will not be allowed to live but they have only got to ask for any reasonable assistance which they require to form a co-operative society and I shall ask the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, as well as Muinntir na Tíre, to help them, but I have not got their help yet.  They may come along with a plan soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> Deputy Giles rightly mentioned the rings which exploited the farmers of this country.  I have &ldquo;bust&rdquo; a couple of them and any more I can find I will &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, or &ldquo;bust&rdquo; in the attempt. I pledge my word to that&mdash;every blooming one of them.  Somebody complained about the tanglers meeting the cattle out the road.  I never saw a tangler coming out the road that I did not thank God for the sight.  Whenever the tanglers are coming out the road, there is a good fair.  No one but a fool ever sold his beast outside the fair green if he met a tangler on the road.  The road is a lonesome place, if there is a bad fair, but it is like an election meeting with tanglers, if prices are rising.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey spoke about the Cork milk situation.  I am blowed if I know what the Cork milk situation is.  Every second person from Cork tells me a very different story about the Cork milk situation.  I will make an offer: Let the Deputies for Cork City and any Deputy whose constituency contains part of an area supplying Cork City or part of an area that wants to supply Cork City, come together and then come to me, and, whatever they agree upon, I will do.</P>

    <P>With regard to the sewage compost business, that is my old friend, Sir Albert Howard.  When ever I meet a member of the Oxford Group, or a believer in Sir Albert Howard's theories, I can always tell them after the third sentence he utters what he belongs to. Both these beliefs seem to have some kind of mystic charm for the people who get bitten by them.  To be quite frank, I think there is a lot of nonsense talked about sewage conservation, but, <Col N="612" /> very prudently, my predecessor said: &ldquo;Let us refer the whole thing to a competent body of experts to examine the whole business up and down.  If it is worth doing we will do it and, if it is not, we will not.&rdquo;  That committee has been sitting and is at present working. As soon as I get its report I will send a copy to the Lord Mayor of Cork, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and to any other municipality interested, and I shall be glad to discuss with them whether they wish to process the material themselves and sell it, or to invite the Department to collaborate with them in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke about the provision of ground limestone and phosphate. I have deliberately left the business of producing limestone in the hands of private enterprise, because I believe that is the way I will get it done cheapest, but the costings I have heard so far envisage a price of 16/- at the pit.  I think it was Deputy Aiken or Deputy Ryan who envisaged the possibility of a contract service in which the man who ground the lime would undertake to bring it to the land and spread it for an all-in charge per acre.  I think that is an extremely good idea, if we can get a sufficient number of people to undertake it.</P>
    <P>In any case, I am glad to be able to tell the House at last that I have something concrete, instead of these hopes which trouble my friends across the House so terribly.  There is one plant up in Kilkenny.  It is there to see and to feel.  To tell the truth, I sometimes wondered whether I would ever be able to see and feel one but there is one there.  It should go into operation next month.  I am hoping that a very great many more will be established and the equipment for a very large one is at present on its way from the United States.  It is frightfully difficult to get delivery of this kind of machinery in Great Britain, but we have got one large plant coming from the United States for a man who is to do it, and, as soon as it comes, it will be erected, and I am not without hope that it will be grinding and distributing well before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I need not dwell on the young farmers' clubs.  I substantially agree <Col N="613" /> with Deputy O'Grady's estimate. Given that they maintain their independence and are firmly resolved that neither I nor any other Minister for Agriculture will dominate or control them, they are of incalculable value to this country; but once they become the appendage of any political organisation or any Government Department, instead of being valuable, they are a menace.  I do not doubt that they will be all right and I exhort them to keep that way.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Hughes who inquired what we were doing about blackleg in beet.  The answer is everything that it is humanly possible to do. Glasnevin and the Sugar Company are studying the matter with all their resources, but the plain fact is that nowhere in the world has it yet been determined precisely what is the source of the disease or what is its cure. Every conceivable resource in this country, the United States and elsewhere is being employed to try to track down the source and provide a remedy. Deputy Bartley also spoke of the incidence of disease in some of the tomato plants in the houses in Connemara. There has been disease, but I can reassure the Deputy that the disease which has occurred amongst certain of the plants in the tomato houses in Connemara is a seed-borne disease, and is not one which is calculated to spread from plant to plant. It comes in the seed and the plant which grows from the particular diseased seed will die, but there is no danger that if you have two or three other plants in a hothouse, they will wilt and die subsequently.  The presence of the diseased plant will not affect them.</P>
    <P>With regard to veterinary services, we have recently had transferred to our Department all the veterinary services of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and we are now in the process of reorganisation. The first thing I did in that regard was to ask the Government to authorise me to send the Director of Veterinary Services on a two-years' course of postgraduate study and research in the United States, Canada and South Africa, because I found that a great many of the veterinary surgeons in this <Col N="614" /> country, certainly those in the service of the Department, had not had much contact with colleges outside Ireland and I felt it was necessary, if we were going to have a director of veterinary services here, that he should be familiar with all the great centres of veterinary learning in the world so that in the years that lie ahead, as he is developing the service, he can pick out one young man from this branch and another young man from that branch and send one to Canada and another to South Africa to study some particular branch of veterinary science.  Thereby, we would build up a very much higher standard of veterinary learning and a very much better standard of veterinary education and administration.</P>
    <P>While he is away, the skeleton scheme that he is working out with the deputy director will continue to develop but we may not but assume that the general scheme of veterinary services worked out during the next two or three years will be more or less of an experimental character.  When the director returns to assume permanent occupancy of his position, we plan to establish a permanent and growing veterinary service, the nature of which, frankly, I do not at present know, because I have not got the information requisite to form a reliable judgment and I cannot hope to have it until I have an opportunity of contacting people familiar not only with veterinary science, but with the complex problem of veterinary administration in dairy conditions and live-stock conditions, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one of the centres to which the veterinary director will go will be Wisconsin, which is one of the great dairy States in America, where the veterinary service is operated from the University of Wisconsin.  There is also a great veterinary station in Iowa. He will spend some time there.  The principal of the McDonald College, in Quebec University, is a friend of mine who will not only place the facilities of the McDonald College of Quebec at his disposal, but will introduce him to the heads of the other Veterinary Colleges in Canada.  Odendaalsrust is a place which all Deputies know of.  It is one of the greatest agricultural research <Col N="615" /> stations in the world and a period of study there, I cannot but believe, will be of material advantage to the director in determining the proper course to be pursued in this country, both in the sphere of education and the sphere of administration in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane spoke of the maize millers' profits.  They are monstrous and revolting but they will not be that long. I am happy to inform the House that the International Emergency Food Council has, for the first time, made an allocation to us of 75,000 tons of maize for animal feed.  That is a very important new development.</P>
    <P>My predecessor in office had to labour under the very great difficulty of having no such allocation and having to search the markets of the world to find maize in a condition which put it outside the category of human food.  It was only in such cases that he was able to purchase it and use it for animal feed. That he was able to get as much as he did, with the assistance of Deputy Lemass, under these extraordinarily difficult circumstances, is something for which the people ought to be duly grateful to them.  This allocation makes my task easier but I am faced with the difficulty of price.  Unfortunately, prices have risen in the cereal market very substantially in the last 12 months but I think they are coming down and I am not without hope that we shall be able to purchase maize.  I want the House to understand very clearly that it is one thing to have maize allocated and another to get it.  The allocation merely amounts to this that the international authority says: &ldquo;You may buy maize now.&rdquo;  Then you have to go and buy it and at that stage you learn what you have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>We could buy maize to-morrow but it would cost us so dear a price that we could not afford to use it or to feed it to our live stock but I am not without hope that, with hopping and trotting, I will be able to get it yet at a price at which, having dealt effectively with the profit margin to which Deputy Lehane referred and reminding the retailers of this country of the good old-fashioned practice of selling Indian <Col N="616" /> meal for 3d. a cwt. profit, we will get it to the farmer at a price which will enable him to feed it to his live stock and make a profit on his produce.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Kinnane that it is merely malicious and mischievous to say that I do not believe in tillage. I have always stood for the policy enunciated in this House 25 long years ago&mdash;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.</P>

The difference between me and my predecessors is that, with God's help, I will get it and, instead of having to subsidise half the land of Ireland, every acre of our land into which a plough is put will pay its own profit and nobody will have to subsidise it.  It will pay the man who ploughs it a profit for his labour and he can stand independent upon it and thank nobody for the livelihood he gets out of it.</P>
      <P>He will not have to be going around with his cap in his hand to any Fianna Fáil T.D. or any Fianna Fáil Minister begging him to give him a subsidy on that crop or a subsidy on this crop or, for the love of God, to push the price of this or that up a little higher than it is.  He will sell his produce in competition with all comers and it will be better quality and make as good or better a price than what will be produced in any other country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick of the doctrine that there is nothing we produce that cannot be produced better and cheaper somewhere else.  That is all hog-wash.  We can meet the Danes and the Dutch and all other comers in the British market and beat the tar out of them in quality <Col N="617" /> and quantity, if we try.  There is no bargain to which the Taoiseach's name will be put beside the Sir Stafford Cripps', by which the price provided does not recognise the fact that Irish produce is equal, grade for grade, with the best that Denmark or Holland can ever hope to produce.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Davin who said that he would not be in favour of compulsory wheat, but would be in favour of compulsory tillage.  Why is it that there is one section of the community that is always presumed to be lazy, a potential criminal and in need of continual supervision to see that he does not do everybody else down?  Do you go into a plumber and compel him to use solder?  Do you go into a painter and insist that he put on paint?  Why is it necessary to go to a farmer in order to see that he farms?  If that is to be the rule, why not take over all the land of the country and hire the farmers and tell them what to do&mdash;do you plough that acre, do you sow that one, do you dig that one?</P>
    <P>What is the use of calling a man's farm his own, if every hour of the day an inspector&mdash;representing me&mdash;can walk in and push him about and tell him what to do.  Why should I go on to Deputy Killilea's holding and tell him what to plant and sow and reap? Is it not his own?  What good is it to him if he has not the right to throw me off it?  What right have I got to go into the farms of any of the Deputies sitting on that side of the House and dictate to them what they are to do with their land?  I will not do it; and so long as I am Minister for Agriculture there will be no compulsion on farmers that does not apply to everybody else.</P>
    <P>All agree that, if war comes upon us, all of us have to surrender our liberties. I remember, when the last war began, we passed an Act in this House which left in the hands of the Government virtually the power to do anything they liked in respect of everybody. In that situation, you have to compel farmers, you may have to compel workers, you may have to order everybody to their post, and require, for the public safety, that each person will do his allotted task.  But there is <Col N="618" /> no reason why, if that is the proper course to pursue in war-time, you should release the whole rest of the community from that rigid regulation when the war is over and say: &ldquo;The poor old clodhopper on the land, it would be as well to keep a grip on him because if we do not he will go astray or go wild.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we to claim that every Deputy in this House is some lazy old somachán that slept half the day and would not till his land and would not make anything out of it?  What put the navy blue suits on the Deputies of this House?  Who made doctors and lawyers and clergymen out of the farmers' sons?  Was it not the ordinary, plain, simple, ignorant farmers&mdash;and they had no cigire or inspector running round saying: &ldquo;You plough there, you sow there&rdquo;.  Are we to assume that their sons have all become degenerates?  I do not.  I do not think their sons are one bit less than their fathers.  I will stake my existence on that conviction and if it is necessary to take every farmer by the back of the neck and teach him his business, then kick me out, for I am not fit to do it, I do not want to do it and I never will.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the pundit over there who ate the face off me for reducing the price of farmers' butter to 1/6 and then ate the face off me for putting him in the black market to get 3/6 a lb. for butter.  The truth of it is that the woman who makes good farmers' butter now, if she can get a choice customer, will get 3/-; the woman who makes cartgrease will not get anything and I hope she will not.  Let her go and grease the axle of the ass cart and not be trying to sell it to her neighbours as butter.  The woman who makes middling butter may have some trouble in selling it, but&mdash;we got some of it inside recently&mdash;it is just the kind of stuff you can sit at the table with and put on a potato and put a bit of cabbage over it.  She will easily get about 2/4 and is well paid.  Let me say to the Deputy from Galway. Deputy Lahiffe, that if his neighbour has beautiful, first quality butter and no one to buy it, let him put it in the boot of his car and bring it up here <Col N="619" /> next Tuesday and let him go around to two or three hotels and he will sell it as quick as lightning.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of bad grass seeds in this country.  I am not going into the whole salam about it, but all control of every sort, kind and description is coming off grass seeds soon.  They can come in and go out, they can go up or go down.  The man who produces good perennial or good Italian will get a good price for it and the man who tries to sell the sweepings of the loft will get nothing whatever except six months in gaol, and I think it is the best thing for him.</P>
    <P>Oh, I must pluck a crow with Deputy Commons.  He says he views the prospect of the mechanisation of agriculture with alarm, lest the introduction of machinery should displace men on the land.  That is the most poisonous heresy that could creep in upon us, because if you accept that doctrine it will mean that the men who work upon the land are for ever to be the lowest grade of manual labourer, never allowed to have access to the instruments or methods which will enable them to take their place where they belong&mdash;at the very top of craftsmen in our country.  I want to put on every farm in Ireland&mdash;whether through co-operative societies or individual ownership&mdash;those instruments which will enable the farm labourer of to-day to do the work of six farm labourers and to ensure that, having so equipped him, he will be proportionately paid.</P>
    <P>I am much beholden to Deputy Moylan for describing me as an adolescent. As you pass the middle forties, you look affectionately at those who still regard you as an adolescent. Deputy Moylan regarded it as a fallacy to suggest that any old pastures should be preserved.  That is a question about which I am not prepared to dogmatise, but I can tell you I was speaking to one of the greatest authorities on grass in Great Britain, a man whose name is nationally known, and I asked him that very question: &ldquo;Could it be possible that there would be such pastures as we had in Meath, which were alleged to have been undisturbed for centuries and to have this extraordinary <Col N="620" /> quality of finishing cattle?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is undoubtedly true; there are certain areas in which that is true.&rdquo;  And I think he mentioned Leicestershire.  I said: &ldquo;With all the progress in soil science, can you suggest to me why it is that you have a field on one side of the road which will finish a beast and a field on the far side which will not?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you cannot, not with precision. It appears to have something to do with the incidence and survival, owing to some soil constituent of the traditional indigenous grasses of the district.  As yet it is hard to determine what will preserve that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So long as that view obtains, God forbid that any fool in this country would go down and tell a Meath farmer to tear up something that may be of incalculable value, something that is utterly irreplaceable, and that is producing more food through the medium of grass owing to this purely chemical coincidence as it apparently does in parts of Leicestershire.  Surely out of pure prejudice we are not going to destroy it.  If we were it would be much the same as if some ignorant imbecile were to walk into the British Museum and smash the Portland vase because he did not like the look of it. The real explanation of that kind of sward can be satisfied only by breaking it up.  So long as we do not know, do not let us smash it up and then deplore our action for the rest of our lives.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Lemass that 90 per cent. of the land of this country given to grass means rotational tillage. There is very little left in Ireland or anywhere else which, if left in permanent grass for a protracted period will not show a tendency to deteriorate and to carry stock.  We know the reason why so little land was broken in many cases.  It was because farmers would not walk behind two horses with a plough, and because west of the Shannon men would not go out and turn the fields with a loy.  Thanks be to God the day is going when they will have to do that any longer.  There are some Deputies who know what it means to face into two Irish roods of land with a loy, turn every inch of it and break it up.  Work with a loy is work fit for a horse and not fit for a <Col N="621" /> man.  There has been a transition between these utterly primitive methods and the methods that we can give to them.  We will have tillage to keep the people on the land and the means to do it in dignity and decency.  So far as I am concerned, we will do all we can to give them the means.  I am not going to ask them to get down in the gutter in order to gratify those who are standing on the ditch.</P>
    <P>I thought it was extremely bad taste on the part of Deputy Moran to sneer and jeer at the occupants of our mental hospitals.  Is there anything wrong in asking the resident medical surgeon of the mental hospital whether occupational therapy for patients might not in turn become an invaluable public user in propagating certain varieties of grass seeds which it is extremely difficult to get propagated commercially?  The whole object of grass strains is to get a strain of grass that will be very leafy.  The trouble about that leafy strain of grass is that when you try to propagate commercial seed the yield is so low that the cost of the seed is fantastic.  It is such that the average farmer cannot afford to buy it.  We have all over the country a number of mental hospitals with considerable tracts of land surrounding them.  It is generally assumed that in occupational therapy the afflicted people will become interested in this as a regular routine.  It is a thing to which they can readily adapt themselves as a desirable occupation. It seemed to me that if we could associate their therapeutic occupation with the feeling that they were making a very material contribution useful to their neighbours, on whom through no fault of their own they had become a charge, it would be a desirable thing. I do not think that is a silly thing nor an undignified thing to do.  In that way we can steadily provide an annual supply of this seed which is so difficult to propagate.  It will be a material contribution to the agriculture of the country which we cannot get in any other way.  It will mean that those poor afflicted people will be doing something which is most valuable.  If anybody thinks that is a foolish, undignified or improper suggestion, I do not agree with him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Deputy Flynn spoke about the reconditioning of the Kerry mountain pastures.  The question is who owns them.  There are a lot of people who have grazing rights on these mountain pastures, but when you go to find a person who actually owns the mountain so that you can do reclamation work you find that the owner is somebody entirely different from the occupier.  The same difficulty arises in Wicklow.  If the users of the Kerry mountain pastures combine and approach my Department I will be delighted to use the resources of the farm improvements scheme.  We shall try to work out a general plan for the reclamation and improvement of these mountain pastures so as to double, treble and quadruple their capacity for carrying sheep or cattle as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I did say in this House that I could see a case for zoning the country, one part for Friesians and some other part for beef.  When I came to put my mind down to it, I saw that it was daft.  I said in this House, and I repeat it, that if you had an exclusively dairying country, or an exclusively liquid milk country, you ought to carry Friesians or Jerseys, but Ireland is not an exclusively dairying country.  It is a very small country, and there is not room in it for setting neighbour against neighbour.  If we do not all work together we will all perish together. Surely, we do not want a position where an individual in a parish can say: &ldquo;So long as I can get my grab what matter about the rest of you.&rdquo; The result of that would be that the neighbourhood would go smash.  I am convinced that this country must be regarded, agriculturally, as a unit, all working together.  Otherwise we will all go burst together.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand the viewpoint, particularly of a dairyman living in a dairying area, feeling: &ldquo;If I could get the class of cattle where I knew that nine out of every ten cows would have a heavy milk yield,&rdquo; and saying: &ldquo;I would be desperately tempted to choose that particular breed.&rdquo;  What a lot of people forget is that 95 per cent. of the cattle in this country are Shorthorn cattle, and that about 5 or 10 per cent. belong to the fancy breeds.  When <Col N="623" /> you are dealing with fancy breeds, which are in a very small minority, the likelihood of your getting a good milker is much higher than if you take the whole cattle population and make a pick there.  It is true to say that the Friesians, the Ayrshires, the Jerseys and the fancy breeds are better fed and better looked after by their owners than the average Shorthorn, but go up to Glasnevin and there is a herd of Shorthorn cattle there.  They are not pedigree cattle.  There is not a beast among them that was not bought on the Dublin market from common Shorthorn cows walked in there that anyone could buy, and the average yield of the herd is over 800 gallons a cow and most of them give 1,000 gallons.  They are yours.  They belong to the Irish people.  If any Deputy in this House would like to go up there and have a look at them Professor Drew would be very glad to show them to you and to tell you the history of each cow.  They were bought on the Dublin market in competition with all the dairy people and every one of them gives a yield of over 800 gallons, while many of them give a yield of 1,200 gallons.  There is no special fancy feeding, and only when they go to about 1,500 gallons are they milked more than twice a day.  Go up there and look at them.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat my challenge.  I will match, against six cows of any breed you care to name from any herd you care to pick, six of those ordinary Shorthorn cows bought on the Dublin market.  Bring out six cows from any herd you choose to take and let them spend a full lactation in competition and I will pick six Shorthorn cows from the Glasnevin herd against any six cows in Ireland.  Now can I say fairer than that?</P>

      <P>Upon my word, he would want to be a mighty good judge to pick some of them.  Some of them are the &ldquo;quarest&rdquo; looking things.... But there you are.  If you know how you can do it.  There is a difficulty that they are 20 cows out of 1,000,000, whereas if you picked 20 Friesians they would be 20 out of a 1,000, all of which were carefully picked in the first instance and your chance of getting 20 good cows is much higher than your chance of getting good Shorthorns. But damn it, we cannot run the country on the assumption that every one who keeps a cow or who buys a cow is not competent to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ben Maguire produced the astonishing theory that the flight from the land was due to the live-stock policy.  God forbid that I would call the members of the Party beyond live stock, but it seems to me that the flight from the land took place from the time the Fianna Fáil policy was in operation. We were told that its result would be the return of the emigrant, but in fact the result is the disappearance of &mdash;is it?&mdash;20,000 per annum.  Heaven forbid that at this hour of the night I should get contentious.</P>
      <P>I am afraid of my life of mentioning anything that Deputy O'Reilly said, because if I compliment him he will think I am making fun of him, and if I criticise he will think I am insulting him, while all I want to do is to deal with him as I would deal with any Deputy.  Deputy O'Reilly contended that the yield of our cattle had gone down through the Livestock Breeding Act, but he followed that by the record of the Milltown Cow Testing Association, which showed that the yield of our cattle was going up.  That done, he passed on to the next topic.  Is not that so, Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's case was that the Live-stock Breeding Act had let the country down and that the yield of Shorthorn <Col N="625" /> cows was going down in the country. Here is the cow testing association's record:&mdash;1940, 466 gallons; 1941, 474 gallons; 1942, 466 gallons; 1943, 455 gallons; 1944, 428 gallons; 1945, 466 gallons, and 1946, 491 gallons.  That was at a time when we had no artificial manures, when the fertility of our land had notoriously gone down, when the difficulties of feeding cattle adequately must have been immensely increased to the people in the milch cow areas.  Is not that a most striking advertisement of the Act?  I am going to get that record framed and hung up in my office in the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I hope it will be of great help to the Department.  Perhaps I have not that oratorical ability of the Minister&mdash;I could not claim to have it&mdash; to put over the point I intended to put over.  In putting that comparison of the cow testing association's figures I also gave the figures of the supply of milk to the Milltown Co-operative Creamery.  I drew the attention of the Minister and of the House to the fact that the members of the Milltown Cow Testing Association are as nearly related as is humanly possible to the creamery area.  I have not my notes as I did not expect this.  I gave the figures of the supply of milk from 1940 to 1946. I pointed to the fact that the milk yield had gone up&mdash;will you oblige with the number of gallons?</P>

I pointed to that fact, but at the same time I pointed to the fact that the supply of milk to the creamery in that area&mdash; Milltown&mdash;had gone down by 60,286 gallons per year as from 1940 to 1946, with the intention of showing that even the cow testing association's figures are not an accurate reflex of the condition of milk supply.

      <P>Deputy James Collins spoke of carting stones seven or eight miles for field drainage.  Surely to God if you are thinking of carting stones seven or eight miles, it would be worth your while to think of using cement tiles or three-inch pipes.  If you have to cart stones seven or eight miles you would make drainage too expensive to be economical and I imagine that it would pay very well either to make or to purchase cement tiles for that purpose. He suggests that if we are going to end compulsion in wheat we should have compulsory nothing.  He advocates shelter belts.  I thoroughly agree, but I do not think we ought to pay our neighbours to put shelter belts on their own land.  Why should they not put them down when they get the trees for nothing from the county councils?  If a man is too lazy to dig a trench and put into it free trees, if the wind blows the thatch off his house the &ldquo;divil&rdquo; mend him.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Rourke, in a most mild and seductive way, asked was not this the policy of Fianna Fáil that Deputy James Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, was preaching.  He had not a word to say against it.  After 27 hours of hullabalco during which I was everything short of a branded criminal, I invite my friends to make up their minds.  Am I a villain tearing down the foundations of agriculture in Ireland? By the time we come to discuss the trade agreement will they oblige me by making up their minds.  Are we carrying on the agreement they made in 1938 and no more, or have we sold <Col N="627" /> the Irish people lock, stock and barrel into the hands of the base and brutal Saxon?  They must make up their minds.  It will have to be one or the other.  It cannot be both.</P>
    <P>Now I am coming to flax.  I would be a foolish man coming from County Monaghan if I did not.  I have abolished all control on scutching charges, because there is now scutching capacity in the country considerably in excess of the total acreage of flax.  I want to make this announcement.  If the scutch millers try to overcharge those farmers who grow flax I look to co-operative societies to operate flax scutching mills in order to see that the scutch millers do not get away with it. If they do exploit their customers this year, they can shut their mills up because people will get out of flax and I would advise them to get out of it. The Board of Trade in Great Britain heretofore has supplied the seed and bought the crop.  They have announced this year that they have disinterested themselves in it, but that they invite the linen spinners in Northern Ireland to make a similar contract with our people.  That contract could be settled in a word.  If the linen spinners in Northern Ireland pay the same price, grade for grade, for our flax that they pay to people in Northern Ireland, we will grow flax and, if they do not, we will not.</P>

      <P>I think I have come near to the end of the questions I have been asked.  I wish Deputy Allen and Deputy Ó Briain would make up their minds. Deputy Allen says that the egg scheme is a delightful scheme and that they will do all they can to help.  Deputy Ó Briain said: &ldquo;Be careful.  You may destroy us with that egg scheme.  Look at it with great suspicion.&rdquo;  I wish they would meet somewhere and make up their minds and then talk with the same voice.  There is no use in one fellow getting up to praise it and the other fellow getting up to give it a stab in the back, because it is easy to kill it. If Fianna Fáil Deputies go round the country saying: &ldquo;If you go in for eggs or hens you will be in a sorry plight this time two years,&rdquo; they can do a lot to damage it.  But I do not give two <Col N="629" /> fiddle-de-dees what they do because, with their help or without their help, we shall make a success of Deputy Smith's egg scheme and, if we make a success of it, let us give the devil his due.  It was Deputy Smith made the agreement and, any loopholes he left in it, I filled them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have answered all the questions I was asked.  I am not a bit afraid of the verdict of the country.  Every blunderbuss you could find by way of argument, insult, violence and threat Fianna Fáil has launched against me in the last 27 hours and you did not knock a feather out of me.  I am not one bit distressed.  My confidence in the rectitude of the agricultural policy of this Government is not in the least shaken. <Col N="630" /> My profound conviction that the events will justify the decisions we have taken and are now taking is unshaken.</P>
    <P>My profound conviction that the farmers of the country will do more and do it better as free men than they would ever do it as inspector-ridden slaves is stronger now than ever it was, and I am quite content to let my reputation and the fate of the Government to which I belong stand or fall by the result of this test: is Fianna Fáil's policy of slavery or this Government's policy of freedom for the farmers the best for the Irish people in the long run?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it may be best before going into details of this Estimate to say a general word on the broad policy which I conceive it to be the duty of the Department of Fisheries to pursue in this country.  I believe the prime function of the Department of Fisheries is to maintain and defend against all interests the livelihood of the inshore fishermen along our coasts.  I conceive it to be the duty of my Department to ensure that no vested interest, foreign or domestic, will pursue its own end at the expense of the livelihood of our inshore fishermen.  I do not want for a moment to conceal from the House that that aim in certain circumstances imposes at times a modest burden on the consumer of fish; but, if such burden should occur, I am satisfied that a consistent adherence to this policy will tend to reduce it as time goes on. Many interested parties conceive it to be a desirable thing to promote the trawling industry in this country.  With my present understanding of this problem, founded on five years' representation <Col N="633" /> of the County of Donegal and an intimate contact with the fishermen of that county during that period and ten years' interest in these problems since, I am satisfied that we must make our choice between establishing a trawling industry in this country and preserving the inshore fishermen&mdash;for we cannot have both.  If we are to have an efficient trawling company, that trawling company can supply not only the total demand of our domestic market but a very substantial export trade as well; and I am not going to ask the fishermen on our coast to become a charge on public charity.</P>
    <P>If there were an efficient trawling company operating in this country there would be no need for the inshore fishermen, and the only basis upon which they could remain in existence would be as a charge on the general community.  They are not that kind of men.  I do not believe, even if we asked them to accept that status, that they would be prepared to accept it. And even though we were ready to provide money artificially to keep their industry in existence, they just would not accept it; they would turn their hands to other work.  Then an industry which constitutes, in my opinion, an essential element in a way of life that I believe it is valuable and desirable to preserve for our people, would be destroyed, and that way of life could no longer continue.  Therefore, I am constrained to present all and sundry with notice that, so long as I retain the confidence of this House as the Minister for Fisheries, there will be no trawling company in this country; that is, in the accepted sense of the word, a commercial trawling company with a fleet of deep-sea trawlers.</P>
    <P>There is in existence a kind of quasi-trawling company which operates from this city, and this problem arises in connection with that.  There are a number of wholesale merchants in the fish business in this country.  That trawling company, provided its activities do not go further than they have gone so far, is not inconsistent with the maintenance of a prosperous livelihood for the inshore fishermen, because it is really a kind of a compliment to call it a trawling company.  I would be prepared <Col N="634" /> to see such a company continue to function, provided it was not a monopoly in the hands of one fish wholesaler.  I am prepared to see it maintained as the co-operative activity of all the recognised fish wholesalers; that is to say, that all would have a share in the enterprise and all would equally share the benefits of the enterprise. I would consider a proposal that it should be run by the Sea Fisheries Association as an ancillary activity to the inshore fishermen's industry, or I would be prepared to see it suspend its operations.  But there is one basis upon which I do not think it may be properly continued in being, and that is as a reserve monopoly.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies might say: &ldquo;Why do you want to interfere with them at all?&rdquo;  The only justification I have for suggesting that we should is that if we allow one trawling company in private hands we ought to allow every private individual who wants to start a trawling company to start it.  I will not let anyone start a big commercial trawling company based on this country because I believe it would destroy the livelihood of the inshore fishermen and, therefore, without in any way wanting to be draconian or precipitate or dictatorial, I put the circumstances to the House and implicitly to the trawling company concerned, with no desire whatever unduly to interfere with the limitations of the individual interests. It is the policy of the Department to have no trawling company in competition with the inshore fishermen. The position of that company must be altered from a monopolistic one into one in which all those who have an interest in the wholesale fish business would have an equal share, or it must come to an end.</P>
    <P>Now, supposing we accept the position that no big trawling company is to provide a surplus of fish, we are then faced with the situation that the inshore fishermen, while they will provide generally an ample supply and variety of fish for our domestic market, will, on occasion, as the result of ungovernable weather, be unable to land fish for a week or maybe a fortnight, and we are confronted with a hiatus which the consumer is entitled to expect <Col N="635" /> will be filled so that he will have a supply of fish when weather makes it impossible for the inshore fishermen to make their regular deliveries.  The only workable method I see out of that difficulty is to authorise the Sea Fisheries Association on those rare occasions to go to Grimsby or one of the large centres of fish supply abroad, bring in sufficient fish to fill the hiatus and auction it off amongst all the wholesalers so that all can have an equal share of it for their trade in the knowledge that there will be no intention to maintain that irregular procedure but as a device merely to fill the gap when weather makes it impossible for the inshore fishermen to supply fish.</P>
    <P>I am not fanatical on any of the methods I here outline and I am quite open to the suggestion of a better method than the one I am suggesting of achieving the fundamental objective, and that is that this market will be reserved for the inshore fishermen and that no interference, foreign or domestic, will be allowed to override that prime desideratum.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of inland fisheries and I have an immense amount of technical information here, the broad heads of which I will deal with briefly. Under the 1939 Fishery Act, there was a proviso that at a certain stage the riparian rights to net fresh water rivers would be extinguished by the State on the basis of compensation.  Those sections of that Act are now coming into operation and there have been some places where there has been misunderstanding and uneasiness when those who had a right to net those fresh water rivers were told they might no longer do so.  Some of them do not realise that if that right is withdrawn from them the Act provides that the value of the right they have been called upon to surrender has to be fixed by an independent arbitrator and that whatever figure he fixes they must receive, and if they are not pleased with his settlement that they should have a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would invite Deputies to whom constituents may come in perplexity in that matter to reassure them <Col N="636" /> and advise them, wherever possible, to constitute themselves into a group of riparian owners seeking compensation for their loss of rights under this Act and to retain the service of an independent solicitor to represent them in the arbitration, and from that on the solicitor will take charge of the negotiations for them and they need have no anxiety that substantial and generous justice will not be done to their claim.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest desire on the part of this Government&mdash;and I think I can speak with confidence on behalf of the Government responsible for passing the Act, our predecessors &mdash;to treat these riparian owners in any niggardly or ungenerous way.  It was the purpose of those who drafted the Act, as it is the purpose of this Government, that they should be fairly, or even generously treated.  It will be our constant aim to ensure that no person, who has rights under the Act, will leave the arbitration with a legitimate feeling of grievance or hardship.</P>
    <P>I know that there will be Deputies here who will have a word to say about the Sea Fisheries Association, and I should like to anticipate these words by recalling to the minds of those who have been interested in this question over a long time, the comparative position of our inshore fishermen to-day with the condition in which they found themselves two or three years after the previous Great War.  The inshore fishermen during the 1914-1918 war made a lot of money and they bought boats, they went into debt and they took a very optimistic view of the future.  Not many years had passed until practically everyone of them was hopelessly insolvent.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made to collect debts from them and their boats were abandoned, valuable gear was thrown away and the whole fishing industry was thrown into a state of confusion, into something approximating to despair. Out of that came the Sea Fisheries Association and a whole new concept of allowing a group of men to get advances for the provision of boats and gear and to permit them to repay out of the proceeds of their several catches, with the result that the majority of the fishermen have come into the post-war <Col N="637" /> period, free of debt, and with equipment mostly in good order, albeit there is a difficulty in procuring the things that require replacing.  While I do not suppose that we can ever hope that they will grow immensely rich, most of them are reasonably comfortable and are getting along.  There has been a difficulty in getting nets but nets are being procured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn will be interested to hear that Kelvin engines were not forgotten when we were in London.  We had even the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerned to look for Kelvin engines for us.  Negotiations are going on but they are a tough lot, the same bunch, and it is hard to get engines out of them.  Danish engines are available but they are expensive and I do not think that people like them.  Deputies may rest assured that the Sea Fisheries Association are doing all in their power constantly, not only to get engines for the fishermen but to get the kind of engines that the fishermen want.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, in the fish business from the fishermen to the consumer there is a very wide variety, a surprisingly wide variety, of interests of one kind or another and their various claims and imagined rights not infrequently collide, loudly and resoundingly. Amongst them all, so far as my study of the problem goes, there is one body which is primarily, and as far as I can find out, solely and exclusively concerned with the welfare of the fishermen and that is the Sea Fisheries Association.  Therefore, I need hardly tell the House, there is one subject on which all the other interests are loudly and resolutely unanimous and that is that of all the infernal conspiracies and villainies in the country the worst is the Sea Fisheries Association. The matter is very highly technical and the wisest man in the world is the man who is wise enough to know the things he does not know.  I do not know the technicalities of the fish trade, so having taken counsel with the exceptionally able and distinguished officers of my Department I determined to set up an advisory council.  We ask every interest in the trade, including <Col N="638" /> the trade unions, to name representatives, and I cannot sufficiently thank Father E. J. Coyne, S.J., for undertaking the extremely laborious assignment of being chairman of that advisory committee.  Those of us who know of his disinterested and distinguished work in the service of the people of this country will not be surprised to find him in the service of the inshore fishermen as well.  It is not everybody who can appreciate the incomparable value of his unique services in the very difficult position of chairman of that council.</P>
    <P>A number of contentious points have been referred to that council for deliberation.  Some of them are points which I have touched upon this evening. If I had been more discreet perhaps I would simply have said: &ldquo;I have nothing to say until the committee reports,&rdquo; but I do not know why I should not have said these things because, as I have stated, my mind is closed to none of the questions of method but it is absolutely closed, as I think that most Deputies' minds will be closed, on the fundamental proposition that the fish market of this country belongs primarily to our own fishermen.</P>
    <P>So soon as that advisory body reports, I shall consider its recommendations. If I agree with them I shall bring them before the House and ask the House to take any legislative steps that may be necessary to give effect to them.  If I do not agree with them, I shall bring them before the House and recommend the House to reject them.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters which I should like to mention.  One is prospective legislation; the other is the efforts we are making to improve fresh-water fisheries.  As Deputies are aware, there are as many theories as there are advisers about how best to increase the brown trout population of any river or lake.  One hopefully anticipates the setting up of a hatchery and producing there astronomical numbers of fry, bearing them off in buckets and pouring them into a river only to be told by some wiseacre that one decent pike will eat the whole of them in the course of a day.  I believe that is true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I determined that I would try an experiment the other way round.  I know a lake myself where all the coarse fish were removed and now there are no trout in it bigger than about 3½ ounces, and, if you cast three flies over the lake, you will get three 3½-ounce trout out of it, because the trout have multiplied so rapidly and the food has not that the fish do not grow and you get an immense number of very small fish. I have, therefore&mdash;and I shall be glad to hear the opinion of Deputies who have interested themselves in this matter&mdash;asked my Department to undertake, as an experiment, the trawling of four small lakes and the removal from their waters of approximately 75 per cent. of the coarse fish, with a view to determining if that method would sufficiently stimulate the ordinary course of nature to increase the fish population of the lake and attendant river, while, at the same time, not permitting so rapid an increase in the trout population as to impinge unsatisfactorily on the total available food supply.  It may not have any satisfactory results but it may.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously, one of our officers is going over to Loch Leven, which is supposed to be one of the best lakes in Scotland for fish propagation and work of that kind, and which, I think, is the centre of the maintenance and development of all the Scottish fisheries.  We propose that he should undertake a course of observation to see how things are done there.  If any other Deputy has any suggestion to make which he thinks would be of value for the purpose of improving inland fisheries, I shall be very glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>I know that I ought to go on to say that if we are going to improve the inland fisheries for the benefit of our neighbours, our neighbours ought to pay something by way of a modest duty on their rods.  Never, so long as I am here, will I ask any country or city boy in this country to pay a duty for using a fishing rod.  If I could prevail on the lads down the country to go out fishing and to make it a habit, I would be sorely tempted to set up a system of making them a present of a fishing rod. <Col N="640" /> Anything we do here, in any circumstances, should create no deterrent whatever to any citizen of this State enjoying the amenities which God put there for the enjoyment of us all.</P>
    <P>The Americans have a very good rule in that regard.  It does not matter how rich or how powerful you are, if there is running through your demesne a river with trout in it, every naturalised citizen of the United States of America has a right to cross your wall and proceed to the bank of that river by the shortest course and there to carry on the constitutional right of a United States citizen to fish in a United States river, and nobody can say him nay.  There are heavy penalties in America for taking from a river a fish below a certain size and they are very rigorously enforced.  I never knew I was as good a runner in my life as on one occasion in Wisconsin on which I was returning from a river and discovered that I had upon my person a fish which might not be expected to measure up to the requirements of the appropriate officer; but, apart from that, so long as I had a fishing rod and wanted to fish, I had the right to cross any man's land by the shortest way to the edge of the lake or river on his property.</P>
    <P>I wish we could hope to enforce such a regulation about the size of fish here, but I am a great believer in practical politics.  If we made a regulation to-morrow that anybody who took a fish less than six inches out of a river must put it back again, we would simply be making a law which would not be enforced, because we would not be able to enforce it.  We must only try to persuade people that they ought not to take fish fry like that and ought not to go out and catch trout fry on bent pins in order to use them as a bait for pike.  We ought to try to persuade our people to co-operate with us, in so far as they can, in destroying the vermin which prey upon game fish. They could do a lot to help, if they would, to persuade our people, now that the fish mainly belong to them, that the poacher who fishes out of season is an enemy of the whole community and not of somebody belonging to the landlord class.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> I hope I will not shock my more conservative colleagues when I say that I wonder if it will ever be possible here to buy out all the fishing rights on all our rivers.  I like the American system. I like the idea that, if God put fish in a river in Ireland, everybody in Ireland, from the smallest to the biggest, has an equal claim to that fish, if he can catch it, and I think it is a reasonable approach.  If we accepted that view, it would mean that we would have to acquire the rights vested in certain individuals for a fair compensation and would have to try to grow up in our sense of responsibility, and recognise that, now that it had become the duty of no individual to protect the rivers, it was the duty of us all to protect them and to collaborate with the servants of the State who are charged with the responsibility of seeing that they were not recklessly plundered and ill-used.  I wonder could we reasonably look forward to the day when we might legitimately invest public money in such a purchase for the people, in the knowledge that, when we had acquired them for ourselves, we could preserve them for ourselves and for the guests whom we chose to make welcome to that amenity of ours.</P>
    <P>It is an ideal towards which I should like to work, but I have no proposals to put before the House now beyond a respectful request that such Deputies as are interested in the matter would fortify me with their opinions on it. If there are any questions any Deputy wishes to ask me in regard to this matter I need hardly say that I shall be only glad to answer them.  I think I should perhaps say that, owing to a variety of circumstances, certain imports of smoked fish come in here from Great Britain.  I carefully considered that question in relation to our visit to London and came to the conclusion that the most satisfactory way of settling that matter was that we should get the British fish-purchasing authority, who buy cured fish for the British and continental market, to bid us a fair price for a good quantity of our cured fish.  It would be an easier way of providing for all legitimate interests. We have approached the appropriate branch of the Ministry of <Col N="642" /> Food and negotiations are still proceeding. I hope we may be able to get &mdash;we may not, and it forms no constituent part of any agreement that has been initialled or is to be initialled, being quite a separate negotiation&mdash;a satisfactory market for the bulk of our cured fish which would greatly assist our herring industry.  I think it is unnecessary for me to add that the Sea Fisheries Association and the resources of the Department are all constantly engaged in trying to find markets for the herring and the mackerel that our people catch but, as Deputies know as well as or better than I do, that is not such an easy job at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should also refer to the Killybegs boat-yard.  I understand we are going to launch a boat there.  I am feeling rather piqued about the launching of the boat because it is going to be launched on the day before an anniversary meeting in Ballingarry.  I have been very much drawn between the launching of the boat in Killybegs and the centenary of Ballingarry but I am going to Ballingarry and I will not see the launching of the boat in Killybegs. However, I can assure Deputy Brady that, if I cannot be there in person, I shall be there in spirit.  I know he will miss me, as would Deputy Neil Blaney. All of us will have reason to be proud of the amenity now provided at Killybegs and those who enjoy its advantages may well think with warm regard of both the Minister and the Association who were responsible for providing it.  I assure all my Fianna Fáil colleagues on the far side, and Deputy McMenamin, that if they make nice speeches paying tributes to my predecessor and to the members of the Sea Fisheries Association for the excellent work that has been done at Killybegs they can, on my behalf, say, &ldquo;Hear hear&rdquo;!  to each of the several speeches they will make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in this House will have to agree with what the Minister has said, that the livelihood of our inshore fishermen must be our first consideration, the second being that we have an obligation to the consumers to see that they get fish in reasonable <Col N="643" /> variety and at a fair price at all times. The difficulty always has been, of course, to try to fit one thing in with the other, and in trying to satisfy the consumer and at the same time to safeguard the inshore fishermen, the consideration of trawler companies and the imports of fish arises.</P>
      <P>I do not think I differ from the Minister with regard to a trawler company. I thought when he said first that a trawler company was inconsistent with the inshore fishermen that I would have to disagree.  But he went on to say that a trawler company of a kind is not inconsistent.  So, the only thing that has to be decided is what size the trawler company should be.  A trawler company of a kind is necessary, in my opinion, to give a variety because, at certain times, we will only get a very poor variety in inshore fishing and we should try, if possible, to supplement that variety by going further afield. That can only be done by trawlers. Therefore, we can all agree that in safeguarding the inshore fishermen we need a trawler company of a certain size.</P>
      <P>There is, as the Minister says, a trawler company in existence but it has very old boats and the company needs to be reconstructed in many ways.  If the Minister can succeed in getting all the interests concerned into one company, he will have done something that it was found impossible to do up to the present.  Perhaps he will succeed.  I hope if he does succeed, that he will also succeed in getting more modern boats that can land fish here at a lower cost.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House will grudge the praise that the Minister gave to the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think I would agree with the Minister on that.  The Minister, probably has been told, if he has not come across the various files, <Col N="644" /> that for the last seven or eight years, the Minister for Agriculture has been trying to work out a scheme but so far has not succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would also agree that there are times when neither the inshore fishermen nor the trawlers will give us the fish we require and we must be free to get fish from outside the country, in other words, to import fish.  The system that has been in operation for a few years back of nominating the Sea Fisheries Association as the importer is, I am quite sure, by far the best system because, as between the various commercial importers, they, at least, are neutral and if they bring in the fish and auction it, as they have been doing, no wholesaler can have any grievance that one person is being favoured more than another.</P>
      <P>I have said that none of us would disagree with the Minister in the praise he has given the Sea Fisheries Association.  They have done great work.  I believe it is a fact that practically all the fishermen who were dealing with the Sea Fisheries Association now have their boats free.  Some may owe a little money yet but most of them have their boats free, so that the association did great work in supplying their members with boats and gear and in helping their members to market their fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said a very true thing, that hatcheries, regarded purely from the point of view of figures, appeared to be deceptive.  It is true that a hatchery goes to a great deal of trouble to supply fry to various fishing clubs or societies and it is true that a very small number of fish let loose in these rivers would lay as many eggs as had been purchased by the clubs or societies. But I think the Minister and others will agree also that there is a psychological effect in having these hatcheries because, if a society or club purchase a certain number of fry, they have more interest in protecting the river than if the river is allowed to develop in the wild way.  From that point of view, I think we have a better spirit amongst the sportsmen and clubs that look after <Col N="645" /> the stocking of rivers by means of hatcheries.  The psychological effect is important also in the matter of a licence being required for the rod in the fishing of brown trout.  I would advocate that a small fee is useful, not so much from what the conservators get out of it, because they will not get very much more than will pay their expenses in connection with it, but because if young people were going out to fish in those rivers, who were perhaps not so responsible or not so much inclined to have regard to the future and to the necessity for having the rivers properly stocked and giving a good yield, if they have to pay a certain small fee for their licence they will be more particular about what they do. It is the psychological effect of charging them a small fee and giving them a licence and a certain amount of responsibility in going out to fish that is useful.  I do not mind if the fee is very small.  When I was bringing in the Bill in 1939, I spoke of five shillings as a nominal sum, but I do not mind if it is lower, even 2/6.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of aiming at having all the banks of all our rivers free to fishermen.  There are two restrictions at present&mdash;a man must have a licence to fish, a rod licence, and must have permission from the person who owns the river bank.  There are, of course, public fisheries where no permission is necessary.  Many of our rivers are privately owned and some of the estuaries are privately owned, while the banks are owned by the people who own the land along the side of the river&mdash;these are the riparian owners.  Even if a person is licensed to carry a rod, he must also get permission from the owner of the bank.  If the Minister can succeed in making the banks free to the fishermen, it will be a very good thing indeed.  In the 1939 Act, a provision was inserted&mdash;probably the most important provision in the Act&mdash;giving the Minister power to take over on behalf of the State the estuarian fisheries that were in private ownership.  I think we should commence there, and if the Minister wants to have free fishing it is only natural to think that he should start at the mouth of the river.  I would like him, therefore, when concluding this debate, to <Col N="646" /> indicate if he intends to proceed in the near future with taking over these estuarian fisheries and, if they were all taken over, whether he would proceed up the river, taking over the rights on the banks, as he mentioned, so that we would eventually reach that very desirable point of freedom that they have in America, where every man, as the Minister told us, can fish in any river he likes.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister intended to mention the consolidation of fishery laws, but did not actually come to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I represent a constituency which is considerably interested in the fishing industry.  We have two sides of the County Wexford which are bordered by the sea&mdash;the Irish Sea on one side and the Atlantic on the other. In addition, we have three types of fishing&mdash;sea fishing, tidal water fishing and the ordinary fresh water fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister say what persons will be acceptable to give advice or evidence to the advisory council he proposes to set up?  There are some grievances in the minds of the sea fishermen in County Wexford, but having regard to the fact that the Minister has said he is setting up this council, I do not propose to go into the details here.  They are of a somewhat technical character and concern, amongst other things, the marketing <Col N="647" /> and the price of fish.  Perhaps the Minister would instruct the council to receive a statement of the case of the Wexford fishermen, so that they may have before them the views of this very important section of the community in connection with fishing.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, in connection with inshore fishing, that there are occasions when it is difficult to land fish during ungovernable weather, and he also mentioned equipment.  The first most necessary equipment for the seafishing industry is adequate harbour and quay facilities.  In County Wexford, in some cases, those facilities are practically non-existent and in others they are in a very bad state; and what might be governable weather with proper habour facilities is ungovernable weather otherwise.</P>
    <P>We suffer also through the presence, from time to time, of foreign poachers. Foreign ships come from quite distant parts and can be seen very clearly from the shore, fishing away for long periods on end.  Once or twice, these vessels have been captured and brought in and there have been prosecutions, but that is not the way to deal with the matter.  In order to cure the evil, I am afraid it will be necessary to invoke the protection of the State and have some vessel sent down there to see that these foreign trawlers do not poach upon our legitimate preserves.  They come there with superior equipment and do a great deal of damage to the fish generally and to the whole district around.  I had intended to deal with various grievances, but as I anticipate that the Minister or his council will receive, by way of a well-documented case, these particular grievances which apply to County Wexford, that would be the most practical way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishing on the rivers, I do not wish to be described as a conservative and never felt at any time that I was a conservative in my views, but if I take the opposite view to the Minister I would have to plead guilty to being a conservative in this matter. He has mentioned that the fish in American rivers belong to the public. There is a vast difference between the <Col N="648" /> United States of America and Canada where there are huge rivers and vast resources and this country of ours, and I do not see for a moment how he is going to put any scheme like that into operation.  I gather that what is at the back of his mind is that, at some future date, having prepared the ground by the necessary propaganda, he will acquire compulsorily the fishing rights in all the rivers of this country. That sounds very nice on paper, but what would be the result?  You would have to build a little rail on each side of the river from the mouth to its source in order to ensure to the landowner, whether he was a big or a small one living alongside the river, that his property is preserved, because the position will be this: whether he has five acres or 500 acres he will not be able to prevent the whole population of the district, if necessary, going on to his land and saying: &ldquo;We have a right to come here; the right to take fish out of this river belongs to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the first practical difficulty in the way.  It is different in America where you have wide open spaces.  It might be feasible in districts where you have open mountains or at the estuaries of rivers, but it is not feasible in between where you have hedges and ditches, trees, crops and shrubberies.  The thing would be absolutely impossible.  I venture to think that, with all the goodwill in the world, the Minister will not be able to create a public point of view in favour of his proposal.  Perhaps at first the balance of public opinion would be in favour of his proposal, even in spite of the fact that the legitimate owners might object.  But there is more in it than that.  The next proposition would be that the rabbits belonged to the public, and that people will say that the apples growing on the trees belong to the public, and you might finish by saying &ldquo;Well, let us give the land and everything else to the public and we hope you will all be such good citizens that we are all going to live under a system where nobody will do any harm to anybody else.&rdquo;  In the end you would have the whole country in a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, when he comes <Col N="649" /> to consider the matter, will agree that I am right.  Now, these schemes are all very fine in theory, but they do not work out in practice.  If one man is entitled to go in another will say that he is entitled to go in and then everybody will be entitled to go in.  Anybody who had any experience of having land near a country town, or near a place where there is a large number of people&mdash;suppose you have timber on it or large quantities of blackberries&mdash; is well aware that children and grownups from the nearby towns will cross the fences and go in on that land.  They can do a considerable amount of damage to farmers' fences.  I think that possibly there may be some other and better way of providing angling facilities for the public generally.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  The Minister, in his statement, seemed to envisage a state of affairs in which our fishing industry will be confined to providing fish for use at home only, and not in any way as part of an export trade. Not knowing the details, I do not know how that could be managed.  I do know that in the sea surrounding our shores we have a vast quantity of fish.  It is the responsibility of the Department to see that our fishermen win from the sea the largest quantity of fish possible.  I am astonished that we have not so far been able to bring that about.  A country like ours, surrounded by the sea, should be able to establish a huge fishing industry, one that would bring us in valuable money from abroad.  I do not know whether our failure is due to not having trawlers or to our method of following inshore fishing, but it does strike one as rather strange that with the same sea as that which touches the shores of European countries, we are not able to avail of the fish which is there.  Deputies are aware that from Brittany right up to Denmark there are thousands and thousands of people engaged in winning fish from the sea. It is a source of valuable wealth to the people of those countries.  It seems to me that our objective up to now has been, and is going to continue to be, merely a fishing industry to satisfy the wants of the population of this country. If that is so, our aim is at a very low target, and we are abandoning a <Col N="650" /> valuable asset.  I think we should aim at developing an industry which would give us a valuable export trade.  I do not think I have anything more to say except, as I said at the beginning, that I hope the Wexford fishermen will be given an ample opportunity of presenting their case, from their point of view, to the advisory council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question here about Kelvin engines for fishermen on the South Kerry coast and I asked the Minister when the trade talks were taking place to mention this matter to the responsible authorities in England and I am glad to say that the Minister has informed the House that he has done so.  On behalf of the fishermen concerned who found it almost impossible to get adequate supplies of this type of engine for their fishing boats, I sincerely thank him.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that this Estimate is not sufficient.  I am open to correction, but I think when you have deducted a certain amount for the repayment of loans and all that, it is possibly about £24,000.  I suggest that it should be at least £44,000.  With the increased price of gear and other types of equipment that fishermen require, in the areas I know particularly, the amounts scheduled for this Estimate are not at all adequate.  I realise that the fact that some of this equipment is in short supply, as in the case of engines, and that it is practically impossible to get other equipment, might have induced the Department not to ask for or schedule the necessary increased amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with what the Minister said about the price of fish.  Deputy Ryan referred to legislation which was to be introduced here some years ago to make provision for the acquisition of fisheries and giving compensation to the owners, and giving over these rivers to the men employed in the industry, but nothing was done about it.  It was just hung up, as far as I know.  I am looking forward with hope and confidence to the Minister at least enacting, or causing to be enacted, what they had intended to do some years ago but did not proceed with.  I have a case in my mind in my own constituency where one of the most valuable fisheries in Ireland is controlled by one man.  As <Col N="651" /> the years went on he and his predecessors bought every available fishery, and when this legislation was pending about 1932 they realised that they would be entitled to tremendous compensation. Even since then they have bought in fisheries and they stand to win by scores of thousands of pounds in the transaction.  Nevertheless, I agree entirely with the Minister, even in the case of men of this type who gambled and speculated, because they saw that if this legislation was put through and provided they could show returns over three years, they would be compensated on their average return over those years.  He realised that and bought valuable fisheries adjacent to the one he already owned, in the hope of this legislation being put through, when he would get about £50,000.  Despite all that, I, on behalf of the fishermen, welcome what the Minister has in mind, that the Government should in the future, when it thinks fit, at the earliest possible date, take over fisheries such as that, so that the fishermen who are already in that industry can be made part owners of it. Another suggestion was that, after paying compensation to that owner, the State should run it as a paying concern and pay these men a standard weekly wage.</P>
    <P>The State could control these fisheries as a nationalised industry and run them in the same way as the Dairy Disposals Company are running the creameries at the moment and give much-needed employment at a decent wage.  They certainly can afford to do this, because this fishery to which I referred is referred to as a gold mine. Thousands of pounds are netted each year, but we had to go in time and again over the years to this landlord on behalf of the unfortunate fishermen. He paid them 15 years ago the starvation wage of 17/- a week plus 3d. per fish commission.  They had to run the chance of getting scarcely anything in some periods even if on other occasions it worked out all right.  Although this man made colossal profits they were never passed on to them.  When the Fianna Fáil Government came in, although this legislation did not go far enough, it compelled men like him to <Col N="652" /> advance.  He did advance, but it is still a low rate.  I hope I will see the day when not one man but ten men are employed at a decent wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister spoke so well of the inshore fishermen.  While the Minister stated that he was going to make representations to get engines, the inshore men are in a bad way for better-class boats.  If they are to fish all the year round they want larger boats, and I hope that will not be long delayed.  The previous Minister did a good job by trying to get going the art of making boats in Killybegs. Representations have been made to the Sea Fisheries Association to try to get engines, and I hope that the Minister will expedite that matter.  There are some applicants for boats at Howth, and at the moment there is unemployment among this good type of fisherman and the sooner boats are brought to that area the better.</P>
      <P>At Loughshinny and Rush we wanted to have something done for the harbours and boats.  Deputy Ryan dealt with the boats.  When the weather is very bad it is very hard for fishermen to get out, and during it, there is a lot of unemployment among fishermen.  I would like Sea Fisheries to institute some welfare scheme to do something for the people at a time like that. While Sea Fisheries have done a good deal, there is a good deal yet to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk from time to time about the transport of fish and the provision of freezing plants.  That matter has been discussed with the Sea Fisheries Association and the officials gave it very sympathetic consideration. However, if we are to put this industry on its feet we should consider the provision of freezing plant in order to have a better supply of fish for the consumer.  In this country fish is very dear for the consumer.  One of the points raised on numerous occasions is the controlled price of fish in the market.  There is a controlled maximum price, but there is no controlled minimum price and, when there is a glut in the market, it can be sold at any price under the maximum.  A number of fishermen in North Dublin feel <Col N="653" /> that the law of supply and demand should be allowed to prevail.  That is a matter I have taken up with the previous Minister and I would ask the present Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of big towns in this country in which fish cannot be procured except by hotels and other people who order it specially.  If we want to improve the industry we should provide for the quick transport of fish from the port at which it is landed to the inland towns.  In addition, the fish should be properly handled because there is nothing so disgusting as fish when it is in a decaying condition. These are matters which should be considered very favourably as they would improve the conditions for our inshore fishermen.  Another thing which we could fall back upon here is the canning industry.  It should be possible to establish a good canning industry to take the surplus fish off the market in which there is sometimes a glut.  That is one way in which the freezing plant would be useful.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he was not in favour of trawlers. Trawlers may be all right in their own way, but four or five good steam trawlers would at least supply all the fish we require here.  All along our coast we have a number of fishermen whose interests we should protect as much as possible.  I am also anxiously awaiting decision as to the advisory committee.  Of course the Sea Fisheries Association is composed of every section of the fishing industry and fishermen have an opportunity of putting their views before the association. The association is a very democratic one and the officials are most helpful.  The position, however, is that a number of fishermen are still dissatisfied possibly because of the shortage of gear, the difficulty of procuring it and the fact that it is very expensive.  The provision of boats, better gear, better engines and the clearing of the harbours to receive the boats all form a big problem in the North County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the importation of smoked fish.  The Minister suggested to-night that he would try to get some <Col N="654" /> smoked fish exported in return for that. That may be a feasible suggestion and I should like to see the matter taken up.  Generally speaking, I should like to see more money spent on the fishing industry.  I should like to see it looked upon as one of our national industries and a good supply of fish made available for every part of the country.  We should also have a better type of boats and gear and the harbours should be dredged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister and the ex-Minister one would think that everything was all right with regard to this industry.  Earlier in the evening the Minister was referring to the wage of 55/- a week paid to the agricultural labourer.  I wonder did he ever seek the views of any housewife with five or six children who has to try to provide fish for herself and the children.  It is notorious that in this country it is almost impossible to get fish in any small or fairly large town even once a week.  It is an extraordinary position that in a country such as this, where this enormous source of food is available at our doors, we have failed to provide it for our people.  There is certainly something radically wrong there.  I hope this committee which is to advise the Minister on matters generally will make a report upon which action will be taken so as to provide the Irish people with a reasonable supply of fish throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that there were some weeks in the year when our boats could not go to the sea and therefore we had to import fish from Great Britain.  I think I know rural Ireland from Donegal down to Cork as well as any man, and I can say that one of the most difficult things for any housewife to procure, even once a week, is a supply of fish at a reasonable price. In fact it is impossible to get it in some places except it is ordered specially in advance.  The Minister stated that a boat is to be launched at Killybegs some day this week and that he regretted he cannot attend.  I regret also that the Minister cannot attend. I think the Minister was hardly candid enough in dealing with the supply of <Col N="655" /> fish and the providing of fish for this country.  As I understand it, the position of the Sea Fisheries Association is that they have now on their books applications for at least 100 fishing boats of the inshore type.  The capacity of the boat-yard at Killybegs, in my native county, is an output of five boats per year.  That being so&mdash;and I am reliably informed that that is the situation&mdash;it is going to take 20 years to meet the number of applications for new boats that are at present on the books of the Sea Fisheries Association. How can we expect a reasonable supply of fish, or even a continuance of the limited supply we have been getting in the past, if it will take 20 years to meet the current orders for boats? What is going to happen each year with regard to the depreciation in the number of our boats due to wreckages and so forth?  There are parts of the coast in my constituency where in one night five or ten new boats may be smashed to pieces.</P>
    <P>That is the position in regard to the Association's boat-yard at Killybegs and yet last year the association closed down the boat-yard at Meevagh.  They took away the livelihood of some 14 families there who were boat-builders and all the other things that that appertains to by tradition.  That means of livelihood had been provided for them there by the Congested Districts Board which was set up by the British Government. It took an Irish Government in the year 1947 to take away the livelihood of those people.  The entire machinery for boat-building, so far as the association is concerned, was removed to a boat-yard that can only supply five boats a year and which will take, at that rate, 20 years to clear off the present orders on their books.  That being so, one must examine this problem in a practical way in an attempt to find a practical solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to smoked fish for consumption in this country and probably for export also.  Where fish are smoked in a factory I think it is absolutely essential, at that point, to have a quick-freeze plant.  In that way, huge fishing catches which might <Col N="656" /> occur for a week or a fortnight could be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>As things are at the moment, the factory cannot deal quickly enough with a large amount of fish so as to avoid a condition where they are not suitable for curing.  Therefore, somewhere around our coast&mdash;I do not mind whether it be at Kinsale, Killybegs or Downings&mdash;there should be some point from which the fish could be taken by lorry to a railhead, to a quick-freeze plant.  It is remarkable that, in a country like this which has a fishing industry with some of our people at least semi-dependent on it for a livelihood we have no way of preserving huge catches of fish to cover the period referred to by the Minister.  The fishermen, owing to the limited capacity of their boats, are unable to go to sea and we are, therefore, dependent on imports. The price of imported fish makes it impossible for the poor people and even the lower middle-class people to purchase it.  In my opinion a great deal requires to be done in this connection. I would say that not even the fringe of this problem has been touched in this country.  The late Congested Districts Board, considering its limitations and the fixed amount of money that was made available by the British Government for its resources, did as much for this country in this connection as we are doing now under a native Government.  Some steps should be taken to provide a supply of new boats as soon as possible.  I understand that the private boat-yards are so booked up with orders that they will not take any orders at all from fishermen generally.  We are, therefore, thrown back on the resources of the association.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister&mdash; and I am not doing so by way of a sop&mdash; that the Meevagh boat-yard should be reopened if the conditions with regard to orders on the books of the Sea Fisheries Association are such as I have stated.  Alternatively, I would suggest that a permanent engineer and a permanent boat builder be stationed at Meevagh so that these small vessels &mdash;if they get into serious trouble&mdash;will not have to travel, say, from Moville at the mouth of Lough Swilly to Killybegs for repairs.  That is highly dangerous <Col N="657" /> and at times it is impossible for such small vessels to undertake the journey.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fresh water problem.  He has referred to the fact that on various lakes and rivers we get a large number of brown trout that are of a very small size.  I do not believe that to trawl lakes and rivers with a view to the removal from these waters of approximately 75 per cent. of coarse fish in them will solve the problem.  The Minister spoke about sending a representative to Lough Leven to study the problem there.  I understand that years and years ago all the information available from Lough Leven was available to the Department. I do not think there is anything new to be discovered there at all. My information is that the size of the brown trout generally around our rivers is due to the fact that mainly these rivers all rise in the mountains.  Because of the amount of bog water in the upper reaches of these rivers the small size of the brown trout is absolutely and completely due to a lack of calcium.  There is also the problem of the trout becoming too numerous either in a lough or a river but particularly in a lough.  They consume the entire feed in it and the only thing then is to put a net on it and to reduce their number.</P>
    <P>You have the twin problems in regard to the size of trout&mdash;one is the feed and the other is the deficiency in calcium. As a result of these twin problems the trout in our rivers do not attain a size commensurate with the rivers.  These rivers rise high up in the mountains, pass through bog land and are totally deficient in calcium.  If we could overcome these drawbacks we would ultimately improve the size of our trout.  I take it the calcium deficiency could be made good by putting calcium into the lakes and rivers.</P>

      <P>I think you would.  I merely want to point out to the Minister the difficulties that confront him.  There are plenty of fish <Col N="658" /> in our rivers.  There are plenty of people who have never fished in their lives but have plenty of ideas in their heads as to how these problems can be overcome.  I do not think, however, that we can overcome them.  Some people ask why it is that if our salmon grow so large in our waters the trout do not thrive to the same extent.  It is a well-known fact that salmon do not feed in the fresh water.  The salmon return to the sea every autumn, coming back to their native rivers in the spring.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters which I wish to raise on this Estimate.  One is the provision of accommodation and protection for the fishermen at Glengad and the other is a similar protection and accommodation for the fishermen at Portaleen.  These unfortunate men live in desperately exposed places. There is no landing accommodation of any kind.  In one locality there was a makeshift landing ground with a crane. Apparently, the wheel of the crane became rusty and the county council ordered it to be dismantled.  It has been dismantled and the fishermen have now no means of hauling up their boats to safety.  At Greencastle, some 20 miles away, there is landing accommodation. These are the only two possible places in which the local fishermen can land their boats or their fish.  I would appeal to the Minister to take immediate steps to provide facilities, either at Greencastle or Portaleen, in order that these men can land their boats and protect them in stormy weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word now about the herring fishing.  In certain parts of my constituency shoals of herring come in two or three times a year.  I think that it is essential that the local fishermen should have facilities provided for them in order that they can deal with these herrings as quickly as possible inside the three weeks or the month during which the shoal lasts.  At the moment there is no way of dealing with them expeditiously.  I would urge upon the Minister that he should establish a herring station somewhere on the western coast between Donegal and Cork.  I would like it for Donegal, but I do not claim it for Donegal.  It might be better <Col N="659" /> to have it at, say, Sligo.  They should be provided with factories competent to prepare and cure the fish for use in time of scarcity or for export.</P>
    <P>The Minister has apparently anchored himself to inshore fishing.  That being so, I think we should give the Minister full power to put these inshore fishermen into full production by supplying them with all the necessary equipment. I have already informed the Minister that the boat-yard at Meevagh has been dismantled.  I think that should be reestablished because it must be appreciated that if an enormous number of boats have to be built for these inshore fishermen there will be a heavy annual replacement necessary.  These boats are small and easily wrecked.  The annual loss is high.  If private yards will not take orders for the building of these boats then some other steps will have to be taken in order to supplement the output of the boat-yard at Killybegs.  I am hoping for a long period of prosperity for the industry there.  Once it has been rehabilitated as a first-class fishing station there is no reason why it should not be successful. I would appeal again to the Minister to consider the urgent necessity for making provision for these fishermen in the Inishowen peninsula.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is as well that all the interests represented in this House should very briefly express their viewpoints in regard to the policy enunciated by the Minister so that, if there is agreement on that policy, we can give him the utmost support. If we are agreed upon policy, certainly there should be an equal agreement on the need for urgent and effective action to remedy the many difficulties that exist in the fishing industry at the moment.  I can speak for a very large body of workers who are directly concerned in the industry in regard to wholesale and retail distribution. They have a certain viewpoint in relation to the policy enunciated by the Minister.  It is as well that their attitude towards that policy should be made quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking for those workers who are engaged in the wholesale and retail trade, I want to make it quite clear <Col N="660" /> that we are wholeheartedly in support of the Minister when he says that it should be the foundation of the policy to protect the existing livelihood of inshore fishermen and to develop that as far as possible so that they will be assured of not merely the present standard of living but, what is much more important, an enhanced standard. I cannot say at the moment that the return which these fishermen secure as a result of their arduous and dangerous labours is an attraction.  So far as the men and women engaged in the wholesale and retail side of the industry are concerned, they are most anxious that inshore fishing should be developed.  At the same time they have certain interests in that development which require both understanding and protection.  It is not quite correct to say that the Sea Fisheries Association is the organisation that has displayed an interest in the welfare of the inshore fishermen.  The men and women engaged in the retail and wholesale side of it have on two occasions recently taken very effective steps to show their sympathy in a practical way.  The livelihood of many of them is dependent at times on the flow of fish, principally for smoking.</P>
    <P>We have only one wholesale market and that is in the city.  They have taken the stand that they are not prepared to handle imported fish if the importation would be to the detriment of the interests of the inshore fishermen. Last year when fishermen had to take direct action to try to establish a fair price from the buyers, the men and women engaged in the wholesale and retail trade expressed their practical sympathy by refusing to handle fish which could not be regarded by the fishermen as having been fairly dealt with, and they definitely refused to handle any fish that might be brought in for the purpose of breaking the action of the inshore fishermen. Therefore, there is a common interest between the workers engaged in the catching and on the distribution side.</P>
    <P>We all agree on basing our policy on the development of the interests of the inshore fishermen, and while that is a problem that has its social and economic aspect, it is also a problem for the consumers.  I feel that, having <Col N="661" /> paid our tribute to the Sea Fisheries Association, much more requires to be done.  In the Estimates I notice a provision of £20,000 for boats.  I understand the position has eased, and there is the fact that we have a shipyard at Killybegs preparing to launch its first boat.  Certain supplies of engines are available.  One would have thought a much larger sum could be utilised this year if we have got a certain supply of engines coming in.  Is there any reason why the construction of the hulls could not be proceeded with, even if it means waiting for a short period for the delivery of the engines?  Quite clearly the problem is one of boats and gear but, having started to solve that, we still have a major problem facing us.</P>
    <P>I can see no point in asking several thousand men to engage in this arduous way of earning a livelihood, even if they have good boats and gear if, when the catches are brought in, they are sold at such a low price as not to give a reasonable return or at such a price that the average consumer cannot afford to buy.  It is quite true, as has been said by speakers here, that so far as supplies of fish in this country are concerned, the supplies do not exist to any great extent outside the big towns.  Even in Dublin some weeks ago fish were put on sale in the market and bought and subsequently thrown out because they were unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that they came to sell bad fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fish came in through the one trawling company we have and that trawler is not suitably equipped for holding fish for long periods.  When they were put on sale they were not of good quality.  As a matter of fact, it was reported to the Department and certain action was taken.  The supply was so short at the time that many shops bought supplies but subsequently found that they could not use them.  They were the only fish available in the market at the time. We have had a situation for a period of weeks where quite a large number of retail shops were unable to get supplies of fine fish.  Representations were made to the Department to arrange for <Col N="662" /> the importation of fish as a temporary measure.  There is a certain objection to that.  When these imports are brought in, I agree they should be under the control of the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
      <P>The system of distribution is such that it requires an element of justice. We have in the cities and towns both large and small retail fish merchants and recently the experience has been that quite a large number of the smaller shops have been left without supplies of fine fish because of bad distribution methods.  That is part of the problem of the big type of monopoly we have.  The Minister should take active steps to give effect to the policy he enunciated of making that monopoly representative of all interests in the trade.  It might be made, as he said, an ancillary side to the Sea Fisheries Association because it seems to me that is the only way we can get away from the present bad situation.  It seems doubtful that the interests he has in mind will take an active share in the development of the company and therefore we are thrown back on the Sea Fisheries Association taking an interest and thus getting away from a bad situation.</P>
      <P>The situation is that we have only one trawling company as a source of supply for one retail combine and when they have their fill of fish what is left is made available for the other interests in the trade.  If there is no surplus there are no fish for those outside the combine.  It may be true that those connected with the combine have taken the gamble, invested their money and provided themselves with this source of supply, but that is dependent on an effective monopoly.  The monopoly is there and it is a continual source of friction because of unfairness in regard to supply, and that situation will continue as long as this is managed on the present basis.  Proposals were made to the Minister from other interests to develop trawling on a much broader basis.  I agree with him in the attitude he took and in his present stand in relation to developing trawling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to base our policy on the sustenance and support of the inshore fishermen we must take more effective <Col N="663" /> steps than merely providing boats and gear.  Before the war the association developed advertising and developed a public taste for fish and gave the public knowledge that fish could be made available.  They tried travelling shops in the rural areas.  These are lines that ought to be developed if we are to invest money and supply men with the gear to catch, land and distribute fish.  I understand that quite a large number of people believe that because we have to eat fish on one day in the week we have a natural disinclination to eat them on other days.  I do not think that is altogether true.  It is correct that fish-eating is confined to a small section of the population, but that may be because of price and the difficulty of supply.  It is equally true that if fish were available at a more reasonable price and supplies were regular and easy of access the public might be more inclined to avail of them.</P>
    <P>If we developed a campaign to bring home to the people the fact that fish are available I believe we could increase the public consumption to quite a large degree.  It is a fact that in many of the smaller towns it is practically impossible to obtain fish and I am quite sure there is no town or village in most parts of Ireland where there are not some people who would like to eat fish.  At the moment they have got no choice.  It is also true that even amongst the ordinary working-class people, years ago when fish was cheaper and a little more readily available, they did not confine their fish-eating to Friday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I never eat fish except on Friday and I never will, with the help of God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If we accept the position that fish is only to be eaten on Friday, the problem is even bigger than we thought it was.  I think, however, that is not a correct view, and having got several thousand men directly engaged in the catching side of the industry and 1,000 or 2,000 <Col N="664" /> engaged in distribution, if we were able to develop a reasonably steady market spread over the major part of each week, it would provide those men with a constant source of employment and a somewhat higher standard of living than they enjoy at the present time.  It does, however, require something more than merely gear and boats and I think the campaign which the Sea Fisheries Association was developing before the war should receive immediate attention. Even if it were merely confined to the question of developing publicity and providing means of transportation, it would lead to a greater consumption of fish as increased supplies became available.</P>
      <P>One other point upon which the Minister touched, to which I should like him to give immediate attention, is the fact that because of our situation in regard to the fishing industry we have at times to face the difficulty that we have not got supplies of home caught fish immediately available.  That has been the situation almost every year from the months of January to March because of weather conditions.  His solution is to import fish but we should first of all make it quite clear that if we are going to import fish, it is not going to be filleted fish.  We have got quite a number of highly skilled men who can fillet fish and if we are going to import fish, there is no reason why that part of the work should be done abroad.  Secondly, if fish is to be imported we should try to secure that it is of good quality.  I understand that there are difficulties in obtaining supplies of fish at the present time and some of the supplies have not been of particularly good quality.  There have been some complaints on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, and most important of all, there is a certain amount of criticism in regard, not to the fact that the Sea Fisheries Association is the importing agency&mdash;I do not know that there is any objection to that&mdash;but to the fact that when fish is imported, supplies are not made available to all retailers on an equal basis, including the Sea Fisheries Association itself.  There should be some distinction between the Sea Fisheries Association as an importing <Col N="665" /> agency and as a trading agency. Some of the criticism has been directed to the fact that the association is engaged in retail trading.  I accept it that that is not correct, but they have engaged in supplying contracts and the criticism is made that advantage is taken by the trading part of the association of that fact that they are importers and, therefore, have first access to available supplies.  I think so long as we agree that it is necessary to have a certain agency for the importation of fish, that agency must be the Sea Fisheries Association, but it should not be allowed to take advantage&mdash;I will not say it has taken advantage&mdash;of its position in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a very limited function on the retail side but it has given rise to a certain amount of criticism.  The most important point is to secure that the association should be the single importing agency.  On behalf of the men and women engaged in the wholesale trade, I hope that the development of this industry will be pushed forward to its limit.  The Minister should appreciate that he has the fullest support of the House in any requirements from the point of view of finance.  So far as the provision of boats is required, every assistance should be given to those engaged in the trade so that we can provide them, not merely with a continuation of their present standards of living, but improve these standards by trying to develop in this country a more extended taste for fish in order to provide a market for the output of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very interesting statement from the Minister on this Estimate.  I think most Deputies will agree with the remarks of Deputy Larkin that if the Minister intends to carry out the hopes expressed and the expectations aroused by his speech to-night, he will have to make a more generous provision for boats and gear, if he is going to maintain the interests of the inshore fishermen.  If we examine the Estimate for this year we find that about £90,000 <Col N="666" /> is being provided under the sub-head for compensation under the Fisheries Act of 1939 and if we deduct that £90,000 from the total amount provided under the Estimate, we shall find that there is a reduction of about £5,000 on the amount provided last year.</P>
      <P>When we take into account the circumstances that obtained last year and the previous years, when gear was practically unobtainable and timber for boat building was very difficult to procure, it occurs to me that a greater financial provision should be made this year, now that these materials are in more plentiful supply, if we are going to make any attempt at the development of our inshore fishing.  During the war years, apart from the fact that very little was done in the way of mending boats or building new boats, there was a considerable deterioration in the condition of our fishing fleets and consequently it would seem to me that the Minister should have made much greater provision than has been made here to meet that situation. There is also the fact that there is a clamour all along the coasts for extra fishing boats.</P>
      <P>While I am on the question of fishing boats, may I say that I think the association are now aware that the type of boat that had been built in previous years, particularly boats intended for seine net fishing, which is the type commonly used in the areas I represent, is not now regarded as suitable. The fishermen are anxious that a boat of a much longer keel should be provided, a boat of a 60 to 75 feet keel. The smaller type of boat, with a 40 to 50 feet keel, is regarded as a more suitable type of boat for the east coast, but I speak for the fishermen of the west coast and they prefer the larger boat which is a more seaworthy craft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What strikes one as a very strange anomaly is the complaints we have heard of the scarcity of fish, which we know to be a fact, in inland towns. When one contrasts that with the ration, as one might describe it, of the fishermen in the matter of the hours and days they are to fish, it is very hard to reconcile the two situations. We have here, on the one hand, a <Col N="667" /> scarcity of fish, and we find, on the other hand, the Sea Fisheries Association refusing to purchase fish from their members, except fish which has been caught on the days on which the members are allowed to fish.  It is true that, in Killybegs, they are confined to three days and, in some weeks, four days.  I am open to correction, but I do not believe that they are allowed to fish more than four days in any week, because they are told that there will be a glut on the market, while we know that many towns, not only throughout Ireland but even adjacent to Killybegs, cannot get fish from one year's end to another.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries Association take the fish and market them in Dublin. There are facilities for people who want to order fish through the Sea Fisheries Association's agent and to make provision for a regular supply of fish, but the average person does not know of that system and, even if he did, it would not pay the private individual, the man who wants fish for his family, always to have to get in touch with the agent in Killybegs and order his own quantity of fish.  Unless we tackle the marketing end, and enable the fishermen to fish when fish are plentiful and provide a market in the inland towns amongst the people who want fish and cannot get it, we will not have dealt in a satisfactory manner with our inland fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">

      <P>My complaint about the Sea Fisheries Association is that they collect the fish at Killybegs depôt, lorry it to Dublin and sell it on the Dublin market, but there is no place from Killybegs to Dublin which will get any share of that fish and no attempt whatever is made to develop a market in the towns through which that fish passes.</P>

      <P>Another matter mentioned here on other occasions, a matter in which I understood the Sea Fisheries Association and the Department were interested, is the question of providing educational facilities for young people who intend to take up fishing as a profession.  One would think that it should not be outside the competency of the Department to devise ways and means of giving educational facilities to those young people in centres convenient to the fishing industry&mdash;to give them instruction in the general principles of navigation, the elements of marine biology, the care and maintenance of marine engines and the care and maintenance of nets, and lectures concerning the sea fisheries of the <Col N="669" /> country and of other countries, and in a general way to cater for the young men who propose to go into the fishing industry.  I understand that the Department were interested in that matter and that they had hoped to get the Department of Education interested, and I am wondering what steps, if any, have been taken to this end and if any progress has been made along these lines.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the launching of the first boat from the new boat-yard in Killybegs and intimated that he did not propose to go down there.  I do not know whether the Minister, if he had gone down, would have used the occasion, as other members of the Government have used similar occasions, to take credit for the work of their predecessors.  The boatyard in Killybegs was completed and work had begun before the change of Government, and, as the Minister admitted, any credit in that respect was due to his predecessor.</P>

      <P>My remarks will have nothing to do with sea fisheries, which, I think have been dealt with pretty exhaustively, but I want to say that this Estimate deals with a most important industry for the country.  We have here in Ireland, by reason of our situation, excellent sea fishery resources, but we also have considerable wealth in our inland rivers and lakes.  We have wealth given to us by the fact that Ireland is extensively watered and there is consequently a real wealth in fish in our <Col N="670" /> inland rivers and lakes.  That wealth, in the years since we got our freedom, has unfortunately been decreasing each year.</P>
      <P>Perhaps by reason of the fact that prior to 1921, big money was interested in inland fishing and ordinary trout and salmon fishing in Ireland was the sport of the rich man, perhaps by reason of the disappearance of that class, we have ceased to value the particular thing they valued and, by neglect, we have allowed some of the most excellent inland fisheries in the world to depreciate and to disappear.  Very few people realise that fishing is no longer the pastime of the rich man and the big man.  It is the pastime of many workers and a fishing holiday is prized by many ordinary people.  Any Deputy who has made a pastime of fishing and who goes to any of the better-known fishing centres, whether lake or river, will always hear the same story, that the big fish were caught years ago, that fishing was always good in the years gone by.  That story is so common in this country that there must be something in it.</P>
      <P>If the experts in the Department were to carry out a survey of our inland fisheries to-day, they would find that in many of our lakes, the western lakes particularly, there is a disease affecting trout that is new to this country.  That is particularly so in the case of a ring of lakes between Roundstone and Clifden, an area in which there are about 100 lakes which were formerly the finest trout-fishing lakes on our western seaboard. To-day there are large lakes, like Loch Fada, which, I am sure, Deputy Bartley is aware of, where the entire stock of fish is rotting away. As soon as they are spawned, they become affected by the disease.  That disease has spread through a ring of lakes in that particular part of the West.  It is not confined to that area. It is to be found in many other inland lakes in this country and it is my view that that has arisen, because there is no one in the Department of Fisheries who cares about our inland fisheries&mdash; not one at all.  I am glad the Minister has returned.  There they have been for years talking about fisheries.</P>

      <P>It is my view that neglect has brought about this position.  The Minister has referred to the dredging of rivers.  Any Deputy who can think of a small trout stream down the country realises the appalling damage that has been done by weeds at spawning time.  He knows the effect that neglect of the rivers has on our trout fishing.  I trust the cleansing of certain spawning streams may bring about good results.  The Minister's Department is aware of the particular disease I have mentioned.  His Department were made aware of it, not by any efficiency on the part of the Department itself, but through trout associations and fishery associations who brought the matter to their notice. However, they have notice of that particular complaint.  They have notice of the harm that has already been caused to a considerable number of lakes in the West and I beseech the Minister not to allow that particular disease to remain, affecting lake after lake, in the years to come.  Now is the time it should be tackled.  We have an attraction in our fisheries so far as tourists are concerned but we have, which is far far more important, an attraction for our own people and we should not allow it to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal than can be said about fisheries that I would like to say at another time.  All these matters require attention.  Let the Minister devote as much time as he likes to sea fisheries and to the organisation of sea fisheries and inshore fisheries so that those who take it up as an occupation may make a fair income from it and get a fair price.  Let him do that by all means but let him, under no circumstances, neglect our inland fisheries.  They have been neglected, perhaps by reason of the fact that there have been too many masters and too many authorities in charge&mdash;drainage boards, the Land Commission, private owners and <Col N="672" /> private trout fishing associations, and the Department.  There has been no central authority, no one laying down a policy or laying down a manner in which fisheries can be preserved.  I would suggest to the Minister that the time has come to have some central authority of experts in charge of inland fisheries, laying down a policy for the general preservation of inland fisheries. I would stress the importance of that particular aspect, which should not be overlooked or forgotten.</P>

      <P>There is no question of politics in this Estimate for Fisheries, whatever might be said about Agriculture. I had not intended to refer to inland fisheries but, as Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned my name, I want to tell him that I do know of the disease to which he has referred. Various causes are ascribed.</P>

      <P>One opinion is that the lakes are all bog lakes and that in a great many of them the waters are too confined.  It is a matter that requires the earnest attention of the Department.  A great many people, particularly in Connemara, consider that by linking up lakes, a very fine inland fishery could be developed and very possibly that might solve the problem. There is another area that has not been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins: it is not far from the group of lakes that he mentioned where the incidence of disease is higher.  I do not know whether it is a peculiar feature of the district or not or whether it occurs elsewhere or not.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the sea fisheries. The Minister's statement would indicate that he does not intend to do anything. We have been lambasted for neglecting sea fisheries, but, at any rate, we never announced that it was our intention as a policy, to stand still. There was a standstill during the war but the strange thing about the fishing industry is that in time of war the industry booms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association up to the beginning of the war.  During the <Col N="673" /> pre-war period, the committee had a great deal of work to do.  There were many difficulties&mdash;principally marketing difficulties&mdash;but I knew from my experience, such as it was, in the First World War that a great many of those difficulties would disappear&mdash;and they did disappear.  The Minister's advisers know that people who had not a £5 note to put down as a purchase deposit on a boat when the war broke out, were able to come along at the end of the war and put down £150 or £200.  A great many who began to operate at the beginning of the war were able to pay off the debt before the war ended &mdash;and some of them had to pay tidy sums in income-tax as well.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the Minister's attitude towards trawling. The previous Minister conceived the idea of a large trawling company and was prepared to give it a certain amount of State aid.  I remember when he announced it here some years ago and I spoke against it myself, as I did not think the State should enter into any large trawling scheme whatsoever. That is not to say I am against trawling.  I am in wholehearted sympathy with the Minister when he says that his main purpose is to retain the inshore fishermen.  Where we part company is when we come to carrying that out.  There were two opposite opinions expressed on the far side to-night.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde said that the home market would not support any fishing industry worthy of the name, while Deputy McMenamin said you cannot get fish in any town in the country.  The strange thing is that you can adduce evidence to support each of these contradictory views. Deputy Larkin seemed to support Deputy Esmonde's view as well.  I do not think you will ever solve that difficulty while the State is the main undertaker in the matter of large-scale fishing.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, from the Minister's own statement about ungovernable weather, that the type of boat that has been supplied is not suitable at all to carry a supply of fish.  It has to operate in accordance with the vagaries of the weather.  That being so, you can have only fine weather fishing. <Col N="674" /> I have always been quarrelling with the Sea Fisheries Association on the type of boat which they designed. My view may have been discounted a good deal because I am not a fisherman myself, but if I am not, in any event, like the man who did not go to school but met the scholars, I got my opinions on it from people who have been at it all their lives; and I think that is a sensible thing to do, that no matter how much personal knowledge a man might have, he should always consult others.  The West coast of Ireland is obviously not a place where you can operate successfully the same type of boat as would be very suitable on the East coast.  The Dublin market is convenient to east coast fishermen and will always make it worth while for a fisherman, with the ordinary type of boat that the Sea Fisheries Association have always been supplying, to get out and get into the industry with that type of equipment.</P>
    <P>A larger boat is definitely wanted on the West coast and, as the Minister must know if he has consulted his advisers and people in the business on the West coast of Ireland, the social changes which have been brought about in certain directions have affected the association also.  Young people are not now going to go out and operate the type of equipment operated very successfully 30 years ago, or even pre-war.  I know one man who is a very active and experienced fisherman and has grown-up sons, and he told me he could not get his own family out fishing with him unless he guaranteed to bring them back in time for the pictures. If you are to counteract that kind of attitude, you can only do it by providing a boat that will offer better amenities than there have been before. To do that, there will have to be a larger boat and I think we will have to aim at a boat for the West coast twice the size of the Sea Fisheries Association's standard boat, which is 36 feet. I believe they have departed now from that and that they are going in for the bigger one, with a deck cabin and wireless and, above all and beyond all, the means of handling fish on board.</P>
    <P>Whether a State association like the Sea Fisheries Association is the best <Col N="675" /> agent for handling that type of fishing or not is open to question and possibly the Minister is aware of that, because he has announced that he is going to set up a council to get advice.  It may be significant that it was not decided to establish this council until a new association called Muintir na Mara established itself.  Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara, the Sea Fisheries Association as we know it, was not established by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government until a similar effort had been made by another group of fishermen who were organising around the coast at that time to force the Government to do something.  Now we have got this Government aid sponsored association, but it lacks, in my opinion, the first characteristic of an association, in the fact that its members do not associate.  If you want to get a quorum at the annual meeting, you have to whip up a number of officials, otherwise the annual meeting will collapse for the want of a quorum.</P>
    <P>The provision of facilities is so regulated that a man must become a member of the association before he can qualify to get any such facilities. He pays down 6/- and thereafter he <Col N="676" /> pays 1/- a year.  The Minister gave us no information at all about the association. He did not tell us how it is functioning or to what extent its membership is live.  He did not tell us what the size of the membership is, how many are paid up, how many calls are in arrear and the amount of the arrears.  In my opinion, all that information should have been given to us. He did not give us very much information about the possibility of supplying the needs of the fishermen who have applications for boats and gear with the association.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be all against trawling, but I would like to remind him of the fact that practically all the boats supplied by the association are trawling boats and engaged in trawling, though, unfortunately, on the West coast they are of such a size that they have to do most of the trawling inshore in the bays and inlets which should be left to much smaller craft. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12 midnight to 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 16th July, 1948.</P>
