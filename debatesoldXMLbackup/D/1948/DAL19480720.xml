      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that during the recent strike of National Health Insurance staff the duties of agent of that company were discharged by home assistance officers, to whom no monetary recompense has so far been made for their services; and, further, if he will take this matter up with the appropriate authority with a view to having suitable remuneration paid to the home assistance officers concerned.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the duties of agent of the National Health Insurance Society were performed by home assistance officers during the recent strike of the society's staff.  The duties performed by the assistance officers consisted mainly of paying special allowances under the Social Welfare (Substitutive Allowances) Order, 1948, to members of the National Health Insurance Society who were ill and were unable, because of the strike, to obtain sickness or disablement benefit, to which they were entitled.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for the payment, through the local assistance authorities, of suitable remuneration to each assistance officer who performed the work in question, and instructions in the matter will be issued to the assistance authorities in the very near future.</P>

      <P>It is only when such works are carried out for the specific purpose of taking men off the unemployment assistance register that full cost State grants can be made.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken as a whole, only a very small percentage of the proposals submitted to the special employment schemes office under rural improvements schemes or minor employment schemes have to be rejected as unsuitable owing to the objections of adjoining landholders.  It is found from experience that many objections are withdrawn after the lapse of a period of time.</P>
      <P>In some cases, as for instance when the work involves the construction of a new section of road or the widening of an existing road, the objection may not be unreasonable, as the objecting landholder may find that he would have to surrender an undue proportion of his land in order to accommodate landholders who would not have to give anything.</P>
      <P>The State is always jealous of any interference with private ownership, and would, no doubt, insist on measures to safeguard individual landholders against the danger of arbitrary actions; so that the exercise of compulsory powers would necessarily involve a whole legal procedure: the serving of preliminary notices, the hearing of objections, the question of compensation and its assessment, and probably a right of appeal.  An elaborate procedure of this kind would be out of place in regard to the relatively small works which are undertaken under the minor schemes.</P>
      <P>It is probable also that an imposed settlement would accentuate the bad feeling amongst neighbours which is very often the cause of the original objection.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied, therefore, that the introduction of proposals for legislation to vest the special employment schemes office with compulsory powers would be warranted in this matter.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that in the normal course employment schemes are sanctioned for execution only during the winter months, but that rural improvements schemes are sanctioned at any time of the year on lodgment by the beneficiaries of their appropriate contribution towards the cost.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, proposals for urban and rural employment schemes are put forward by the urban and county councils, respectively, through the Department of Local Government to absorb the amounts made available for such schemes from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.  The minor employment schemes programme is prepared from applications received in my office from rural areas in which there are sufficient unemployment assistance recipients to warrant the sanction of grants; and, as already stated, the sanction of rural improvements schemes depends on the acceptance of offers made to the landholders concerned.  Without an undue amount of clerical work on the part of my staff, I could not say what number of proposals under the latter two heads have been reported as suitable by the inspectors.  Work on employment schemes in County Clare will in the normal course be put in hands during the winter months, but a programme of drainage schemes for the development of privately owned bogs has recently been sanctioned for execution there during the summer months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has under consideration the question of granting a general carriers' licence to private lorry owners who were engaged in turf, or similar haulage work, during the emergency, or of granting permission to them to carry for hire or reward.</P>

      <P>The question of granting merchandise licences to private hauliers who were engaged in the transport of fuel during the emergency <Col N="770" /> has been very fully considered.  It has been necessary to take account of the serious position of public transport as a whole, and of the fact that the railway companies and the existing licensed hauliers are at present able to provide more than adequately for all the traffic offering.  The difficulty can be appreciated from the fact that there are now on the roads about twice as many lorries owned by the public transport companies, licensed hauliers and private owners, as there were in 1938. The position of public transport is so serious that the Government have decided on an immediate comprehensive investigation of it.  The admission of a large number of new entrants into the general road transport business when there is not now enough work to go around would create serious unemployment among the staffs of the public transport companies and licensed hauliers and would not in the long run, be in the interests either of the lorry owners or of the public generally.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that private lorry owners were promised, as a result of representations made to the Government, that legislation would be introduced to amend the 1943 Transport Act and that, because of these promises, people who had lorries, hung on to them although they might have been able to dispose of them otherwise?  These are now idle so that such silly statements should not be made by members of the Government until such time as they would be in a position to carry out their promises to these people.</P>

Imports of silk and artificial silk hose are subject to quantitative control since 1st July, 1947, and unrestricted imports of other hosiery goods were permitted only during the period from 13th December, 1946, to 21st January, 1948.

      <P>I have made no statutory regulations in regard to the purchase and distribution of streptomycin.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were made with the importing firms and the Medical Research Council to control the import and distribution of this drug until the medical profession in this country has gained more experience of its use. Under these arrangements stocks of streptomycin held by the various importing firms are regarded as forming a pool, details of which are kept by the secretary, Irish Drug Association (wholesale section).  The importers have undertaken to maintain a minimum pool of 4,000 grammes.  When fresh supplies are required to make good withdrawals from the pool application is made by one or more of the importing firms to the Department of Finance for dollar facilities to import a consignment or consignments from the United States of America.  The application for the dollars is accompanied by a recommendation from the secretary, Irish Drug Association, a copy of which is sent to this Department, which, as a rule, supports the recommendation for the grant of the necessary dollars.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangement a medical practitioner or a hospital, desiring to use streptomycin, should apply to the Medical Research Council for permission. If the council are satisfied on the information given by a private practitioner that the case is suitable for treatment with streptomycin, they arrange with the secretary, Irish Drug Association, for the supply of a suitable quantity of the drug to the doctor through his usual chemist.  Hospitals are permitted by the council to keep a reserve up to 100 grammes.</P>
      <P>This amount, together with the amounts required to keep up the reserve, are authorised by the Medical Research Council to be supplied by the distributors selected by the Irish Drug Association and, where possible, through the usual wholesale supplier of the hospital.  A hospital may use up to ten grammes in the treatment of any patient without the prior approval of the council but, if this limit is exceeded, the council's approval must be obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that the understanding which was arrived at last week that the financial business should be concluded on Friday next was based on the assumption that Deputies of all Parties would co-operate in order to dispose of the business in that time. The fact that there has been such an understanding alters the position as far as the preparation of a time-table is concerned.  We are by no means anxious to limit the debate on any Estimate or to place upon ourselves the difficult task of selecting from our own members those who are to participate and of excluding others.  In view, however, of the protracted discussions on some Estimates, I think it would be desirable if an agreement could be made practicable that there should be some arrangement with regard to time. <Col N="786" /> Otherwise there might possibly be protracted debates on minor Estimates which would prevent discussion on major Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience has shown no agreement which the Fine Gael Party have kept and this proves it.  We have had the spectacle of Fine Gael Deputies rising one after the other in order to kill time, and if it goes on in this way we will not co-operate.  Our offer to co-operate is still there, but there must be genuine co-operation and not dictation.  We will not stand for dictation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to this fact. There has been a contention that Deputies on this side of the House occupied the time unnecessarily, but on the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture, 26 speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party occupied 20 hours and seven minutes of the time; of all other sections in the House, 31 members took part, occupying nine hours, 46 minutes. On the Fisheries debate which followed 13 speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party occupied two hours, 22 minutes, while <Col N="787" /> 20 speakers of other sections occupied two hours and 27 minutes.  In view of what Deputy Lemass has said, I make clear again what I made clear last week that I did not accept any understanding, expressed or implied, as limiting in any way what was to my mind, and what I made absolutely clear was an unqualified undertaking, that the Estimates and all Stages of the Appropriation Bill would be finished next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

Our agreement to finish the financial business by Friday next is dependent upon the Government Parties co-operating in the completion of the business by that time and giving reasonable facilities for the discussion of each Estimate.

So far as co-operation is concerned, we have tried for months past to get some co-operation on these Estimates, and failed, and it was not until I obtained a public agreement, publicly announced in the House, to finish these Estimates, that we were able to get <Col N="788" /> anywhere at all.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,975,840 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment <Col N="792" /> during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>The gross Post Office Estimate for 1948/49 amounts to £4,770,298, but, allowing for receipts totalling £245,458 to be appropriated in aid, the net Estimate is for £4,524,840.  This represents an increase of £36,140 over the net provision for 1947/48.  The more substantial variations&mdash;those over £5,000&mdash; occur on the following sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A (1) to A (4)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  There is a net increase under these sub-heads of £74,090.  Provision is made for additional expenditure amounting to £124,033, to meet normal incremental increases; additional staff to provide for growth of work, increased remuneration to sub-postmasters, etc. Against this additional expenditure there are offsetting decreases amounting to £49,943, due to savings on retirements, reduced provision for temporary staff, etc.</P>
    <P>E (2)&mdash;Conveyance of mails by road. The increase, £14,300, is due to the introduction of new road services; higher subsidies to mail car contractors, including Córas Iompair Éireann, as a result of increased operating costs of transport; and to higher payments for casual assistance on delivery duties.</P>
    <P>E (5)&mdash;Conveyance by air.  The increase of £42,750 is due to the material growth of traffic arising from trade revival since the end of hostilities, from greater facilities afforded by more frequent and varied air services and from lower air postage rates.  The air mail traffic despatched from the Shannon Airport to the U.S.A., for example, has more than doubled.</P>
    <P>G (1)&mdash;Stores (Non-Engineering).  On this sub-head there is an increase of £16,320.  The provision of this sub-head is for the purchase of non-engineering stores.  The increase is due mainly to provision for the purchase of mail bags <Col N="793" /> the renewal of which had been held up because of the difficulty in securing suitable material during the emergency.</P>
    <P>G (2)&mdash;Uniform Clothing.  The increase of £11,710 is due to the building up of stocks of cottons which became seriously depleted during the emergency years, to additional tailoring costs and to a partial resumption of the issue of uniform to postmen and boy messengers.</P>
    <P>I (1)&mdash;Engineering Establishment, Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  There is a decrease of £57,455.  This sub-head provides for the total pay of the engineering branch staff but the cost of staff time employed on the development of the telephone service as distinct from its maintenance is defrayed from telephone capital funds.  The speeding up of telephone development this year will, therefore, cause greater relief from the funds, namely, £170,885 as against £74,435 last year.</P>
    <P>While, therefore, the sub-head makes provision for additional payment for staff amounting to £38,995, this is more than offset by the greater relief from telephone capital funds, leaving a net decrease on the sub-head of £57,455.</P>
    <P>K&mdash;Engineering Materials.  On this sub-head there is a decrease of £15,585. Provision is made for increased purchases of engineering stores, £96,720, more than offset by relief, £112,305, from telephone capital funds in respect of stores employed for telephone capital works.</P>
    <P>L (3)&mdash;Engineering Contract Work. The increase of £13,050 is in respect of additional telegraph, etc., construction.</P>
    <P>M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments. This sub-head is increased by £9,462. As Deputies are aware, funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924-1946) which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums for this purpose.  They are repayable by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance provision is made each year under this sub-head <Col N="794" /> for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increase indicates the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>N (1) to N (3)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances, etc.  The decrease under sub-head N (1) amounts to £50,720, due mainly to reduced provision for additional allowances (£52,200) and marriage gratuities (£2,730), offset by minor variations amounting to £4,210.</P>
    <P>The decrease&mdash;£3,040&mdash;under N (2) is due to the deaths of Treaty pensioners, while the increase&mdash;£4,000&mdash;under N (3) represents certain bonus payments to officers who gave notice of retirement under the Treaty, prior to 1st March, 1929.  The retiring allowances in these cases are paid without an overriding maximum in regard to cost-of-living bonus and the British Administration repays the difference between the cost-of-living figure at the time of retirement and any higher cost-of-living figure which subsequently may become operative.  The repayments are brought to credit under sub-head T (12).</P>
    <P>Q (1) to Q (3).&mdash;Civil aviation and meteorological services.  These services are controlled by the Department of Industry and Commerce but the engineering personnel (technical and labour) is provided by the Post Office and paid for out of this sub-head, which also defrays the cost of providing and installing equipment and the maintenance charges of the radio stations, rent., etc.  The amount so paid is charged against the Department of Industry and Commerce in the post office commercial accounts as a &ldquo;service rendered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid.  The estimated increase of £20,457 is based mainly on the expectation that £8,000 will be received from the British Administration in respect of the excess of incoming parcel traffic from Britain over outgoing traffic; that £4,000 more than last year will be repaid on foot of Treaty, etc., pensions; and that savings bank funds will repay £4,000 more in respect of anticipated additional staff costs.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the three <Col N="795" /> main services&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone&mdash;at the end of 1946-47, the latest year for which complete figures are available, was not unfavourable on the whole, though a substantial disimprovement was evident as compared with the previous year.  It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Postal Services&mdash;deficit £26,980, as against a surplus of £32,512 in 1945-46.</P>
    <P>Telegraph Service&mdash;deficit £140,515, as against a deficit of £116,001.</P>
    <P>Telephone Service&mdash;surplus of £253,119, as against £298,004.</P>
    <P>The net surplus on the three services for 1946-47 was £85,624, as compared with £214,515 for the previous year and will be seen to have been achieved by the buoyant returns from the working of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>My predecessor intimated last year that this surplus was likely to fall still further in view of growing costs.  It will perhaps be well, therefore, if I refer briefly to the causes of the deficits on the postal and telegraph services.</P>
    <P>On the postal service the swing-over from a surplus of £32,512 to a deficit of £26,980 was, in the main, caused by increased expenditure of £204,000 on salaries, wages, etc., which was due to extra staff and consolidation of salaries and wages, of £35,000 on uniform clothing, etc., of £67,500 on conveyance of mails, while provision for mailbags, etc., and pension liability amounted to a further £28,000.  This increased expenditure was partly offset by a growth in postal revenue of £271,000.</P>
    <P>On the telegraph service the increased deficit was attributable to higher salaries and wages, which was, again, mainly due to extra staff and consolidation, and to higher costs of maintenance, etc., offset in some measure by additional revenue from extra traffic.</P>
    <P>The completed revenue and expenditure figures for the three services for the financial year 1947-48, are not yet available, but preliminary figures suggest that, as compared with the years 1945-46 and 1946-47, when there were surpluses of £214,515 <Col N="796" /> and £85,624, respectively, the balance for 1947-48 will be much less favourable. Indeed the year's working may even show a loss.  In view of this possibility and taking into account growing costs generally, including increased expenditure on mail services &mdash;to which I will refer later&mdash;it is quite clear that a very substantial deficit for the financial year 1948-49 would have resulted unless steps were taken to increase revenue.  The Department, accordingly, found it necessary to impose certain increases in rates as from 1st July, and particulars of these have been announced.  The increases, which are expected to produce additional revenue to the extent of £200,000 per annum, principally affect the printed paper and parcel post services, which have hitherto been carried out at a relatively greater loss than other types of postal business.</P>
    <P>Mails.  In regard to mails, I am glad to say that substantial progress has been made towards providing better services for the public than it has been possible to give for a number of years past.  When my predecessor introduced his Estimate last year, the fuel crisis was acute; rail services were restricted and the mail services which, as Deputies are aware, are closely bound up with the rail transport system, suffered severely.  Immediately the fuel crisis became less acute, however, and the transport situation became easier, the mail arrangements were extended and improved, and there has since been a progressive development towards a more satisfactory standard of service.</P>
    <P>The first development of importance was the restoration of night mail services to and from the West of Ireland, which had been suspended since 1941. Restoration of these night mail services, which supplemented those already in operation to and from the South, was made possible by the introduction, principally for mail purposes, of night perishable trains to and from Athlone, to which connecting lorry services on the Sligo, Mayo and Athlone-Galway sections were arranged.  The night mails on the Dublin-Wexford line were transferred to Departmental motor transport, with a substantial <Col N="797" /> improvement in regularity of operation, and ensured that night mail postings at offices on the Dublin-Wexford line would secure the first morning delivery in Dublin.  Special road transport for night mails in the Waterford-Mallow, Portarlington-Tullamore and Birr-Ballybrophy-Roscrea areas was also introduced, with beneficial results. Later in the year, Departmental transport was introduced for mails on the Galway-Clifden line, resulting in a much earlier delivery throughout Connemara. The Dublin-Kells motor van service was restored in December last.</P>
    <P>Following the further recent improvement in the fuel position, opportunity was availed of to open negotiations with Córas Iompair Éireann with a view to improving the day mail services, and I am pleased to say that, as a result of these negotiations, the company found it possible to provide, as from 29th May, main line day mail trains on the southern and western sections of the company's system.  Branch line offices are, for the present, being served by special road transport working in conjunction with the day mail trains. The day mail trains formerly occupied an important position in the Department's mail organisation as a whole, and their restoration is of substantial benefit to the mail service and to the public.  In this connection, I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the manner in which the company co-operated with the Department in the matter.</P>
    <P>On the southern section, the down day mail leaves Kingsbridge at 7 a.m., due Cork 11.35 a.m.  The times of day mail deliveries are now much earlier than those in force up to 31st May. For example, the day mail delivery in Cork is at 12.30 p.m. instead of 4.15 p.m.; in Limerick, 3.15 p.m. instead of 4.45 p.m.; Waterford, 1.15 p.m. instead of 2 p.m.; Mallow, 12.0 noon instead of 4.0 p.m.  Day mails from Dublin are now delivered in Tralee at 2.15 p.m.; Killarney, 2.30 p.m.; Bandon, 2 p.m.; Bantry, 4.30 p.m., and in Skibbereen at 3.30 p.m. on day of receipt.  Prior to the 31st May, these mails were not delivered until the following morning.</P>
    <P>The up day mail train leaves Cork <Col N="798" /> at 3 p.m. and is due Kingsbridge 7.25 p.m.  There are good posting facilities almost everywhere throughout the South, for mails forwarded by this train.  A travelling post office works on the train and connections for correspondence are made at Dublin with the down night mails to the West and to the Dublin-Wexford line, with the outgoing right steamer to Great Britain and the late despatch to the North.</P>
    <P>On the western section, the down day mail leaves Westland Row at 8.0 a.m. and is due in Galway at 12.15 p.m.  The times of day mail deliveries throughout the Midlands and the West of Ireland generally are much earlier than those in force up to the 31st May.  For example, the day mail delivery in Galway now commences at 1.10 p.m. instead of 5 p.m., in Mullingar at 11 a.m. instead of 12.30 p.m.; Athlone 12 noon instead of 2.45 p.m., Tuam 2 p.m. instead of 5 p.m.  Day mails from Dublin are now delivered in Westport at 3.45 p.m. on day of receipt.  Prior to the 31st May, these mails were not delivered until the following morning.</P>
    <P>The up day mail train leaves Galway at 3 p.m., due Westland Row 7.20 p.m. There are good posting facilities throughout the West and Midlands for mails forwarded by this train.  A travelling post office works on it and connections for correspondence are made at Dublin with the down night mails to the South and with the Dublin-Wexford line, with the outgoing night steamer to Great Britain and with the late despatch to the North.  As in the case also of the up day mail from Cork, restoration of the up day mail from Galway results in considerable acceleration in the delivery of correspondence.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing, Deputies will readily appreciate the advantages of the day mail services on the southern and western sections to the public, particularly the business community.</P>
    <P>Road working for both night and day mails in the West Cork area was introduced on the 31st May, with immense benefit to the postal services in those parts.  I hope that, as a result of these arrangements I will be spared the embarrassment of having to make any more apologies for the unsatisfactory <Col N="799" /> services which previously obtained in West Cork and which were due entirely to the unsatisfactory rail transport available for mail purposes in that area.</P>
    <P>Night mail arrangements in Counties Carlow and Kilkenny were improved by the introduction of a night road service on the 31st May, which works in conjunction with the Dublin and Cork night mail trains.  Night mail services were also improved in County Kerry, including the Tralee-Dingle section.  Night mail correspondence from Dublin, Cork and the South of Ireland generally now obtains first delivery in Tralee next morning. Previously, this correspondence was not delivered until 11.45 a.m. on the day after posting.  It was possible to have the night mail train from Youghal to Cork reintroduced on the 31st May and this resulted in the restoration of the pre-war night mail services at offices on the Cork-Youghal branch. Mail services were also improved in County Offaly&mdash;particularly in the Banagher, Belmont, Ferbane, Clara and Ballycumber areas.</P>
    <P>I regret that it has not yet been possible to secure the restoration of suitable day mail trains on the Dublin-Wexford line, but the day mail services in this area are being examined with a view to their improvement.</P>
    <P>So far as the cross-Channel mails are concerned, the night steamer service has continued without interruption since September, 1946.  The working of this service is not, however, as satisfactory as formerly, principally on account of the later morning arrival in Dún Laoghaire, and as a result of this, it is not possible to afford connection between the incoming steamer and the new down day mail train to the South. Indeed, on account of unpunctual operation of the steamer, the connection with the 8 a.m. train to Galway cannot always be secured.  The difficulties arising from this are, however, receiving careful attention to see what can be done.  The day cross-Channel steamers have recently been restored temporarily and the restoration of these will have the effect of accelerating the delivery of portion of the correspondence <Col N="800" /> between Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The decision to afford increased frequency of delivery in rural districts has been implemented, except in certain areas where difficulties have been encountered in avoiding the creation of undesirable small part-time posts.  It is proposed to overcome these by examination on the spot by headquarters officers, and this has already commenced.  These officers will also revise the rural services generally, to ensure that the most efficient and economic methods are being employed to provide satisfactory services for the public.  Where the increased frequency has been provided, it has resulted in a marked improvement in the remuneration of part-time staff generally.</P>
    <P>The postal traffic throughout the year was heavy, and the Christmas traffic created new records.  During the fortnight prior to the last General Election, poll cards and election communications totalling over 8,000,000 were delivered.  The number of parcels received from Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1947 exceeded the number of outgoing parcels to these destinations for the first time since 1939.  This change in the trend of interState parcel traffic is mainly due to a large increase in the number of incoming trade parcels and a very substantial fall in outgoing traffic due to the suspension of the sending of gift parcels of meat to Great Britain.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEGRAPHS.</P>
    <P>Telegraph traffic showed an increase on the figures for the previous year, with a consequent improvement in revenue receipts.  Despite this additional revenue, however, the loss on the service for the financial year 1947-48 is likely to exceed substantially the loss of £140,515 for the financial year 1946-47.  This, in the main, is attributable to the cost of additional staff, to higher expenditure on salaries and wages and to increased costs of maintenance.</P>
    <P>To meet the demand for private teleprinter circuits, an additional 18-channel Voice Frequency System has <Col N="801" /> been provided between Dublin and London.  It is also intended to provide a second 18-channel system between Dublin and Limerick and the substitution of an 18-channel system for the existing 6-channel system between Dublin and Cork is being considered. Arrangements are also in hand for improving the internal service generally, by the extension of the use of tele-printers between Dublin and certain provincial centres.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONES.</P>
    <P>Telephone traffic continues to grow and in 1947 the total calls numbered 61,460,000 as compared with 60,452,000 in 1946.  The increase would have been greater but for the severe damage caused by storms early in 1947, to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>While the position regarding supplies, to which my predecessor referred in detail last year, has eased substantially, there are still some difficulties and delays in obtaining deliveries.</P>
    <P>It has, however, been found possible in the last year to improve the standard of service generally.  Additional equipment was installed in the Dublin automatic exchanges serving the central city area.  Before this equipment was installed, traffic which has been growing rapidly for some years past was much beyond the capacity of the automatic exchange.  The Dublin trunk exchange also was extended.  A large suite of modern switchboards, which have been on order for some years, is likely to be in service within the next few days.  In the meantime, every possible expedient is being adoptd to reduce delay in answering subscribers.</P>
    <P>During the year, additional equipment was installed at about 16 provincial exchanges, including Cork, Letterkenny, Mullingar, etc.  The fitting of additional equipment at some other exchanges has been held up owing to the necessity for structural alterations to provide accommodation.</P>
    <P>Before the end of the year additional circuits were provided on numerous routes, mostly by the installation of three-channel carrier equipment.  This <Col N="802" /> equipment enables three additional conversion channels to be obtained from one pair of wires.  In all, 7,500 miles of additional circuits were provided during the year, bringing the total trunk circuit mileage to 28,135.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Sligo route, which serves the North-West and which was subject to very heavy delay conditions, was relieved by the provision of six additional circuits.  Three circuits were provided between Waterford and Limerick, thus establishing direct communication between the two places.</P>
    <P>There is still heavy delay on the Western route to Athlone and Galway, but it may be possible to give relief during the present year.</P>
    <P>Most of the circuits provided last year were on the main trunk routes. During the coming year it is proposed to provide as many as possible of the shorter lines needed to reduce delays to and from the smaller centres off the main routes.</P>
    <P>The number of cross-Channel circuits which was increased in 1948 from 16 to 26 has recently been further increased to 48 circuits.  The 22 extra lines have been obtained from two additional submarine cables laid at the end of last year in co-operation with the British Post Office.  This is more than treble the number of cross-Channel lines available two years ago.  There is now little or no delay during day hours.  To cater for further growth of cross-Channel traffic, the question of providing more circuits by laying another cable or otherwise is under consideration.</P>
    <P>The severe snowstorms of February and March last year caused extensive damage to the Department's plant throughout the country.  Many areas were completely isolated and, in order to restore communication at the earliest possible moment, temporary repairs were carried out in the first instance, which had subsequently to be made permanent.  This was a big job, necessitating the employment of almost the entire overhead construction staff until the end of October.  In consequence, development work on the new trunk lines, subscribers' circuits, <Col N="803" /> etc., was seriously retarded, while the disorganisation of circuits resulted in a considerable reduction in the annual number of calls.  It is estimated that 180,000 more trunk calls would have been made but for the storm damage. The total cost of repairing the damage due to the snowstorms is estimated at £60,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the position as regards the connection of new subscribers is improving.  A start was made on the systematic clearance of arrears of waiting applications in 1946. The work was interrupted by the diversion of staff to repair storm damage but was resumed in December last when there were some 7,000 waiting applications on hands.  It is intended to provide service for almost all these this year.  Some 2,900 had already been dealt with by the end of June.  The main obstacles in our way are lack of exchange equipment and shortage of spare circuits in the underground cables in the cities and towns.  These are being overcome as rapidly as the supplies and labour position permit.</P>
    <P>Following the rearrangement of equipment in the Dublin automatic exchanges last year to cater for more subscribers it was necessary to transfer to the exchange at Crown Alley all subscribers' lines formerly connected to the exchange at Ship Street.  As a consequence the numbers of the lines transferred (about 2,000 altogether) had to be changed from the series beginning with the figure &ldquo;2&rdquo; to the series beginning with &ldquo;7&rdquo;.  The subscribers concerned were advised of the impending change in August and it was carried out on 1st November.  Arrangements were made whereby anybody dialling the old numbers would be automatically connected to the new numbers.  Over 200 of the subscribers affected will have their numbers changed again within the next few months and they have been advised accordingly.  Arrangements will be made as before whereby calls for their old numbers will be connected to their new numbers.  The Department recognises that changes of telephone numbers cause inconvenience to subscribers but such changes are unavoidable when the <Col N="804" /> service is being expanded.  With the opening of new exchanges in Dublin in the next year or two further extensive changes of numbers will have to be made.</P>
    <P>Telephone service was provided during the past year with Germany (British and United States zones only), Poland and Newfoundland.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Department's policy to provide a telephone call office at every post office which has not hitherto had a public telephone, but this programme will have to be spread over a number of years.  About 900 sub-offices altogether are affected.  Most of these offices are in remote places and heavy line construction work is involved in giving them telephones.  In view of the urgent need to give telephones to the people who were on the waiting list at 31st December last it has been decided to suspend the provision of call offices for the current year in favour of the clearance of waiting applications for telephones.  To date 138 call offices have been provided under the approved scheme.</P>
    <P>The building industry generally is still affected by the scarcity of materials and lack of skilled labour. It has, however, been found possible during the past year to maintain reasonably steady progress with the Department's programme for improvements and extensions in post office accommodation generally which was greatly retarded by the difficulties experienced for some years past and which has now become imperative owing to the further development of the services.  In towns where it is not possible to effect the necessary improvement within the limits of the existing holdings, additional properties or sites are being secured. Already new properties or sites have been acquired at Ballina, Bandon, Bray, Carlow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilrush, Kilkenny, Limerick, Portlaoighise, Rathluirc, Roscrea, Sligo and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Work on a new auto-manual telephone exchange at Cork is in progress and is due for completion in the autumn, when further improvements in the accommodation there will <Col N="805" /> be undertaken.  It is expected that the new auto exchange and engineering office at Waterford will be ready in 1950, and much-needed extensions to the post office at Claremorris are being provided immediately.</P>
    <P>The full plans of the new post office and telephone exchange at St. Andrew Street, Dublin, have been completed, but building operations have been temporarily deferred in favour of more urgent State projects.  Fresh preparatory sketch plans of the new central sorting offices at Pearse Street, Dublin, are under examination.  It was found necessary to discard the former proposals as it was felt that they would not provide adequately for the changes in traffic and expansion of services that have recently taken place, and are apparently of a permanent nature. The scheme for the erection and lease of an extensive new building at the rere of Hammam Buildings, O'Connell Street, to accommodate a new automatic telephone exchange (North City), new telephone headquarters, and new engineering headquarters is proceeding satisfactorily, and the new structure is expected to be ready in 1949.</P>
    <P>The value of contracts placed by the Department's Stores Branch last year was £1,385,970, as compared with £1,024,296 for the previous year.  This increase to a large extent arose from heavy demands for engineering stores required in connection with telephone development and increased activity on the part of other Government Departments who obtain their supplies through the Stores Branch.  Whilst there has been a slight improvement in the supply position, matters in this respect are still far from satisfactory, particularly so far as steel supplies are concerned. My predecessor referred last year to the general shortage of lead.  I am glad to say that there was an unexpected easement during the year in the lead supply position with the result that the Department was able to obtain badly needed large quantities of heavy cable.  There has been a sharp rise in the prices of all commodities whether of foreign or of local origin.</P>
    <P>The amount to credit of Savings Bank depositors on 31st December, 1947, was <Col N="806" /> £36,860,000, the highest year-end figure yet reached.  In 1947, for the first time since 1929, the withdrawals exceeded the deposits.  This falling off of deposits surplus is partly due to the discouragement of savings by the reduction in the rate of interest which came into operation as from 1st January, 1947; but it was, no doubt, contributed to by the fact that goods for which a pent-up demand existed became available in 1947 for the first time since the beginning of the emergency.  The traditional rate of 2½ per cent. interest on all deposits has been restored, as announced in the Budget speech, from the 1st July.</P>
    <P>The amount remaining invested in Savings Certificates at the end of 1947 (exclusive of interest) was £11,700,000. The sale of certificates in 1947, the first complete year of the present issue, was only about 60 per cent. of the sales in 1945, the last complete year of the previous issue; and in the meantime the repayments have increased by 30 per cent.  This decline of saving is no doubt due to the same causes as have affected the Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>The position of some 600 odd temporary part-time postmen recruited during the period 1940-46 and who were only appointed in a temporary capacity was reviewed during the year.  All the officers concerned, save the single men and women who had not service in the Army or in any of the voluntary Defence organisations are being appointed in a quasi-permanent capacity. New ground was broken in regard to the holding of limited competitions for situations as postmen confined to ex-Defence Force personnel&mdash;Post Office service was not a requirement for eligibility.</P>
    <P>My predecessor referred last year to the introduction of a scheme for the review and overhaul of organisation and methods of work in the Accounts Branch, also a scheme for the training of new entrants.  The latter scheme is being continued with gratifying results while the organisation and methods work has been further extended.  Very satisfactory progress, leading to economy has been achieved by simplifying procedure and eliminating unnecessary tasks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> In order to ensure closer co-operation between headquarters and provincial offices, conferences were held during the year with telephone supervising officers and telephonists and the results were satisfactory.  A conference was also recently held with postmasters and the outcome was similarly gratifying. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation of the excellent service rendered by the staff of all grades during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I do this for the purpose simply of giving a general opportunity of criticising the policy of the Department and I do not think we are likely to put the matter to a vote.  Everybody realises the importance of the Post Office.  The amount it spends has gone up enormously with the growing needs and the growing work which it carries on.  It spends £4,500,000 every year and it employs half of the whole Civil Service.  The business increases rapidly from year to year, not merely the number of telephone calls, but the amount of money entrusted to the Post Office.  It also gives service to 67 Departments of State and is credited with something over £600,000 for that work.  It is a Department which has a growing responsibility.  Possibly because it is one of the old Departments, it is a Department that is taken for granted.  I really believe that the Department should have greater powers and that the Minister has an increased responsibility to carry out the work of his Department with much greater initiative.  I was glad to hear buildings referred to. The number of buildings, some of which they have answered on, in the Estimates under the Board of Works, is 24.  I was glad to know that the Hammam site will be developed and that the work planned, especially there, will be completed next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to the Andrew Street Post Office is amazing.  We know that the Department is in a strait-jacket so far as the Board of Works is concerned.  It is not fair to <Col N="808" /> either Department that such a relationship should exist.  On different occasions I myself was informed that work was about to be started on the Andrew Street premises, and afterwards I was told that it would not.  There is a dual control there which is very unsatisfactory. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should therefore, have a much more complete staff of its own and so carry out a great deal of the work themselves.  I do not blame the Board of Works.  That, also, is an old Department which is admirable for carrying on maintenance works.  It has, however, thrown on its shoulders several very large sections of constructional work throughout the country. It is hardly fair, then, to expect them to devote the time or the staff to the specialised type of architecture and engineering which is required for postal work.  There are 24 of these buildings here.  I am glad to note from the Minister's statement that in some cases, at least, considerable advances are being made&mdash;especially in Cork, Waterford and some other places.  I notice that the Minister referred to Andrew Street and the sorting office in Pearse Street.  The sorting office at Pearse Street has been a hardy annual. I am sorry that the Minister for Social Welfare has left the House before I have had an opportunity of returning the compliment he paid me every year for the last so many years with regard to Pearse Street.  There is a fundamental difficulty there.  A much freer hand is required in the post office for dealing with such things.  The post office is a kind of nerve system of the whole State.  The business community depends on it.  If there is to be any real drive and initiative behind the business community it should get the most rapidly developed services.  Therefore these buildings are all tremendously important and they should not be put aside.  I have in mind in particular the telephone service which is an earning service and which is increasing constantly.  It is a service also in respect of which the more that is done the better.  Every expenditure that is made upon it under the Telephone Capital Act is going to bring in its return and bring it in rather quickly. <Col N="809" /> If there is one reason more than another why this Estimate should be referred back it is because of the stopping of the scheme to provide telephones in every centre in Ireland.  When the previous Government announced that we wanted to have a telephone in every house, what we had in mind was that every telephone that was put into every sub-post office in Ireland would become available as an exchange and that everybody, especially those in the rural areas, who would make a demand for a telephone would get an opportunity of having one installed.  That would be of enormous advantage in the policy&mdash;which I suppose the present Government will carry on&mdash;of decentralisation and of developing rural areas.  Therefore, I must enter a protest in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the subject of arrears, I would point out that the Minister is fortunate in that he has not this year four blizzards to contend with.  That was a task which confronted the staff last year and I must say that we had nothing but admiration for the way in which they carried on the work.  There was then a shortage of lead, of copper, bronze and of steel, but these supplies are now gradually coming in.  I do not want to make any unreasonable demands on the Minister or to pitch my speech in the very unreasonable tones in which I was attacked last year because I could not produce rabbits out of my hat.  I feel, however, that arrears should be dealt with as quickly as possible and that, during the year, we should be able to get to the stage where we will be able to carry out the original telephone plan.  That plan was laid down at the end of 1946 when I introduced the Telephone Capital Act, and its object was to introduce a telephone service into every sub-post office throughout the country.  In that way the farming community would be able to make contacts with their markets and that would be useful for developing the rural areas in general.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear of the introduction of the increased postage rates. That was signed on the 15th June.  I am not blaming the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this respect, but I <Col N="810" /> am blaming the Minister for Finance. He should have told us when he was introducing the Budget that he was going to put this extra imposition of £200,000 upon the community.  The warrant was signed on the 15th June at a time when actually the Finance Act had not yet passed out of the House.  It is true, of course, that it is a commercial charge and in that way such warrants actually escape the authority of the House as in control of supply.  That is the old system, but I do not think it is fair for the Minister for Finance to take advantage of it so that, when we were dealing with the Budget, we actually did not know about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The Minister for Finance said in the Seanad that he had omitted to mention the matter. There is an important principle involved, because one might take advantage of the comparative freedom of the Post Office in order to escape from the authority of the House as the authority over supply. The Minister for Finance promised us a reduction in the cost of living, but I would point out that this new imposition will have the effect of sending it up.  One has only to glance over the increased postal rates to see that the commercial world, in particular, is <Col N="811" /> seriously affected.  The increase applies to circulars, post cards, samples and parcels, both inland and those going to Northern Ireland and abroad. It will all come back, of course, on the man who pays and it is inevitable that it will add to the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It affects people who want to send parcels to the Six Counties and those who want to send parcels to unfortunate people on the Continent, because, in future, they will have to pay increased postage on such parcels.</P>
      <P>I was glad to note certain increases in the way of wages and payments. There is just one small class in connection with which Deputy Norton, now Minister for Social Services, used to press to have the incremental period shortened.  These are the persons on salaries of over £350 a year.  They get no benefit out of the flat rate increase of 11/-.  These are the grade A clerks.  Supposing that such a clerk marries when he is 23, at age 33 his increments would be of most value to him if the incremental period were shortened up.  At ten years of age children require more boots, clothing, food and so on.  The class is a comparatively small one, and I would suggest that some steps should be taken to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express my esteem and respect for the Department with which I was associated for so long.  The officials were always well informed, energetic and willing to carry through any orders given to them.  They were most helpful in every way in their capacity as public servants.  My only hope is that there will be no further cheeseparing on the Department resulting in the holding up of work.  Such delays have a bad effect on the initiative and energy of the staff.  I trust that the present Minister will <Col N="812" /> make sure especially that building will go ahead.  If necessary, he should face up to the task of preparing plans even before the actual supplies come in.  If necessary, he should engage outside architects.  The Board of Works has always been rather conservative in that respect.  If plans are drawn up building can be proceeded with as rapidly as possible once materials become available. With regard to the telephone development we should continue to aim at our objective of having a telephone in every home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I appreciate the kindness of the House on the manner in which they have treated this very important Estimate.  It is a change from the way previous Estimates brought in during the last few weeks have been treated. I agree with Deputy Little that there is urgent necessity for having telephones in all rural post offices.  I am sure he will appreciate our difficulties. We have applications for 7,000 telephones. We had no alternative except to meet these demands in the first instance and to concentrate our entire organisation and energy in completing the applications by the end of the year.  We hope next year to concentrate on providing telephones as far as possible in out-of-the-way rural areas and, if we have sufficient equipment, on providing telephones in all the post offices in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>As regards buildings, I agree it is necessary to prepare plans in advance and I hope with the co-operation of the Board of Works we shall be able to simplify the procedure in the future. Progress has been retarded to some extent in the past.  I have some experience in connection with buildings and I see no objection to the Post Office carrying on their building schemes in the rural areas without all the red tape and delay that has been experienced in the past.  That matter will be carefully considered.  It is hoped that with the housing problem solved, we shall then be in a position to go ahead with our personal building schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Little referred to the high cost and asked why it was not mentioned <Col N="813" /> in the Budget.  Certain schemes were put up to the Minister for Finance and the Government.  It was not considered necessary at the time the Budget was being framed to put on these extra charges.  Immediately after the Budget statement I was faced with demands for increased wages from the staff.  I was faced with increased demands from Córas Iompair Éireann in order to give country people a mail service.  These services cost a very considerable sum.  Now the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a commercial undertaking and it has to bring in revenue.  I have been informed that the rates for papers have not been revised for a long time back.  Faced with that problem we had no other alternative except to increase our rates in order to meet the exceptional demands.  Had I not secured those increases I am perfectly certain that Deputy Little would have been the first to condemn the Department for not taking appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little raised the case also of the men on £350 a year.  I agree that they must get some increase, but my first concern was to get something for the men under £350 in order to bring them up.  As the House has been informed, arrangements are being made under which the men with £350 a year and over will get some increase. Their case is being considered at the moment.  I can assure the House that I shall do everything I possibly can to carry on successfully the work of the Post Office and to improve the position as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £163,550 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with <Col N="814" /> Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
    <P>In putting the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting before the House I propose, as is usual, to deal first with the financial position and to follow with references to the main developments that took place during the past year and to future policy.</P>
    <P>The provision required in the Estimate before you is £245,550, a decrease of £81,535 on the Estimate for last year. The decrease occurs entirely in the provision for technical equipment which is down by £108,005, but this is partly offset by increases under other sub-heads, principally in sub-head B, which covers the cost of daily programmes.</P>
    <P>The following is a brief explanation of the causes of increase or decrease in the provision in any of the individual sub-heads in which there has been a substantial variation from the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A, which provides for salaries and wages, shows an increase of £4,765.  The increase is due principally to a strengthening of the doorkeeper staff, made necessary by an expansion of the broadcasting premises and to a change in accounting practice under which the salaries of officials on loan to the station are shown in the broadcasting Estimate instead of in the Estimates for their own Departments.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly substantial increase of £13,550 in sub-head B, from which the fees are paid for the daily programmes. The higher provision is required mainly to pay somewhat better fees than formerly.  The general increase in wage levels that have taken place has, of course, affected the payments that must be made to those who give their services for radio programmes. Actually the repercussions from the change in wage levels made themselves felt during the past year and the provision for fees in the 1947-48 Estimate was exceeded.  The extra cost had to be met by savings on other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C provides for musical instruments and music.  The increase of £2,650 in this sub-head is needed mainly for the purchase of pianos, two <Col N="815" /> of which are required for new outside halls provided permanently for studio broadcasts by the two radio orchestras. The hire and purchase of music will, of course, also cost more than formerly when there was only one orchestra.</P>
    <P>The main cause of the increase of £4,800 in sub-head D is for the payment of the travelling and subsistence expenses of outside broadcast officers and descriptive writers and for special expenses of a temporary nature incidental to the recruitment of the enlarged symphony orchestra.</P>
    <P>The large decrease of £108,005 in sub-head F is due to the fact that the bulk of the cost of the transmitter and aerial systems for an overseas broadcasting service which it was proposed to establish was provided in last year's Estimate.  Of the sum of £60,890 provided for equipment this year, £30,000 is a revote in respect of the cost of part of the short-wave equipment. The House is aware of the position regarding the short-wave station.  We are committed to part of the expenditure included this year for equipment purchased, but there will be a saving of about £14,000 on the capital expenditure provided in the sub-head. The balance of the estimated expenditure in sub-head F, apart from that intended for short-wave equipment, is for the maintenance and operation of recording equipment and for ordinary maintenance and renewals for the home service stations.</P>
    <P>In the explanations I have given above in regard to estimated expenditure under particular sub-heads, I have taken the figures as shown in the published Estimates.  As a result of the short-wave situation I anticipate a saving of about £20,000 on programme expenditure spread over the various sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the sub-heads do not call for comment as the estimated expenditure is normal and does not vary greatly from last year's provision. I should refer, however, to the token provision of £10 for a radio journal.  A broadcasting journal is a normal appanage of most broadcasting organisations throughout the world and the <Col N="816" /> need for such a journal here has long been felt.  No decisions have as yet been taken or commitments entered into : the object of the provision under sub-head I is simply to secure the approval of the Dáil for whatever expenditure may be incurred in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The receipts from wireless licence fees for the past financial year were approximately £122,000, and from advertising programmes £64,000.  In the present year the revenue from licence fees is estimated at £122,000, and from advertising at £66,000, that is a total of £188,000.  The total estimated expenditure from the Wireless Broadcasting Vote and from other Votes for services performed for broadcasting, is estimated at £291,352.  The excess of expenditure over revenue is, therefore, anticipated to be £103,352.  The expenditure includes the cost of the short-wave transmissions, in respect of which there would be no receipts by way of licence fees, and also the sum of about £30,000, already mentioned, for the completion of the equipment.  The receipts from wireless licence fees will likely be somewhat higher than that shown in the Estimate, which was, of course, framed a considerable time ago.</P>
    <P>The House was informed on last year's Estimate that certain expansions of the programme organisation were taking place.  These were introduced primarily in connection with the proposed inauguration of an overseas service, but they are no less necessary for the proper presentation of programmes for our listeners at home, and for the most part their retention is imperative.  The time has passed when the specialised work of programme presentation can be allowed to depend to any considerable extent on amateur or part-time professional talent, and the additions that have been made to the programme organisation have already quite obviously lifted the standard of the station.  No one, for instance, will, I think, question the success of the repertory company, that team of fulltime actors with producer and assistant producer who began work in the station about nine months ago. <Col N="817" /> These are people experienced in their profession who can now devote their whole time to the perfection of broadcasting technique.  Rehearsals, which formerly could only be held in the evenings to suit part-time actors, are now going on practically continuously from early morning each day and this intensive preparation is reflected in better finished work and more ambitious productions.</P>
    <P>I should say here that the provision of light variety entertainment has been, and still is, the bug-bear of broadcasting.  As a nation we have the reputation of being witty, but our wit, I believe, is of the spontaneous kind and is not easily made to order. Native professional variety artists are rare and theatres depend a good deal on cross-Channel turns.  The number of variety artists here who are also good broadcasters is more limited still, so that the provision of variety shows day after day and week after week is probably the most difficult problem of our radio organisation.</P>
    <P>Since last year's Estimate's statement, too, the bulk of the recruitment for the enlarged symphony orchestra has taken place and a light orchestra has also been found.  These developments have added notably to the musical side of the programmes.  The practice has been continued of bringing in continental musicians on short-term engagements to conduct the principal orchestra.  To encourage the dissemination of musical knowledge&mdash; while providing an audience for the orchestra&mdash;invitations are issued each week to the public to participate, free of charge, in the symphony concerts broadcast from the orchestral studio in the Phoenix Hall.  The hall is filled to capacity for every concert and enables many hundreds of Dublin people each week to hear performances of classical and contemporary music.  I hope in time it will be possible to send the orchestra out to visit at least some of the larger provincial centres in order that the benefit of the only professional symphony combination in Ireland will be more widely diffused.  It is necessary that people should see orchestras as well as hear them as part of the process of musical education.  The <Col N="818" /> second orchestra, which is being trained and conducted by a well-known Irish musician, supplies a long-felt need in the broadcasting organisation. In addition to giving regular performances of what may be termed light orchestral music, it functions as a céili band and also assists in variety shows as occasion demands.</P>
    <P>An up-to-date mobile recording unit with van, which was recently put on the road, has in a very short time added substantially to the number of &ldquo;live&rdquo; descriptive features and repeatedly gives an actuality quality to the news bulletins.  When a second recording unit which is on order comes into operation it should be possible to do more long term work such as obtaining material of permanent value from the Gaeltacht.  One unit is likely to be fairly fully occupied in Dublin City and other centres taking recordings of current happenings.</P>
    <P>There has been pressure in the House and elsewhere mainly on behalf of the farming community, for more localised and detailed weather reports than had been given, and the suggestion was made last year that there should be a weather forecast about 9 a.m.  The matter has since been fully examined, and I am glad to say that as from the 1st April a separate forecast has been given for each of the provinces, as well as the general forecast.  We have looked into the matter of a morning forecast and have discussed it with representatives of the Department of Agriculture, but taking everything into consideration, we felt that this is a development that is hardly called for. The station would, of course, have to be opened specially for the purpose, and this would involve considerable expense.  In any event, in addition to the short weather bulletins at 1.30 and 6.30 p.m. the forecast prepared for 10.10 p.m. is given in more detail as required.  This covers a period of 24 hours ahead, that is up to about 10 p.m. the following day, and should thus meet all reasonable needs of people preparing for the next day's farming operations.  Of course, if experience shows that the forecasts now being provided do not meet the situation, we shall be happy to review it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> I have outlined the financial position of broadcasting and the principal developments that have taken place during the year and I would now like to make some general comments on broadcasting policy.  On the occasion of this Estimate each year some Deputies are kind enough to give the service credit for doing as well as possible with the resources at its command while others have recommendations to make or strong criticism to offer which the Minister is expected to defend.  I should like to say at once that I am aware the service has shortcomings about which I would expect to hear some dissatisfaction expressed in the House.  I have, of course, been responsible for broadcasting for only a short period but it has not required any particular sagacity on my part to diagnose some of its troubles.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the State has not unlimited resources and only a reasonable amount of money&mdash;much less than could have been used with advantage&mdash; could be placed at the disposal of the broadcasting service each year.  The Department of Finance has made particular efforts to help in this direction in recent years but there are still much-needed improvements which it has so far not been found possible to effect.  One of the big problems&mdash;which involve financial as well as other considerations&mdash;is that of accommodation. Although the service has been over 20 years in operation it has not yet got a building of its own.  When broadcasting was first established in this country in 1926 the studios were put in a couple of rooms in business premises in this city and &ldquo;makeshift&rdquo; accommodation of that character has been the order ever since.  In 1929 the studios were removed to the General Post Office. The General Post Office is a fine building but it was not built or designed for broadcasting.  Because of the penetration of noise from the street, lack of acoustic properties and inadequate space for rehearsals and performances it is just what a broadcasting station should not be in almost every particular.</P>
    <P>While the building is totally unsuitable for broadcasting, the space <Col N="820" /> allotted for that purpose has created an almost intolerable situation for the ordinary Post Office services for which of course the premises were designed. For recent broadcasting expansion, additional blocks of space have been taken within the building, with the result that the Post Office staffs are being scattered throughout the city with consequent inconvenience and loss of efficiency for the postal services. With a view to dealing with this predicament, a site was acquired last year for a new broadcasting building and a token provision for its erection is included in the current Public Works and Buildings Estimate.  I recognise, and I have no doubt the House will recognise, the magnitude of the work of erecting a broadcasting house with all the special features which are not necessary in an ordinary type of building.  I also appreciate that the cost will be heavy.  Because of the large cost that will be entailed and having regard to the serious problems of every kind associated with building projects at the present time, I am unable to say when the task of providing the broadcasting house can be faced.  I feel, however, that I should let Deputies know who may be exercised about the standard of the programmes that the lack of proper accommodation is a serious handicap for the programme staffs, and that many of the director's difficulties cannot be removed until such time as it is found possible to provide more suitable premises.</P>
    <P>The second great deficiency in broadcasting lies in the absence of a second programme.  As Deputies know, Radio Eireann broadcasts a single programme only&mdash;and that simultaneously from the three transmitters at Athlone, Dublin and Cork&mdash;while the number of hours of broadcasting is pretty much the same as it was in 1926, when the Dublin Station was first opened.  In this single programme of limited duration we have to cater for two languages and to satisfy high brow and low brow tastes and all the grades of taste in between. In the result nobody can be fully satisfied and our nationals naturally turn elsewhere for the material they can't get from the home station.  I am convinced <Col N="821" /> that the basic cause of whatever genuine dissatisfaction exists is to be found here, and not in the day-to-day programme policy of the station.  That is probably as good, generally speaking, as it can be, having regard to the limitations of a single programme as well as those of talent, finance and accommodation with which the authorities have to contend.</P>
    <P>There are two main problems connected with the provision of a second programme.  They are: money and wavelengths.  Accommodation is also a difficulty but I have already dealt with that.  On the question of money it is obvious that the broadcasting service should, to the largest possible extent, be self-supporting.  Development, such as I am here dealing with, must accordingly proceed in parallel with an expansion in broadcasting revenue.  The second problem of wavelengths, which is in the international domain, is not within our own control. The Dublin and Cork transmitters work on low power which international regulations prevent us from increasing. A separate programme from Dublin or Cork, or from both, would cover only a limited area of the country and would not therefore be very satisfactory. An independent wavelength additional to that on which the transmissions are made from the highpower station at Athlone is, therefore, an essential.  The wavelength accommodation available is, however, entirely insufficient for all the broadcasting stations operating in Europe and there is as a consequence serious congestion and interference between stations; some stations are actually working outside the wavelengths proper to broadcasting thus causing interference to other types of radio-using services.</P>
    <P>A conference is now in session at Copenhagen at which, provided no political issues of an international character prevail, an effort will be made to bring order into the wavelength position and to draw up a plan of allocations for European broadcasting stations.  We have put forward a claim for consideration by that conference for a second independent wavelength but, because of the congestion <Col N="822" /> I have just mentioned, we cannot be assured that our claim can be met. Moreover, if we had an extra wavelength now and were otherwise ready to proceed with the additional programme the provision of a transmitter and other equipment would take a considerable time because of the scarcity of steel and other materials and the general frustration encountered nowadays at every step in carrying out manufacturing processes.  The second programme for the reasons I have stated is, therefore, more an aim than an immediate prospect, but it is an aim that I would like to see realised as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The last question of policy I want to touch on is perhaps the most fundamental of them all&mdash;the question whether the present system of control and operation of the broadcasting service is the best one.  This matter has often been referred to in the Press and elsewhere.  My short association with broadcasting has not enabled me to form any definite views on that subject and I have an open mind on it.  I do know that the Post Office was from the beginning opposed to the idea of the operation by a State Department of a service for the provision mainly of entertainment.  It did not consider a Civil Service Department a suitable medium for the purpose.  Experience has not disproved the Post Office view.</P>
    <P>Inclusion in the Civil Service organisation has, of course, certain advantages, the value of which I do not underrate.  For example, its well-established accounting system ensures a high degree of safety in broadcasting finances.  But this elaborate system of financial control has in itself the inherent disadvantage of slowing down and stereotyping a service whose characteristics should be those of change and variety.  To enable some degree of flexibility to be achieved the Minister for Finance has from time to time delegated a good deal of financial authority and quite recently these delegations were widened considerably. But the question goes beyond one of mere finance.  A civil servant, by tradition and training, feels the need to anticipate difficulties to save his Department possible embarrassments. In fact, safety must be his keynote. <Col N="823" /> This emphasis on safety imposes a rigidity in the material broadcast which is fatal in such a service.</P>
    <P>I should say here that within the present broadcasting organisation a most competent staff has been collected and I am satisfied that no alternative type of organisation, such as a semi-independent corporation, would be able to secure more highly qualified people. I am quite certain they are capable of doing everything that broadcasting requires of them if they can be made to feel that they are free to do so without all the inhibitions associated with the more normal type of Civil Service department.</P>
    <P>To give an adequate trial to the present broadcasting set-up I feel that one desirable step is the creation for these people of an atmosphere in which they can give of their best.  A form of encouragement I believe in is to tell the staffs responsible for the programmes, as I do now, that I have every confidence in them and that apart from laying down policy for them in general terms I propose to give them the widest measure of freedom possible to do their job.  This will help towards the provision of better programmes and will give us the opportunity of judging, at our leisure, under the better conditions created, whether a Civil Service organisation is capable of catering adequately for this most unusual type of State service.  I am sure that in this task the Broadcasting Service will continue to benefit from the advice tendered by the advisory committee which is being reconstituted with an enlarged membership.</P>
    <P>One move in the direction of loosening up the rigid limitations on the use of the radio was the suggestion I got recently in a Dáil question to allow representatives of political parties to present their views to listeners on current national affairs in uncensored statements.  From the purely broadcasting point of view the director would welcome such broadcasts as he believes they would be of particular interest to listeners.  All the Parties in the House were, however, given an opportunity to present their views on the subject and <Col N="824" /> these were almost unanimously against the introduction of political broadcasts or indifferent to the proposal.  The matter was, therefore, dropped.</P>
    <P>Apart from purely political broadcasts I feel there is room for considerable relaxation of the attitude hitherto maintained towards discussions and debates before the microphone of matters of current interest in which there is some element of controversy. Listeners have a keen appreciation of these live topics and, provided the decencies are observed, I do not think a discussion of them on the radio does any harm.  On the contrary, it may do positive good in educating public opinion or in providing an additional vent for the expression of conflicting views.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer here to a complaint recently made in the House that the news bulletins contain political attacks against the Opposition Party. I ask the Deputies to accept my assurance that since I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I have not given any direction whatever in regard to the policy to be adopted in the news bulletins nor have I made the slightest suggestion as to what should or should not be included in or excluded from a bulletin.  The station officials responsible for the selection and editing of items of news for broadcasting are civil servants whose conditions of employment require them not to favour any political party and I think the proper course and the fairest to all Parties is to allow them, without interference, to select the news they consider of most general interest to listeners without restrictions in regard to where the statements are made or as to the persons making them.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, inevitable that Ministers get more publicity than private Deputies.  This applied to the last Government, it applies to the present Government and will apply to any future Government.  If the radio, as do the newspapers, gives more space to the statements of Ministers, who have the responsibilities of office, than they do to the speeches of ordinary Deputies I do not think that this can reasonably be held to be political bias or an attack of any sort. <Col N="825" /> There has been a considerable growth of radio criticism in recent years.  Most of the daily newspapers and some of the periodicals have special radio correspondents.  This is all very desirable and helps the public to a keener appreciation of the possibilities of a still relatively new medium. The work of these critics deserves to be encouraged and I am glad to learn that as a development in that direction the broadcasting service is arranging for periodical conferences with these critics at which information and ideas will be exchanged.  Criticism is wholesome; the only plea I make regarding it is that it should not descend to personal abuse of the officials of Radio Éireann who are not able, because of their office, to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>That concludes my statement.  I have confined myself mainly to matters of policy, and I would be much obliged to Deputies if they would adopt the same line.  Information on matters of detail can more appropriately be got by personal or written inquiry to the Director of Broadcasting.</P>

      <P>The following motion stood in the names of Deputies Lemass and Little:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil records its disapproval of the Government's decision to abandon the plans for the establishment of a short-wave broadcasting station.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to discuss, first of all, the question of the short-wave station which was to have been set up but which is, unfortunately, owing to the attitude of the present Government, being closed down. Indeed, it looks as if it is going to be abolished altogether.  We had experience during the last war of trying to reach the outer world by means of a short-wave apparatus, the power of which was too low.  Nothing could be <Col N="826" /> said against our experts who did their very best.  They were very capable people, but the power was too low to reach the outer world.  I think that on one or two occasions it did reach Canada, but otherwise it was entirely inadequate.  We came to the conclusion that it would be absolutely necessary&mdash;that it would have been the duty of any Government especially with a view to any further emergency that might occur&mdash;that we should take the first opportunity of building a short-wave station.  By good fortune we were able, after the emergency, to enter into contracts and to get the plant. In the course of the year or two which followed that plant arrived and was largely set up.  It was vital that we should proceed that way because we could not claim the allocation of a wavelength until we had actually got the plant and that it should be in the process of being set up.  Otherwise, we would have no claim to get a wavelength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that people should realise that: that we could not have gone to the international conference in Atlantic City unless, first of all, we had entered into the financial commitments for the setting up of the masts, and so the work proceeded. Three masts were set up, and the fourth was on the way of being established when the change of Government came.  In the meantime, our negotiators, our officers, went to Atlantic City where they established a high reputation for themselves on account of their approach to this whole world problem. It was a very difficult problem because there had been no conference since before the war.  Even the allocation of the wavelength, which took place almost immediately before the war, had never been carried into effect.  People may have got wireless sets at that time, but the wavelengths were incorrectly marked, so that the position was fairly chaotic.  Then, again, during the war various conflicting governments and countries took over wavelengths, and all that had to be disentangled.  Principles were agreed upon by which they could proceed before they could get the allocation of a wavelength.  In the course of these conferences, our <Col N="827" /> negotiators put up the proposal that no country should get a very large share of the waveband until every country had got a reasonable share.</P>
    <P>That, of course, was the first really good step taken towards our chances of getting a wavelength.  The atmosphere of friendliness that was created amongst all the negotiating parties was such that there was every hope that we would get a wavelength at the next conference which is to take place in the fall of this year in Mexico.  Our people had conversations with the other countries.  These would have meant that by sharing the wavelength with other countries we would have been able to get two air space covering sectors of the world, and a certain amount of air space, I assume, in the air channel so far as the United States is concerned for listening in.</P>
    <P>The contention that we had no chance of getting a wavelength was quite a misstatement of the whole situation.  It was based on the statement of the Minister for Finance in the Seanad when he said that recommendations had been made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs setting out the difficulties and pointing out that it would be almost impossible to get a wavelength.  But that memorandum, even according to him, was five years old before the attempt had been made to try to get a wavelength.  If we were to be deterred by the difficulties which it is the duty of a Department to put up to the Government, you would never do anything.  Here let me answer the charge so far as it concerns myself. I signed that memorandum.  It was my duty to present the difficulties to the Government, although as a member of the Government I was entitled to take a different point of view.  But it was essential that the Government should have all the facts and difficulties before it.  That does not by any means tie the hands of the members of the Government in making a decision upon the larger considerations.  After all, if we were to refuse to do anything because of the difficulties nothing would be done at all.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the negotiations proceeded, and then they were adjourned <Col N="828" /> to another conference which is to take place in Mexico.  Now if our people do not go to Mexico we may lose the chance of ever getting a short-wave allocation at any time in the future, and whatever may be the view held about the immediate expenditure it would be real national sabotage not to make sure that we get radio allocation. In that way, we at least will have secured the position for the moment.</P>
    <P>The real issue here is the importance of having a short-wave station or not. On that there is a very wide divergence of opinion in this House.  We regard it as one of vital importance, and there are other Parties, too, who were assumed to regard it as of vital importance.  From the point of view of defence, it is necessary that the voice of Ireland should be heard in all those places where influential public opinion operates amongst our own race all over the world: in all those institutions which have been set up by Irishmen and Irishwomen all over the world and which would be centres from which opinions would be moulded, as well as by people who are not of the Irish race but who take an interest in, and have sympathy with and support the principles for which Ireland stands, on questions such, for example, as Partition and the general outlook of Ireland.  These are all moulders of opinion all over the world, and it is with them that one desires to keep in contact.  It is a very poor criticism to say that the cheaper sets in America have not got the short-wave series on them.  That really does not affect the situation because these institutions, these people who are keenly interested to listen to Ireland, all Irishmen who have friends here at home and relations will make sure that they will get the kind of set that will enable them to listen in.  When the Minister for Finance, however, puts forward these arguments, it is apparent that he does not hold that it is a vital service for Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with it.  There is a modulated frequency, an expensive system which is used in <Col N="829" /> America but it is not used to a wide extent and it is used for very limited purposes.  It has nothing to do with the short-wave.  The issue is do we regard the extra series from the view of being in touch with people all over the world, of breaking down what the late Arthur Griffith used to call &ldquo;the paper wall between us and the world&rdquo;, of keeping up our historical traditions of keeping in touch with the outside world through the centuries.  To cut down the short-wave is a complete reversal of national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may ask a question. In case of a crisis could not the present station as it is at present constituted burst in on a wavelength and be heard in any part of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for meteorological purposes there is no short-wave and, even if it were used, it would be a very weak arm compared to a short-wave which people had been listening to and which had given the people the habit of listening to Ireland.  As well as having a short-wave, you must encourage people through the newspapers and so on to create a habit of keeping in contact before the crisis came off. They will not listen to the meteorological short-wave, and if they hear anything from that it will be by the merest accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real issue is whether we take the view that we want to keep in touch with people all over the world and whether we want that arm of defence. I believe that this is a fundamental difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I am sorry that Deputy Lehane took up the attitude on this issue of running away from his own convictions because the Fine Gael Party was able to say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to a goose.  On other matters the influence of other Parties in the inter-Party Government was able to insist that Fine Gael carry out schemes which they proposed to get rid of.  If Clan na Poblachta had the strength of conviction which they contend that they have they could easily have forced the Government to give way on this matter and carry out the national policy as it had been outlined before.  One has only to realise what a loss it was during the <Col N="830" /> last war not to have had this; also when we were fighting our war of independence world propaganda helped our soldiers at home.  Without that we could never have carried on that unequal struggle against a great Power, Since then, wireless has developed very much and you cannot carry on propaganda unless you have it.  There is, of course, the question of expense, but it has already been pointed out in the statement that the net expenditure is only £103,000 odd, the capital expenditure being £110,000.  The money is already being spent; there may be £40,000 or £50,000 more to be spent, but that is all.  Considering what other countries spend&mdash;England during the war spent about £10,000,000 a year on radio broadcasting&mdash;we should have some sense of proportion as to the amount of money we would be prepared to spend on it.  We spent only £103,000 on it this year.</P>
    <P>We should consider a thing which I always bring up because I think the principle is as good to-day as it was formerly; the Minister for Finance for Cumann na nGaedheal, long ago when he was introducing the duty on radio sets imported into this country, said that the money should be earmarked and set against expenditure on radio. The money during that period runs well over £1,000,000, probably £1,500,000.  From year to year, taking the total sum, it would easily cancel any expenditure on this matter.  We should not then regard this very small amount of £103,000 a year as being too much.</P>
    <P>Another objection was that we would not have people to speak foreign languages.  This, of course, is not true at all, because all our announcers, I think, must know a few foreign languages and we actually distinguished ourselves on a previous occasion when one of our announcers was taken to Geneva because of his facility in speaking several languages.  The issue in effect is not the difficulties which has been put up with regard to saving money, but whether you regard this as being a really important and vital national service or not, and it is on that the House should divide, not on any other issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> Turning then to the general policy of radio, radio has become, not merely in Ireland but everywhere else, the centre for cultural activity&mdash;debates, drama, music, lectures on science and entertainment of every kind be it high-brow or low-brow.  In fact, it is regarded now in all countries as being the expression of the culture of the country and for that reason it is of very great importance indeed.  Some people like to assume a kind of sophisticated toughness; they like to be regarded as curmudgeons from the point of view of culture, not because they are not quite intelligent and quite capable of enjoying the good thing, but because they think that that kind of thing goes down with the public.  I do not think that it goes down with the public at all.  The Irish farmers are as appreciative of good stuff as anybody else and as anxious that their children should learn the best, have distinguished careers and do well afterwards in every walk of life, including the world of drama, music or other cultural activities.</P>
    <P>That raises a question which has been in controversy for some time, the question of Sunday orchestral concerts. There has been a continuous complaint that these Sunday concerts had to cease.  Concerts given in a cinema are always subject to very great difficulties, because you are limited to Sunday afternoon which is, generally speaking, a bad time for concerts, because people, especially young people, want to go out into the fresh air and enjoy sport and so on.  The success of these concerts was greatly decreased owing to the fact that they were held on Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Then there were financial difficulties and certainly it made one realise that the only real answer is to have a proper concert hall.  With that in mind, the Government took a very keen interest in trying to bring about a situation in which we would have a proper national concert hall, and preliminary agreements were entered into to sign a contract with the Rotunda, in order to build a concert hall in Cavendish Row, immediately beside the Rotunda, the <Col N="832" /> Rotunda to be regarded as the <i>foyer</i> or a place where various public functions could take place.  It might even be a source of revenue because it could be used for the purposes of various organisations and societies and there would be the concert hall along the side of the street there.  With that in mind, we sent our experts, our architect and radio engineer, to Northern Europe last year and got them to go through the various radio studios and bring back the accumulated knowledge of what is wanted in connection with a concert hall, and the plans for that concert hall were completed before I left office.  For years, people have been crying out in Ireland for a proper concert hall in Dublin and such a hall would be of enormous benefit, I need scarcely say, to the radio, because you would then have a really big audience of 2,000 people and would be able to give the country what it deserves in the way of adequate and first-class music and would remove a blot from, I might say, our civilisation, because there is really no country of the standard of education of Ireland which has not got a decent concert hall in its capital.  We have not got one, so that I hope there is still a chance of these plans being carried out and a concert hall being built to fill a long felt want not merely for the people of Dublin but for the people of Ireland, because people come up to these concerts from all over the country.  I hope it will be carried out in co-operation with the radio.</P>

      <P>That is the argument which has always been put up.  There is no reason why one should not be done and the other neglected.  There is no reason why, if we could get the proper co-operation of labour and the other people concerned, the two could not be done.  Look at the number of cinemas which have been put up by private enterprise.  Look at the Butlin Camp, which sprang up like a mushroom. Surely the Board of Works could set about the job in something of the spirit of those responsible for the Butlin Camp.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about it.  They must have got it from the Labour people.  The studio accommodation for the radio station is absurd and it is unfair to the Post Office that the studio should be situated in a building which should be used for postal purposes.  We had purchased a site of 17 acres with a house on which our people who had been abroad and had seen all the studios were in a position to plan proper studios.  I do not know how the radio people carry on at present.  With increased staff, the increased number of dramatic groups and the excellent programmes which have to be prepared and rehearsed, it is a puzzle to me how they are able to do it at all.  That is another of these projects which, I am afraid, has been put on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has decided to bring the advisory committee into activity again and I hope he will pursue the line we followed of getting Irish taught in the schools over the radio.  I do not know how far he has been able to carry out successful negotiations with the Department of Education, but the ideas we had then were that absolutely first-class teachers in Irish would give lessons over the radio to all the schools which took advantage of the radio.  It is done in England. All over Britain, very admirable lessons are given and there is a certain technique of making sure that the students take full advantage of the service by <Col N="834" /> means of examination in the subjects and so on. It is one of the things which would be most helpful in getting a really good standard of Irish all over the country.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters which I feel bound to raise.  One is the matter of partisan reports on the radio.  Our policy was that, while Ministers got preference with regard to any statements they had to make, first, because they were good news and secondly, because it was a direction to the country as to what Government policy was, we did not exclude the criticisms, summarised, if you like, of the Opposition speakers and often people criticised the radio because we gave too much to the Opposition, but we at least tried to balance things. Partisan reporting on the radio is very unwise because giving a purely partisan flavour, giving only Ministers' statements, as was done the other night, and not giving the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, although there was plenty of time to do so, will have a very bad effect on the radio itself, because at least half the people of Ireland are Fianna Fáil in opinion and they will be exasperated and just will not listen because they will be so annoyed at the idea of a public institution being used for partisan purposes. I know that it is a difficult policy to carry out to get a perfect balance, but I suggest that the Minister should insist, no matter who is responsible for it, whether it is the Government publicity department or anybody else, on a balance as near as possible, because it is he who must accept responsibility in the House for what really amounts to a scandal and is causing a great deal of annoyance to people in general.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I must draw the attention of the Minister is that a permanent official of his Department is running a monthly paper which has taken sides in politics with considerable emphasis.  If that is allowed to continue, there is no reason why any other officer should not start some other paper and take an opposite view.  We want to know where this is going to stop.  There were times when I was in office when that complaint was made, and, by disciplinary action, we tried to <Col N="835" /> control it, but I feel that now, especially in view of the July issue of that paper, the Minister will have to take very grave notice of the completely partisan attitude taken up in that paper.  I should like to say that I appreciate very much the tremendous advance made in the station on both the programme and musical sides, and I hope that the station will get every encouragement and facility to continue on the lines on which they are at present working.</P>

    <P>While Deputy Little was speaking, I resisted the temptation to interject when he disclosed an attitude of mind that he felt he was in a position to level taunts against the members of the Clann na Poblachta Party because of their attitude in connection with the Government's decision regarding the short-wave radio station.  The motion put down in the names of Deputy Lemass and Little, which we are now discussing with the Estimate, if I understand the Minister aright, bears no real relation to the Government's decision.  In so far as I understand the Government's decision to date, it has been decided that the plans for the <Col N="836" /> establishment of a short-wave radio station in this financial year are not being proceeded with.  Surely, it is an unwarranted straining of the ordinary usage of the English language to describe that as an abandonment. Were I convinced that an emphatic decision had been taken by the Government to abandon completely the short-wave radio station and to commit the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to a policy which would mean that at no future time could we have a short-wave radio station, I would be opposed to it but, as I understand the Government's decision, it is a simple decision not to proceed with these plans for the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question which had far better be addressed to the Minister than to me.  I am dealing with the policy of the Department as outlined by the Minister and I am relating that to the motion in the names of the Deputy's two colleagues.  I would ask the Minister for this assurance, that before this very valuable equipment is disposed of, he will come back to the Dáil and let the House have an opportunity of making a decision on the matter.  I would certainly consider it a very unwise policy on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were this valuable equipment, very properly procured by his predecessor, to be disposed of without reference to the House.  I trust there will be no necessity to dispose of the equipment already purchased and that the erection of the short-wave radio station is merely postponed.  I think that is the general sense of the Minister's statement to this House and I think the motion in the terms set out bears no relation to the realities of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, while I am very loath to contradict a former Minister on a subject with which he should be much better acquainted than I am, I will have the temerity to disagree <Col N="837" /> with him when he says that, if we do not get the wavelength at the Mexico conference, we are lost.  The important thing is to keep the equipment here.</P>
      <P>To pass to the Estimate generally and the Minister's policy as outlined by him, I would first of all urge on him that he should set before himself a policy of gradual improvement in the broadcasting service. It would be unreasonable to expect that all the many improvements that, it is suggested from time to time, should be carried out in any one financial year should be carried out forthwith, but I think the Minister should have a progressive plan for an improvement and an extension of the broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of going on record as one of those who do not agree with the uninformed and often-repeated strictures upon the broadcasting service in this country.  I do not know whether my tastes are vitiated or not, but I must confess that, as a matter of choice, I would prefer to listen to the programmes of Radio Éireann than to those from any other station.  Much of the criticism directed against radio in the past has been uninformed and prejudiced.  In the presentation of plays and documentaries, particularly, Radio Éireann compares very favourably with anything I have heard from the British Broadcasting Company.  Many of the artistes and members of the repertory company find it almost impossible to carry on, due to the limited studio accommodation available.  On many occasions you have band or musical rehearsals in one room and, immediately beside it and perfectly audible, there are either play or variety programmes being broadcast or rehearsed.  If the Minister could arrange for more studio accommodation, even in the present buildings in Henry Street, there would be a marked improvement in the quality of the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be quite feasible to broadcast a second programme from either Dublin or Cork along with the normal programme on the Athlone band.  I understand that the Cork station is working on 25 per cent. of its potential kilowattage.  That is <Col N="838" /> rather a pity, inasmuch as it is from that Cork station we would have the best chance of reaching people interested in Irish programmes, people of Irish race or descent in southern England.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not outlined in any great detail what plans he has for the use of mobile recording units, but I know that many people in the broadcasting services are very anxious that these units should be more fully developed, particularly as a means of making available talent in country places which would otherwise remain undiscovered.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider extending the hours of broadcasting as far as he can.  I know the arguments that have been made against that.  One of the reasons our people are prone to listen to programmes from the B.B.C. is the availability of B.B.C. programmes during hours when Radio Éireann is not broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make any reference&mdash;nor perhaps should he be expected to&mdash;to the use of the radio for the purpose of anti-Partition propaganda. In my submission, the fullest possible use should be made of this valuable vehicle of publicity to put before the people of the world the injustice perpetrated on our country by Britain through Partition.</P>
    <P>I think I will find a good deal of agreement when I say it was hardly in the best possible taste for the present Minister's predecessor, now Deputy Little, to refer to partisanship in the operation of the broadcasting services. I do not want to go any further than that, but I hope the Minister will resist the temptation, no matter from what quarter it comes, to impose political tests such as were imposed by his predecessor in order to prevent a very popular and very capable broadcasting artist from reaching the Irish public on the air.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane pretends to be very naive.  He does not yet know that, when the Fine Gael Government which he is responsible for putting into power says that it does not intend to proceed with a matter this year, that means it is put into <Col N="839" /> abeyance and &ldquo;put into abeyance&rdquo; means that it is abandoned and that they know Deputy Lehane and others will support them in that abandonment.</P>
      <P>Even if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is going to commit himself to some vague promise that in the distant future he will erect a broadcasting station or will agree to its being erected by somebody else, the Minister for Finance has indicated that, as far as he is concerned, this short-wave broadcasting business is to come to an end.  In the Seanad on Wednesday, 30th June, as given in col. 302 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know that anything more ought to be said about the short-wave station.  It is a bit of a standing condemnation of Fianna Fáil so long as even the masts stick up into the air.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, whom Deputy Lehane put in here in control of the affairs of this State, is determined that even the masts will come down, to be used as Deputy Dillon wanted radio masts used, to be turned into knitting needles to knit the wool of the rabbits that soon will be running on Rineanna, he hoped.</P>

      <P>It is Deputy Lehane who brought it in.  Deputy Lehane is prepared to support the Fine Gael Government in abandoning the short-wave radio station.  All the money that was required for capital purposes has been spent upon it, or practically all of it. Deputy Lehane at some time or another wants £103,000 to be spent on the full running of the short-wave radio station, because that is what it is estimated to cost.  Deputy Lehane and his Party promised free credits for everything. What is £103,000 even to the Minister for Finance?  Last year on the Department of Agriculture Vote he stated that £217,000,000 was not a frightening figure.  Therefore £103,000 is a mere bagatelle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane is quite prepared to let the partitionists continue their proPartition propaganda while he refuses to support the plea that £103,000 should be spent on this short-wave radio station in order that the Irish point of view on any question, Partition or anything else, should get over the iron curtain.  Arthur Griffith used to talk about a paper wall.  Deputy Lehane is going to stand in with Fine Gael in putting an iron curtain round the country if they can.  Not only is he prepared to abandon the short-wave station, but he also stood behind them in the abandonment of modern transportation to other countries.  Why not use some of these free credits which they were talking about around the country?</P>

      <P>They gave the Minister for External Affairs the reins of Government, and at the present time he is using a very slack rein on the Fine Gael Government.  All the other Parties in this inter-Party Government can get their price from Fine Gael for their support.  Clann na Poblachta cannot.  Why do they not get even a short-wave station?  If the partitionists are using the short-wave to put forward their point of view, justifying the partition of Ireland, and talking about the beautiful spectacle presented by the procession on the 12th July in the North, why cannot Deputy Lehane at least say: &ldquo;We must get this bagatelle of £103,000 a year if we are to continue to support you&rdquo;?  I ask Deputy Lehane to have another whisper with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs before this debate is over, and let the Minister get up here and give us some more hopeful news about this short-wave broadcasting before the debate concludes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an ex-Minister for Finance I do not want to see the moneys collected from the people misspent or spent injudiciously. But, when I was Minister for Finance and the case was put up that in this country we should have a short-wave broadcasting station in order to put the Irish point of view to the rest of the world, I was prepared to support the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on that matter, even though it did cost £200,000 or so of capital expenditure and was calculated to cost £103,000 a year.  I hope that in the interests of the country, irrespective of Party, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will get on with his job of erecting this station; that he will get it going so that he can apply at the next conference in Mexico, or where-ever it is to be held, for the wavelengths. Those of us who opened our political eyes before 1920 will remember the bitter complaints made by the nationally-minded people of the country when Great Britain shut us out from all contact with the world and then blackguarded us on the other side of the paper wall.  If we are to prevent that happening again, we should be <Col N="843" /> able to get contact by modern means with the people who are interested in Ireland in other parts of the world. Deputy Collins is going to get up and give another tiny excuse for the abandoning of this short-wave station.  He is going to say that the modern radio station in America has a modulated frequency.  There is one modulated frequency station in the United States and there are probably a couple of thousand suitable listening sets.</P>

      <P>The old age pensioners have already been well provided for by the £600,000 which was taken from the national health insurance people; by the £450,000 in connection with the widows' and orphans' pensions, and by the £750,000 or nearabouts that is being saved in relation to agricultural development.  The old age pensions were estimated to cost £600,000 this year.  Two million pounds have been saved under the three measures which I have outlined and this will be put into the pocket of the Minister for Finance. Deputy C. Lehane may think out all the excuses he likes I hope he will have another whisper with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and that before this debate is over the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will give us some more cheerful news about the short-wave broadcasting station.</P>

      <P>I will deal first of all with the motion by Deputy Lemass and by Deputy Little.  Deputy Little has just yielded up the stewardship of the Post Office after a considerable number of years.  No matter where he has been questioned he has not yet been able to indicate anything more than embryo as far as a short-waveband for this country is concerned.  I agree thoroughly with Deputy C. Lehane.  As a Fine Gael Deputy, let me say, for the information of Deputy Aiken, that I agree emphatically with what Deputy C. Lehane has said to the effect that <Col N="845" /> this policy of the short-wave station should not be abandoned until careful consideration has been given to it and until it is proved impracticable.  If it is proved impracticable I think we will then be coerced to the conclusion that it must be abandoned.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will send representatives to Mexico and I hope that we will get a wave-band.  I feel that there is now more necessity than ever before for us to get Partition propaganda across to the world in view of the amount that is being talked about it by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleague, Mr. Aiken, since they left office.  A long, long period of silence is broken when Fianna Fáil leaves office and then, in an amazing trans-world cycle, we have the chain lightening of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the short-wave station for Partition purposes is relative to the policy of the short-wave station and it has been introduced into this debate by the movers of this motion on the short-wave radio station. Their basis of complaint is that we have now no way of penetrating the paper wall.  I recollect, and Deputy de Valera can correct me if I am wrong, that he made a statement once to the effect that the radio was no means by which Partition could be solved.  The short-wave radio station can be a national asset.  If, as I believe &mdash;and Deputy Little agrees with me&mdash; the present condition of the short-wave station permits us in the case of an emergency or of a national crisis to crash in on wave-bands I feel the Minister should reserve the station, such as it is at the moment.  We should all realise by now that most of the propaganda done during the last world <Col N="846" /> holocaust was done on unrecognised wavelengths.</P>
      <P>If we are sincere in the fact that we want this station for the purpose of getting the ear of the outside world and if the Minister finds it impossible to go any further than preserve the facilities he has to reach the outside world, I will be perfectly satisfied.  I should, however, like the Minister to give some kind of a chance to the short-wave radio station from the point of view of trying to procure a waveband. I should like him to come back to this House, as Deputy C. Lehane would like him, at some future date and tell us the real position.  If it is as sorry as I think it is, I hope he will have the courage to come and tell us in no uncertain way about it.  A good deal of capital has been made out of the subject of the short-wave radio station. Deputy Little says that we could not get the equipment until 1945&mdash;quite forgetting that from 1932 to 1939 he could have got all the equipment he wanted for his short-wave radio station if he had then wanted it.  Unless the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, running a commercial undertaking on a commercial basis, can come into this House and give us a reasonable assurance that the short-wave radio station will be heard abroad I do not think we will be justified in the expenditure of a very large annual sum for running it.</P>
      <P>On the subject of radio generally, I think that with the best will in the world the wrong people to run radio are civil servants.  I feel that the Minister should contemplate the possibility of a different type of directorship and managementship of radio altogether&mdash;one that would be virtually independent so far as it would be possible within a general statement of policy to make any director of radio independent.  Some very good features are broadcast by Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with Deputy Lehane on that point.  So far as plays, in particular, are concerned the standard is very high, in fact, excellent. I have, however, a feeling that there is a want of balance about the programmes of Radio Éireann.  That can only be met by bringing into the directorship of it people whose whole <Col N="847" /> life and environment has been in a general type of show or radio back-ground&mdash;people who are really knowledgeable from the point of view of actually being artistes themselves or of being so acquainted with production as to be of some real assistance to the station.  I should like to ask Deputy Little&mdash;particularly in view of his present loud talk about using a short-wave radio station for the purpose of putting the evil of Partition to the world and, in the same breath, about developing culture and employing Irish artists and so forth at home&mdash;why he permitted such a terrific recruitment of foreign artistes to work in Radio Éireann.  Did he really explore the possibility of getting suitable Irish applicants for these positions and why is such a preference in remuneration shown to foreign artistes?  If Radio Éireann is to be anything I say that it must be symbolic of Ireland and her tradition.  That symbolism and that tradition of Ireland can be best transmitted to the world through the medium of people born and reared in this country and steeped in the tradition of this country who have proved their efficiency either as musicians, singers or various other types of artistes.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should seriously review the matter.  There are many features in Radio Éireann that I would like to see in more frequent use.  I would like, too, to have some hours in the morning devoted to a certain type of entertainment suitable to those of us who have to remain at home such as is given by the B.B.C. at the moment. Considering the popularity of the present recorded programmes at midday and of the Irish Hospitals' Sweep at night I think the Minister would be fully justified in introducing a musical programme along traditional Irish lines, thereby offering our people throughout the country some reasonable entertainment during the morning hours and weaning them away from their present devotion to the B.B.C.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to introduce a note of dissension into this debate.  Neither do I wish to be deliberately provocative but I do think the time has come when the radio of this country might <Col N="848" /> be used with advantage in educating the general public in relation to incidents and individuals prominent in our history.  I think the Minister should introduce speeches dealing with the lives of historical personages as a corrective to the present distorted views held by our own people.  No matter what Deputy Little may say about partisanship, I hold that during the past 16 years the radio was stifled so far as opponents to the existing régime were concerned.  The time has come when the radio should be used to correct the deliberate perversion of the lives and aims of people who are now dead.  I would like to have interesting short talks given on the radio.  I would like to see the programme dealing with '98 enlarged and expanded to bring within its scope the heroes and the martyrs of 1916, and subsequent years, who left their mark on the destiny of this country.</P>
    <P>I thing great improvement could be made in the radio programmes if less highbrow music was used.  I am not a devotee of highbrow music.  I want to see programmes of characteristic Irish music.  I would like to see presentations in the Irish language of reasonably good plays.  I think such plays have a definite entertainment value. There is a feature in the <i>Irish Press</i> at the moment in which a new phrase in Irish is given every day.  I think something similar could be done on the radio.  One quarter of an hour per day could be devoted to a progressive type of programme in the Irish language giving words and phrases in common use and helping to keep alive the knowledge of the Irish language in some people and to revive interest in it on the part of others.  If we were really in earnest about reviving our language we would take every means at our disposal to encourage its growth.</P>
    <P>When the Minister reconvenes the advisory council I want him to consider seriously the question of balance as far as Radio Éireann programmes are concerned.  I do not care very much for jazz music or light swing but at the same time I think the Minister might consider the desirability of giving those of our people who like that <Col N="849" /> kind of music an hour's programme two or three times per week.  I think the programme needs balance.  At the moment there are certain items that stand out.</P>
    <P>Practically everybody likes to listen to a good play.  Practically everybody likes the midday recorded programme and the Hospitals Sweep programme. Nobody can deny that we are all interested in sport and sports commentaries. I think Radio Éireann, considering all the drawbacks it suffers under in regard to accommodation and so forth, has done a pretty good job in regard to sports commentaries generally.  The Olympic Games will shortly be held in Britain and I hope the Minister will have some facilities for broadcasting those events in which Irish athletes are taking part.  Such features are a definite improvement in the programme.  With 20 odd years' experience behind us we should now be able to make adjustments to meet the needs of a modern situation.</P>
    <P>The radio could be utilised as a means of helping such a programme as I have suggested.  There could be a simple type of Irish lesson during the early part of the morning and it would give an impetus to the language revival. Then the radio could give our housewives a type of light entertainment, light music that they can listen to while at their work, and it could also give us some commentary on sports and other events of general public interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the suggestion that there is a good deal of partisanship on the radio, that certain people are given more prominence than others.  It is in the nature of our Parliament that people holding Ministerial rank, or holding the positions occupied by Deputy de Valera or Deputy Lemass in the Opposition, will get a good deal more prominence than ordinary Deputies.  I do not think anybody can quarrel with that.  Ministers are, in theory at any rate, responsible for the running of the State; they make pronouncements on policy and on the future of this country and it is not unreasonable to expect that in certain news items they would be given more prominence.  I have the distinction of <Col N="850" /> never having been mentioned on the radio and it does not worry me.  Why should we quarrel when the people editing these news items are, as the Minister says, doing their best in an impartial way and are dissociated from any political group?</P>
    <P>The Minister has, in Radio Éireann, one of the big cultural instruments that the country possesses.  He has there an organisation for the development of Irish culture.  He should try to build up a programme on the basis of our culture and the needs of our people. Above all, he should concentrate as rapidly as possible on engaging Irish people and he should have as little foreign interference and as few foreign artistes as possible.</P>

      <P>With the exception of Deputy Collins's rather superfluous remarks about the short-wave station, I agree to a large extent with what he said.  Deputy Collins apparently is satisfied that the short-wave station would be a most advantageous thing for this country.  It will be rather hard for him later on to reconcile his action, when he is voting against this motion, with what he has just said.  The abandonment of the short-wave station is, in my opinion, a national scandal. With that remark I leave it, and I shall confine myself to the existing station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old saying with reference to fooling the people and perhaps I shall be allowed to turn that saying slightly, to sum up the criticisms and the difficulties with which the Minister is faced so far as broadcasting is concerned. You can please some of the people all of the time and all the people some of the time, but you can not please all the people all the time. There is only a limited time each day at the disposal of Radio Éireann and, therefore, in its efforts to cater for all tastes, I agree with Deputy Collins that it has done a very good job in the past.  As a means of overcoming its present shortcomings, I suggest that the Department should proceed as soon as possible with the establishment of an alternative programme.  I believe it is part of the Government's policy to have an alternative medium-wave <Col N="851" /> programme.  That may not be as difficult as it seems to be just now, because we actually have a second station.  The wave-band might not be as powerful as the Dublin wave-band, but in Cork we have a station which could well be utilised for the transmission of an alternative programme.</P>
    <P>I do not mention this because I happen to represent Cork City.  I believe it would be quite popular, and it is one way of overcoming the criticism with which the Minister is faced in relation to the defects of broadcasting from Radio Éireann.  In Cork there is a broadcasting station in what was formerly an old jail.  It is on a good height and, with a little renovation, it would make an ideal permanent transmitting station.  For many years Cork has held a high place in the musical world and its artistes have been recognised for their ability and taste.  In the dramatic and operatic world Cork also holds a position of honour and in recent years it has enhanced its reputation in that respect.  If there were a permanent transmitting station in Cork I can guarantee to the Minister that he will have sufficient artistes there for any type of programme.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting in this country has not been brought to the same pitch as in other countries.  At the present time it does not offer many attractions as a whole-time occupation.  For that reason many of the contributors to Radio Éireann are people with businesses or professions and the market has more or less been cornered by people who live in or near Dublin.  I submit that the standard must necessarily be low because talented people throughout the country have not an opportunity of contributing to the programmes.  If you have a station in Cork people from Minister would find it quite convenient to contribute from there.  Cork is only a run of 1½ hours by car from Limerick, where there is some splendid talent. An alternative station in Cork would eliminate one difficulty facing the director of broadcasting when he has two equally attractive items at the same time.  These could easily be broadcast from the two centres.</P>
    <P>At the moment one of these items <Col N="852" /> has to suffer, whereas if there were a second station both could be broadcast. For instance, if there were a big event in Cork and another in Dublin at the same time on the same day, both could be broadcast, with the alternative station established in Cork.  Again, there are items on Radio Éireann which many people would regard as dull but nobody would dream or suggest that they should be done away with.  It is largely because of that that Radio Éireann has got a bad name. With an alternative station you could have a light programme, say in Cork, and a heavy programme in Dublin, and I am sure that would go a long way towards pleasing all the people all the time.</P>
    <P>As regards the present broadcasts, there are some naturally more attractive than others and the Minister might well adopt the B.B.C. device of recording good programmes and putting them over the air a second time.  There are items such as &ldquo;Round the Fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Information Please&rdquo;, which are given regularly each week at a fixed hour.  There are many people who would like to hear them, but they cannot because at the time of the broadcast they are otherwise engaged, and maybe so engaged week after week, whereas if we had a recorded version on a different night of some of the more popular programmes, it would go a long way towards solving another of the Minister's problems regarding radio generally.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister also, so far as the broadcasting of news in Irish is concerned, that when news is being broadcast in Irish, he should either have more time devoted to the broadcast or request the speakers to speak more slowly?  In that way he would encourage more people to listen to these broadcasts and also to other items which are broadcast in Irish. There are so many dialects that people who have learned one dialect have a certain difficulty in understanding a speaker who is proficient in another dialect with which they are not familiar.  As a means of solving that problem, I would suggest that these broadcasts should be made a little more slowly and distinctly.  That would <Col N="853" /> be one means of encouraging people to listen regularly to broadcasts in Irish.</P>

      <P>I always regard the debate on this Estimate as one of the most important in which this House can indulge.  I do think that some people do not fully realise the important part that wireless can play in all features of our national, social and economic life or how it can be made a medium for good or a medium for bad.  Perhaps we have tended in the programmes which are broadcast here to lay too much emphasis on the needs of those who dwell in Dublin and other large cities.  I am afraid this country has not yet got out of the habit of attending more to the needs and wants of urban dwellers as against the needs of those who live on farms and who form the majority of the population of the country, people who live in country districts, sometimes in very isolated parts of the country.  Wireless is a very important adjunct in the homes of those who do not read the daily papers, who have no opportunity of going to see a film or to attend a theatre.  It provides news and entertainment for these people.  I do not think sufficient emphasis has been laid on the part that wireless plays in the lives of these people.  We have heard a lot about the need of brightening rural life in order to keep people on the land, and I think there should be some readjustment of the official point of view regarding wireless in connection with that matter.</P>
      <P>A large part of the debate has centred round the abandonment for the time being of the short-wave station. I want to say quite frankly that I am very sorry that the project for the short-wave station is not being proceeded with, but I understand there are financial and technical reasons against it.  Even if there were only technical reasons, it might be possible to surmount them but I believe financial reasons are against it and, weighing the matter in the balance, I believe that the financial reasons should prevail. For that reason I am going to support the Government in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I referred <Col N="854" /> in the Dáil every year when I was here before, and that is the question of providing longer programmes.  I cannot see why, when people pay a licence fee for the use of wireless, they should not be provided with a full session of entertainment and news. Other countries provide a complete programme and I do not see why this country should be an exception.  I should like to see programmes which are not confined to certain periods of the day only.  On the other hand, I should like to congratulate the wireless authorities on the very excellent performances which they do provide.  Their plays are very good and I think they have cut a good deal of jazz and music of that kind and that they now concentrate more on folk music, Irish music and classical music.  As I said, I think their plays are very good and, on the whole, balancing one station with another, I would as soon tune in to the Irish station as any other.  There were many good Continental stations before the recent war but they have disappeared. I am very glad that our station orchestra has been strengthened.  Its performances compare very favourably with those provided by any other country.</P>
    <P>I understand that speeches are to be kept very brief but there is one other point to which I should like to refer and which I also touched upon in former years when I was a member of the Dáil.  It has been referred to by two ex-Ministers this evening.  That is the question of the use of wireless for propaganda.  I think it comes very badly from these two ex-Ministers to raise that point.  Although I may have changed my seat from the last occasion on which I sat in the Dáil, I have not altered my views in any respect on this matter.  I gave expression to these views year after year, namely, that in wireless broadcasting we have in this country a very valuable medium to put a well-reasoned case on the air in regard to Partition.  On each occasion on which I raised the matter, in so far as I could extract any answer from the then Government, whether it was from the Minister responsible for the wireless service or from Deputy de Valera who was then Taoiseach that answer <Col N="855" /> was that there was no use in utilising wireless as a medium for propaganda. I do not agree with that at all and I am going to say what I said in Opposition, that I hope the Government will make use in so far as they can of our wireless service, not to engage in a campaign of vilification or anything of that kind, but in order to put forward a well-reasoned and well-balanced case which will reach the ears of reasonable men who can understand and appreciate the grievance under which this country is suffering at present.</P>
    <P>As I say, it came very badly from the two ex-Ministers who have spoken to suggest that there was anything in the Government programme at present that was intended to interfere in any way with a solution of that problem. Whether it was by reason of the fact that they had a firm conviction on the point that it would be no use or because they had arrived at the point that they did not want to use it at all events, the last Government gave me the impression every time I raised the point&mdash;and I raised it deliberately every year; I have gone through the reports of the debates on the various Estimates in former years and checked up on them&mdash;that it would be no use trying to utilise the wireless for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on this subject of a short-wave broadcasting <Col N="856" /> station.  In conjunction with Deputy Little, I am asking the Dáil &ldquo;to record its disapproval of the Government's decision to abandon the plans for the establishment of a short-wave broadcasting station.&rdquo;  So far as the Dáil was aware, until to-day, the Government had taken a decision to abandon the short-wave broadcasting station. There were a number of statements to that effect made by Ministers.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has, however, to-day used a phrase which suggests that the decision has not been to abandon the station but to postpone its establishment.  If that indicates a change of mind on the part of the Government, we welcome it, and I hope that what I have to say, and what has already been said from these benches, will expedite the process of conversion, and lead to a decision to proceed with the short-wave broadcasting station.  It is possible, of course, that the announcement from the Clann na Poblachta Ard Fheis may have had more effect upon the Government's views on this matter than the opinions expressed from these benches, but if that is so it also is to be welcomed, because in this matter the Government have made a grave mistake, a mistake into which I believe they rushed without full examination, and they would deserve not gibes or criticism but congratulation if they had now the courage to admit their mistake and to rectify it.</P>
      <P>It is to me inconceivable that there is any number of Deputies in this House, or any body of opinion in the country, which would not regard it as desirable that we should have here a wireless broadcasting station capable of being heard in whatever parts of the world our citizens and our friends have made their homes.  On many occasions in past years, leaders of nationalist opinion in Ireland have been concerned with the difficulty of establishing and maintaining contact with our people and our friends throughout the world, and now that science has made available to us a most excellent means of establishing and maintaining these contacts, it is clearly desirable that we should use these means.  It is impossible to conceive any Deputy standing up to argue that it is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> I want, however, to put the case for the establishment of the short-wave broadcasting station not solely on the basis that it is desirable that we should have it but that it is important&mdash;even necessary&mdash;that we should have it. There were many occasions in the past when it seemed to us to be of real importance to our national interest that our friends throughout the world, the individuals and the groups that might have been expected to help us in various difficulties, should have a channel of reliable information on Irish affairs.  There were many occasions during the war, and some occasions before the war, when we felt that the national position was weakened and that the national interests were less secure because these friends of Ireland &mdash;these individuals and groups in other countries who might have been able to help us in various circumstances&mdash;had no means of getting information about this country&mdash;no means of getting information concerning the opinions and the aims of our people except through wireless broadcasting stations in other countries, operated by authorities in other countries, or through international Press agencies which, as we all know, were not always friendly, and very frequently were inaccurate in relation to Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>The importance of having a short-wave broadcasting station was demonstrated to us who were in the Government during the war upon many occasions.  It is the knowledge that we felt the lack of such a means of communication abroad very acutely during that period that convinces me that the Government took a decision concerning the short-wave broadcasting station without attempting to draw upon the fund of knowledge and experience which is to be found in the records of the various Government Departments. If they had had our experience, or if they had attempted to ascertain the nature of our experience from these records, it is impossible to imagine them taking that decision so quickly and announcing it in the form in which they did.  There were occasions during the war when the dangers to this country&mdash;and it is futile now to ignore the fact that there were many <Col N="858" /> occasions when we were in danger&mdash; were greatly increased by the fact that we had not got available to us direct access to opinion in other countries, and that we could not reach opinion in other countries except through channels which were not friendly to us, and that people abroad were frequently given a false picture of events here, and even a false idea of opinion here.</P>
    <P>We did, in fact, on many occasions during the war wish that we had such a station.  The decision to proceed with its erection immediately after the end of the war was taken some years ago. It is obviously foolish for us to ignore now the lessons of that experience, and foolish for us to refuse to provide the country with the facilities which that short-wave station would represent in the light of international circumstances as they are now developing.</P>
    <P>There are, I think, very few people who can take regard of the state of the world at the present time and not feel that there is on the Government a direct obligation, as the custodians of the national interests and of the national purse, to examine the lessons of the last war, and to examine the deficiencies which increased our danger during that period and set out as quickly as possibly to remedy them, now that we have the chance.  It is not merely in relation to this matter of a short-wave broadcasting station, but in a number of other matters, that the Government give the impression of proceeding without reference to anything that has happened.  They are certainly allowing themselves to be influenced in relation to some of these matters unduly by what seems to be a prejudice against schemes initiated by their predecessors. It is impossible to imagine the people of this country electing a Government that would deliberately try to betray the national interests, but if ever such a Government were elected it would, in regard to some matters, pursue the policy which the present Government are following because of these unreasonable prejudices. It is not a time in which we can allow ourselves the luxury of prejudices where matters affecting national interests are concerned.  Nobody can examine international conditions without seeing the dangers which existed <Col N="859" /> from 1939 until 1945 reappearing some time in the future, if not precisely in the same form, at least in a form which would not be altogether dissimilar.  In that situation, it is clearly desirable to give us now the things we should like to have had, the things that, it is our recorded opinion, would, if they then existed, have contributed to our safety in those difficult days.</P>
    <P>What is the case for the abandonment of the station?  Deputy Esmonde said that the reasons for the abandonment of the short-wave station were financial and technical.  Let us examine precisely what are those financial and technical reasons.  The financial reason, presumably, is a desire for economy.  In fact, it was as an economy that the decision to abandon the short-wave station was first announced to the Dáil.  The equipment for the station has been purchased at a cost roughly of £100,000.  The greater part of it has been delivered and most of it is on the site for the station.  Some has already been erected.  As there is now a change of mind on the part of the Government and a withdrawal from the original position of abandoning the station in favour of merely postponing its establishment, presumably that equipment will not be sold, and some expense will be incurred in preventing it from deteriorating while it is lying round the site there at Athlone.  If the economy of which we were asked to approve was the avoidance of capital expenditure, the answer is that the capital expenditure has already been incurred.  While it might have been recovered by the sale of the equipment, it is doubtful if sale would be practicable and in any event I take it that the decision now is not to sell it. The equipment was of a most modern kind.  We were assured by the Marconi Company that supplied it that it contained many features which were a considerable advance upon those embodied in similar short-wave broadcasting stations in other countries.  If it is an economy, therefore, to abandon the station, it is not an economy on capital, but rather an avoidance of expenditure on the employment of musicians, artistes, technicians and workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> I doubt very much if the total expenditure avoided can be very considerable in relation to the total expenditure of Government services, and in any event it was hardly the type of economy I would have expected many of the Deputies opposite to approve of.  We have frequently in the past discussed here the problem of unemployment and its associated problem of emigration. It is a cliché to say that the solution of the problem of unemployment is to increase the opportunities of work in this country, but the solution of the problem of emigration goes much deeper.  It is to provide, not merely an adequate number of jobs for our people but a variety of jobs, to give an opportunity to people who want to follow particular occupations which require a higher degree of skill and facility than other people have to remain in that type of work at home.  It is at least as important as increasing the total number of jobs to increase the variety of jobs, particularly the types of employment which require the possession of a natural facility or skill of a high order.  The general case for the short-wave broadcasting station, the development of air services, and many projects which the Government embarked on in the past, included the desirability of providing an increase in the variety of employments in Ireland available to our own people.  It is unlikely that the Government will defend its decision to abandon the short-wave broadcasting station merely on the grounds that by doing so it will avoid employing a certain number of musicians, artistes and technicians, and yet it seems that that is the only real economy that the abandonment involves.  I do not think that the attempt to represent to the Dáil that there is a case for the abandonment of the station on technical grounds is altogether straightforward.</P>
    <P>It is true, I know, that no short-wave length has been allocated to this country, but it is extremely improbable in any circumstances that a short-wave length would be allocated until we had a short-wave broadcasting station. What is the position concerning the allocation of wave lengths?  There is an international body voluntarily set up by governments to bring order into the <Col N="861" /> whole business of broadcasting and to allocate wavelengths to various countries, so as to avoid their interference one with the other.  We are a member of this international organisation.  We joined it because we expected that it would act fairly and equitably as far as we were concerned.  There was no reason to assume that it would not, and if it did not, the case for our membership in the organisation would be destroyed and the same would be true for the other countries in it.  There is no reason to think that we will not get the facilities given to every other country, many of them smaller than ours, which have in recent years established short-wave broadcasting stations and which have got facilities in the matter of wavelengths.  It is to be assumed that as soon as we have a short-wave station capable of operation the international organisation responsible for regulating the wavelengths will make the necessary arrangements to enable it to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, of course, gave another reason for the abandonment of the short-wave station.  He said that the decision to erect it was evidence of megalomania.  I do not think that anybody&mdash;except the Minister for Finance&mdash;would consider it to be a proof of our madness that we decided to establish in this country the facilities which the peoples of other countries regard as normal development, something that comes as a matter of course.  Is there any reason for saying that it is evidence of megalomania for us to have the same means of international communication here as exist in practically every other country in the world?  It is unlikely, I think, that that particular point of view expressed by the Minister for Finance is shared by any substantial number of the Deputies who support the Government.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was never happy about this decision to abandon the short-wave broadcasting station and I am quite certain that the Party of which he is a member was never happy about it.  It is, I think, possible that he may have been given a misleading picture of the case for the establishment <Col N="862" /> of such a station by the officers to whom he went for advice who may have been less convinced than the previous Government of the necessity for it.  It may have been a majority decision of the Cabinet; it may have been a decision taken by his colleagues at a time when they thought it was necessary for them to justify in a material way the announced intention of achieving economies and that that was the only consideration.  Whatever the reason for it, I am quite sure that if the Minister exerts his influence and authority as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as the channel through which the Government should be advised on this matter, the amended decision to postpone the establishment of the station can soon be further amended to a decision to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the announcement of Clann na Poblachta that they also disapproved of the decision to abandon the short-wave broadcasting station. The announcement of their decision, whatever they are going to do about it, makes it clear that the majority of this House is in favour of proceeding with it.  That being so, it makes less justifiable any attempt by the Government to stick its heels in the ground and to refuse to be budged by the force of opinion in this matter.</P>
    <P>The motion asks the Dáil to express its disapproval of the decision to abandon the station.  The rejection of that motion by the Dáil would, I think, mean that the attitude of the majority here and of our people would be misrepresented. It is, I know, not likely to be regarded or accepted as a vote of no confidence by the Government, and, on that account, Deputies who feel as I do that the Government made a mistake in this decision and that the sooner they reverse the decision the better, can freely vote for the motion, without risking upsetting the political balance which they wish to maintain. I am putting the case for the motion on that basis, that there are Deputies who will feel that, whatever temporary political reverse the Government would be regarded as having received or whatever victory the Opposition would be regarded as having gained it is of <Col N="863" /> minor importance compared with the correction of this wrong decision by the Government.  If the motion is passed, I assume that the Government will accept the view of the Dáil majority and proceed with the station. If it is rejected, they will regard it as confirmation of their present attitude. I hope, therefore, that it will be passed and that all Deputies opposite who feel with us that this wrong decision should be reversed will be induced to vote for it, or, at least, be persuaded not to vote against it.</P>

      <P>No matter what one may think of Deputy Lemass or his political views, one will always concede that, as a debater, he is very plausible.  I have conceded that on more than one occasion and I concede it again now.  Never was Deputy Lemass more plausible than in his references to the short-wave station.  I understand the position, and I understood the position all along, to be that the Government decided that, so far as this year was concerned, they were not going ahead with the establishment of the short-wave station.  That was my understanding at the time this matter was first mentioned in the Budget debate.  I have since gone to the trouble of checking the references made in the debate to this matter and, so far as they do anything, they confirm definitely that the decision was to postpone rather than to abandon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be quite honest with the House and to say that I do not altogether agree with the views expressed by Deputy Lemass or by Deputy Con Lehane to-day.  Deputy Lemass put it to Deputies for their consideration that it was inconceivable that any Deputy or any volume of opinion in the country would believe that the establishment of this short-wave station was not desirable. So far as that statement is concerned, I will agree with him, but I want to put this view to Deputies: If the establishment of a short-wave station is desirable in 1948, it was also desirable in 1932.  It took the Fianna Fáil Party 16 years to get around to this question of a short-wave radio station and 16 years to develop plans for it.  If it is desirable now, it was <Col N="864" /> desirable when they came into office. I will agree that the establishment of a short-wave station, if it can be afforded by the people, is desirable and is a worthy project.  I do not believe that this year&mdash;and possibly not next year&mdash;this country can afford expenditure on a short-wave station or on many other items I have in mind and will not be permitted to mention in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little spoke about a national concert hall and said that the objection to that&mdash;and I assume it came from his own colleagues, because that was the way he put it&mdash;always was that houses must come first.  There was always something which must come first.  The position at the moment is that, so far as some essential expenditure is concerned, the situation is desperate, and this Dáil would, to use another phrase of Deputy Lemass's, be betraying the national interest if it were to put housing or increased benefits for old age pensioners and subsistence pensioners in second or third place to short-wave radio stations or concert halls.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any doubt about it.  You cannot run up money all the time and there must be some sense of responsibility when the Government are dealing with the people's money.  We can thank God, at any rate, that this Government does show a sense of responsibility, unlike Deputy de Valera's Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;national scandal&rdquo; were used twice in this debate by speakers from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  They were used by Deputy Lynch in relation to the short-wave station and by Deputy Little in connection with what he termed partisan broadcasts.  I wonder if Deputies listened to what Deputy Little exactly said.  We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs this evening assuring Deputies, and asking them to accept his word for it, that he had not, since he came into office, given any direction, good, bad or indifferent, to the Director of Broadcasting, or whoever is responsible for editing the news <Col N="865" /> bulletins with regard to what items of a political nature they were to include or to exclude.  But we had an admission, which I regard as rather startling, from Deputy Little that, when he was Minister, it was his policy and the policy of his Government to see to it that Fianna Fáil Ministers got a much better show in the news bulletins than any other Deputies.  He said it was deliberate policy.  That was the Fianna Fáil way of working.  This Minister has departed from that policy and is leaving it to the person responsible for editing the news bulletins as to what will be included and what will not.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Radio Éireann programmes, I believe that, if the programmes are analysed from a purely academic point of view, they will probably be graded as good or very good, but I am quite convinced, from my own personal experience, from talking to people who listen to Radio Éireann programmes, that these programmes are not catering for the people who listen to them.  They are not giving the people what the people want to hear.  I merely mention that because it is a matter about which there can, and should be, two opinions, as to whether we should give programmes which are cultural, educational and so on, but which people do not want to hear, or whether we should insist on catering for the tastes of those who listen and who have paid their licence fees, a problem which the Minister and his officials must work out in the course of the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I want to wish the Minister well in dealing with those problems, and to say that, so far as I am concerned, and so far as those who sit on these benches with me are concerned, we are very glad to see the Minister in the position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. We wish him every succcess in tackling the problems he will have to face.</P>

      <P>We have listened to one of the lamest apologies this House has ever heard for the abandonment by the present Administration of the project to establish a short-wave station here.  We are told, of course, that the project has not been abandoned; it has been merely postponed but, Deputy <Col N="866" /> O'Higgins, having made inquiries, is satisfied that, so far as this year is concerned and perhaps next year, the Government are definitely not going ahead with the short-wave station.  It reminds me of &ldquo;this year, next year, sometime, never&rdquo;.  That, I take it, is the real attitude of the section of the coalition which dominates the whole. So far as they are concerned they regard the proposal to establish a short-wave station as one that is undesirable in itself.  Deputy O'Higgins almost went so far as to say that.</P>

      <P>Any person looking at the international situation as we see it to-day must realise that we are running <Col N="867" /> grave risks in postponing the establishment of this station, that it may be essential to the national safety and security in future that we should have some means of communicating with the outside world.  Those of us who had the experience of going through the last war, who were aware of the extent to which the position of this country was misrepresented abroad all during that war, had borne in upon us very forcibly how essential it was that we should be able to communicate and make known our position in regard to any international situation that might arise to the world at large, but particularly to those who are of Irish origin or Irish descent or who are sympathetic to the people of this country and who happen to live abroad.</P>
      <P>A situation may arise in Europe&mdash; and there is no person now can deny that the international situation is very threatening, that it is full of possible danger for the people of this country&mdash; when it may be, as I have said, essential for the national security and for the safety of all our people that we should be able to communicate with the outside world.  That is the principal reason why I regard the decision by the Government not to proceed with the erection of this station as a dangerous decision, as a decision which is not justified by the circumstances of the time and a decision which has been taken, not with a view to making any significant economy, but merely because of the fact that this was a project which had been initiated by Fianna Fáil.  Because it was a project of that kind, that was sufficient to damn it in the eyes of the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that because there has been no real economy secured by the abandonment of this station.  The capital expenditure required had already been incurred.  Plant and equipment were here.  All that was necessary was to provide the labour necessary to complete the execution of the scheme.  The greater part of that labour would have been provided by Irishmen.  God knows, we have enough unemployment in the country to-day to make it desirable that any project which is in the national interest should be proceeded with without delay.  In so far as the <Col N="868" /> programmes were concerned, expenditure upon them was not going to be by any manner of means considerable, having regard to the amount of money which was already being provided for Radio Éireann programmes.</P>
    <P>The revenue from wireless licences and other sources would have been more than sufficient to have covered the additional expenditure on programmes and running expenses which the short-wave station would have necessitated.  My colleague, Deputy Little, the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, says: &ldquo;not quite&rdquo;.  I say that we could budget upon an increased revenue from wireless licences this year which would have fully covered any additional expenditure which the operation of a short-wave station would have involved.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, bearing in mind what I have already said in regard to the international situation, bearing in mind the need of this little country to maintain whatever ties and affiliations it may have with the sons and daughters of this race abroad, surely it would have been worth while spending £10,000 or £20,000 in order to keep them in touch with affairs at home.  If you like, the association need only be a cultural one.  We could not make it a definite political one but, if they were able to listen to our programmes, our songs, our plays, to listen, if you like, even to our news bulletins, partisan and all as they have proved to be over the last three or four months, would not it at least have enabled them to realise that they too had ties and links with Ireland, a realisation which would be very valuable to us and almost essential to our safety in the world of the future.</P>
    <P>Again let me repeat, merely, I think, because the credit of the Fianna Fáil Party was in some way intertwined with this proposal to establish a short-wave station, the Government have decided to abandon it.  The plant and equipment, remember, were already on the site.  The works were in course of erection.  The completion of them would have given a great deal of muchneeded employment to Irish people. The programmes were going to impose <Col N="869" /> no undue expense upon the State.  Yet that whole project is abandoned, and abandoned in this year of 1948, when the cloud of war is hanging heavy over the whole of Europe and when we, if that war should come, may find ourselves in the very centre of it.  Is there any justification from the point of view of the national interest for the policy which the Government has pursued?</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech defending this indefensible policy of the Government, Deputy O'Higgins said that if this were desirable in 1948, it was also desirable in 1932.  In so far as the desirability of the short-wave station is concerned, I agree with Deputy O'Higgins.  Of course, it would have been very useful to us in 1932, when we had opened the Constitutional battle and the Bill for the removal of the Oath was here before Dáil Éireann.  It would have been very useful to us to have been able to make our people in Great Britain and Australia and America aware of what was being done here by us at that time.  We could have done that, if we had a short-wave station at our disposal. It would have been very useful to us during the whole course of the economic war, or during 1937, when we were discussing the present Constitution of this independent State here in Dáil Éireann.  The point, however, is that, while it might have been useful then, it might not have been practicable.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, the problems associated with satisfactory short-wave transmission over long distances had not then been solved.  It was only about 1937 or 1938 that one could say with a certain amount of assurance that the expenditure on a short-wave station would have been justified from the point of view of efficiency of the transmissions.  As soon as it was a practical proposition, the Government, having given consideration to it, adopted it in principle; and we were pushing forward with plans to establish the station when the war broke out in 1939.  The experience we underwent during that war convinced us beyond yea or nay that it was essential in the national interest that we should equip ourselves with this means of communication with the outside world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> I want now to refer to the answer which the Minister gave to the question put down by my colleague, Deputy Little, in regard to the partisan way in which news of vital interest to the community is being presented by Radio Éireann.  Those of us who listened to the speech of the former Minister for Agriculture in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, know that it was a speech which covered the whole field of agricultural effort in this country; a speech which, from the point of view of the practical farmer and the scientific farmer, was a masterpiece; a speech which beyond doubt impressed the intelligent members of the Government Party, and which must have convinced many of them that the policy being pursued by the present Minister for Agriculture was detrimental to the national interest.  The most striking proof of the effectiveness of that speech was that it was very cursorily reported in the Government Press and was suppressed altogether in the Government news broadcast.</P>
    <P>Whereas a resumé of the speech of the present Minister for Agriculture was given at some length in Friday evening's broadcast&mdash;and I do not complain of that, as I think it is essential that the country should be made well aware of the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the cogent and searching criticism of that speech and of that policy, which was made by his immediate predecessor, the former Minister for Agriculture, was completely suppressed.  The people were not allowed to hear what he said. Though Deputy Smith spoke early on Friday, and early again when the debate was resumed on Tuesday, he appears to have spoken too late for any single word of his to have been included in the news broadcast at 10.10 on Friday evening and at 10.10 on Tuesday evening.</P>
    <P>I do not know how that happened, unless the telephone service, or the telegraph service, or even the messenger service, under the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has become hopelessly inefficient; or, as we contend, the national broadcasting service, which is the property of the <Col N="871" /> whole people and to support which those who own wireless licences are compelled to subscribe, irrespective of Party, is being used here to bolster up the present Administration in a shame-lessly partisan way.  It must be either hopeless inefficiency on the part of the Department under its present Minister, or else shameless partisanship on the part of those who control news broadcasts. I do not believe that the Department has become hopelessly inefficient.  I have had personal experience of many of the higher officers in executive positions in control of the service and I am sure they are as efficient and as able as can be found in this State.  Therefore, the explanation for this very curious omission to give even one single sentence from the speech of the former Minister for Agriculture can only be ascribed to deliberate partisanship on the part of some person.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in his reply to Deputy Little to-day, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am satisfied that the news officials perform their difficult task without any bias and so long as that is the case I do not think it right that I should interfere with their independence of action by holding investigations into what the exigencies of their work require them to include in, or exclude from, individual bulletins.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reminds me of the performance of Pilate on a certain historic occasion. The Minister is responsible for his officers.  He holds a responsibility to this House, he surely has a duty to all the people of this country, to ensure that the news broadcasts from Radio Éireann will be impartial, that they will give both sides of the case.  How can anyone argue that a news broadcast was impartial or gave both sides of the case, when the statement of the present Minister for Agriculture was broadcast at some length and the speech of his immediate predecessor was totally suppressed?  I think that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he will look facts in the face, if he will be candid with himself, must admit <Col N="872" /> that the broadcast of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture was definitely biased, was definitely partisan and failed to give the country a fair resumé of what was said in the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he does not interfere with the broadcasts. Perhaps he feels that it is not necessary for him to interfere with the broadcasts, because he knows what the nature of the broadcasts is going to be. It is not usual in this House to comment upon the activities of officials of the Department.  But it is well known that there is a certain Party partisan journal published monthly in this country which has been consistently anti-Fianna Fáil.</P>

If those activities are improper according to the standards which have been laid down in relation to the Civil Service and the Minister permits them, the Minister is responsible to this House.

      <P>A regulation was issued by, I think, the second Minister for Finance in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that civil servants were not to identify themselves with political points of view in a way which would enable them to be recognised as civil servants.  The head of every Department is responsible for ensuring that the regulation laid down by the then Minister for Finance for the general governance of the Civil Service is strictly enforced.  I am saying that that rule has been violated, and I am charging the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with permitting it to be violated.  If a civil servant breaks a Civil Service regulation and is permitted to do so, then the person answerable to this House for that state of affairs is the Minister.  That is the position in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now&mdash;that he is permitting this rule to be broken and that he is permitting it to be broken deliberately because he knows that, in so far as the official activities of this particular civil servant are concerned, those which come immediately and directly under the Minister, he is going to discharge his duties in relation to them in a way which will be consistent with the other activities which he pursues outside the service.</P>

      <P>I would not be allowed to mention it.  It would be <Col N="875" /> quite improper for me to mention it. Its only relevance in this debate is to bring home the fact that certain people can do things and get away with them under the present Minister.  As I have said, the broadcasting service in this country is maintained by fees collected from all sections of the population.  In so far as that service purports to broadcast news, it is bound, in discharge of its responsibilities to the people, to broadcast that news without bias and, whenever there is a subject under discussion in the Dáil, to give both sides of the case without fear or favour.  That is the position which we took up when in office and that is the position which we honourably and consistently maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Early this year and during the election campaign a number of members of the then Opposition Parties advocated that all Parties should have the right to use the radio for the purpose of putting their point of view before the electorate.  I was one of those who advocated that policy at that time. Immediately after the formation of the present Government I asked the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he would proceed to allow all Parties in this State the right to broadcast.  The Minister replied that he was favourably considering that proposition.  That service has not been availed of by all Parties in the State mainly because the then Opposition Party refused point blank to obey.  I cannot understand why the chief Opposition Party turned down that proposition.  I think it is desirable in the national interest that all Parties should have the right to state their case over the radio and thus inform the people of their viewpoints.  The main advantage of such a service goes to the Opposition Party.  Ministers have, by reason of their office, quite frequent opportunities to express their views on the air.  The Opposition Party, however, could have derived some advantage from this service but they did not choose to avail of it.  The only reason I can think of is that they felt they had no reasonable case to put before the public or else that they feared that <Col N="876" /> Deputy MacEntee might go on the air. I am one of those who believe in justice and fair play for all Parties and particularly in regard to a national service such as this.  That is why I have frequently suggested in debates on this Estimate that there should be established a national advisory council to advise the Minister in regard to the broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that in my opinion Deputies of this House are the worst possible judges as to what a broadcasting programme should be.  I do not think there is any section of the community which has as little opportunity for listening to the radio as Deputies.  As we know, the radio is part of the equipment of the home but I think it will be agreed that Deputies have very little home life and for that reason they have very little opportunity of listening to the programmes. A carefully selected and representative advisory council would, I think, be able to give the Minister very useful advice on how the programmes should be shaped.  It is something which ought to be established in the near future. Nearly every Government Department and nearly every Minister at the present time is setting up an advisory council.  There is no Department that requires such a council more urgently than the Department in charge of broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am altogether in favour of a second programme.  I think it is absolutely impossible to crowd into one programme all the features that will appeal to every section of the community. Another improvement which, I think, is long overdue is the more extensive use of the radio in schools and colleges.  There are certain types of broadcasts which are very desirable for pupils in our national schools and our secondary schools.  I refer particularly to the subject of civics.  This is one form of instruction which could be given very well over the radio.  There are, no doubt, many other branches of education in which a very good broadcaster could assist and supplement the work of our teachers in the national and in the secondary schools.  Therefore, every week at least one half-hour should be devoted to the primary <Col N="877" /> schools and one half-hour to the secondary schools.  It would be, in addition, a very useful addition to our programme.  It is, too, very desirable to improve the standard of our agricultural broadcasts.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling amongst those in authority in various Government Departments that anything is good enough for the farmer.  Deputy Little more or less revealed that mentality in one respect when he said that even the farmers had a sense of culture and could enjoy and take advantage of a cultural programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think farmers would take that&mdash;whatever words the Deputy used&mdash;as being very complimentary. There is the idea that you can lay down a certain form of stereotyped instruction on how to feed pigs and cows and so forth and that the farmer will listen in and believe it.  I do not think that kind of programme is any use whatever from the agricultural point of view.  What we want on the air for the improvement and education of those engaged in the agricultural industry is a discussion between intelligent people who are competent to argue the various viewpoints in regard to agricultural policy and practice. That, in the main, is what people like to hear.  The ordinary man, if he is listening to a broadcast talk, likes to hear a battle of wits between two able people who can debate opposing viewpoints. By having discussions on contentious matters as well as on agricultural matters&mdash;and some agricultural matters can be very contentious&mdash;our programmes would be brightened considerably and they would at the same time have an educational value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the short-wave radio station, I am entirely in agreement with those who have pointed out the desirability of postponing, at least for a time, that development until we have definitely settled in our minds what we <Col N="878" /> are going to put on the air.  If we are going to broadcast to our people in foreign countries it is most desirable that our programmes should be very carefully considered.  I would ask the Minister not to broadcast to other countries and not to put this short-wave station into operation until we have functioning in this country a national advisory council such as I have suggested, and until that council has hammered out a good programme which will impress the people abroad and raise our prestige.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter in connection with broadcasting to which I would like to refer.  It was the custom of Radio Éireann formerly to hold symphony concerts in the various halls around the city.  Under the new system the concerts are being held in the Phoenix Hall.  The public can still go to these concerts but the method of obtaining tickets has been changed.  The public have now to write in and ask for the tickets.  No person can be quite sure as to whether he or she will be able to get admission and the matter requires a certain amount of planning in advance.  I would appeal to the Minister that some of these concerts should be held as heretofore in the big public halls.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Phoenix Hall is of inestimable benefit to students of music and that such students have free admission there.  That is a good thing in itself and I would be sorry to interfere with any benefits which the students may derive from this method. But there is a wider public which ought to be encouraged and a public that we would like to see regularly attending these concerts.  In order to facilitate such public the public halls are the best method.  I draw the Minister's attention to that aspect in so far as the change of venue is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My original intention was to reserve what I have to say on the short-wave broadcasting station to the Vote for External Affairs.  It occurred to me, however, that the Chair might possibly rule me out of order if I attempted to do that once this discussion was over.  I think it is better, therefore, that I should speak now.  Before I come to deal with the short-wave station and its abandonment I should, perhaps, say a word or two about broadcasting in general.  I think everybody will admit that the cinema and the wireless have come to stay.  Some may regret the evils that are brought through such media but we must all reckon with the fact that they are there and it is our business to make the best possible use we can of them.  There is no doubt that the cinema and broadcasting can be of great value from the educational point of view.  The radio can also be used from the point of view of entertainment. It is at times a nice problem to try to achieve a balance and see that entertainment&mdash;which, provided it is of the right sort, is a good thing in itself &mdash;does not usurp the educational side. The difficulty is to ensure that entertainment and education are properly <Col N="880" /> adjusted.  I take it it has always been a problem to achieve that balance in broadcasting.  It is quite true that one cannot please everybody.  No matter what decision is taken it must, in the long run, be a purely arbitrary one. Some person, some group, some council will have to decide what is best.  I take it that that has been the practice in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister, or the director, or the advisory council take decisions; they discuss matters first of all and then the Minister, having heard what they have to say, takes the final decision. Can one improve upon that?  I do not think one can as a system.  All one can do is to try to get the best qualified person as Minister and the best qualified group as an advisory council and let them decide.  There will be objections to any decision that they may arrive at.  All one can do is to hope that in the long run and on balance they will decide wisely.  My own view is that two programmes would be desirable. There are two tastes for which one must cater.  For those who want entertainment primarily entertainment must be provided.  For those who want education, programmes must be devised on a cultural basis.  If there were two stations there could be two programmes catering for entertainment and education simultaneously.  In that way, it would be easier to achieve more general satisfaction.  If one is tired and wants recreation, then one can turn on the entertainment programme. If, on the other hand, I am interested in some particular subject which, it has been announced, will be treated on the cultural side, I can turn on to that and listen in.  Therefore, the only thing we can do about it at the moment is to urge the Minister and his wise advisers to try to have the two programmes put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means more money, of course&mdash;at least, I expect it does.  When you come to this question of money in regard to any public service you have, of course, a difficulty.  Money can be got only in one way, and that is by way of taxation&mdash;that is, for the ordinary services. We are not a very wealthy community and we must of necessity pay attention to the financial side.  The only <Col N="881" /> thing we have to remember in that regard is that money can be very well spent and that to take a narrow view of finance and cut out everything because it means expenditure is the worst possible type of economy.  On all occasions you must ask yourself is the money going to be spent properly. There is, of course, the anterior question: can we get the money&mdash;is it available? Assuming it is available in one form or another, the question to be asked in all cases like that is: is the expenditure worth while&mdash;is the money that is to be spent going to justify the burden that will be placed on the community by spending it?</P>
    <P>We have been talking about education and there is a good deal of money being spent on it.  Is anybody going to say that, because the money that has to be spent on education will be a burden on our people, we ought to cut down in the matter of education?  If there is a question of national defence or some other national service, surely we ought to consider very carefully before we deprive the country of a service which in other countries is regarded as essential?</P>
    <P>That is precisely what we propose to do here in the case of the short-wave station.  We propose to reverse a decision that was adopted after very careful thought, adopted for no other reason but to serve the national interest.  Surely it is very unwise of us in this Chamber to reverse that decision without the most careful consideration? There is undoubtedly a reversal of a decision here.</P>
    <P>Why was the decision taken in the first instance?  The decision was taken as a result of experience.  You have been told already by Deputy Lemass how sorely we who formed the Government during the war period felt the loss of a short-wave station that would enable us to reach outside countries. Our country was being maligned every day; we had &ldquo;German submarines sheltering in our harbours&rdquo;; we had, according to these reports, not merely that&mdash;that was the report, of course&mdash; but we also had &ldquo;huge establishments here in the German and Japanese diplomatic missions&rdquo;.  Everything that could be said by way of bitter <Col N="882" /> propaganda to malign us was said and we had no means whatever of replying to it.  There was no use in hoping that any interview which might be given contradicting this would get outside and the result was that friends of ours, friends of freedom, friends of small nations throughout the world, were being poisoned against this nation by that foul propaganda.</P>
    <P>We were so affected by it that at one period we asked the body we set up to help us scientifically to boost up the existing station so that we could reach outside countries.  A considerable period of time and some money were spent in an effort to boost up the existing station.  We were determined at that time, because of our experience and for no other reason, that it would be in the national interest, and well worth the money spent on it, to acquire at the first possible opportunity installations which would enable us to reach the outside world.  We had difficulty in getting them; we had to wait for a considerable time, and now it is proposed, when they have been got, that these things should either be scrapped or sold.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in coming to that decision. The point is that when a crisis is on it is then you want a short-wave station, and these crises can happen very rapidly.  Even if you do not have a wavelength alloted to you, and even if you do not have what the last Deputy has suggested, a council or some other body to control the radio, surely you should have some means at your disposal to transmit to the outside world?  I think the Government, on reconsideration, cannot continue with that decision to postpone this matter for the coming financial year.  As has been mentioned already in the House, the outlook in the world to-day is not of such a kind that we can imagine we are completely out of the wood and that we can approach all our national and economic problems here as if we were facing a period of peace.  We may very well be facing a period of war, and then it will be too late for you, much too late for you, to get the necessary equipment to set up your station.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to reconsider <Col N="883" /> this matter and not let the narrow financial point of view which, in my opinion, is the dominant one here, get predominance.  I have said already, and I think I could prove it by going into the past, that there have been many decisions taken by Finance that have proved, in the sequel, to be very bad financially for the country.  Many things were postponed or not done because of the expense factor, and in the course of a year or two it was found that these things had to be done at three or four times the expense.  Let us not have that again.  As I understand it, we have got the greater part of the equipment ready.  At least we ought to put it in working order, and if we have to wait some time to get a satisfactory wavelength allotted to us it will be good insurance meanwhile to have the equipment there.  As was pointed out by some Deputies, at a time of crisis there is no observance of any wavelength; you try to get on the air in the best position you can so that your views may be heard.  That is a most important and urgent consideration, a consideration that makes it quite wrong to postpone the establishment of this station.</P>
    <P>There are many other arguments that I could adduce to suggest that we should go on with it.  I admit they have been already referred to, but it might be no harm if I were to repeat them. We are not an isolated nation here, in the sense that those who are interested in our welfare are far more widely flung than within the confines of this island. We have, in our struggles in the past, been supported by the goodwill of people of our race all over the world. These people are good citizens of the countries in which they dwell.  Nobody can point a finger at them but they have an affection for the land from which they themselves and their forebears sprung.  Because of that, it is desirable that we should keep in touch with them.  We can do that best through a short-wave station.  It is only those who have been away from this country for any length of time who realise the importance of that contact. Newspapers in other countries, if they carry any information at all about this <Col N="884" /> country, it will be, you may be sure, information in the main that is to our detriment.  It is about something sensational that has happened in this country and the unfortunate thing is that those who get only the sensational are inclined to think that the sensational is the normal, as it is the only information that they get.  They get some wrong impressions of this country just as we might, for instance, get a wrong impression of a city like Chicago from the way in which certain happenings in that city were depicted here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the accidental circumstance, due to the nature of news, that it is only sensational things as a rule that are sent abroad, there is the fact that in the past there has been deliberate propaganda against our country.  It was one of the means by which the Power that held this country in the past tried to justify its hold on it.  For that reason we are in a worse position than most people would be. Surely, then, it is to our interest to keep in touch with our people abroad who, we can believe, will be, of all others, the most understanding and sympathetic to our cause.  We will have a good case in our fight for liberty.  We had a good case in fighting for the amount of liberty we have got and we will have an equally good case in fighting for the rest of it.  Surely that is a reason why we should see that our contacts with our people abroad should not be cut.  These contacts in the past were largely maintained by the fact that new people were going every year from this country into these other countries. They were able to supply our exiles abroad with up-to-date information as to feeling at home, but that channel of information is rapidly drying up.  There are not so many of our people nowadays going to these countries which were most sympathetic to us in the past and for that reason you are not going to have the same freshening of contacts as you had in the past.  Again, that emphasises the need of having some substitute.</P>
    <P>I know of no substitute except one which will reflect life in this country as it is, and enable our people to keep in contact with our culture.  Our people abroad like to have the same sort of <Col N="885" /> entertainments as we have here.  They have their céilidhthe, their Irish songs and their Irish dances.  They are interested in all these things because of their roots in this country.  I happened to be abroad when it was announced that the project for this broadcasting station was to be abandoned and I may tell you that there was a sense of despair amongst these people because they had been looking forward to it as a means of renewing their contacts with the motherland.  They had, as I say, looked forward to it and now they find that the hopes that they had cherished are all to be destroyed. Again, I appeal to the Government to reconsider this decision and to realise that they should not postpone the setting up of this station for one day, not to speak of one year.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of radio to deal with Partition has been raised. Deputy Esmonde reminded me of a remark I made in interruption here on one occasion on that subject.  If he will look back on it, he will find that the interruption was made in a debate on an Emergency Powers Bill here in 1940.  I do not know if the matter was ever raised since.  My anxiety at that particular time, above all others, was to see that this country was not going to get involved in the war.  It was not an easy task.  This Government, if it has to deal with a situation like that in future, will probably realise how difficult that task was and can be.</P>
    <P>I had to ask myself whether at that particular time the use of the radio here, such as we had at our disposal, could be wisely allowed for that purpose. I felt it would be a hopeless instrument for that purpose because the moment we started, you might as well have an old blunderbuss challenging a machine-gun.  There was no point in starting a contest of that sort at that particular time.  The whole world was poisoned against you, even if you could get it out but we had no other means at our disposal.  The Deputy has given me the quotation and I have seen it.  I asked him at that time&mdash;it was a most extraordinary situation in which it was brought in&mdash;how it could be shown that it could bring Partition to an end.  He could only <Col N="886" /> answer that it would help.  Later on he explained that his idea was that every time Britain explained what her war aims were, we could belch&mdash;I think that was the word used or some other word like it&mdash;our statements with regard to the Six-County position and so on.  I do not think that it would have helped us at that particular time to do that.  But I did not say at any time, as far as I know&mdash;if I did I cannot understand it because it would not have represented my thought&mdash;that a proper radio system could not be used. I used it myself, such as it was, when I got a chance to speak to the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that I have only begun to talk about Partition now.  There is not a word of truth in that.  I could give day and date, even during the war, when I spoke about it, even in public utterances, and, mind you, during the war there was not very much use in talking about Partition outside the country. Here at home, nobody needs to talk about it.  As far as this part of Ireland is concerned, I take it that 90 per cent. of our people would vote for the abolition of Partition if they were given a chance.  If Partition were put to a plebiscite, the people, as far as this part of the country is concerned, I have not the slightest doubt would vote for its abolition by a huge majority.  Probably they are more unanimous on that than on any other single question that could be put to them, so that there was no object in speaking to our own people about Partition.  What we have got to do is to get a proper public understanding abroad of the situation and a proper understanding of it in the Six Counties themselves.  There is not a single Party in this part of the country that would stand for a continuation of Partition.  There is no doubt where our people stand on that matter.  What is the point then in using the radio if you have to deal only with our own people here at home? Some people might say that you could use it for Britain.  As I said before, in regard to that you were going to use it in the worst possible conditions.  I am not against it.  I say that the time has come when every effort must be <Col N="887" /> made and that it is a good time to make it.  I certainly will not now, any more than I did when I was on the other side of the House, find fault with anybody who comes forward and puts a case against Partition before the world.  I think that every good Irishman will welcome the putting of that case.</P>
    <P>I believe that if you are being attacked you certainly have got to defend yourself to the best of your ability.  I do not listen very often to the radio.  Unfortunately, I have not got the time very often, but I am told that a campaign has been started elsewhere. We must answer that campaign. There is one thing as regards Partition at the present time and it is that a myth has been established, and we have go to explode that myth and to make it clear to the world what really is the case as far as the Six Counties are concerned.  An attempt has been made to try and create the impression abroad that we have here two nations occupying two separate territories, and that, therefore, there is a justification for separating them. Of course, everybody knows that is not true.  There is the suggestion that you have a homogeneous population in the Six Counties.  Everybody knows that is not true.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not wish to transgress the rules of order. Coming back to the radio, it may be necessary to use it if other people, by means of their broadcasting system, have been spreading wrong information. If other people have been doing that, it may be necessary for us to use it in order that people may get the truth.  From the point of view then of the immediate situation and from the point of view of cultural contacts and <Col N="888" /> of the people who are our friends abroad and who have an affection for this country, the decision, in my opinion, to abandon the short-wave broadcasting station is bad, and I would ask the Government not to be guilty of what is, in my opinion, national madness in this particular matter.  If it is simply a postponement, why should they not ask themselves the question: &ldquo;Why should we even postpone it with the condition of the world as it is to-day?&rdquo;  I cannot do more than repeat what, I think, Deputy Lemass has said, that from the speeches that have been made in this House it must be obvious to the Government from what has been said by everybody who has spoken that the concensus of opinion is that this short-wave broadcasting station should be established with all possible speed.  To those who while arguing for it and its desirability have finally said: &ldquo;Very well, we have to depend on the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; I would simply say: ask the Minister for Finance and those people to consider that it has been proved time after time that some of these decisions, taken on the basis of a narrow financial interest, have been, in the long run, even financially unsound, and that in the long run, where a case could be made for them, they are not good national policy.  For these reasons I would ask the Government again to reconsider its decision.</P>

      <P>I think I should say a few words on this subject.  The discussion on the Estimate has mainly centred round the short-wave radio station.  I should like to make it perfectly clear that, in my opinion, in view of conditions as they are at the moment, it is necessary that a short-wave radio station should be established. I was pleased to hear to-day from the Minister that the decision of the Government has not been a decision to abandon but a decision to postpone. If there has been reconsideration of that aspect of the question, I want to join in the appeals that have been made to the Government to reconsider this matter at once and to go ahead with the completion of this short-wave radio station.  Now, not only am I supported by the observations that have <Col N="889" /> been made in this House to-day, but I feel that I am strongly supported by the expressions of opinion that were given at the Ard-Fheis of Clann na Poblachta when I was a member. These expressions were clear, specific and definite that it was wrong to think of abandoning this short-wave radio station.</P>
      <P>If this motion is pressed to a division, I want to make it clear that I will vote for the motion as a specific and clear indication to the Government of my views that this short-wave radio project should be proceeded with as soon as possible.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy Lemass say that a decision unfavourable to the Government on this motion would not be considered as a vote of no confidence in the Government. I think that makes it simple and easy for Deputies like myself who believe that, in the general national interest, it is necessary that this present Government should be maintained in office for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>On the general subject of the radio, I want to express a personal point of view.  I have been surprised for some considerable time to see that the radio is being used for the propagation of gambling.  I think that the radio has many useful purposes to serve but I do not think it is right that a portion of the time should be devoted each night to advising the people of this country what horses they ought to back the following morning. I think it is wrong.  I have no objection in the world to people gambling, but I have a definite objection to the radio being used in this way.  If that is not encouragement of gambling I do not know what is.  It is my viewpoint for what it is worth and I take this opportunity of expressing it in the House.</P>
      <P>I did not speak on the other Estimates introduced by the Minister and I would like to take this opportunity of saying that my experience, since the present Minister became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has been that there has been no more courteous or no more approachable Minister and I join with the other Deputies who wish the Minister success in his period of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite a deal of talk in connection with the short-wave station.  I do not think that anybody in the House can deny that the appeals made to the Government for the immediate putting into operation of this short-wave station could be classed as anything other than sincere and, in the opinions of those who made them, in the best interests of the nation.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the Estimate which was prepared before the present Government came into office.  If you go through this year's Estimate carefully, you will find that the total amount required to put into operation the short-wave station is £5,790.  I have gone through the Estimates. Licences bring in £122,000 and advertisements £66,000, bringing the total to £188,000.  The cost of salaries, wages and allowances is £101,970; the cost of programmes £59,850; musical instruments, etc., £3,200&mdash;I am reading what is in the Estimate&mdash;travelling expenses, £6,500; light, power, etc., £12,095; plant and equipment £60,890; miscellaneous items £1,045, and for the maintenance of a short-wave station, £5,790.  So, surely to goodness, it cannot be argued that withholding progress to complete the short-wave station can be based on economies.  In early references to the short-wave station it was classed together with the transatlantic air services; megalomania was going to be brought into check and the air services, Aerlinte, were to be stopped as well as the short-wave station.  It was doubtless in the minds of people abroad and of Deputies in the House that the intention was to abandon the station.  That is clear from what Deputy Cowan said of the discussion about it at the Clann na Poblachta Árd-Fheis.  It is now suggested that it is not intended to abandon the station in the sense of closing it down, but of putting the operation of it into abeyance.  In view of the almost negligible saving which accrues even to the Department, let alone to the State, the expenditure is no excuse for not going on with this scheme.</P>

      <P>The debate has entered into two subjects, programmes and the <Col N="891" /> short-wave station.  Deputies have suggested that we should have a second programme from the Cork station, but they have overlooked the fact that we have an international agreement limiting the power we can use and this prevents us from putting on programmes from Cork that reach the whole nation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little mentioned the concert hall, pointing out that he had made arrangements for the erection of a concert hall.  This would be all to the good here in the City of Dublin and very necessary if we were living in normal times.  He had only a sketch plan of that concert hall, however, and it came into the Estimate of another Department.  It was estimated to cost £500,000 and that matter was deferred. If we are to go in for building schemes, our first duty should be to provide sanatoria for the poor patients in the country who are in need of them, and houses for those who have no accommodation and not go in for luxury hotels or fancy building such as cinemas or halls.  An earnest effort should first be made to break the back of the problem of providing buildings which are urgently needed. I am sure Deputy Little will agree.</P>

      <P>Deputies have spoken in connection with civil servants.  It is regrettable that charges can be made, and made freely, in this House against civil servants who are not in a position to defend themselves.  Those civil servants were appointed by the previous Government and I never interfered with one of them.  I took them over knowing that they were civil servants who had not been appointed through political influence but merely as capable and efficient officers ready and willing to give good and loyal service.  What is the charge against <Col N="892" /> them?  If it is the person that I have in mind, surely to God we have not become less humorous than our ancestors.  Is it because we come as Deputies to this House that articles cannot be written criticising us and that we can say that civil servants are acting contrary to what is fair play?  I told the person I have in mind that I was not concerned if he put the whole Government in kilts, provided that he worked well in my Department and gave satisfactory service.  I do not want to take his freedom from any individual and it was the policy of the Government coming in to give fair play to all sections of the community. There is no specific charge made against that individual&mdash;I am only assuming that what he put in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> has been criticised so much to-night.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins and others put a number of other points that it would be impossible to deal with seriatim, so I will take that bone of contention, the short-wave station.  I heard Deputy Aiken&mdash;and I am surprised at him&mdash; making a case for the necessity of it this year.  I am not against the short-wave station.  I would have several short-wave and television stations if necessary if we were living in normal times, but Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, as well as Deputy Little when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, opposed this short-wave station.</P>

      <P>Some of the back benchers may not be aware of the arguments put up at the conference last year as to why Ireland should not have a short-wave station.  I am not prepared to go cap in hand, nor am I prepared to send any Irishman cap in hand, for what we believe are our rights.  If the International Conference is still in existence, we will send representatives to fight for our rights and I believe that the attitude we have taken up might mean that we will get some of our rights sooner than we would if we went there determined that we were going to have the station, whether or not we got a wavelength.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put up here to-night in favour of the short-wave station was that it could be used in time of emergency.  Do Deputies not know that with the powerful stations of <Col N="894" /> Germany, Russia and even America, we could be bottled up inside an hour, even if we had a short-wavelength? That being so, when we were faced with Estimates to the amount of £88,000,000, I was asked how I could make economies.  Our concern was to increase the old age pensioners' allowance and to give the old man and his wife at least 35/- per week in the evening of their days, to provide the beds in sanatoria for which people were appealing through charitable organisations and public bodies, and houses for those people in Dublin who were living in condemned houses and slums.  That was the problem that we were faced with and, if the Deputy were faced with a similar problem, I am certain that he would decide to postpone the expenditure of £50,000 or £100,000 this year on a short-wave station and spend the money instead on the relief of poverty and destitution in the country.</P>
      <P>When we have provided these social services for our people, when we will have increased the old age pensioners' allowances and have enabled them to live in frugal comfort, let us have our short-wave station and tell our friends in New Zealand that the people here have a scheme of social services similar to that which they enjoy.  Let us then tell our friends in America and other parts of the world that the pensions of their kith and kin here have been increased to enable them to live in frugal comfort.  When we have these good tidings to tell our people, we can proceed, next year or the following year, with the short-wave station and give these tidings to our kith and kin abroad.  As I have explained, the station remains intact, but there will be no programme this year.  Deputy de Valera has argued that it is necessary to have programmes and he says that the money can be easily found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said it was all a question of money.  Every case a Minister puts up is a question of money.  Where were we to get the money for this purpose?  Either by charging increased licence fees to the people at home to pay for foreign propaganda <Col N="895" /> who would not be getting the two programmes which have been advocated from all sides of the House or by taxation.  We are not in a position, as Deputy Little well knows, to give two programmes at present.  We have not got the frequencies and have not been allocated a wavelength by the International Conference of which we are members.</P>
      <P>As regards the short-wave station, the ex-Ministers know that if we had it to-morrow, we could not use it to advocate the removal of Partition. They know the arguments which had to be put up at the International Conference and they know that we could not put up as an argument designed to secure the support of other countries that we proposed to advocate the removal of Partition, being dependent as we were on their votes.  They know that that was not the argument put up last year and I do not think it is an argument which any of our representatives can put up.  We have at the same time our own views and every Irishman is against Partition.  I believe that every man, no matter which side of the House he sits on, will use all his powers in an effort to remove that canker.</P>

      <P>I believe it is better, for this year, at least, to do all we can in the matter of improving the lot of our people than to spend £50,000 or £100,000 on a short-wave station for which we have no wavelength.  If we get the wavelength, then it will be be another day's work.  There have been references to two programmes and to many other things which are necessary.  With these I agree, if we had the money.  I am not in a position to say that we can give two programmes. We have not got a wavelength, but it may be that, by next year, following the conference in Copenhagen we may be in a position to secure a wavelength for a double programme. The money must be provided either by increased licence fees or through taxation.  There are only two ways of getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said he saw no reason why we could not have the short-wave station this year.  Did not he know very well that the wavelength must be authorised by the International Committee?  Attacks have been made on the deputy director of broadcasting.  The deputy director is under the control of the Director of Broadcasting and the news editor is under the complete control of the Director of Broadcasting.  Therefore, it is with the authority and approval <Col N="897" /> of the Director of Broadcasting that the matters that have been complained of have taken place.</P>
    <P>I have to thank Deputies for the way in which they have conducted this debate.  As I have said, it is different from the other debates that have taken place, but I would ask Deputies not to be led away by the appeal made by Deputy Lemass or Deputy Little or the other suggestion that we are against the establishment of a short-wave station.  I have stated that we have merely postponed it for this year. In view of the serious financial position, we considered it much more important, as we had not got a wavelength from the International Committee, to spend the money on the social services I have outlined.  If this station is still in existence, we will send representatives in the autumn to the conference in Mexico City and I hope then that we will be able to retain the station.  If we retain it, even without the wavelength, it is my intention to put on a programme for a short time each day.</P>
    <P>There has been misunderstanding. We should not allow anything to happen which would not be in the interests of the country as a whole.  As I have pointed out, there are very serious problems in connection with social services and there are thousands of pounds that can be saved this year by the elimination of unnecessary expenditure or by postponing certain expenditure for a few years.  That is the reason we have postponed the building of the concert hall, the building of the broadcasting station, and other buildings in the Post Office.  We want to concentrate all our effort, material and skilled labour on providing the <Col N="898" /> homes which all members of the House desire to see every Irishman occupying.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £115,860 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will <Col N="901" /> come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924), including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>There is also a Supplementary Estimate for £6,585, which was introduced this morning.  With the permission of the Chair, I propose, if this course is convenient to the House, that the two Estimates be discussed together.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the matters which from strictly part of the Estimates for my Department, there are certain considerations that I should like to urge upon the House generally. Since the inception of our Parliamentary institutions I do not think it can be said that our constitutional or Parliamentary development has been a normal one.  Many issues of fundamental importance from time to time stirred the embers of the civil war and aroused a good deal of bitterness. This was to a large extent an inevitable sequel to the events that occurred.  It had the drawback of leading to heated controversy, leading often to unreasoned criticism.  Therefore, I should like to appeal to all sections of the House for a new approach in the consideration of issues that come before the House.  Instead of approaching problems from the point of view of scoring either personal or Party advantages, I would appeal to the House to approach them from a constructive point of view.  In making this appeal I am quite prepared to grant freely that destructive criticism comes from all sides of the House.  I think that a greater degree of co-operation and a greater degree of deliberation in the criticism that is made would be welcomed by the country and would help to achieve a greater measure of common good.</P>
    <P>Our Parliamentary traditions are very short and they have been stormy. A time has been reached when we should be able to be more deliberate and more constructive in our approach. I am not suggesting that Deputies should not criticise or should not express their views freely.  I am suggesting that, as far as possible, they <Col N="902" /> should try to do so in the most constructive manner possible.  In no sphere of debate or in no sphere of Governmental activity is this more important than in the sphere of our external affairs.  Whatever political differences we may have among ourselves, we as a nation must be united in our dealings with the rest of the world.  I should like to feel while I hold this post that in speaking to other nations and in helping to shape the external policy of this country, I am doing so with the full support of every section of this House irrespective of Party difference.  The more this is possible, the more our national position will be strengthened, the more our voice will count in the world.</P>
    <P>Unanimity and co-operation in external affairs will also help to increase the self-confidence of our own people in relation to problems connected with external affairs.  Generally speaking, it is the function of the Department I represent in this House to be the voice of Ireland abroad.  It is my desire that this function should be carried out by my Department on a broad national basis without regard to any differences based on matters of internal policy.  I should like to make it clear to this House that I shall always welcome any suggestion, any advice or any help that any Deputy can give me in the carrying out of my duties.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary institutions of some countries provide for a committee on foreign affairs.  I do not know whether it would be possible within the existing framework of our Parliamentary institutions to make such a provision here.  It is a matter that might well be considered at some future date.  But, in the meanwhile, I shall always be glad to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition or with the leaders of any of the Parties in this House any matters relating to the external affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot, in the time available for my estimates, discuss the international situation, beyond saying that it is far from satisfactory.  It is a sad commentary on the development of human civilisation that, after the most destructive war of history has just concluded, <Col N="903" /> the possibility&mdash;it may be a remote possibility, but it is a possibility&mdash;of armed conflict should again have to be envisaged by the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we are pledged, by our Constitution, to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations, on a basis of international justice and morality.  It is the policy of the Government, therefore, to do anything it can to assist in the maintenance of peace.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of the present situation in Europe is that a number of nations have, willingly or unwillingly, aligned themselves behind an ideology that takes little or no cognisance of the elementary principles of democracy and personal liberty.  I have no doubt that, if democratic institutions were allowed to work freely throughout the countries of Europe, none of them would willingly pursue a path that would lead to war.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are not much troubled by conflicting ideologies.  We are firm believers in democracy in its true sense and are firmly attached to the principles of Christianity.  Our sympathies, therefore, lie clearly with the nations of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been made recently in support of a plan to form a United States of Europe.  While these plans are still in their preliminary stages and have not got the official backing of the Governments of Europe, it might be well that we in Ireland should begin to think about these plans. It is clear that with the development of transport communication and science generally, isolationism is no longer possible.  If another disaster&mdash;which this time might well mean the complete annihilation of Europe&mdash;is to be averted, it is obvious that some form of world organisation is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Organisation has not so far provided a solution.  The mere fact that, in the present crisis, it does not appear to have taken any effective steps to resolve the present crisis is, in itself, an indication of its failure.  The fact, too, that we have been excluded from it demonstrates that its mechanism is open to abuse. In this connection I should mention that, at some time in the near future, <Col N="904" /> it may become necessary that the Government should consider whether our application for membership of the United Nations Organisation should not be withdrawn.  I have delayed in bringing this matter formally before the Government and the Dáil as I did not wish, in the present situation, to take any steps that would indicate a lack of faith in any attempt that was being made to discuss world problems at a conference table.  No matter how abortive or fruitless such conferences may prove, it is still the only way of avoiding conflict.  The more representatives of different nations meet to discuss their problems, the greater the possibility of reaching understanding and peaceful solutions.</P>
    <P>A start has been made in the direction of a united states of Europe in the economic sphere by the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.  This organisation has undertaken its work in a businesslike and constructive manner.  If it continues to progress in the same direction, it may well form a nucleus around which economic co-operation throughout the whole of Europe can be planned.</P>
    <P>If the countries of Europe are all prepared to surrender a certain small fraction of their sovereignty, then a United States of Europe could become a practical possibility, in the political as well as in the economic sphere.</P>
    <P>This movement for a United States of Europe is the result of the realisation that, unless something tangible is done to remove the causes of war, the world will again drift towards self-destruction.  I feel, however, that what is really more important than the creation of international machinery is the creation of an ideal of peace, based on the recognition of certain fundamental democratic rights.  Materialism and expediency, coupled with fear and intolerance, have been the dominating influences in European politics.  It is essential that the people of Europe should be given some hope, based on faith and idealism.  For us, this is relatively easy, because our attachment to Christian principles gives us that faith and idealism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> Because of our desire for peace, because of our belief that man has a higher function to fulfil than to act as a cog in a flywheel, and because of our close relationship with the Western Hemisphere, we should be able to play an important rôle in Europe.  Our usefulness in this respect is largely nullified by the fact that we ourselves suffer from an injustice, in that our country is artificially divided against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its people.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with Partition at any length in this debate, but I think that I should take this occasion to emphasise the importance of this issue.  The continuance of Partition precludes us from taking our rightful place in the affairs of Europe.  I believe that the British Government and people are approaching the realisation that the statesmanlike policy lies in the direction of securing the complete friendship and co-operation of this island; the realisation that a united and a free Ireland is as essential to Britain's welfare as it is to Ireland's. We, on our part, want to hold out the hand of friendship to Britain, but so long as Partition remains, it will inevitably mar the relationship between our two islands.  We want, and are quite prepared, to bury the past provided that the present holds out a realisation of our right to national selfdetermination. The wise and statesmanlike approach on Britain's part is to assist in the removal of this sore and of all other reminders of the unhappy history of our past relationships.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties that we have to contend with in relation to Partition is that, to Britain, it is only one of many problems; it is always easier to shelve a problem&mdash;especially an uncomfortable one.  I should like to urge upon the statesmen of Great Britain the very real urgency and importance of this problem from our point of view. It has often been said, and I think it is commonplace even in English political circles, that the tragedy of Anglo-Irish relationship lies in the fact that the British realisation of the realities of our problems always came too late. Nothing can be gained by delaying the <Col N="906" /> adoption of a statesmanlike approach to this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Two points emerge now possibly more clearly than ever before; firstly, the artificial division of our national territory is something that no generation of Irishmen and that no Irish Government will ever acquiesce in or accept.  Secondly, that so long as it continues, Partition will constitute a definite obstacle to the kind of relationship between Ireland and Britain, which it is in the interest, not merely of the two countries, but of the world as a whole, to bring about.</P>
    <P>In earlier debates in this House I have already referred to the economic disadvantages that result from the continued division of our country&mdash; economic disadvantages that affect the welfare of our people on both sides of the Border.  If we, in the Twenty-Six Counties have, in the present situation, to be a drain on the resources of the United States or on the dollar resources of the sterling area reserve it is due, practically entirely, to the fact that the industrial arm of our country has been amputated.  On the other hand, our people in the Six North - Eastern Counties have to undergo very heavy taxation and shortages, because they are cut off from the agricultural arm of their own country.  A very large proportion of their exports remain unrequited, while they are deprived of substantial markets for their own goods in the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been urged that the reunification of Ireland would, in some way, adversely affect the industrial potential of the Six Counties; that the shipyards or other heavy industries would be hit. I do not think that this would be so, and I feel certain that we would all be prepared to satisfy our Six-County friends on this issue.  The industrial potential of the Six Counties is of as much importance to a united Ireland as it is to Britain.  On the contrary, our markets would provide them with an additional outlet; I think, too, that we might be of some assistance in helping the sale of Irish linen abroad. I think that complaints would be far more likely to come from some of our industrialists down here who would <Col N="907" /> fear competition from Belfast.  I have great respect and admiration for the business and industrial genius of our fellow-countrymen in the North-East. Their enterprise and competition would, I think, benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that if Partition were ended, the religious and civil liberties of the people in the Six Counties would, in some way be endangered.  I do not know whether this is a real or an argumentative view, but in either event, I feel I am expressing the unanimous view of this House in saying that we would be prepared to give them any additional constitutional guarantees that might be reasonably required to lay these fears to rest. There are ample safeguards in our Constitution as regards religious and civil liberties.  I am certain that we would not hesitate to strengthen these if necessary, to meet their viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need dwell more on the question of Partition beyond saying that every section of the community in the Twenty-Six Counties would welcome the representatives of our lost counties, be they Catholic or Protestant, Republican or Unionist, into this House.  We have three things in common, which are fundamental, especially in this troubled era: firstly, we all believe in a mode of life founded on Christian principles; secondly, we are all firm believers in democracy, and in the principles of civil liberty; and lastly, but not leastly, we are all Irish, and, I think, all proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Partition, I have already dealt with the major problem of Anglo-Irish relationship.  Apart from this major problem, I am glad to be able to tell the House that since the Estimates of my Department last came up for consideration, there has been an improvement in the mutual feelings between our two countries.  Not least in helping to promote a better understanding have been the steps which are being taken by the British Government to remove some of the startling conflicts of nationality law that existed between our two countries.  Under British law, as it has existed hitherto, <Col N="908" /> our citizens were regarded as British subjects, whereas, of course, the position under Irish law was guided by our Constitution and by our own Nationality Act.</P>
    <P>A very serious effort to meet our viewpoint was made by Mr. Attlee's Government and embodied in the Bill which has just passed the British House of Commons.  Some of the provisions of the Bill, as passed by the Commons, still fall considerably short of our viewpoint; such, for instance, as the imposition of a non-Irish status on our fellow countrymen in the Six Counties and the clauses dealing with the retention of British nationality. However, the provisions of the Bill, as adopted by the Commons, constitute a vast improvement on the position that has existed hitherto.</P>
    <P>I welcome the advent of this Bill as a constructive step that has already helped to form a link in the chain of better relationship between our two islands.  Its importance lies, perhaps, not so much in its actual practical effects as in the indication it gives of a real desire to understand our viewpoint. Therefore, despite the infirmities which it may still possess <i>vis-á-vis</i> our point of view, I heartily welcome it as a piece of constructive and statesmanlike legislation that can only improve the relationships between our two islands.</P>
    <P>I hasten to say that my welcome to this Bill is limited, of course, to it, in the form in which it left the House of Commons.  I do not think that it would be proper for me to discuss the details of this Bill or the amendments which were introduced in the House of Lords and subsequently removed by the House of Commons, but I think I can say, without impropriety, that the amendments introduced in the House of Lords, if adopted, would entirely nullify the good effect this measure would otherwise have on Anglo-Irish relationship.  I sincerely hope that the majority in the House of Lords will appreciate the importance of not destroying the value and constructiveness of this step towards a better relationship. I hesitated to deal with this matter in this debate, but decided to do so, as I was made aware that the <Col N="909" /> Opposition and Deputies in this House were anxious to have the Government's viewpoint.  I am glad to be able to add that there is a complete identity of views held by the last Government and the present Government in relation to this matter.  The views of the last Government and of the present Government were, of course, communicated to the British Government.</P>
    <P>It might, perhaps, be well, that I should refer to a misconception which seems to exist in some quarters in Great Britain.  This misconception is not prevalent, but it does exist and I should like to dispel it in so far as I can.  It is that the dominant factor in our political relations with Great Britain is a feeling of traditional ill-will towards that country and towards its people.  That is the reverse of the truth.  No people has shown itself more ready to lay aside resentments once their causes were removed than our people.  It would be more true to say that there is a great fund of potential goodwill towards Britain in this country; that there is a keen perception among our people of the community of interest that exists between our two countries; that there is a general feeling of sympathy and even admiration aroused by the manner in which the people of Britain faced adversity during the war and are courageously now undertaking the rebuilding of their economy.  The difficulties in our relations arise, not from any out-worn prejudice or from any barren hatreds, but rather from concrete obstacles such as Partition and such as any short-sighted efforts to retain out-worn forms of a past era that can only serve as an unfortunate reminder of an unhappy and tragic history.</P>
    <P>If we are to create a sound framework of our relations with Britain, it must be appreciated that what matters is the substance and not the form of the relationship.  Political forms have sense and usefulness only in so far as they express political realities.  Out-worn forms which are only reminders of a historically unhappy past can only act as irritants.  As irritants, they endanger and frustrate the relationship which they are intended to express and preserve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The British Crown may well be a traditional rallying point for the people of Britain, Australia, New Zealand or Canada.  If I were an Englishman, or an Australian, I probably would feel considerable attachment to the British Crown and would attach value to the traditional forms that go with it.  The descendants of the British pioneers that built the present Commonwealth under a common crown may take an understandable pride in their common British origin.  They may well choose to express their association by adopting forms that are part and parcel of British constitutional history.  We in no way criticise their views.  They are quite understandable.  But there is no parallel between the history of the Commonwealth countries and the history of our country.  We are a small country with a very different history; a history which has been one of continual struggle for survival as a nation. We take pride in our history, in our culture, in our race and in our nation. We resent anything that takes away from that pride of nationhood or race.</P>
    <P>We want to be friendly with our big neighbour, not merely because she is a big neighbour, but because we have many things in common.  The Crown and outward forms that belong to British constitutional history are merely reminders of an unhappy past that we want to bury, that have no realities for us and only serve as irritants.  I have said all these things frankly as I feel that a clear understanding of this position can only help to bring about more real co-operation. An examination of the history of the last quarter of a century will, I think, show that many of these forms in the past only served to prevent closer understanding.</P>
    <P>We have very close relationships, indeed, with many great countries that are far more distant from us, such as the United States, Canada and Australia.  Millions of our people have lived and settled in these countries. No question of forms enter into our relationship with them, yet our relationship is always most friendly and useful.</P>
    <P>I have spent some considerable time in dealing with our relationship with <Col N="911" /> Britain because of my desire to bring about a realisation of our viewpoint to the people in Britain.  Our relationship with the United States is so obviously close and friendly that I hardly need refer to it.  By reason of the close ties that exist between our two nations, that relationship can only grow and improve.  I am glad to say that in every country where we have diplomatic missions, our relationship is an extremely happy one.</P>
    <P>We have recently opened a Legation in the Argentine and, I am glad to be able to inform the House that, in the very near future, we shall welcome in our midst an Argentine Minister Plenipotentiary, who will open, on behalf of his Government, an Argentine Legation in Dublin.  I would like to take this opportunity of according him a welcome as the representative of a country that has many ties with us.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to be able to inform the House that, with the co-operation of the Department of Finance, I am in a position to present a Supplementary Estimate to enable the opening to be made of a Legation to the Netherlands at The Hague.  I feel that this is somewhat overdue.  Our trade relationship with the Netherlands has increased considerably in recent years. The Netherlands have been represented by a Consular representative here since 1923 and they have been represented, following the opening of a Legation here, by a <i>Chargé-d' Affaires</i> since 1945.  I feel it is somewhat overdue that we should reciprocate.</P>
    <P>Our participation on the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation has brought us into much closer and more friendly contact with the 15 other nations of Europe which are also on the council.  That contact, I think, has been useful and it will prove useful in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the Estimates in any detail, but I shall be pleased to give any information that any Deputy may seek in the course of the debate.  There is a net increase of £12,100 on the main Estimate compared with last year.  This is not due so much to any extension of staff as to purely automatic factors and accountancy <Col N="912" /> changes.  Nearly £4,000 of the increase is due to the charge to this Vote for the first time of the salaries of staffs that have been borrowed and which were previously defrayed out of the Estimates for other Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the amount of the External Affairs Vote should call for any apology or defence from any Minister for External Affairs in this House.  Any idea that our expenditure on external affairs is extravagant or disproportionate is completely untrue. Relatively to our resources, we spend less on external affairs than practically any other country in the world. We certainly spend a good deal less than any other country in Europe. Our expenditure on external affairs is less than one-third of 1 per cent. of the total public expenditure.  Of each £1 that comes into the Exchequer, less than ¾d. is spent on our foreign affairs.  The whole Department of External Affairs, including officials in Dublin and our Diplomatic and Consular representatives abroad, costs less than the staff of the British Embassy at Cairo, Bagdad, Ankara or Teheran.  That will give the House an idea of the smallness of our Department. The whole Department, including our representatives abroad, costs less than the British Embassy at Cairo.</P>
    <P>We have relaxed as far as we could the wartime arrangements in relation to travel restrictions.  A simpler system for the issue of travel identity cards, through the police, took its place.  The change simplifies matters for the public and makes things much easier for the officials concerned.  Prior to that change, the Department was issuing permits at the rate of 60,000 a year.  Passports showed a return to normality.  In the year 1947-48 the Department issued 14,843 passports as compared with 6,273 the year before&mdash; that is more than double the number issued the year before.  In the previous year the total number of passports was 1,635.  Passports are being issued at the rate roughly of 70 or 80 a day.  A considerable number of passports are for people proceeding to overseas destinations such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and mission fields abroad such as China and Africa.  A <Col N="913" /> large number are for people travelling on business or for educational or health reasons.</P>
    <P>There has been a corresponding increase in the number of visas issued by our various missions abroad.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the war, agreements to end the necessity for visas have been entered into with a number of countries, mostly Western European countries, particularly Norway, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  As a result, our citizens can travel to these countries without having to get visas, and citizens of these countries can come here without visas from us.  Judging by the number of visas issued in the United States by our consuls and diplomatic representatives, the number of American citizens coming over here is showing an increase.  The Consul-General in New York has recently reported that his visa issues are 50 per cent. higher than they were at the corresponding period last year.  That is of some importance from the point of view of earning dollars.</P>
    <P>Provision was also made for the appointment of some honorary consuls in a number of countries in all parts of the world where we had no representatives. The absence of representatives in such countries has often led to embarrassment and difficulties as it meant that we had to rely on the representatives of other countries to attend to the needs of our own citizens.  We have tried to get over this by appointing some honorary consuls.  They do not get a salary.  They take on the position in an honorary capacity and get sums, varying from £100 to £150 per annum to cover postage, office and general expenses.  We have appointed one such honorary consul in Beirut with jurisdiction in the Lebanon and Syria.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Irish citizens residing in the Middle East, and in view of conditions there, we felt there should be an Irish consular representative within possible reach.  We have appointed another honorary consul in New Orleans.  There is a considerable number of Irish citizens in New Orleans, in Louisiana, and in the surrounding cities.  Previously they had <Col N="914" /> to go to Chicago to obtain consular facilities.</P>
    <P>We propose to raise consular fees and charges for passports in the near future, but I am not in a position to give the Dáil at the moment the final list of these charges.  Passports at present are charged for at 12/6 each. It is proposed to raise the charge to £1 or £1 1s. 0d.  We feel that that will not impose any serious burden or in any way curtail travel.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputies realise that the Department of External Affairs earns a very considerable amount of money for the nation by assisting to recover the estates of intestates who die in America, by acting for the next of kin, by finding the next of kin and by following up the estate.  For the last 12-months period for which we have figures, the sum realised in that way amounted approximately to £100,000.  The amount varies from year to year. These are important figures because these sums usually come from America and mean the transfer of certain dollar balances.</P>
    <P>Now, I have touched generally on the position of the economic co-operation organisation which has its headquarters in Paris.  Part of the Supplementary Vote which I am asking the House to agree to is in relation to the appointment of staffs for the European recovery programme.  This economic co-operation organisation has grown very considerably.  It has branched into a great many committees.  I am glad to say that one national representative is chairman of the committee dealing with food and agriculture. There are numerous committees sitting the whole time, and it is essential that we should, as far as possible, be represented on these committees, and keep in touch with the developments taking place.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, all the work of co-ordinating the programmes of the 16 participating countries will take place in Paris.  Each country will formulate its own programmes and its own requirements from the Western Hemisphere. These programmes will then all go to Paris and be sorted out there. On examination, it will probably be <Col N="915" /> found that a great many of these programmes will have to be cut down and that Europe's total requirements exceed the availability of certain goods in the Western Hemisphere.  Then it becomes necessary to make the programmes fit each other.  The purpose of the economic committee's organisation in Paris is to ensure that everything that can be produced and obtained in Europe will be produced and obtained in Europe rather than be imported from the Western Hemisphere so as to ensure, as far as possible, the free distribution of those commodities that are in short supply in Europe.  All that entails a tremendous amount of work.  We have, so far, been inclined to man these various committees by sending officials from the Department here to represent us.  This has meant a considerable amount of travelling to and fro, and had the double defect, on the one hand, of leaving us very short-handed here, and on the other hand, of not securing continuity in the work which was being done on the committees in Paris.  Therefore, we are providing and propose that there should be one <i>Chargé Affaires</i> in Paris who will deal exclusively with European recovery programme matters in Paris in relation to the organisation for economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>That is the second portion of the Supplementary Estimate.  The other portion deals with the question of establishing our legation in the Hague. I think I mentioned in the House before that the European recovery programme has increased very considerably the work which has had to be performed in the Department of External Affairs. The work is more or less co-ordinated there, and the Department has to keep in touch with the economic administrator in America and with the organisation for economic co-operation in Paris. There are also other numerous conferences going on the whole time, and there will probably be new ones.  I have tried, as far as possible, to limit our attendance at these international conferences to conferences that we consider would be of some importance to us and to Ireland.  There is always a <Col N="916" /> tendency by very big wealthy countries to create huge organisations and to have conferences about many different matters.  This may be easy for big countries like the United States and Great Britain with unlimited resources and unlimited staffs at their disposal, but it possesses a great many difficulties for small countries like ours where our whole Department, as I told the House before is smaller than one Embassy of another country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else that I wish to add.  I shall be glad to give any information to any Deputy who may want it.  I want to repeat the offer that I made when I opened this discussion, that if at any time the leader of the Opposition or the leader of any of the other Parties in this House, wishes to discuss any matters relating to external affairs with me I shall be only too glad to do so.</P>

      <P>The time allowed for this Vote is six and a half hours.  The Minister will get an hour in which to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to note at the start that there is not in the case of this Department&mdash;this Ministry&mdash;the violent reversal of policy which is so apparent in every other case.  I would like to assure the Minister, as far as this side of the House is concerned, that we have had experience, and that we know full well how important it is in dealing with outside nations and in dealing with all external affairs that we should speak, as far as possible, with the same voice. The Minister need have no fear, therefore, that when we talk on the subject, our attitude will not be one of constructive criticism when criticism is necessary at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most serious time for all peoples.  It is a particularly serious time for peoples in small nations; it is doubly so for us seeing that we have here an old quarrel, if I may put it that way&mdash;an old source of grievance with our neighbour&mdash;that our country is divided.  That is a difficulty which is not, of course, of our making, but it is one which complicates and makes particularly difficult for us every critical <Col N="917" /> international situation.  I think it is only right that our people should begin from now on to think very seriously of the situation which may confront us.  Nobody, apparently, wants war and yet war comes, and it comes because of the fact that nations have not yet agreed upon a fundamental principle either of law or of the methods of adjusting their disputes. As the Minister pointed out, we have no system by which the disputes between nations can be resolved as the disputes between individuals are resolved within a particular nation or community.  That is the need of the world and it is a need that has not so far been supplied.  As long as there are disputes&mdash;and there will be&mdash; between nations, each one thinking it is right, so long will there be the urge to decide these disputes by means of force.</P>
    <P>We have in the world to-day a far worse situation, of course, than that which followed the first world war. After the first world war, the victors, at any rate, were able to get together and to agree that peace was desirable, that it was their duty to combine to preserve peace and to try to provide some form of organisation that would enable that to be done.  All of them may not have felt with equal intensity about the need for that, but there was in general an agreement among them and that agreement is conspicuously absent since the termination of the recent war.  It was clear almost from the beginning that there was not among the victor nations a desire to co-operate in the maintenance of peace. They apparently had different views as to what the world needed and although the United Nations Organisation was set up, it was evident to everybody who looked at it and saw its operation that there was a lack of the essential will to make it really effective.  It had in its nature, in its constitution, a number of difficulties undoubtedly, but if the will to work it were there those difficulties would be remedied long before this.</P>
    <P>Now you have an organisation that will not work, and it will not work because of the fact that the will to work is lacking.  It is quite clear that <Col N="918" /> already two groups are formed, one who apparently wants to work it in demo cracy and in peace, and the other, apparently, at least as far as any outside evidence is available to us, who does not want it to work at all.  These two groups are now arrayed, so to speak, one against the other.  It is hoped that war will not result.  The general belief is that war will not result because neither side is yet ready&mdash;I am giving expression to the common belief and I think it is desirable that expression should be given to it somewhere. The belief is that war is inevitable ultimately, but not immediately, because neither side is ready for it yet.  The question of engaging in war, however, is not one of absolute strength.  Wars take place on the basis of relative strength and war can very well occur when one side believes that at the moment anyway it is relatively stronger than the other side.</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it and it is a terrible position for the world, and the sooner our people realise what that position may mean for us the better.  It is completely wrong for the Government at the present time to act as if it were facing a peaceful situation when all the indications are the reverse.  I am not war mongering, quite far from it.  I desire to see peace, both from the point of view of human beings in general and from the point of view of our own people, but it is no use putting our head in the sand on occasions like this.  It is essential that our people from now on, if they have not already done so, should envisage the possibility of another terrible conflict similar to the one we have just gone through.  It will mean the same hardships, if not far more, and the same dangers for our people.  If it wants to do its duty by the nation, the Government at the present time ought to take steps from the beginning to provide against that possibility.  It is not a time to diminish the Army.  It is not a time for cheese-paring on certain public services essential in the national defence.  Now is the time to look ahead and whether war comes quickly or is deferred, whatever steps are taken can be taken as a matter of national insurance and should be taken as such.</P>
    <P>I have been disturbed, I must say, <Col N="919" /> by the attitude of the Government in this regard, and I hope that the Minister for External Affairs will bring home to his colleagues the seriousness of this situation.  We will have to come here and make a very serious decision, perhaps very soon, on these fundamental national matters, and I think that the people of this country should begin to think and to make up their minds as to what is going to be the result for them if this conflict should take place.  It is for that reason particularly that I appreciate some of the statements made by the Minister this evening.  I think it is important for everybody, the people of this country and people outside it, to realise that the division of our country cuts across our own national position and makes every situation that has got to be faced doubly difficult.</P>
    <P>I think I should not at this stage deal in particular with the Nationality Bill that is passing through the British House of Commons at the present moment.  I will come to deal with it later.  In the meantime, I felt that I should at the very beginning sound the note of warning as far as I can to the Ministry, to the Dáil, and to the people with regard to the dangerous situation in the world to-day.  As the Minister pointed out, we all want peace, and I sincerely hope that this situation will not develop, as it very well can develop. This situation would have meant war, in my opinion, in the past.  A spark in the present situation could create war, and I consequently think it desirable that our people should regard the situation as extremely dangerous.  It will be dangerous until some change of will is apparent, until it is evident that there is not going to be an attempt made by one set of powers to impose their will upon other peoples and that they will realise what was stated so clearly at the end of the first world war as being absolutely necessary for the peace of the world, that nations will be allowed to choose their own way, as President Wilson put it, of &ldquo;life and obedience,&rdquo; and that each nation has a right to pursue its own policy, so long as it does not interfere with other nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Self-determination was one of the aims&mdash;at least, it was one of the professed aims&mdash;of the great Powers in the first world war.  Self-determination undoubtedly for a country like ours&mdash;there was no other country in the world that had such a right to it&mdash; meant that the will of our people would be effective.  The will of our people was declared without doubt at that time, declared for freedom and complete independence and declared also in regard to the form of Government. The same principle which should have been applied to us and which would have meant peace in this country, would have meant good relations between ourselves and other countries, must be applied throughout the world, if we are to have peace.</P>
    <P>I want now to come from that plane to a much simpler one.  There are some smaller matters with which I should like to deal before dealing with the Nationality Bill, which, I am sorry to say, I do not regard with the same apparent satisfaction as the Minister. The Minister says it is unsatisfactory, but at the same time seems to indicate that everything it is possible to do to meet us has been done.  I am not quite prepared to accept that view, but I think I had better leave it over for the moment.  There are a number of things in the Estimates about which I was rather anxious to get information.  So far as the Supplementary Estimate is concerned, I have to congratulate the Minister on being able to keep the finance axe off this Vote.  I agree with him that we are not, considering the importance of this Department, over-spending in the Department.  At the same time, I think it only right that Deputies should get the fullest information with regard to any increases which may be found in the Estimates. I notice that, in the Supplementary Estimate, provision is being made for an assistant secretary and for one counsellor.  I expect that these are promotions and not new appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, yes.  I should have explained that the Department generally was reorganised to meet the increased work due to the European recovery programme.  There was one <Col N="921" /> assistant secretary before and there are now two, promoted within the Department.  There is one section dealing entirely with the European recovery programme, another with trade, and another with political information, all under the control of one assistant secretary. The other assistant secretary is in control of protocol, passports, estates and accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's view of organisation and methods of organisation may differ from mine.  My view always was&mdash;and I would hold this view for every Department&mdash;that the secretary of a Department, to the utmost extent, should be free and should not be tied to daily tasks at a desk.  My view, therefore, was that the assistant secretary would in fact be the day-to-day manager of the office, doing the work of a general routine character and any other work which might come his way.  My trouble in this case is with regard to the assistant secretaries and their co-ordination.  I may say that, if this is promotion and if the officer is the officer who would seem to be indicated from my knowledge of the Department, I would say of him that no better officer could be found and that he would be fitted for any position in the State.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, finding no fault whatever with any promotion suggested, but I do think, from the point of view of organisation, that it would present a difficulty in co-ordination.  It is obvious that there ought to be one central head through whom the general work would pass.  The Minister, I know, will be able to do that to a certain extent, but I think it desirable that as far as possible the secretary of the Department should be able to do it and, if he does, if he is used in that way, I am afraid he will not be free for the sort of work I personally would like him to be free for.  However, I take it that the Minister's case is that he wants this assistant secretary to take charge of a certain group within the Department.  My only object is to know how it can be done, while still preserving what I regard as a very important principle, that the Secretary of the Department ought not to be tied to his desk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> I agree that there has been a tremendous amount of work thrown on that Department in connection with the Marshall Plan and European co-operation, and, perhaps, as this is the first occasion I have spoken in the Dáil with reference to this Department since I left office, I might be permitted to say how highly I appreciated the work done by the officers of that Department.  The country is served magnificently by the officers in that Department and, indeed, to my knowledge, of all the Departments, and my hope would be that the country will always be served by such officers.  I think it quite wrong that suggestions should be made in any quarter that officers of that type are not worthy of the fullest trust.  If anybody at any time should be found to have abused his office, let him be punished, but let it not be said or suggested that we have not in this country as good a body of public servants as are to be found anywhere in the world.  In the Department of External Affairs the nation is magnificently served.  I was often amazed by the fact that they were able, small in numbers as they were, to do the work they did.  Returning again to the items on the Estimate, the counsellor indicated may probably be a substitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy a chart of the present organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad to have it.  I take it, however, that all these are warranted and that when we see sums set out in respect of five clerical officers and so on, these are ordinary incremental increases.  It is not proposed to appoint five new clerical officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extra clerical staff in relation to European recovery programme work.  As the Deputy will see from the chart, a separate European recovery programme section has been created and it had to be staffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall not be able to study the chart now and satisfy myself with regard to particular <Col N="923" /> matters.  I agree that the sending of a <i>Chargé-d' Affaires</i> to the Netherlands was overdue and I think the Estimate in that respect provides the normal amounts which are provided.  With regard to the <i>Chargé-d' Affaires</i> in Paris, is he to be quite independent of the Minister there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>He is to be independent of the Minister and solely on European recovery programme work. The staff at the Legation already was somewhat small for the work they have to do, quite apart from European recovery programme work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The next matter about which I would like to get some further information is the question of the organisation that was being set up for cultural relations, for which there is a sum of £10,000 provided in the Estimate.  I would like to know what progress is being made.  A committee was to be set up and regulations were to be made.  I would like very much if these regulations, before they were put into operation, were submitted to the House so that we would have some opportunity of seeing the regulations with regard to cultural relations.  I have not heard that that was going to be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that it is not going to be abandoned.  I think it is one of the organisations which are already overdue.  When I was speaking on the Estimate for wireless broadcasting with regard to short-wave broadcasting I pointed out that one of the things that are essential for us is to keep contact with the people of our race who, while they are the most loyal of the citizens of the various countries in which they live, have pride in the nation from which they sprung.  They have much affection for that nation.  They have much regard for its traditional culture and they are desirous of maintaining contact with it.  One of the ways in which that can be done is by means of an organisation such as I have indicated. <Col N="924" /> Such organisations are well known. Other nations have them.  Mother countries whose people have emigrated have tried to keep contact with them by means of these organisations and, I am sure, in countries like the United States or Australia, it is possible to get the people there to co-operate by raising funds to help in maintaining the relationship which they desire so much, provided we do our part.</P>
      <P>The next thing I took a note of was the official handbook.  The official handbook was in hands and certain progress had been made before the change of Government.  I expect also that that has not been abandoned.  It was one of the things that were always needed.  You needed it when strangers came who knew little about the country. You needed some attractive means to put at their disposal by which they would get the information they desired about the country.  That was the purpose of the handbook, and it had reached a certain stage, and I will be glad to hear from the Minister that progress is being made in that regard also.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us about the honorary consuls.  That is a development which, I am afraid, should have taken place earlier.  There was a certain reluctance to have honorary consuls for certain reasons which I need not mention.  I was myself doubtful for a considerable period but finally I was satisfied that they are necessary if we are to get done work which is essential for our position.  I am not sure that I heard the list.  The Minister, I think, did give a list of those that were already appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One in New Orleans and the other in Beirut.  These, I know, are excellent appointments and if we can get people of similar standing to act in other places, where we need consular representation, I hope we will move rapidly.  I might tell the Minister &mdash;he perhaps knows of it himself&mdash;that in Philadelphia they feel they ought to have a consul just as they have in Boston and in Chicago and San Francisco. Although it does not seem so far from New York, they feel it is one of the <Col N="925" /> great, big cities of the United States with a very large population of Irish blood who want frequently to visit this country and they feel it would be a great convenience to them if we could have a consul there.  Whether an honorary consul would be sufficient, is the question.  As far as I have been able to judge from those who have been making representations about it to me, they would prefer, if possible, to have a career consul and there one has to balance the advantage with the question of the expense.</P>
      <P>With regard generally to our representatives abroad, nothing could be worse than to incur the expense which we are now incurring in having them there unless we give them whatever is necessary to enable them to work efficiently.  They are there representing our country.  Their offices and establishments ought to be worthy of that position.  In some cases the residences and the offices are right and proper.  In some cases they are not so. We ought to see to it that they are properly equipped as far as the office and other conditions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to say with regard to representation allowances that if these representatives of ours are to do their work properly we cannot be stingy with them in regard to the money that is given to them for the purpose of entertainment and for the purpose of making the necessary contacts, so that they will be able to do their work properly.  Again, we have this difficult question of trying to reconcile efficiency with economy, but, as I have said in another connection, the worst type of economy is that which pares down at the point at which you have incurred the expense of the machine and you are not prepared to make available the amount that is necessary to keep it working efficiently.  That is the fear that I have always had with regard to our representatives abroad, lest while we were providing some thousands to make the posts, we were cheese-paring in the matter of a couple of hundreds, or so, which would enable them to function as they should.  That is a matter on which I can only express a general opinion.  It can only be settled by <Col N="926" /> people who have the right viewpoint on what is true economy, going into it and seeing whether, in fact, we are enabling our representatives abroad to function as they should function.</P>
    <P>I am saying a lot of these things because I think it is easier for me to talk about these general matters than it might be for the Minister, and I think it is desirable that all members of the House and the country as a whole should take an interest, not merely in the general questions, but in the details of this kind.  If they do that they will not easily give way to the sort of side-tracking appeals that are sometimes made to them by suggesting that old age pensions or something else ought to come in the first place, as was done in the debate to-day. They should come in the first place, but there is no reason whatever, in my opinion, why we cannot hold our position properly as a nation and look after these things as well.  If you give way to that other argument, then there is no end to it.  You can continue using that argument to cut down practically every Estimate there is for anything of a spiritual or prestige character.  I think it is a wrong argument to use, and the more our people know about the details of these things and concern themselves with them, the less will they be inclined to be deceived by catch cries or false arguments.</P>
    <P>With regard to making our representatives effective, there is, as I have said, the question of sufficient representation allowance to enable them to hold their position and to make their contacts properly with other representatives.</P>
    <P>There is also the question in a large country, of providing sufficient money to enable them to travel.  For instance in one of the countries I was in recently &mdash;Australia&mdash;which is a very large country, something like 2,400 miles across, you can easily see that, if a representative at Canberra is to make contacts as he should with the various cities, it would be quite impossible to do that unless there was a reasonable sum available for travelling expenses. Where we have, as in a case like that, practically only one representative to cover a very large area, with large <Col N="927" /> cities, we ought to see that provision is made to enable him to undertake the necessary travelling.  No one should think that I say this as the result of any suggestions on his part, as that would not be true; it comes from my own knowledge of what it costs and what the distances are in a country like Australia.  We have not such a bad position in this respect in the United States of America, as we have in our Consulates representatives who are able to do a good deal of the diplomatic work that would otherwise fall on our representative at Washington. You have not that position in a country like Australia.</P>
    <P>We are suffering very severely from our lack of contact with those countries.  We have a very friendly people in Australia and a very friendly Government, and I am sure it would be the same of the Government no matter what Party it was.  The same thing is true of New Zealand.  It is really important for us to see that these are kept in contact and that the information about happenings in this country is properly sent to them.  It is for that reason that I particularly deprecated, in the previous debate, the ending of the short-wave broadcasting station.  Our representatives abroad need that station, more than anything else, perhaps.  It really should be part of our equipment to provide them with the news and information which they could get readily over the wireless but cannot get in any other way.  I know that, when I was Minister, we were trying to keep these people informed occasionally by expensive wires and at other times by cuttings by air mail. We even doubted the value of sending newspapers as a whole by air mail, as they were expensive, and we went to the point of making excerpts.  That does not give to a representative the picture that the newspaper as a whole will give.</P>
    <P>In the case of the United States, we had not such great difficulty, but in the case of Australia there is a serious difficulty in keeping them informed.  If we had the wireless, they would be able to listen in and it would be possible <Col N="928" /> to see that they were, from day to day, equipped with the information which is necessary for them to do their work properly.  My plea with regard to representatives is that we should not be cheese-paring, that we should not be penny wise and pound foolish and that, having incurred the expenditure of setting up these representative establishments, we should take care to see that they have the means of being effective.  With regard to expansion, before I left the Ministry there were suggestions that we ought to exchange representatives with India.  That is another country which is very friendly, to my knowledge.  It is a very large country and a great country, and we ought to consider, in the very near future, the possibility of exchanging representatives with that country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to know that the Minister has done that. I would have liked to know from him a little bit more about any developments that he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of tourists is associated, in a way, with this Department. I regret very much the campaign that took place in this country for the last few years; it was a very unwise campaign on the part of anybody to say that that was not a most important industry from the point of view of this nation.  Some £35,000,000 last year came into this country in that way.  I think the Minister for Social Services said that, and I am glad to note the change of attitude on the part of some Ministers.  Deputy MacEntee tells me that that figure is not an exaggeration. I had not an opportunity of checking up to see exactly what the amount was, but £35,000,000 coming in means apart from the portion of it that would be in dollars which would otherwise be difficult to earn&mdash;an export of the most valuable kind.  The people who come in here consume, in the main, products that would have to be exported otherwise.  They provide here a better market than the market we would get outside and they give an opportunity to our people to earn their living by giving services.  What was <Col N="929" /> done for that particular purpose, to create that industry, instead of having been attacked should have been welcomed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be interested in that industry, and that, so far as he can, he will see that he and his Department play their part in helping it.  One of the ways in which it can be helped is by the treatment of our visitors.  This Department had a great reputation for the courtesy and assiduity with which they attended to everything that was brought to their notice.  It is a great thing for us to have that reputation for any Department and it is a great thing for the country to have that there is such a reputation.  I know that the reputation will be maintained and I hope it will not be made ineffective by some foolish action or some want of consideration by an individual State officer here and there.  In this connection, you have transport organisations to start with and we should make up our minds that those coming in will be treated well at whatever point they come, whether they land at Cóbh or at Shannon or elsewhere.  It is too bad to learn that recently some people from the United States were kept for hours in Cóbh through bad organisation.  If we are to have our customs work done expeditiously, we must make arrangements for that and give to our officers at these places, no matter to what Department they belong, instructions that, in the national interest and for the sake of the national dignity, they must be careful to attend to the needs of these visitors.</P>
    <P>If they go away disappointed they can do as much harm by their contacts as we can do good by ours.  The curious thing is that it is much easier to have evil propaganda disseminated than it is to have the reverse.  If some people go back disappointed with conditions which should have been remedied, then they will do harm.  I only ask that Departments, if they hear of any complaints of that sort, will have them investigated immediately and that the necessary steps will be taken to put them right.  I am referring particularly to a recent incident. I have not the details complete enough to give them to the House, but <Col N="930" /> I think I will be able to get them for the Minister so that he will be able to take action upon them.</P>

      <P>It is one of these things which does a great deal of damage.  The unfortunate thing is that those who can rectify it only hear of it when it is too late to do anything. I have postponed until I dealt with other matters the question of Partition and the question of the British Nationality Bill.  With regard to Partition, the Minister is quite right when he says that every section of our people want to see it ended, and that until it is ended the good relations which, I think the Minister will agree, I have tried to cultivate so far as it was possible between Britain and ourselves and which it is desirable should be established cannot be established so long as Partition lasts.  The Irish people regard Partition as a grievous wrong done to them by another nation.</P>
      <P>Attempts have been made to try to suggest that Britain is not responsible. Britain is responsible for originating it.  Britain is responsible for the continuation of it.  Britain created it and it is not unfair to expect that Britain ought to take a primary part in the ending of it.  It is true, of course, that there were certain conditions which the British Government of the day used in order to bring Partition about and to excuse it.  But the fact is that the Irish people regard the partition of their country as a grievous wrong done to them by Britain and, as the Minister has said, we are tackling this question of our relations with Britain, not from the point of view of bitterness or hatred or memory of past misdeeds on the part of Britain, but on the basis of a continuing wrong.  It is the continuing wrong that makes us naturally advert to the wrongs that were done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of our people ought to do everything in their power to make known what is the national attitude with regard to this matter of Partition. We ought to make it quite clear to the world that so long as it exists there is no use in talking to the Irish people about crusading for anybody.  There <Col N="931" /> is the need for us as a primary task getting back again what is rightly ours. In the first world war a large section of our people, generous people, were misled.  They went into that war and helped in the winning of that war in the belief that in doing so they were fighting for the rights of small nations and that their own nation would gain its right by the victory.  I have seen advertisements issued at that particular time with the authority of the British War Department saying definitely: &ldquo;Go and fight in Flanders for the freedom of small nations and Ireland too will gain victory.&rdquo;  We know what happened afterwards.  It is clear that people who have had that experience are not going to be fooled again by cries of that character.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in the recent war.  We have had charters of various kinds which have been suggested as being the aims of the various nations, providing that democracy will prevail and that the rights of nations will prevail.  But that is being denied by Britain to us at the present time&mdash; the right of our people to determine for themselves.  They did it unmistakably before and they can do it again, if that is to be the test.  This island as a whole is a national territory.  It has been so since the beginning of this nation more than 2,000 years ago.  We have this single unit which was the national territory and that has been cut up.  It seems to us to be ridiculous that we should be asked to join in and create a large bloc in Europe or anywhere else, that there should be this attempt to bring nations together that have been separated and try to unify them when, at the very same time, a nation which has been one for all these centuries is being kept cut in two despite the expressed will of the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Excuses, of course, have been made for this cutting up.  There has been propaganda to create the myth that there are two nations here occupying two different parts of the island.  As everybody knows, there is no truth in that suggestion.  There is here in this island as a whole a complex group drawn from different racial strains. <Col N="932" /> You will find that difference there, as far as groups or racial strains are concerned, in every part of the country. You possibly will find it greater in one place than in another.  If you call them black and white, you will find a little more black in one place and a little more white in another.  The black and white are mixed right through the country as a whole.  Therefore, there is no truth in the suggestion that there are two nations inhabiting this island, each of them having its own particular home.</P>
    <P>There is no truth, as everybody knows, in the suggestion that in the Six Counties which are cut off you have a natural historic unit.  Nobody who knows the facts will admit that.  Look at any map of this country before the year 1920 and you will not find upon the face of it any division such as that which exists to-day.  The suggestion that it is Ulster, of course, is all nonsense. Everybody knows that it is not Ulster.  Everybody knows that in Ulster there are nine counties, that only six of these were cut off, and that these six were cut off for one reason only.  It was a portion which they cut off so as to get a majority, differing politically, from the majority in the country as a whole.  Anybody who knows the facts knows perfectly well that in these Six Counties you could cut out an area roughly of four counties in which there would be a majority in favour of union with the rest of the country.  All those facts ought to be made known to all those people who have been misled by the myth of six-county homogeneity and that ought to be made clear.  We should do everything in our power&mdash;and now is the time to do it&mdash;to make it clear to everybody who is interested in this question that a myth has been propagated since 1920 and that that myth is without any real foundation in fact.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I rise to occupy the time of the House <Col N="933" /> in view of the great importance of the work which it is undertaking at the moment and the necessity for speed with regard to the passage of the Estimates.  I certainly would not have asked for time to raise this question on the adjournment if I did not consider that it is of major importance to my constituency.  I very much appreciate that the scheme for the drainage of the Brosna is a national scheme.  It is a very important scheme and it is the only one scheme in operation under the Arterial Drainage Act.  The people of Offaly very deeply appreciate the work which is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works and the start which was made on the Brosna has been welcomed by everybody concerned and by all the public representatives in the constituency.  To-day, on the question of the Brosna Drainage Scheme, I asked the Minister for Finance if he would state the number of men employed to date on the scheme and the rates of wages paid to gangers and workers; further, whether it is proposed to increase the rates of pay to the workers concerned and, if so, when the new rates will be announced and put into operation.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance replied to the effect that the number of men employed on the Brosna Drainage Scheme for the week ended 10th July, 1948, was 183 and that the rates of wages are: gangers, £5 per week and labourers, £3 per week.  He also said that the question of increasing the rates has not arisen.  If the Fianna Fáil Government gave me that reply in this House this time 12 months ago&mdash; if the Brosna Drainage Scheme was then in operation&mdash;I would raise the roof clean off this House, and I am going to take no such reply from the present Minister or from the present Parliamentary Secretary.  I have played a major part in bringing about a change of Government in this country with a view to bringing about better times and improving the conditions of the workers.  I am damned if I will stand here and be faced with the very same replies to-day as we were getting from the Fianna Fáil Ministers in the past.  I am raising this question, realising that not one of the Fianna <Col N="934" /> Fáil Deputies from this constituency is in the House and that the only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am raising this question in an endeavour to find out if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will state whether it is proposed to increase the wages of those workers or not.  The reply which he gave to me this afternoon was most unsatisfactory.  These men are in receipt of £3 per week.  In the local villages they are obliged to pay up to 50/- per week for their lodgings&mdash; leaving them 10/- a week to provide for their wives and their families and to keep a bicycle in good running order to bring them to their work and to take them home again.  Surely, at this stage in our history, when the cost of living has gone sky high, one cannot be expected to live or to exist on a rock bottom wage of £3 per week, 50/- of which must go on lodgings.  How can any man live in Christian decency on 10/- per week?  These men have to work hard from morning till night on the Brosna drainage scheme.  It is tough work and it is work for which every man is not fit.  It is a special type of work.  Every man who applies for a job or who is looking for a job is not fit to undertake work on major drainage schemes such as this. Therefore, I cannot see how this Government is going to defend a wage of £3 per week in view of the fact that most of the workers employed on this scheme are obliged to live many miles from home.  I fail to understand where the difference comes in of £3 per week for labouring men and £5 per week for gangers.  Is there not a very great gap to be filled?  I asked the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="935" /> to-day if it would be possible even to bring the rates of wages of these workers up to the level of the local building trade rate of wages in the district.  In the Tullamore area the local rate is 1/8 per hour.  The men on the Brosna drainage scheme are obliged to work for 1/3 per hour.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot put forward the argument that this is the same type of work as bog work.  It is no such thing.  It is much harder and tougher work and, in addition, there is no such thing as piece work on drainage.  The men have to work by the day.  Bog workers could earn up to £7, £8 and £9 per week on task work.  There is no task work on drainage.  Therefore, they are nailed down to £3 per week, 50/- of which goes for lodgings, leaving them 10/- on which to exist.  Some steps will have to be taken to remedy this situation. All I want from the Parliamentary Secretary is a guarantee or an undertaking that if representations come from the workers' organisation or from the workers' union or from a responsible person on behalf of the workers they will be sympathetically considered. I am anxious that a guarantee will be given for a substantial improvement in the rates of pay for which those poor unfortunate men are obliged to slave at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common knowledge in my constituency that in the districts of Banagher, Ferbane, Belmont and Clogher suitable accommodation is not available in hotels, boarding-houses and other houses for these workers. The respectable people of these towns have endeavoured to accommodate as many of these men as possible, but no boarding house, no hotel and no catering establishments can, in my opinion, cater for a worker and give him three good meals a day and a good bed to sleep on at night, at less than £2, £2 5s. or £2 10s. per week.  Therefore, I think I am being reasonable when I ask if it would not be possible for the Board of Works to make inquiries as to what old camps are available from Bord na Móna, and if Bord na Móna are not using those camps, if it would not be possible to have them erected at convenient <Col N="936" /> centres so as to house the workers employed on this scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that the scheme moves on and that they cannot bring the camps along according as the excavators move.  They can. These turf camps can be removed.  A small type of camp can be erected to house 50 or 60 such workers.  We do not expect the same menu and the same bedding in those camps as one would find in the Gresham hotel or the Shelbourne hotel.  We want decent accommodation for these workers.</P>
    <P>If we do as I have suggested, these workers will be in a position then to send something home to their wives and families.  At the moment they can send nothing.  I trust that the Minister and the Government will take some steps to have conditions improved.  The Parliamentary Secretary comes from a rural constituency just as I do.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that £3 per week is a suitable wage for any worker?  I spoke from many platforms during the election.  I made my constituents certain promises and, to the best of my ability, I am prepared to keep those promises.  The Parliamentary Secretary made somewhat similar promises to those that I made.  He stressed the need of a living wage for all workers.  He is now offered the opportunity of making good his promises.  The Government, including myself, are now being given an opportunity of proving our sincerity in relation to the Brosna drainage scheme.  Camps must be provided for these workers where suitable accommodation is not available or else they must be given increased wages, or an allowance, to meet lodging expenses. It is no wonder that the young men are flying from rural Ireland.  They are offered no encouragement to remain at home.  No young man would take up employment on the Brosna scheme at £3 per week on work that is both difficult and arduous.  It is no wonder that 175,000 of our young men are living outside our country to-day.</P>
    <P>I am warning the Government that I am one man who will not stand for any nonsense or codology in my constituency. <Col N="937" /> These men are working hard and earning every penny they get. I hope that the Government and the Minister will sympathetically consider any demand made by these men for decent wages.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply, will offer some hope or guarantee that their case will be sympathetically considered.  I would not work for £3 per week, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be the last man to work for £3 per week.  For that reason I hope that at an early date we shall see an increase made in the wages offered to the workers on this scheme.  If that increase is not given, then I ask that camps shall be erected in order to assist them to help their families.  I do not raise this matter here to-night in any contentious spirit.  I raise it in sincerity and friendliness.  I am 100 per cent. behind the Government and will continue to be 100 per cent. behind it in the future; but I do want to see the workers getting a fair deal.  I am anxious that the promises I made shall be fulfilled.  We have an obligation to the workers in our respective constituencies. I have an obligation to the workers in my constituency.  While I am on this side of the House I shall do all in my power to honour my obligations and to live up to the confidence and trust reposed in me by my constituents.</P>

      <P>I am more than surprised at Deputy Flanagan raising this matter on the adjournment.  He read out the question addressed to me and my reply.  He did not care about the second part where I pointed out that the question of an increase in rates of pay for workers on this scheme had not arisen. When I saw that question this morning there was no mention of rates of pay in it.  How, then, could Deputy Flanagan, or any other Deputy, think that I could have done anything with regard to increases in pay?  I cannot understand why Deputy Flanagan should get into such a state about the matter.</P>

      <P>When the Estimate for Public Works was introduced on the 30th June, Deputy Flanagan was not in this House at the time when I made a statement wherein I appealed to the people working on the Brosna scheme &ldquo;who, in my opinion, at the moment, are getting a fair wage.  If they think they are not, they have the machinery and, if they think they can make a case, it will get consideration.&rdquo;  Surely, that was fair.  While I am not prepared to discuss whether or not £3 per week is a satisfactory wage, I do want to point out that one cannot regard these workers as other than agricultural labourers.  The work is of the self-same character; it is work for agriculture. Their pay is 60/- per week for a 48-hour week; the agricultural worker in the same area is getting 55/- per week for a 54-hour week.  If the workers on the Brosna scheme work overtime they get time and a-quarter.  Later on, if they have to work on holidays, they will be paid time and a-half Does any Deputy hold that these workers are anything more skilled than agricultural workers? I was an agricultural worker myself in my time, and I think agricultural workers are second to none in this country. If an increase was made in the rates offered does Deputy Flanagan not realise that it would take away from agriculture in that area every single worker at present engaged in agriculture?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that practically every worker on this scheme comes in on his bicycle in the morning and goes home again on it at night.  I would like to know from Deputy Flanagan how many labourers engaged on the Brosna scheme are in board and <Col N="939" /> odgings.  My information is that there is not one of them circumstanced like that.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the Government, I may say we have as much interest in these people as has the Deputy.  I agree that Deputy Flanagan is interested in them and is a good worker for them.  I know the interest he has taken in several cases and I know he did his part without a doubt. But I will ask him to consider the position if we raise the rate of wages. What will happen to the agricultural worker and to the farmer?  You cannot take the Brosna drainage scheme as anything other than agricultural work; it is for the benefit of the agricultural community that the scheme is there. If a case can be made, it will get consideration, but I am giving the warning beforehand that I cannot see how the rate of wages for the labourer, who comes there on his bicycle and works his day and gets 60/- for a 48-hour week, can be increased as against the agricultural worker who works 54 hours a week for 55/-.  I cannot see how he has a claim.</P>
      <P>As regards Bord na Móna, they paid that rate of wages.  If such a drainage scheme were operating in the West of Ireland the pay would not be 60/- a week&mdash;it would be lower.  Our rate of pay depends on the local conditions. That is our point of view.  I believe that if Deputy Flanagan had read the statement I made in a recent debate he would not have put down this question at all.</P>

I would appeal to Deputies, as I did that day, and especially to Labour representatives, that, as regards the drainage schemes, we have in hands or those we are taking on, let there not be any strikes.  If there can be a case made, there is ample machinery there so that that case can be heard.  They can make their application, but let them get on with the work and let there not be sabotage.</P>

I am anxious to co-operate.  I believe in the erection of such camps.  In the event of another 100 or 200 men being employed on the Brosna there will have to be some type of accommodation. There is no accommodation in the villages or towns adjacent to the work.</P>

It will be awkward, for the simple reason that you cannot do what you did in the bogs.  There they were on the spot, but in the Brosna they will not be in the same place every week; they will have to shift.  You would have camps in one place one month and in another place the next month.  They would have to be shifted and the commissioners decided that it would not be feasible to erect camps.</P>

    <P>Irish manufacturers are not yet in a position to meet all demands for such <Col N="944" /> machines owing to the difficulties in obtaining material and to shortage of skilled labour.  The import duty on these sprayers has been suspended owing to the difficulties in supply, but I understand that the manufacturers are meeting demands much better than last year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals of the Laoighis County Council for the provision of a sewerage scheme at Durrow have been approved and the county council have been carrying out negotiations for the acquisition by agreement of lands required for the execution of the scheme.  These negotiations have failed and it has become necessary for the council to have recourse to the procedure for compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the necessity for the scheme and everything possible will be done to expedite matters.  In the case of compulsory acquisition of land the necessary legal procedure involves a public local inquiry.</P>
