      <P>The matter of the application of Ireland and a number of other nations for membership of the United Nations Organisation is at present under consideration at the meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation in Paris.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Government will miss no opportunity of seeking to undo the unnatural division of our country.  One immediate task will be to unmask the hypocritical humbug embodied in the phrase to which much currency has recently been given that &ldquo;Ulster must not be coerced.&rdquo;  The British Parliament, by the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, coerced into the jurisdiction of the Parliament created by that Act at least two whole counties and other homogeneous areas in which there was a clear majority who strenuously objected to that coercion.  A majority in those counties and areas and a large minority in other areas are still being coerced into a system repugnant to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government has taken any definite decision to reduce the high cost of living; and, if so, what positive steps are to be taken to bring about the reduction, and when he proposes to make a statement to the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort has been, is being and will be made by the Government to reduce the cost of living, and to secure the co-operation to that end of all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remission of taxation which was effected by the Government <Col N="727" /> immediately after their entry upon office must in itself have acted as a significant contribution towards reducing the cost of living.  In addition to this, constant supervision has been exercised over prices and profits.  All possible precautions have been and are being taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that the profits earned by manufacturers' agents, importers and distributors are reasonable having regard to costs. Whenever there is evidence that costs have fallen in any particular industry, steps are taken to secure a reduction in price.  The principal consideration which prevents a fall in the general price level is the high cost of imported commodities and raw materials.</P>
    <P>During the past six months it has been possible to secure reductions in the prices of a number of commodities and utilities, including hardware and hollow-ware, certain building materials, gas, leather goods, wrapping paper, timber, sugar confectionery, margarine, motor cars and bicycles.  Such reductions must have had the effect of reducing the cost of living to a certain extent.  In addition, active steps are being taken to secure price reductions in the case of other essential commodities, including clothing.</P>
    <P>Retail prices, as indicated by the official cost-of-living index number, have remained steady in recent months; they have fallen slightly during the past year despite rises in wages and in wholesale prices generally.  It is known that most countries are planning for increased production during the next few years, so that, under fairly normal conditions, a reduction in prices may reasonably be anticipated.  It is by increased production here, also, in agriculture and manufacturing industry, that the most effective contribution towards a reduction in the cost of living can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say if, apart from the items he has mentioned in which there has been some reduction, the Government in the near future will slash the prices of such articles as clothing, boots and beef&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Deputy may be assured that every possible step is being taken by the Government to that end.  There are certain factors over which we have no control, such as the import price of goods that must be imported, and the general level of costs entailed thereby.  However, in every respect and in every way possible the Government is doing everything that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that the appeal to industrialists which was made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, and in other speeches which he has made in this House, has not succeeded and, in those circumstances, will the threat mentioned by the Minister at the time be put into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is assuming something which may not be absolutely accurate.  We still have hopes that there will be such co-operation between all sections of the community, not merely manufacturers but others as well, as will bring about a substantial reduction in the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state how many meetings have been held to date by the Commission on Emigration, and when its report may be expected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been 14 formal meetings of the commission to date.  In addition, there have been many committee and sub-committee meetings, and special surveys have been undertaken in almost all counties and in England by individual members of the commission.</P>
      <P>I am informed that oral evidence is still being taken, and that statistical and other information is being assembled.  This work must take time, and, although I am satisfied that it is being done energetically, it is not possible at this stage to indicate when the report will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission have already been made aware of the fact that the Government desires to have the report with the utmost expedition. I am quite satisfied that the commission appreciates its responsibilities in that respect.  The fact that they have held so many formal meetings and sub-committee meetings, as well as sending members to England to inquire on the spot, may be taken as a clear indication of the fact that they are handling their work in a conscientious and expeditious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in view of the serious misunderstanding of the gravity of the increase of emigration during the present year, disclosed by a member of the Government Commission on Emigration in an article published over his name in a newspaper, he will take steps to ensure that the latest and most accurate information on the subject is made available to the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without accepting the implications of the question I can assure the Deputy that information in my Department, desired by the commission, has been and will continue to be supplied to the commission on the basis of the latest and most accurate particulars available.  I feel sure this is equally true of any other Department from which the commission desires information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If the gentleman indicated in the question wrote the article in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> which represented emigration as having decreased this year while the facts announced here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce were available to him, does the Tánaiste think he is a suitable member of the commission?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will ask his colleagues on the benches beside him to keep quiet while he is asking the question I will answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this member of the commission had the information given here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce available to him and nevertheless wrote an article which was published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> over his name in which he purported to show that emigration had decreased this year by half when, in fact, it had substantially increased, is he a suitable member of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence at all that emigration has increased substantially. If the Deputy would examine the reply he got on that matter he would see that it was clearly indicated there that the figures given for the issue of passports and permits are not to be taken as implying the net emigration.</P>

      <P>So far as the members of the commission are concerned, it is not my desire to interfere with the discretion of the members of the commission or with the personnel of the commission.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be most undesirable for me at this stage to express any view on the opinions of any member of the commission on any particular subject.  I have to leave it to the good sense of the commission and, in that respect, I have confidence in the general good sense of the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take together Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, as regards game rights (i.e. sporting rights other than fishing rights), the Land Commission have power to acquire for resale to purchasers of lands under the Land Acts any such rights as did not vest in them with their holdings.  Any applications that may be received from bodies of tenants for the exercise of the Land <Col N="733" /> Commission's powers in this regard will be considered.</P>
    <P>Fishing rights are in a different category.  The Land Commission have no power to acquire fishing rights reserved out of sale proceedings under the Land Acts prior to the Land Act, 1923.  Powers do exist for the acquisition of fishing rights on estates the subject of proceedings under the Land Acts, 1923-46, but such fisheries as are acquired in exercise of these powers are, in practice, retained in the hands of the Department and operated in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Arising out of representations made to me recently on this subject on behalf of riparian tenants on the River Blackwater in Cork and Waterford, I have considered the position carefully and I am satisfied that the splitting up of fisheries which would result from a policy of transferring ownership to riparian tenants would not make for proper management and development and would not be in the best interest of the State.  I do not, therefore, propose to introduce legislation on the lines suggested or to alter the present practice with regard to fisheries coming into the possession of the Land Commission.  As regards the River Blackwater, the Land Commission are not at present the owners of any fishing rights therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fishing rights on one half of the Blackwater are vested in the tenants and on the other half are held by the Land Commission?  The present position is merely a temptation to potential poachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider the flotation of a national loan to the amount of £20,000,000 to finance the erection of working class houses in Irish cities, towns and rural areas, in view of the fact that in existing circumstances local authorities will be compelled to increase rates to a level <Col N="743" /> above the financial capacity of the ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach (for the Minister for Finance) John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the view that in existing circumstances the provision of working class houses will necessitate increases in rates beyond the financial capacity of the ratepayers.  As regards the question of raising a loan of £20,000,000 suggested by the Deputy, whenever a new national loan falls to be issued provision is included for any capital to be made available via the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for housing and other purposes.  The erection of houses by local authorities is not being held up through lack of capital as they are already in a position to obtain, at low rates of interest, all the capital they need for that purpose.  Those of them who are not able to borrow from other sources on favourable terms may obtain loans from the Local Loans Fund repayable over 50 years.</P>
      <P>Through grants from central funds the State at present bears about one-half of the cost of local authority housing, the other half being shared between the local bodies and the tenants.  Expressed in another way, the present measure of State assistance is approximately equivalent to the provision of interest free loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that accused persons returned for trial are seriously prejudiced by being denied copies of the depositions free of charge and if he will take appropriate steps to provide that such accused persons shall receive copies of the depositions as of right and free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The law provides that a person returned for trial on an indictment charge may require and shall be entitled to receive copies of the depositions taken in his case on payment of a reasonable sum calculated at a rate not exceeding 1½d. per folio of 90 words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice county registrars do, on request, supply copies of depositions free of charge in appropriate cases, where they are satisfied that the accused person is without means and that he is liable to be prejudiced or embarrassed in making his defence <Col N="746" /> without copies of the depositions. Moreover, a person returned for trial in custody, if he so requests, is supplied through the governor of the prison with copies of the depositions which he is allowed to retain for a reasonable period for inspection but which are then required to be returned to the county registrar.</P>
    <P>In this set of facts, I am not prepared to accept without question the proposition that accused persons are seriously prejudiced by being denied copies of depositions free of charge, and I am not satisfied on the information at present before me that there is any need for a change in the existing law and practice in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if, in the Dublin Circuit Court area, the practice he refers to is in operation, that a person without means will obtain depositions free of charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>If he applies to the governor, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister investigate the matter further, as I think that quite a number of Deputies could inform the Minister that it has never been known in the Dublin area that depositions may be obtained free in criminal charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The present law is contained fully in Section 14 of the Petty Sessions Act, and I presume that the Deputy, as a solicitor, is aware of the position.  An accused person is always defended by somebody, and, if he does not know the law, he generally asks the governor some questions and the governor generally gives the information sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to investigate the matter further because, I, like Deputy Cowan, know of many cases of hardship in this connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be quite satisfied if the Minister will give instructions in the matter, because I had a case a few days ago where the depositions cost £11 14s. Od.  The man was unable to pay that sum and, <Col N="747" /> consequently, could not get them. Undoubtedly, if a man has not got the depositions, his legal advisers are unable to defend him properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>At our request, a small party of British personnel arrived here recently with special technical equipment for the purpose of assisting us in completing a general and photographic survey in coastal areas and also for the purpose of training a number of our officers and men in modern survey methods. Delivery is expected shortly of radar equipment for the Air Corps and for anti-aircraft purposes.  This equipment has been on order for some considerable time.  With the exception of naval ships already fitted with radar equipment, a decision has not yet been taken as to what other units will be so equipped.  As this work is being carried out at our request, we are responsible for the expenses involved.</P>

      <P>The reply to this question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>Where a military attaché is accredited, it is a matter of routine courtesy to afford him opportunities to visit military establishments.  The United States Attaché accredited to this country, like any other attaché so accredited, accompanies officers of Army Headquarters Staff on such visits from time to time.  The United States Attaché recently accompanied officers of Army Headquarters Staff on a visit to a number of military posts, but no significance whatever attaches to it. My authority is not necessary for routine visits of this nature.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if notification of the amount of moneys standing to the credit of officers and soldiers of the Defence Forces is sent to each officer and soldier concerned periodically; and, if not, whether he will arrange to have this notification issued at least once each year and on termination of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state what is the total amount of money standing to the credit of officers and soldiers and unclaimed by them, as at 1/4/1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Officers are paid their net entitlements of pay and allowances monthly and an explanatory statement is supplied with each payment showing how the amount has been computed.  The question of unclaimed credits does not, therefore, arise in the case of officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For certain administrative reasons soldiers are not informed periodically of moneys standing to their credit. They are, however, supplied with pay books in which all payments are entered and by reference to which they can ascertain their position at any time.  They can also obtain, on request, a detailed statement of their accounts. I have no reason to suppose that soldiers are not kept acquainted with <Col N="750" /> the position of their accounts by means of the facilities at present at their disposal, but I will consider the question of notifying credit balances at least once a year.</P>
    <P>There is no periodic clearing of balances from soldiers' pay accounts and a soldier may, for personal reasons or as a means of saving, allow credits to accumulate in his account.  Such credits are paid on termination of service, or earlier, if desired by the soldier.  The amount standing to the credit of soldiers as at 1st April, 1948, was £7,635.</P>

Two Bills were introduced here on the 11th and 12th December, 1936.  The occasion was the abdication of King Edward VIII.  The British Government at that time proposed certain legislation ratifying the instrument of abdication which was signed on the 10th December.  The States of the British Commonwealth agreed that they would request legislation from the British Parliament ratifying the abdication, and that they would give their assent to that legislation.  The Government of the day felt that such a course would be quite inappropriate here.  The two Bills were brought in as a pair, it being clearly stated that the second Bill would not be passed unless the first Bill was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the effect of the first Bill which became an Act on the day on which it was discussed here, namely the 11th December, was to take the King out of the Free State Constitution.  The King was removed.  The Crown was removed.  Everything that pertained to monarchy in that Constitution was taken away.  In particular, the Article which vested the executive power in the King was amended.  In its original form it made it quite clear that the executive power was vested in the King.  After the amendment it made it clear that the executive power was vested in the Executive Council, that the Executive Council would exercise all the executive powers as of its own right.  It was also provided that the Executive Council, subject to the restrictions indicated by law, might <Col N="763" /> use, for the purpose of accrediting its diplomatic representatives and other functions of that type that were mentioned in connection with our external relations, any organ used as a constitutional organ by the States of the British Commonwealth.  It is clear from that that the only way in which it was possible to use the King, who was the organ in the States of the British Commonwealth, was to use him as an agent, not as a principal&mdash;to use him as an agent of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Now, what was the position that was created as a result?  By removing the King from every Article of it, the Constitution at that stage was a republican Constitution, as was clear to those who had studied it.  There was still remaining, of course, Article 1 of the Constitution and the question that naturally had to be examined was, to what extent, when the King was removed from every Article of the Constitution, our association as a co-equal member of the Commonwealth, as expressed in Article 1, was affected or could subsist.  What were the implications in that particular Article so far as the King was concerned?  The view that was taken by some of the Deputies who were here on the opposite benches is clear from, for example, the statement that was made by Deputy Lavery, the present Attorney-General. On that occasion, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Examining the Bill in the time that I and the House have had in which to do it, it would seem to me that the effect of it is to remove the King from the Constitution and to give to this country a republican Constitution.  That may or may not be a desirable thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole of the opposition to the first measure came from those who opposed it because the King was being removed.  When Deputy Norton opposed the second measure, my own view at the time&mdash;I can be quite frank about it&mdash;was that he simply wanted to make a demonstration; that he had not even studied the matter, After Deputy Norton had spoken, Professor Thrift, <Col N="764" /> who was a Deputy at the time, spokeDeputy Professor Thrift, who followed immediately after Mr. Norton, commenced by saying that he thought he had seldom listened to more unadulterated nonsense than the speech they had just heard.  &ldquo;Deputy Norton failed even to appreciate the information which the President gave him yesterday, and did not appreciate the fact that this Bill is not one which appoints a new King in any sense of the word.&rdquo; Continuing, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I do not think that it is possible to stress too strongly that this Bill is not a Bill which, in a sense, appoints a successor to King Edward VIII.  If we pass this Bill, we shall do two straightforward things.  We shall, on our part and of our own free will, accept the abdication of the late King.  We shall appoint to the new King certain functions in relation to external matters.  That is all that this Bill does.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Looking back on it at this period of time, I think that anybody who examines the question will say that that was a fair comment and a fair appreciation of what was being done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The comment of Deputy Professor Thrift on &ldquo;unadulterated nonsense&rdquo; appeared to me to be more than justified.  The Bill which became an Act on 12th December, the day following the other, was &ldquo;a Bill entitled an Act to make provision in accordance with the Constitution for the exercise of the executive authority of Saorstát Éireann in relation to certain matters in the domain of external relations and for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  It was an Act then to make provision in accordance with the Constitution.  It was quite clear that that Act could not exceed the powers that were given by the Constitution.  If it did, it would have been declared invalid.  In the old Constitution it was in the power of the Supreme Court to declare a Bill which was repugnant to the Constitution invalid and, consequently, <Col N="765" /> when this Bill came before the Parliament, as the other Bill had become an Act on the preceding day, it was not possible to use the King that was mentioned in any other capacity except as an agent and it did not, as Deputy Thrift clearly saw, bring back a King of this country as successor to Edward VIII.  Edward VIII had abdicated.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the Bill was in a simpler form than the form in which it was finally passed.  In that simpler form it was perhaps more evident than in the final Bill what the purposes were. The reason for the change was that certain doubts had been expressed on the previous day, when the two Bills were before the Dáil, as to whether, when you had removed the King completely from the Constitution, there might not be, in view of the fact that in British law the King was the fount of authority and justice, some function that had been overlooked. Consequently the original draft was amended, and the second part of Section 3 was introduced.  That amendment was intended, in the first place, to make quite certain that the King who was abdicating could not appear in any shape or form.  The fear had been expressed that it was not sufficient to take him out of the Constitution, and the original draft went on the assumption that taking him out of the Constitution was taking him out completely, and probably it would be held to-day by most lawyers that that view was right.  The Bill had to be passed in a hurry, and no risks or chances could be taken.  It had to make doubly sure, and sometimes when you try to make doubly sure you make the matter less sure; in taking a second step to confirm a first you may sometimes throw a doubt on the validity of the first step, and that happened here in the light of subsequent argument.  The intention was clear; it accepted the abdication of Edward VIII in the most formal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first draft no cognisance was taken of the abdication of Edward VIII.  Why was it changed in the second draft?  To take cognisance of it?  The first reason was to make assurance doubly sure.  The other was <Col N="766" /> to indicate that the power lay here for it was desirable to show very clearly and very definitely that as far as any King in this country was concerned, he was a Parliamentary King and subject to the will of Parliament.  It was desirable that that should be done because if you were to allow it to be suggested that it was possible by some way other than by this Parliament to appoint a King for this country, we were in a completely subject position. We maintained that we were in a sovereign position, and, consequently, that we had the power and we exercised the power by taking note of that abdication and declaring it ratified.  By this action we indicated our power. We took, therefore, notice of this instrument of abdication because, remember, before this, on the 10th December, which is the date referred to here, he was accepted in the Constitution&mdash;whatever may be said about the people&mdash;as King.  We took note of that, accepted his abdication and made it as final and as complete as we could.</P>
    <P>You notice that there is reference in that paragraph not merely to the specified purposes indicated in an earlier paragraph of the Act, particularly the previous sub-section in which we permitted the King who is King of Canada, Australia, and so on, to be used by the Executive Council as an agent, but we were indicating in this paragraph that Edward VIII had disappeared, as far as this State is concerned, not merely for these purposes but, as a precaution, as in the way here indicated, for any &ldquo;other purposes&rdquo;. The question was: were there any? Nobody could point to any at the time, but a fear was expressed that on account of the way the King is bound up with British law which had been taken over here, some particular case might arise in which it might be desirable to see that no vestige of the authority of Edward VIII was left.  It was to cut it off completely that these words, &ldquo;other purposes, if any&rdquo;, were used.  The next thing to be done in the paragraph was to indicate who was to be successor to Edward VIII for the exercise of those particular functions which were assigned to him in Section 2.  That person had to be indicated. <Col N="767" /> We had indicated it otherwise by saying that he would be the King who would be recognised by Canada, Australia and New Zealand for the purpose of accrediting diplomatic representatives and so on.  He was indicated in the second instance in terms, I quite admit, which did not appear to some of us to be quite satisfactory, because it was suggested that the new person indicated might be appointed for purposes other than those set out in sub-section (1) of Section 3.  The answer was, first of all, that there were no such purposes in fact and, secondly, if there were any functions or purposes contrary to Article 51 as amended, they would be automatically cut off as if by a sieve, as Article 51 was a sieve to cut off any function other than those permitted by Section 51.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it is not the principle of that particular section.  Agreeing to the principle of the Bill as a whole does not mean that any particular section cannot be argued against.  I think I may take it that I am entitled to give a vote for the Bill as a whole when I have had an opportunity of dealing with the particular parts to which I object.  If I were to object to this section&mdash;that is the repeal section&mdash;I think I would be entitled to vote against it, even though I voted for the measure as a whole.  It is only right that we should have clearly in our minds what we are doing.  In order that the precise effect of what we are doing would be clear I have had to indicate what is the effect of this Act which we are about to repeal.  The effect of this Act is simple.  It got rid of Edward VIII by ratifying the instrument of abdication and it enabled the Executive Council of that date, in accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution&mdash;so far and no farther&mdash;to use as an instrument, or to use as a statutory agent, which is in every way perhaps the most appropriate word, the King who was used for the purpose of accrediting foreign representatives, etc., by Canada, Australia, etc., so long as we were associated with those States. That was the position in 1936.  I think the Minister for External Affairs hinted that I was not too happy myself about that particular section to which I referred.  The reason was that there was a difference of opinion.</P>

    <Col N="769" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There was a difference of opinion between some of the legal advisers.  Some were for making assurance doubly sure; the others were satisfied that they were sure already, that the simple Bill which had been brought in in the first instance was quite sufficient without anything further.  The Attorney-General, or whoever was in charge, was of opinion that it was desirable to make assurance doubly sure and there was, therefore, a certain uneasiness as to the effect of the particular phrase: &ldquo;for all other purposes, if any&rdquo;.  We had that question definitely in mind when the new Constitution was being considered and when it was being discussed here.  Having it in mind, we took the opportunity in the 1937 Constitution to remove anything in the way of a doubt.  You will find in Articles 28 and 29, which indicate the executive powers, and also I think in Articles 48 and 49, the question of the extent to which existing legislation should be taken over.  We took over the same scheme, namely, the Constitution in which there was no kingly function, no function of a King as such.  We took over that idea and we also took over the idea of allowing the Government of the day, with which all executive power and authority lay, the power of using as an instrument or as an agent the person who was King of Canada, Australia, etc.  In other words, we took over the External Relations Act in the taking over of British law.  But, of course, it was only to such an extent as was consistent with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs stated recently that there was something strange, that either the King was there and the Act was <i>ultra vires</i> or that the Constitution was not a republican Constitution.  That is a complete <i>non seqitur</i> so far as I can see.  The position was that the Constitution was the overriding instrument. Any law which was taken over which was in any respect inconsistent with the Constitution or repugnent to it was to that extent invalid and inoperative. Therefore, as the Constitution was clearly a republican Constitution, there could be no question of importing the King into it or with it <Col N="770" /> or around it by means of the External Relations Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>I do not.  I have not said so.  I said it was a question of making sure and in this case the danger did not exist.  In this case you were taking a completely new instrument and you were doing the thing completely. I have not said it was.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was perfectly constitutional. In any case, as to whether it was constitutional or not, the question is: is there anything that was done which was unconstitutional?  You may argue about words as you please. There was a perfectly simple constitutional position in which the Government of this State could use as an instrument, as an agent for the accrediting of our representatives to other States, and as a mark of their association <Col N="771" /> with these States, a person who, if he had not been a King, would have given rise to no difficulty.</P>
      <P>If, for instance, you had to-day a grouping of the States of Europe, such as France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg&mdash;to take a few neighbouring States&mdash;and if these States came into association and agreed that to mark themselves out from other States that were not in the association, they would accept in accrediting their representatives to other States, the signature of the President of France, it would be perfectly possible for them to do it if they wanted to do it.  It would be perfectly within their competence to do it, and it would in no way be a derogation from their sovereignty.</P>

      <P>What I said was that there was a question of some vague thing which might possibly exist, but nobody ever discovered it and nobody was ever able to lay their finger on it. This instrument is not importing a continuing personality or a continuing agent.  It is importing an agent <i>ad hoc</i> for each particular case.  There was no continuity of personality at all. It was a series of individual acts since 1937.  I would be interested to know&mdash; I did not think it worth while to put down a question about it&mdash;how many such Letters of Credence were signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Now, nothing will show better the actual position, I think, than to read for Deputies one of the Letters of Credence which was put in the Library for the information of Deputies.  That was done some time ago.  I was asked to give the information and I gave it. I have here the form.  There was a general evolution in these forms.  When we came in originally, the position was that I saw some documents signed by the Government here as His Majesty's Government of the Irish Free State. Letters of Credence were in the name of His Majesty and definitely originated from him as from the centre of authority.  Passports, in which the usual requests were made, were in the name of His Britannic Majesty.  That was not the position when we were leaving office, and it is not the position to-day when we are going to get rid of this External Relations Act.  This was the general form.  It began &ldquo;Your Holiness,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Brother&rdquo; according as to whether the letter was addressed to the Holy Father, to a King, or to a republican President or some person in a republican State.  It then went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mark you, it says the &ldquo;Government of Ireland&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;being desirous of maintaining the relations of friendship which exist between Ireland and (the State concerned is then mentioned) have advised me that they have judged it expedient that So-and-so be accredited to Your Holiness or Majesty (or whoever the head of the State might be) in the character of (Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary or Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary) of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It starts, then, with indicating who it is that is originating, and is the source of, this request.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Government feel assured that the choice of So-and-so will be perfectly agreeable to Your Holiness or Majesty (as the case may be) and that he will prove himself worthy of this mark of confidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It then goes on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" />&ldquo;I, therefore, request, on behalf of the Government of Ireland,&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>in which he had no part himself, obviously,&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that Your Holiness (or whoever it might be) will give entire credence to all that this person shall communicate to Your Holiness or Majesty in their name, and I take this opportunity of renewing to Your Holiness or Majesty the assurance of my sincere friendship and of the unfeigned respect and esteem which I entertain for Your Holiness or Majesty (as the case might be), person and character.</P>
    <P>Given at my Court at So-and-so on such and such date.  I am, Sir, my Brother, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows clearly that the person who signed this document, and those who were receiving our representative, had got documents from the same person in another, and in quite different, capacity, and I am perfectly certain that they were not so simple as not to notice the difference between them.  In one case he was acting as principal; here he was obviously acting as agent.  Whether that is desirable or not is a matter on which we can have our views&mdash;whether or not it was desirable to have that thing done.  That is a question of policy.  I am anxious that the House would know precisely, before they do this, what was being done and what is the existing position.</P>
    <P>At the moment I have not got with me the passports which were issued at the time we were leaving office.  These passports were issued by the Minister for External Affairs asking, in a corporate capacity, that the usual courtesies and so on would be given to the person who had the passport.  I want to point out at this moment, before we get rid of this Act, what the actual, legal constitutional position in practice is&mdash;that we are here a republican State, and that this republican State, in order to mark its association with other States,. was simply making use as a statutory agent of the person who signed our letters in one capacity and in quite a different capacity for other states.  As I have said, we can have our views as to whether that is desirable or not.  I <Col N="774" /> want to say what the Taoiseach said some time ago&mdash;his words probably are not quite the same as mine&mdash;but I do say that the British Crown in this country has, in the minds of our people, always been associated with British rule.  It was the symbol of British rule in this country.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lloyd George expressed a truth when he said&mdash;I think it was some time between 1914 and 1919&mdash;that &ldquo;centuries of brutal and often ruthless injustice and, what is worse.... centuries of insolence and insult have driven hatred of British rule into the very marrow of the Irish race.&rdquo;  The British Crown, therefore, as symbolising that rule was not acceptable to the sentiments of our people.  We naturally were not anxious to have in any shape or in any form the British Crown associated with our free institutions.  That is perfectly true.  The question was then whether it was possible for us to have it as a symbol of association.  It was not the association with the States of the British Commonwealth that our people objected to.  I have over a number of years made statements similar to the statements that have recently been made by the Taoiseach on that matter. I believed them true then.  I believe them true to-day.  I believe he is expressing the truth.  Association with these States appeared to me to be on a very different footing from that of the Crown.  Association was acceptable so long as it was quite clear that it was to be a free association.  That seemed to me to be something that our people could accept provided that the terms of the association were satisfactory. I could not think myself, and I have been struggling with these problems since, I might say, 1917&mdash;I was very close to these problems in 1921&mdash; of any simpler way by which association could be signified.  I have suggested that France and Belgium and Holland and Luxemburg could show association by accepting the signature of, say, the President of France.  Or, if we wanted to-morrow to join an association of which the United States would be a member, and, being the strongest member, it was agreed that in order to distinguish members of the association from other States the signature of the President of the United <Col N="775" /> States might be used in accrediting diplomatic representatives abroad.</P>
    <P>One of its values of which we had better take note before we get rid of this Act&mdash;and I am only repeating, I think, in other words what the present Minister for Finance said when he was on these benches&mdash;was that there were no real commitments in that symbol of the association&mdash;or co-operation, as I have put it.  I may tell the Taoiseach, for it will interest him, that one of the reasons why we did not use the symbol &ldquo;association&rdquo; and that we inserted instead &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; was that we believed and held in fact that there was no free association inasmuch as the Treaty was imposed by threat of force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty was gone at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at that time. The Taoiseach will remember that all this started in 1936.  The battle for the land annuities was still not won; we had not yet got the ports back and a lot of other things were not there.  The attitude of the Party to which the Taoiseach then belonged was that this was a free association.  We denied that.  We felt that that was an association which was imposed by the terms of the Treaty which, in my opinion, anyhow, and in the opinion of those who were with me at the time, was accepted here, in so far as it was accepted, only under threat of force. I could never see myself regarding an association imposed under such terms as being entitled to be called a free association.  But &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; in that sense would be free because there was no duty or obligation to co-operate if you did not want to do so.  There was a question of coming to consult and consider the question of co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we are getting rid of this symbol.  In my opinion&mdash; and remember that I am in favour of getting rid of it&mdash;it is very doubtful when people come to examine this in later years, whether it may not appear that you, by means of treaties or other, arrangements which you may have to make to preserve such an association, as you say you want, will be incurring <Col N="776" /> greater obligations than were contained in the symbol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not making any treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that even though you were in the association&mdash;it is a thing that some people forget&mdash;you would have to make treaties and so forth in order to obtain certain reciprocal rights.  They do not follow directly and immediately from the association itself.  The point is that I should like here, even if I were not to be in this House another day, to sound a note of warning.  As one who has been fairly close, both in an executive capacity and in opposition, to the central problems for now close on 30 years, I should like to say that if we are getting rid of this measure we shall have to be mighty careful not to enter into any arrangements which will be substituted for it in order to preserve an association.  There seems to be a desire to have some association. The question is whether the association is not in a simpler form now than it will be following this measure.  I am in favour of removing this Act.  I am in favour of removing it because of the confusion that has been created about it.  I do not admit that any jurists who examined the matter had any doubt whatsoever as to what this State was.  I do not admit that any foreign State had any doubt whatever as to what our real status was.  The Minister for External Affairs said that the question of our sovereignty should be made clear.  Nobody has questioned the sovereignty of this State&mdash;nobody.  At no time that I know of has the sovereignty of this State been questioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Deputy stated on repeated occasions to the House that one of the reasons for not repealing this Act was that we might <Col N="777" /> find it difficult to be recognised by other States?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that might be created if, as the result of some intriguing, perhaps with the British Government or somewhere else, some foreign State might possibly withdraw its representative from here and use some excuse such as the excuse that we were creating a new State or something like that.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit that I hesitated, even though there was confusion, in going to my colleagues in the Government and asking them to remove it.  First of all, I quite realised at that time that, if I were to bring in such a Bill, the atmosphere then was very different from the atmosphere which prevails at the present moment.  If we had introduced that Bill, with one or two exceptions, there would immediately have been a campaign of attack against us by the then Opposition.  I considered, therefore, that it would not be in the interests of the country at the time.  On the 6th August last when Deputy Norton was again talking &ldquo;pure and unadulterated nonsense,&rdquo; I said to him: &ldquo;If you believe these things now, act.&rdquo; I told him further, lest there should be any doubt, that we would not oppose him.  The reason was that I believed that if this Act had to go it was better that it should go when there was some chance of a united Parliament bringing about its repeal rather <Col N="778" /> than that it should go at a time when there might be a division of opinion in the country.</P>
      <P>I admit I did hesitate.  I hesitated, first of all, because &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; or sentiment is something which could not be left out of account.  If one were prepared coldly to examine the whole situation, without any feeling, one could say that the present was not an unsatisfactory arrangement.  Not merely are we a sovereign State, but we are a republic now before this Bill passes.  It is as clear as crystal that there never was at any time at any acceptance of allegiance.  The mark that was used was used merely to show an association with the other States of the Commonwealth.</P>
      <P>People who do not examine these things coldly in the light of intellect might be easily misled merely because it happened to be a King who was used as that mark.  It was easy for some people to suggest that we were accepting him as a King and were giving him allegiance.  We had taken away the oath of allegiance out of the old Constitution. In 1936 our position was already clear.  It was abundantly clearer in 1937 that we were a republic. Our association with the British Commonwealth was simply marked by this symbol.  On the 29th December of that year the British Government stated that the enactment of our Constitution made no change as regards our membership of the Commonwealth.  That was made spontaneously and voluntarily. The Minister seems to suggest that we were in doubt as to whether or not we were a republic.  At no time have I ever been in any doubt as to our republican status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt, but the Deputy made categorical statements for two years afterwards. Did he not examine the position until then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy has already read that.  I know what I said. <Col N="779" /> These are some statements of mine in reply to a paper read in University College together with some statement that I made in the House.  At the time of the enactment of our Constitution it was not my desire that any controversy should arise as to the designation or description of the State particularly when the State's jurisdiction was to extend over the whole of our country. When the Constitution was being put to the people I was not going to resurrect an old controversy centring around the monarchy and the Treaty debate. That Constitution was accepted by the majority of our people.  Had I resurrected all the old discussions centring around the name of the State the only result would have been to cloud the entire issue at the time and we might probably not now have our Constitution at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately refrained from introducing the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; because I felt that the whole controversy would have raged around that word and the Constitution itself would have been forgotten.  I knew that when the time came for us to resolve the matter as a separate question we could do it.  We can resolve it now by stating definitely what was always the fact&mdash;but a fact that was denied by some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can state now that we are a republic.  That is a different matter from doing it at the time when the Constitution was before the people.  I was meditating upon the matter at that time but I decided that any attempt to resolve it then would lead to a division of opinion.  Secondly, there were certain advantages in retaining the symbol and I was prepared <Col N="780" /> to hold those advantages for a little longer until the association, interrupted by the war, would again consolidate itself.  That has now happened. To some extent it is true to say that I provoked the bringing in of this measure by certain remarks of mine to the Tánaiste in August last.  I may be regarded as having provoked the introduction of this measure.  Whatever or whoever caused it, I have not said at any time that we were opposed to the measure.</P>
    <P>It is, however, my earnest wish that we should clearly see what we are doing.  I do not wish to enter into any controversy as to whether we were or were not a republic up to this.  I am not particularly perturbed as to designation. A name has no particular value to me as long as the country is divided.  It is the institution that is important.  When our country is united we can decide upon our name.  There has never been any question as to our sovereignty.  If you mean by &ldquo;status&rdquo; how exactly a State is to be classified and in what particular category, then I say that I am not one of those who think that we should of necessity fall into any one particular category. States' relations and their institutions develop in accordance with the needs of their people.  Grammarians classify language into rules but it sometimes happens that the language changes and then the rules must change.  But that classification is not a vital essential to speech.  Neither is the particular classification of a State vitally essential. Speech develops and grammarians make changes to meet that development. In the same way States develop.</P>
    <P>The class into which a State falls depends upon its institutions.  The historian subsequently sets out to trace the progress of the State and classifies it, placing it in its particular category. The characteristic of the British Commonwealth of Nations was said to be that it defied definition and classification. That was said to be its intrinsic value.  It is unique amongst associations.  State institutions evolve out of the State's unique circumstances. If a State evolves a mechanism by association with other States which is <i>sui generis</i> that is not a sufficient <Col N="781" /> reason why anyone should sneer and jibe at it because it does not fall into some existing classification.  But in truth there is nothing fundamentally wrong in the arrangement that existed.  It may not fall into any of the ordinary classifications.  Without a doubt, however, our State is a republican State. There was nothing in the arrangement that was in any way contrary to the State being so classified.</P>

      <P>What other republic in the history of the world ever utilised the King of another country in the manner in which he was utilised here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, in reply, what other organisation is like the British Commonwealth?  If, to-morrow, it was decided to be a good way of denoting an association of States, such as France, Belgium&mdash;Belgium was a kingdom; I do not know if it is a kingdom now&mdash;Holland, which is a kingdom, and Luxembourg&mdash;if these countries with France, decided that their association was to be denoted by the use of the signature of the French President in regard to the accrediting of their diplomatic representatives, what is unreasonable in it?  It has not been done already, but is that to be a reason why the thing is wrong?  Why should something be wrong if it is merely unusual and has not been done already? The relations of Britain, Canada and Australia are relations that have not been paralleled by other States and if there is a solution, which would enable us to work with them in amity and in accordance with the desires of our people, why should we be cut off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that could be said against it was that the particular symbol used was the British King, and the British Crown associated with British rule was not accepted as a suitable symbol of the association. That is the only thing that can be said about it.  Because it is unusual it gave an opportunity to everyone who wanted to sneer at it.  That is one of the reasons why, believing that clarity here was essential, I agreed with the Taoiseach when he said it was very much better that we should make the position clear and not be wasting our <Col N="782" /> time in arid constitutional discussions. I agree.  It was not I who introduced this question as to what particular type of State we are.  When I was asked about it I said we were a republic.  I said some years ago that we are an independent republic, associated with other countries as a matter of external policy.  That is the whole question&mdash;just as Britain was in the League of Nations because of her external policy, we were associated as a matter of our external policy with the States of the British Commonwealth. To mark this association we availed ourselves of the procedure of the External Relations Act by which the King, recognised by the States of the British Commonwealth, acted for us under advice in certain specified matters in the field of our external relations.</P>
    <P>That is an accurate statement of our status as an independent republic and an accurate statement of the manner in which the signature of the British or Canadian or Australian King was used in regard to our external affairs. We did not necessarily have to use that symbol.  Without passing this Bill at all, as we stand at this moment, without any repeal of the External Relations Act, the Government, which is the centre of executive authority and in my opinion the real head of the State&mdash;because the head of the State need not necessarily be an individual; it can be a body just as well&mdash;can act through an agent.</P>
    <P>The real head of the State here acts through an agent and the Government at this moment can use that particular statutory instrument.  In my opinion the Government is entitled to use any agent it wants.  There is only one Article in this which is really important in the situation.  In my opinion, by its authority, the Government could nominate any person it wants to sign letters of credence&mdash;the Chief Justice, the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, anybody except the President.</P>

      <P>The King was not at the top.  Do not continue here the sort of stuff you can talk at the crossroads. There is no King at the top; the King, in fact, was at the bottom.  He was an instrument, an agent, and one of the arguments used against us was that it was really something which was humiliating to him.  Some people said if they were in his position they would not do it.  If he did not, that was all about it.  But he was not at the top. That is the misrepresentation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government was at the top.  The Government here, in so far as the executive power is concerned, is the supreme authority subject to the criticism and control which can be exercised by this House and ultimately by the people.  If you want to know where the ultimate sovereignty lies, it lies with the people.  They ultimately have to decide who are to be the persons from whom their rulers have to be chosen; who are the people who will make their laws.  Ultimately they should be given an opportunity of deciding questions of policy but unfortunately now they will not be given it. They should be given the opportunity of deciding what is the national policy that is going to be pursued by the Government.  Coalition prevents that. The people are sovereign.  If you are looking for the head of the State, the central source of authority, that is ultimately with the people.  The next <Col N="784" /> organ to the people is this Assembly and the associated Chamber, the Seanad.  The next centre of authority so far as executive power is concerned. the organ of State through which the power must be exercised, is the Government. As regards the head of State, one will realise this idea was very appropriate in the days of monarchy. The King in Council is the supreme judge.  It is the King in the Legislature who is the final element in the legislation and it is the King, through his Ministers, as they are supposed to be, who is the chief executive authority.</P>
      <P>In a kingdom or a monarchy you have something you can readily point to as a head of State.  You have not that where the powers are distributed, where each power is more or less sovereign in its own particular sphere. Each one of them might be entitled to be regarded, in its own particular sphere, as a head.  We were anxious that the President, as the first citizen in the land, should get powers&mdash;he cannot at present on account of our Constitution&mdash;which would indicate as much authority as would make him not merely a symbol but a real power.  I am altogether in favour of giving him these powers, but the fact that it was unusual is due to the circumstances in which our Constitution and our situation here have evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out what I think is being done.  We have a republic and we are simply getting rid of one particular agent representing or marking our association with a group, but in my opinion we could probably appoint to-morrow, if this Act were passed to-morrow, if we wanted to, seeing that there is no restriction so far as I can see on the power of the Executive to appoint anybody as their agent, the King if he were regarded as suitable, not because of our association but as an individual.  There is no restriction on the power of the Executive to appoint any individual they choose, except the President.  The President exexcluded because it is not one of the functions given to the President explicitly in the Constitution and it is indicated in the Constitution that, if the President was to get any powers over and above the powers he has, these powers would have to be given <Col N="785" /> to him by law, and would have to be exercised by him on the advice and under the control of the Government.</P>
    <P>We can do everything, it seems to me, when this Act has gone, that we could do before it went.  The only value of the repeal of this Act is a certain demonstration, a demonstration to clear the air; I am one of those who favour this.  I have been gradually coming to that opinion for some time, on account of the dislike of our people for the British Crown as the symbol of British rule and the possibility of misrepresentation as the Deputy opposite has sought to misrepresent it&mdash;that, because the King was in it at all, he was to be in it in his former capacity, as being a head and a fount of authority instead of a mere instrument. Because it was possible to misrepresent the situation and to create confusion, I am in favour of getting rid of it and we will, therefore, vote for this section. I think it only right, however, that the whole of our position in this matter should have been made clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on this section very shortly and, I hope, very succinctly.  I think it would be very wrong and contrary to the national interest if the speech to which we have just listened for over an hour should reopen that which I have referred to throughout the discussion on this Bill as the arid controversy as to our constitutional status.  Deputy de Valera has stated that the reason for his utterance to-day is that he wants the people to know quite clearly what they are doing and wants Deputies to be apprised of what they are doing.  What we are doing in this Bill is getting rid of the talk to which we have just listened and the kind of answer which must inevitably be given to the discussion which the speech we have listened to must entail.  The speech on this section, to which we have listened, emphasises and underlines the argument I put forward on the Second Reading as being one of the reasons why this Bill was necessary.  I did myself make it absolutely clear that that reason was not the principal reason impelling the Government to bring in this measure at this particular time, but that it was a supplemental reason to the principal <Col N="786" /> reason for which the Bill was brought in.  We want to stop the arid controversy about our constitutional status and about constitutional law.</P>
      <P>I said on the Second Reading that we had too many constitutional lawyers in this country; what I really should have said is that we have too many lay constitutional lawyers in this country. Deputy de Valera has stated that, in the preparation of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, two views were taken as to a certain matter.  One was whether it was necessary to put in these words, &ldquo;all other, if any, purposes&rdquo;, and the other that it was not necessary.  One section assumed it was necessary and the other said it was not.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said he followed then the opinion of the Attorney-General of the time, but he expressed here to-day the view that the Attorney-General's opinion was wrong and proceeded to state quite clearly and simply his view of this Bill and its effect, what it was intended to do and what in fact it did, and he specifically laid down the proposition that any jurist examining this Act of 1936 and the other Act to which it was complementary, the amendment of the then existing Constitution, would have no doubt as to what our real status was.  I have discussed for the past 12 years with lawyers of various types and political opinions what our political status was. We argued it &ldquo;in, about and round about and we came out by that same door as in we went,&rdquo; and up to the present moment I do not know what our status was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any view I take or any other view put forward would necessarily be the correct view. It is possible that Deputy de Valera is right.  I concede that it is possible that he is absolutely right and I concede absolutely that he believes himself to be right, but that there exists a multiplicity of other opinions is also beyond all doubt and that situation has given rise to all these controversies, disputes, doubts and difficulties which have occupied such a lot of our time in this House for the past 12 years. That was one of the reasons we wanted to get rid of all this.  It is as I <Col N="787" /> emphasised, and I want again to underline the fact, not the principal reason for this Bill.  I do hope that this speech of Deputy de Valera's will not give rise to the expression of a variety of views in this House on what was the meaning of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936.  I could put forward for hours and hours a variety of arguments, of suggestions, as to what the Bill meant and what it did and did not do.  I do not intend to do anything of the sort. The proposition I want to lay down is that Deputy de Valera has stated his view which, he says, is a clear view and I have other views which I could put forward and various other people have different opinions.  Any of us may be right, but what I want to do is to stop the discussion which leads nowhere and that is one of the principal reasons for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera stated that he wanted to sound a note of warning. I do not know why he should sound a note of warning.  We do not want any notes of warning; no notes of warning are necessary.  There is no warning, by way of note or otherwise, necessary in connection with the Bill.  When this Bill becomes law, we will be in the position that we will have no association, formal or informal, with the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  It was in order to prevent further argument about this class of thing that we took up that position. We might very easily have woven out of our constitutional ingenuity some other link or symbol&mdash;anything you like&mdash;to mark the fact that we wished to continue our factual relationship with the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or Commonwealth of Nations, as I should call it now; but we thought it better, in order that there should be no more controversy, no more discussion, that we should be enabled, when this Bill became law, to assert beyond all possible shadow of doubt that there was no link or symbol lurking around anywhere binding us to the Commonwealth of Nations.  We wanted to stop all further controversy and that is why we made a clean break here.  We <Col N="788" /> wanted to have the position absolutely clear so that no one could hang an argument on it again.  We wanted to put a stop to the arrant, futile discussion which was diverting our energies from the work which we have to do.  I do not want this discussion to start again.  We require no warning.  We are fully alive to the fact that, when this Bill becomes law, we will be an independent State.  We have got recognised that, to make use of that neutral word, a factual association exists.</P>
    <P>We recognise that there exist common interests between ourselves, Great Britain and other members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Those interests will go on exactly as they were before, without any symbol or other mark of our association.  All property rights will be in the same position as before; our doctors and other medical people will be in the same position; the arrangements we have with regard to double income-tax and all other matters will be precisely as they were.  There will be free passage of men and&mdash;subject to existing treaties and other arrangements&mdash;of materials between this country and Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Everything will be precisely as it was before, but we will have a completely independent republic without any symbol other than the factual one&mdash;if you can call a factual existence a symbol&mdash;indicating our desire to have the closest association with the members of the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to go around talking about these things and talking about warnings.  I want to eradicate that from this discussion, here and now, because behind that suggestion and implicit in it is the suggestion that we will have to do something by way of making a treaty as between Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, to show that there is association, to provide for a statutory agent of the Crown within the Empire.  I do not know what that means.  We will have to make no treaty we would not have to make here if the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, were not repealed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> There has been a lot of talk about Commonwealth preferences and other matters of that kind.  Most of the matters in the way of trade and commerce between all the members of the Commonwealth of Nations are hammered out on the basis of reciprocal rights and interests and not on the basis of symbols.  That position will go on as it was before.  We got anything we got from Great Britain&mdash;such as we got in the trade agreement last July&mdash; because it was good business for us and it was good business for Great Britain.  We have people living in England, but so have the British people living here.  We have ties with our relations in England, so have the British here.  The whole matter is one of reciprocity and I do not want to have tremendous damage done by the phrase used by Deputy de Valera, issuing his notes of warning.  I want to see all that wiped clean out of the public mind.</P>

      <P>I would like to follow up one point made by the Minister when he was concluding the last day, without going into a detailed discussion on it.  Before doing so, I think we may approach this repeal measure on the basis that we know now where various people stood and what the facts of the position are.  The fog <Col N="790" /> and confusion that the Taoiseach has referred to, if it was there at all, resulted from the activities of political lawyers, and I do not propose to follow into the intricacies of that.  The first question I would like to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister is this.  Am I correct in the view that this Bill, this section in particular, does no more, as far as Section 1 is concerned, than repeal the provisions for using the King as an agent for external relations?</P>

On sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the External Relations Act, the Minister made a point, in closing the Second Reading debate, that the Act brought back the King.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point arises out of the Minister's contention.  On Section 3 (1) of the Act there is no <Col N="791" /> controversy as to what you do, but in Section 3 (2) the Minister contended that the force of the words &ldquo;tenor thereof&rdquo; was that the King abdicated according to the tenor thereof and that by virtue of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the descriptive clause of the King, he was brought back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of Abdication was made part of our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was part of the law of Saorstát Éireann.  The Act of Abdication is to have effect &ldquo;according to the tenor thereof&rdquo; and the tenor thereof is that this instrument should be given effect to immediately and &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; was the 10th day of December, 1936.  Therefore, the effect of that section was to say that the King, King Edward, had abdicated as from the 10th December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy missed the point I was making.  The Act of Abdication is given the force of law by this Act. The first declaration of the Act of Abdication is that the King, King Edward VIII, is King of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Was King of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You have, therefore, by this Act, declared him to be King of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer it this way.  Under the old Constitution he was King.  We republicans never admitted it, though we had to face the factual situation and the legal situation under a law forced upon us by the Treaty which we made it our business to get rid of.  The legal situation, which we were taking cognisance of in the Free State, was that certainly up to December 10th, 1936, there was a King there.  We republicans never acknowledged him, but for legal purposes it was so.  I must admit that, but I make this admission no further than that it was the legal position; that it was the accepted legal doctrine, which no republican ever acknowledged.  The legal position was that on the 9th December, 1936, there was King <Col N="792" /> Edward and, within the old Free State Constitution, he was King of Ireland, within that law which we, as republicans, abhorred and repudiated.  We simply used that legal position to try to get rid of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you not get rid of him on the 11th?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the 9th.  I shall come to that quickly enough if I am not interrupted.  On the 10th we had the instrument of abdication.  On the 12th an Act was enacted in this House providing that &ldquo;immediately upon the passing of this Act the instrument of abdication shall have effect according to the tenor thereof.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tenor&rdquo;, as the Minister appreciates as a lawyer, has a rigorous connotation.  Because of that, that section must be read as that immediately on the passing of this Act, the instrument of abdication would have effect as from the 10th December.  That was the effect in law.  That being so, notwithstanding the fact that the Act was enacted here on the 12th, in contemplation of our law, King Edward VIII had abdicated on the 10th.  The legal position then was that on the 10th, on the coming into operation of his abdication, that notionally his successor, according to whatever law there was providing for the King, continued to be King.  His successor, of course, was the present King, his brother.  Therefore, on the dawn of the 11th, the King for the purposes of the Free State Constitution was George VI, but the actual identity of the King is unimportant for present purposes.  On the 11th, by an Act of this House, that said King&mdash;not Edward, but his successor&mdash;was removed from the old Constitution of Saorstát Eireann completely. Therefore, he was gone.  Now, on the 12th, the further provision was made that &ldquo;his said Majesty (Edward VIII) shall for the purposes of the foregoing sub-section of this section and all other (if any) cease to be King.&rdquo;  That is of the same nature as the first clause. He ceased to be King as from the date of his abdication, and then it says that &ldquo;the King for those purposes shall henceforth be the person who&rdquo;, etc. The effect of that is that his successor <Col N="793" /> becomes the King for the purposes of the External Relations Act and &ldquo;all other purposes (if any)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not suggest that the Act amending the Constitution passed on the 11th December had any reference to King George VI as a distinct monarch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to put this point, irrespective of the particular person who would be King at a particular time.  Notionally, the monarchy was continuous and passed from one person to the next person entitled to the Crown.  The King never dies.  The point I am making is that &ldquo;all other purposes&rdquo; in Section 3 (2) means all other purposes left over, if any, from the Act of the previous day. I do concede to the Minister that there have been discussions as to what the precise position thereafter was.  I do admit that there was room for discussions in an interim period, but I think a strong case can be made for the intentions of the Executive of that time. I am arguing as a lawyer, just putting the finishing touches to the matter.  In fact the country knew where we stood. The actual position in fact was that we were sovereign here with a republican status, using an external organ.  Arguing legally on the matter, on that basis, I would, if briefed, be well prepared to argue that the position on the passage of the External Relations Act was that we were a republican State, utilising a roving consular-general, as Professor O'Sullivan called it, for the purpose of external relations.  I need not prolong that matter.  It has been argued before, but the Minister has joined issue with me.</P>
      <P>I think it is more important to look at what our position in 1937 was. Supposing I adopt the Minister's argument. Just for the sake of safe-guarding myself from any possible implication that I admit the Minister's legal arguments in regard to the King, I have gone into what I have referred to just now, but supposing for the sake of argument there was such a possibility, what was the position of the Constitution in 1937?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for the sake of getting things clear, does the Deputy <Col N="794" /> admit that the External Relations Act, in effect, continued the King as part of the organ of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  Let me say precisely what I do think it does legally.  It defines the King who is to sign the credentials of foreign Ministers, I mean in our external relations, who in other words is to be King within the meaning of Section 3.  Perhaps I might make myself clearer.  It is a misuse of the term &ldquo;King&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; is not to be used as the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; in the Act, then I give it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Many a lawyer would not give it up.  Does the Minister remember a famous case&mdash;and this was held to be perfectly good law &mdash;where under the Scrap Iron Act, in order to obtain certain effects, there was a definition that &ldquo;the term scrap iron shall include horse&rdquo;.  This is something of the same nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;the meaning that he was King of Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the argument I have just put forward meets the Minister's point.  If &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is to be construed so rigorously as to embrace a descriptive portion of the Act as a positive declaration, as the Minister intends by importing it, then &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; must be equally rigidly construed to embrace that effect should be given to this instrument immediately. If &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is rigorous enough to make what is purely descriptive <Col N="795" /> declaratory, then &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is rigorous enough to make &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; mean rigorously what &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; does mean, and if &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is rigorous in that sense, I can see the Minister's view about King of Ireland, but I say the Act of Abdication must of necessity have taken effect on the 10th, the day before the King was removed. All that is anterior to the preparatory Act and the force of the Minister's argument is completely gone.  That is the legal position, I submit.</P>
      <P>To get on from that&mdash;supposing I concede to the Minister a doubt, it is all I will concede&mdash;what was the position when the new Constitution was passed?  The new Constitution was overriding law and, in particular, it enacted Article 48:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Constitution of Saorstát Éireann in force immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution and the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act, 1922, in so far as that Act or any provision thereof is then in force shall be and are hereby repealed as on and from that date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By virtue of that Article, if the Minister's contention and the contention of certain other lawyers is correct, in so far as the External Relations Act imported the King in any way into the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann, supposing we admit, which I am not in fact admitting&mdash;I am merely admitting for the purpose of argument here&mdash;supposing I admit that the External Relations Act imported into the Constitution of the Free State the King, whether it is in an attenuated form or whether a completely sovereign form, even if he was imported back to the extent of putting him in the 1932 position, then the effect of Article 48 of this Constitution is to obliterate him again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you in a moment or should I, like the rest of the lawyers in this House, not tell you but throw up a fog?  The point is this that, even if you are right and if the King was imported into the old Constitution, you are perfectly right in your contention that Article 48 of the new Constitution wiped that out completely and, therefore, I agree with you that if the effect of the External Relations Act was in any way to import the King back into the Constitution in spite of the intention of the Executive and the Legislature which passed it, then, in so far as the External Relations Act is repugnant to the Constitution, it is unconstitutional and void.  I agree there.  But, nevertheless, you will agree with me, I think, that in so far as the provisions of that Act are in accordance with the Constitution then, <Col N="797" /> by virtue of the continuing laws provision in the Constitution, they are valid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that, too.  The position is this: supposing I admit your contention, the result is, the abdication is sped and finished.  It is not a continuing thing.  It is something that was done for all time and a repeal cannot affect it.  It does not revive anything that was done&mdash;another principle of statute law.  So, as far as abdication is concerned, that is done and sped.  As far as anything might have been imported into the Free State Constitution&mdash;which I do not admit&mdash; it is unconstitutional.  It was unconstitutional under the 1937 Constitution, and therefore it is sped.</P>

      <P>Therefore the Government has been operating under an unconstitutional Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not. So that you are left, for the moment, with the position that Sections 1, 2 and 3 (1) and 4 of this Act are in force up to now.  Supposing we take that and if sub-section (2) of Section 3 did what the Minister said, it was unconstitutional and was gone.  Now Sections 1 and 2 are not unconstitutional because Sections 1 and 2 are in complete accord with the Constitution because the Government succeeded the Executive Council and it is in accord with the vesting of authority in the Government. Sections 1 and 2 of the External Relations Act are perfectly constitutional and, therefore, have current force until to-day.  They were redundant and unnecessary, I agree, because they are explicitly provided for in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, where are we with regard to Section 3?  The position in regard to Section 3 is that, really, under the <Col N="798" /> Constitution&mdash;Article 29&mdash;the executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations shall in accordance with Article 28 of that Constitution be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.  In other words, Article 29 (4) thereof is really equivalent to the provisions of Sections 1 and 2.  All the executive authority in regard to external relations being vested in the Government.</P>
    <P>Article 29 (4) 2º then provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members....&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the External Relations Act, it was declared that the Government might use a particular king, and the King recognised by those nations&mdash; and there is no doubt who the King recognised by those nations is&mdash;within the meaning of the law declared in Article 24 was the King provided by the sub-section.</P>

      <P>That was an Act relating back to December 10th.  As I argued with the Minister&mdash;but I am <Col N="799" /> deducing the Minister's own argument &mdash;even if by accident, contrary to intention of the Legislature, it was to do what the Minister said, by virtue of the Article I have quoted, if the Minister's contention is right, if it was that sub-section (2) became unconstitutional and therefore vanished from our law notionally; the legal position here to-day is that sub-section (2) of Section 3 has notionally vanished from our law on the passing of our Constitution because of repugnancy and the Act which we are passing to-day consists of three sections, Sections 1, 2, 4, and Section 3 (1), sub-section (2) of Section 3 having gone.  That, I submit, is the actual legal position here to-day.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that would be sustained in a court of law, but I disagree with the Minister.  If I understand the Minister to say that we would have to wait for a declaratory order for a thing to be unconstitutional, I think it is a misstatement of the position completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the passing of this section is either consistent with the Constitution or repugnant to the Constitution.  If it is consistent with the Constitution it remains good law to-day, but if, on the other hand, it is repugnant to the Constitution it becomes void, not voidable at the option of the High Court, but void from the moment of passing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I join issue with the Minister on that.  From the passing of the Constitution anything repugnant to that Constitution went from that date.  However, I do not want to argue the point; I simply want my view on record and now that the Minister has <Col N="800" /> put his view on record let us leave it to the lawyers and the jurists to choose between them.  I assert as a proposition of law that if there is anything in the Minister's contention that sub-section (2) of Section 3 is unconstitutional, it is gone and we are not even repealing it to-day because in fact it was repealed from the date of the passing of the Constitution by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution.  I have gone on a little bit longer than I would wish.  I think I have answered the Minister's argument, but if the Minister is correct, nothing unconstitutional was done because it was permissible for the Government to use any agency. They used the agency permitted in sub-section (1) of Section 3.  It was not clear as to what sub-section 3 (2) meant &mdash;I am talking as a lawyer&mdash;but in practice, as this country and this House knew, we are all very clear as to where we stood.  Section 3 (1) is sufficient support of what has been done.  The net practical position is that everything has been right and legal up to this.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's view we are repealing an Act with one sub-section gone by virtue of the Constitution; according to others we are repealing the whole Act.  In any event, the Government might have used that agency and it was quite permissible.  If the Government wanted to do this themselves, if they did not want to give the power to the President, if they wanted to put the seal of the Government on documents instead of sending them to London, the Government could have done it without legislation at all, according to Article 29.  The reason that legislation is necessary arises under Section 3 of this Bill and I do not intend to anticipate possible discussion. I have only risen to develop the Minister's argument and to answer it and I particularly wanted to develop it to its logical conclusion on the hypothesis he adopted although I did not agree with that hypothesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>I think that probably the discussions that have taken place in this House this evening are an indication of the degree of confusion which seems to have existed even among people who have studied the provisions <Col N="801" /> of the Act.  I do not propose adding to the confusion beyond stating what my view of the legal position was under the Act.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 gives the force of law in Ireland to the Act of Abdication.  The Act of Abdication declares that King Edward VIII of Britain is King of Ireland.  The External Relations Act therefore gives the validity of law to that declaration and gives the force of Irish law to the declaration by the King of Britain that he was King of Ireland.</P>

      <P>From the 10th or 11th or from any date you like.  It does not matter.  Having declared in effect King Edward VIII of Britain to be King of Ireland, the sub-section then proceeds to provide for his succession:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That his successors shall henceforth be the person who, if his said Majesty had died on the 10th day of December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor according to the law of Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Opposition wants to quibble with me as to the difference between the word &ldquo;successor&rdquo; and &ldquo;succession&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point that was not dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition or by Deputy Vivion de Valera, and that is, the last few words of the sub-section.  I do not want to add to the discussion, but it would be interesting to know who would be the successor under the law of Saorstát Éireann.  To my mind, the clear effect of the provisions of that sub-section <Col N="802" /> was to make the King of Britain King of Ireland in so far as it was constitutional to do so.  I am not prepared to advance a definite opinion as to whether, under the then existing Constitution, it was constitutional or not.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree that it probably was, having regard to the fact that Article 1 of the Constitution, as it then was, provided that we were a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  There would, therefore, seem to me to be nothing inconsistent in recognising the King of Britain as the King of Ireland.  However, I do not think any useful purpose would be served by examining that position.  My view is that, whatever the position may have been up to 1937, the Act became unconstitutional as from the passing of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that a court would hold, if called upon to examine the position, that it was an Act that was divisible.  This matter has been discussed frequently in our courts on constitutionality issues and the courts have refused to dissect sections and declare a half section unconstitutional, or some words unconstitutional. They have usually declared either the Act as a whole to be unconstitutional or a part of the Act, where it is a long Act and where that part could be segregated into one compartment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In a constitutional case, the attitude the courts have taken is that they are not going to declare a sentence or a section or a sub-section unconstitutional.  They will take the body of the Act which deals with the matter which is unconstitutional and declare it unconstitutional. That matter was discussed at the time of the Trade Union Act.  It was probable that only one or two sections of Part III of the Act were unconstitutional, but the court declared the whole of Part III, which contained 30 or 40 sections, to be unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the Act as a whole.  I think it is in the realm of guess work that any court would divide a sub-section and say that that sub-section was unconstitutional and the rest was constitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the Statute Book and there are only two ways of getting rid of it: either a declaration by the courts or repeal by this House. The Constitution provides that the only court that can deal with it is the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>The Article states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Save as otherwise provided by this Article, the jurisdiction of the High Court shall extend to the question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of this Constitution, and no such question shall be raised (whether by pleading, argument or otherwise) in any court established under this or any other Article of this Constitution other than the High Court or the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Act remains law until it is declared to be unconstitutional.  I think that anything done under the Act remains constitutional.  Otherwise, you would be in the extraordinary position that an unconstitutional Act might be passed, as has been done by this House on a few occasions, and you might be leaving the Government of the day in a position where it might be amenable for having behaved illegally and unconstitutionally. Therefore, you have to deem it, unless you want to make them amenable for their breaches of the Constitution, to be the law and to have been constitutional until it is declared unconstitutional.  That is the law as it stands</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition when quoting from Professor Thrift stopped at the point at which he stopped.  I understood Deputy <Col N="804" /> de Valera to quote Professor Thrift for the purpose of using Professor Thrift's opinion to back up his own.  I think the Leader of the Opposition stopped at the words: &ldquo;That is all that this Bill does&rdquo;.  Professor Thrift went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not ratify any appointment and it does not make any appointment.  It deals entirely with functions, just as yesterday's Bill dealt with functions.  It was my contention yesterday&mdash;I have exactly the same view to-day&mdash;that removing the function did not remove the entity&mdash; that, although we have deprived the King of certain functions attached to him in our Constitution, the King remained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to destroy the value of that quotation in the sense in which it was used.  As to the question of whether there was any confusion as to whether or not this was a republic before the repeal of this Act, I think the best argument I can use is to rely on statements made by the Leader of the Opposition himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It did.  I am not going to use many quotations.  I will just refer to two.  In November, 1938, Deputy de Valera, who was then Taoiseach, speaking at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There may be obstacles of fact or on material or other grounds but there is no legal obstacle to your declaring a republic in the morning.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently he had no illusions at the time that we had not got a republic.</P>
      <P>He went on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann has only got to repeal the External Relations Act, 1936, and you have a complete republic in fact for this part of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A short time afterwards, Deputy de Valera, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 23rd November, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I for one am sorry because I feel that if we were able to say we are an independent republic there would <Col N="805" /> be none of this confusion which exists at the moment and which is helping to cause dissatisfaction and is, in a sense, a source of danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Presumably, these were Deputy de Valera's views in 1938.  I do not know that anything happened constitutionally since that would alter the set of facts upon which he had based those views then.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, in saying good-bye to this Act now, any useful purpose would be served by prolonging the discussion on the position which it created at the time it was enacted.  I am quite prepared to say that it may have served a useful purpose for a certain period, but I think there is agreement generally among all sections in the House that it no longer serves a useful purpose, and I think it would be a pity to try and justify it as something more than it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few words that I would like to say before we do pass it.  I assure you that I will be glad to see the end of it.  There was a very simple case.  It was: what were we allowed to do, and what were we doing?  We were allowed, if we wanted to and if we regarded it as good policy in the interests of our State and as a mark of our association, to draw up our Letters of Credence and get them signed by whom?  Not by the King of Ireland, but by a person who was a King, and because he was a King of other States&mdash;by the person who was the King of those States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Whom we had declared to be King of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Whom we had declared to have been King of Ireland. I will come to that again.  I am not a lawyer.  I am only a plain, blunt man with ordinary intelligence.  I hope that I am just able to read English and to interpret it in the ordinary way.  I learned just a little bit of the law from the good people who were my advisers over a period of years and got some idea of how lawyers' minds work, and of how the law is interpreted.  That is all I claim.  I do not want to get too much involved in the net of legalism, but I think I am able to get the layman's clear view of what is important in these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> With regard to the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; it was because he was the King of those States that he was chosen and because he was for them a symbol.  If we wanted we need not have used him. There was no suggestion at any time that anything we did was unconstitutional. It could not have been unconstitutional because, in my opinion, we could have used him if the External Relations Act was not there.  From the practical point of view, therefore, it did not arise.  The only case in which it could possibly arise was on the question as to what is our status&mdash;and whether we are genuinely a republic or not.  It was because of that vague sort of thing, I admit, that possibly too much precaution was taken.  It was that extra precaution that caused the trouble about somebody floating about, of a possible person as King of Ireland. That supposed possible person we never met in practice.  There was no other purpose and to suggest otherwise is completely devoid of any substance. In fact there was no such purpose. What did we do?  There was a King before December 10th.  He was there by law which we had to operate.  It was not a matter of our feelings.  It was the law of the State which we had to operate.  We had not then come to the position which we have arrived at to-day.  We had tried even with arms to prevent that position arising, and let nobody think that it was our will or desire that these things happened.</P>
    <P>On the 10th day of December there was a person who, according to the law which we had to operate at that time and which the courts would take eognisance of, a King who was King of Ireland.  That was the title, and that was a claim that had been accepted by the people who were responsible for the Constitution and for the position which we had inherited.  He was King of Ireland.  The question was: was this particular person to be imposed from outside, or a person that we would keep under control and get rid of if we wanted to?  We wanted to have it made quite clear&mdash;that is the reason why extra precautions were taken&mdash; that it was within our power to declare that he was abdicating in accordance with the law.  On the next day we finished that situation.  We took cognisance <Col N="807" /> of it on the 11th.  We finished him, or he finished himself as King, on the 10th.  We took note of that and on the 11th we passed these other Acts. That particular person, as an individual, could no longer claim in any sense whatever to have any kingly power, rights or authority here.</P>
    <P>He was gone.  Very well.  As I have pointed out, there were lawyers who held that that was quite sufficient, and that there was no need to take any notice whatever of the instrument of abdication.  The idea was to make assurance doubly sure, and also to make it quite clear that we could either put him up or pull him down&mdash;that is the King who was in the old Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>So we pulled him up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait awhile.  We could do either.  We did not put him up.  What we did was this: we indicated that the person that we were going to use as the statutory instrument was the particular individual who, but for the action which we had taken by knocking him out of Irish law, would have been his successor.  He would have been the individual who succeeded him because that particular person was the King of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  It was indicating him as the person who was King of those particular States.  That was our view. We were supported in that view by the law officers of the day though there were others who were in another Department who did not take that view.  We were simply appointing and nominating to perform these particular functions an individual who was no longer our King or in our law, but who was the King, and could be called the King, of those particular States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never had any doubt in my mind with regard to it.  I will admit that in these two cases I wished to have the matter clarified.  I feel that it would have been a good job for the country in the long run if what we are doing to-day had been done earlier.  I deliberately tried, by my attitude towards Deputy Norton, to force the Executive to bring in this.  I did so <Col N="808" /> with full malice if you like.  I tried to compel them because I believed it was going to be in the interests of the country that it should be done.  I believe that, not by opposing the doing of this now, we are going to get a degree of unanimity in doing it which could never be secured if we were on the other side.</P>
    <P>I want to say with regard to our status and with regard to the statements which I have made that they were in reference to the name republic. I did not want to have any controversy as to whether the republic only extended over Twenty-Six Counties and I did not want that the name itself should be brought into disrepute.  The Minister said that this is a republic for the whole of Ireland <i>de jure</i> and that <i>de facto</i> it only extends to the Twenty-Six Counties.  Because our jurisdiction is not made effective&mdash;at the moment you cannot make it effective&mdash;in regard to the Thirty-Two Counties, you will find people pointing a contemptuous finger at the republic of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I did not want that.</P>

One of the persons I saw recently attaching an epithet of contempt to it was the very person who, when he was a Deputy in this House, tried to force me into a position which, if I had agreed, would have caused a controversy throughout the country which would not be profitable.  I avoided that, I am glad, until we got unanimity. We would not have got that unanimity of viewpoint on any occasion I have seen up to the present.  The Minister stated, very nicely from a rhetorical viewpoint but in my opinion it was a lot of nonsense&mdash;I have not the paper by me at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Taoiseach on that point but I want to make the position clear as far as I am concerned.  I think it is only right and just that we ought to be clear on what we are doing.  I am as convinced as it is possible for any human being to be convinced that unquestionably we have been a republic since 1937.  In the interim period, I admit, certain people were raising doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were dealing <Col N="810" /> with the Constitution we deliberately took steps to try to remove even that possibility of doubt.  I shall deal now with the question of the head of State.  I do not know what the Minister means by that.  Does he want to suggest that every head of State has the same sort of functions?  The functions of a head of State are the functions that are given to him in the Constitution. As a matter of courtesy we call our President the head of State.  I doubt, however, if legally a person looking for the centre of authority would say that he is the individual. Such a person would rather say that the centre of authority resides in the Government's group.  I have, for instance, seen that it resides in the group of the Federal Council in the State of Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The next point is with regard to the King.  On that matter I am absolutely convinced that there has been no King in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next comes the question of association. The position was that we had got rid of allegiance.  It was, as far as I understand it from the 1926 declaration of the Imperial Conference, allegiance to the Crown.  The Crown was the bond and allegiance to the Crown was necessary.  We had repudiated allegiance.  Therefore we were wrong if we were to take 1926 as the basis.  But the British Government and the other Governments apparently took a different view.  I was quite content to let that situation rest for a while. This was 1937.  We had not settled a number of things then which we were able to settle afterwards.  I did not want to force that issue.  It did not matter a thraneen to me as long as we were prepared to have association what their view was provided that the bond was not the sort of bond that we had formerly.  I had good reason to believe, and I believe that it would have been so if it were not for the war, that there would have been quite a different development.  I believe that&mdash; the situation being a choice of one of two things, what you might call external members and the others&mdash;they would have expanded as they had expanded before, and allegiance as such and acceptance of the King as such <Col N="811" /> would not have been insisted upon as being the unifying symbol of the association.  I did not want to force that issue.</P>
    <P>I was asked two questions: (1) Are you a republic or not?  I gave an affirmative answer.  It is not right for the Minister to suggest that I was not able to answer in the affirmative. I said very definitely that we were a republic.  (2) Are you in the Commonwealth of Nations or are you out of it? That was not a question for me to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not answer that, did you?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you why I did not answer it and why I said I could not answer it.  I said that if allegiance as has been suggested by the 1926 declaration and the acceptance of the monarch is a condition of membership, then we are out&mdash;that is, as far as our judgment is concerned.  As far as their judgment was concerned they had said something different.  After seeing our Constitution and understanding the whole situation they said that it made no fundamental change. That being so, I did not want to force the issue.  I was prepared to leave it to them to make the decision and they did finally make the decision.  The decision arose ultimately as a result of the war situation.  I did not want to force it for two reasons.  The first was the point of view of the interests of the country.  I felt it was just as well to leave that situation as it was.  The second reason was that to do so would again cause a very bitter controversy in this country as to whether we were in or out.  We did that with the sanction of the people.  The results were there.  They knew.  If the results were those that the other people cared to wring forth from it I was quite content to let it go.  My belief is that that situation might have resolved itself in a different way from the situation as it is to-day if it were not for the war.  The answer to-day then is, and that answer has been quite clear for some time past, particularly in discussions with regard to nationality, that the position gradually became clear and that they <Col N="812" /> reversed.  We did not change our position. They said that the situation had not changed as regards our membership in 1937.  They changed their view afterwards and said that we were out.</P>
      <P>The position is clear that we are to-day a republic and that we have not any formal association with the States of the British Commonwealth.  We are no longer members, and any associations we have with them are of a type that are determined rather by the facts of our relations and not by any formal agreement.  That, in my opinion, is the situation to-day.  In so far as this Act helps to make that situation clear I am in favour of it.  I am in favour of it personally, irrespective of any views that may be held as to its value in other regards.  That is my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I want to make clear.  I misunderstood the Minister about constitutional law <i>vis-a-vis</i> the courts.  I want to correct the misunderstanding.  I quite agree that if a law is made to-day the determination of its constitutionality or otherwise is a matter for the courts and that anything done thereunder up to the time of such determination will be treated as valid.  The case I was making against the Minister really rests on Articles 48 and 50 of the Constitution when taken together.  If you take the Minister's contention that subsection (3) of Section 2 of the External Relations Act was repugnant, then by virtue of Article 50 only so much of that enactment will be taken over as is consistent with the Constitution. The presumption is that all laws, constitutional and otherwise, were impliedly repealed and the laws that were carried over notionally re-enacted by the passing of this Constitution. Article 50 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Laws enacted before, but expressed to come into force after, the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall, unless otherwise enacted by the Oireachtas, come into force in accordance with the terms thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I merely make that point in order to show that the Minister and I appear to be completely at loggerheads.</P>

      <P>I understand a question has been raised in the course of this debate as to whether the Act which the section proposes to repeal did bring the King back into Ireland or not. When doctors differ the results are unprofitable for the patients.  When lawyers differ prolonged discussion in the House may result; if that discussion leads to prolonged discussion in the courts it is profitable for the lawyers. In a matter of this kind, if there is any doubt as between one member of the Government and another, we should go to Cæsar.  I understand that the Minister for External Affairs has given to the House his opinion as to what the enactment of the External Relations Act did.  May I quote to the House the opinion of an even more eminent authority, the opinion of an erstwhile Attorney-General of this State and leader of the Bar and who is now Taoiseach?  Speaking on the Second Reading of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Bill, 1936, the Taoiseach&mdash;Deputy Costello as he then was&mdash;said at column 1431, Volume 64, of Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was perfectly clear to us that Section 3 (2) of the Bill as it stood yesterday, did not in any way not merely recognise but regularise the abdication of the King.  I indicated yesterday that we agree with the President that it was essential for the maintenance of the supremacy of this Parliament that we should ourselves pass a Bill dealing with the situation created by the abdication of the King.  I entirely disagree with the views put forward by Deputy Norton on this subject&mdash;that we are by our act to-day in a hurried fashion electing the British King as King of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I hope that the Ministers and Deputies of the House who have been misled by the arguments which have been used by the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;and other inexperienced Deputies&mdash;will take note of the considered opinion of the Taoiseach&mdash;Deputy Costello, as he then was.  May I repeat it: &ldquo;I entirely disagree with the views put forward by Deputy Norton on this subject&mdash;that we are by our act to-day in a hurried fashion electing the British King as King of Ireland&rdquo;?  Deputy Costello, as he then was, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are doing something in the exercise of our sovereign rights as a sovereign Parliament which we are entitled to do and which we ought to do, so long as we remain a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to whether we were or were not at that time a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations I do not know.  I am not, of course, a lawyer. At any rate Article 1 of the then Constitution still stood.  May I remind the House what strong republicans we were when this Constitution was passed?  In order to do that I propose to read Article 1 of the Constitution of 1922:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State, otherwise hereinafter, or sometimes, called Soarstát Éireann is a co-equal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish to burden the House or claim the indulgence of the Chair in quoting what the leading members of the then Opposition said in regard to Article 1 of the Constitution and the Treaty, of which it was the fruit and in the light of which it had to be construed. There were certainly most emphatic assertions from the Taoiseach, amongst others&mdash;Deputy Costello as he then was&mdash;from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan as he then was, and from the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Higgins as he then was.  There were most emphatic declarations that they stood and felt in honour bound to stand on Article 1 of the Constitution and the Treaty.</P>

In view of that am I not entitled to recall to the House the circumstances under which the External Relations Act became law, what it was proposed to do by that Act and what changes it made in the practice, procedure and executive power by which our foreign representatives had hitherto been accredited?  I do not wish to pursue that line at any great length.

      <P>I suggest I am entitled, having been challenged by the Taoiseach, to quote liberally from his speeches on that occasion.  I could quote very liberally, but I prefer, if I may, with your indulgence and the courtesy of the House, to continue in the words of the Taoiseach to demolish the thesis submitted to this House by his Minister for External Affairs, that the External Relations Act of 1936 brought the King back into Ireland.  I quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I entirely disagree with the views put forward by Deputy Norton on this subject&mdash;that we are by our act to-day in a hurried fashion electing the British King as King of Ireland. We are doing something in the exercise of our sovereign rights as a sovereign Parliament which we are entitled to do and which we ought to do, so long as we remain a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is his criticism of the procedure we adopted, and certainly it is not the type of criticism which one would expect from a very strong republican:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would have been more proper, I think, if instead of the procedure which was adopted yesterday to consider the question of a Bill dealing with the removal of the name of the King from the Constitution, that a Bill would have been brought in dealing solely and only with the situation created by the abdication of the King.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was made by Deputy Costello, on the Second Reading of the External Relations Bill, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" />&ldquo;A Bill comprising any section other that what will be comprised in this Bill in Section 3 (2) with the amendment which is to be proposed by the President is necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been holding himself up to the country as a person who has been always unreservedly opposed to the External Relations Act, as it is commonly called.  I propose to show here that, so far from being opposed to that Act, the Taoiseach, when he was Deputy Costello here in opposition, actually advocated it.  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If such a measure had been brought in yesterday, very little time would have been spent upon its consideration, and it would have been more in accordance with constitutional usage and practice if some arrangement had been come to with the countries of the British Commonwealth agreeing to this and agreeing that an instrument necessary to give ratification to the documents signed by the late King would come into operation simultaneously.&rdquo;</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello was arguing that a certain course should have been pursued on the previous day and he went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That would have been the proper procedure.  We were faced last night with the fact that the King had abdicated under the provisions of the British Parliament.  So far as this country is concerned, he has not abdicated yet.  That is not a situation that should have arisen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Costello found to criticise in the fact that we had not tried to act simultaneously with the British Parliament, that we had chosen to pursue a course which made it quite clear to everybody that we were acting independently of the British Parliament.  The Taoiseach, or Deputy Costello as he then was, made it quite clear that while the King had abdicated in Great Britain, the King under this Constitution had not yet abdicated in Ireland and therefore we <Col N="818" /> were not marching in step with the British Commonwealth, the British Government or indeed with any of the British Dominions; we were acting, more or less, on our own, acting as much on our own as we could, within the limitations imposed on us by this Constitution of 1922.  Deputy Costello then drew a moral and that moral, I think, was a correct one.  He drew the right conclusion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The very fact that we are here engaged on this Bill is in itself a very significant manifestation of the powers of this Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a manifestation of the powers of this Parliament that was made possible by a Fianna Fáil Government because, according to the remarks with which Deputy Costello had prefaced that statement, if a Fine Gael Government had been in power they would have been so anxious to assimilate their conduct with that of the British Commonwealth that they would have proceeded in quite a different way and they would not have manifested the powers of the Parliament in the singular way in which we did.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If anybody had said in 1925 that it would have been possible for the Parliament of any member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to pass on its own mere motion and of its own volition, legislation in any way dealing with the Crown or a section of the Crown, that would have been regarded not merely as a constitutional heresy but as something approaching high treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why were we in a position to do that? Why were we in a position to take the course in relation to the Bill that, according to Deputy Costello, would have been regarded as something approaching high treason?  Because the Fianna Fáil Administration in the year 1932 had set itself, of deliberate policy, to eviscerate that Constitution, to cut out of it every significant element in it that bound us up with British constitutional practice.  If it had not been for the fact that, despite the opposition, against the opposition of Fine Gael on the preceding day, we had removed the King and every iota of British association from that Constitution, <Col N="819" /> except Article 1, we would not have been in the position to take action which Deputy Costello held would have been regarded by British constitutional lawyers in other days as something approaching high treason.</P>
    <P>Proceeding later in the course of his speech, Deputy Costello&mdash;I must try to make quite clear that I am speaking now of the Taoiseach, not as holding his present office, but as a leading member of the Opposition, and, with your indulgence, Sir, and with his permission, I will continue henceforward to refer to the Taoiseach as Deputy Costello, for the purpose of making quite clear the capacity in which he was speaking&mdash;said, on 12th December, 1936:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 3 is a most extraordinary section....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the members of Clann na Poblachta are not here to listen to this, because they have been the principal propagators of the falsehood that the King was enshrined in our Constitution, of the lie that we had brought the King back and that this country, by virtue of the External Relations Act, had been made subject to Great Britain.  There is not one of those who sent men to death on that hypothesis here to listen to this exposition of the constitutional position by Deputy Costello. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 3 is a most extraordinary section and I am not at all sure that on its strict legal construction, it may not have the effect which would, I am sure, be very welcome to some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and some of their supporters throughout the country.  In fact, the effect of this Bill&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here we see where an epigram was coined&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which is to give us half a Crown is that it gives no Crown at all...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, on the Second Reading of the Bill, was talking about a crown on the brow and a half-crown on the brow, and he thought that Ireland would be better with no Crown at all.  His colleague sitting on the front Fine Gael Bench in 1936 <Col N="820" /> thought the effect of the External Relations Act of that year was to give us no Crown at all, so what was all the pother about when the Minister for Defence was speaking?  If the purpose, the avowed purpose, of the repeal of this Act is to give us no Crown at all, we had reached that position on 12th December, 1936, according to Deputy Costello, now Taoiseach.  He gave his reason for that conclusion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...for the phrase in Section 3 (1) which purports to confer functions on the King in external affairs may in fact have the effect of there being no King at all in this country because the authority that is conferred upon the Crown by Section 3 (1) subsists only so long as the King, represented by these nations, namely, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and South Africa as the symbol of their co-operation, continues to act on behalf of each of those nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is where Deputy Costello brought in his favourite hypothesis and I think there is a great deal in it, because, remember, as we have been told, the phrase &ldquo;symbol of their co-operation&rdquo; was deliberately chosen.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are only authorising the King to act on our behalf so long as the nations of the Commonwealth recognise the King as their symbol of co-operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to point out that the King, as he had long argued on the previous day, was not their symbol of co-operation, but their symbol of association.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We propose solemnly to pass an Act of this Dáil stating that we will allow the King to act for us in external affairs so long as the other nations recognise him as the symbol of their co-operation.  But they do not recognise the King as a symbol of their co-operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here was his conclusion, the conclusion of the man who is now Taoiseach, the man who had helped to draft constitutions, who had helped to smash constitutions and therefore a lawyer whose opinion must carry a great deal of weight in constitutional affairs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, this Act never can <Col N="821" /> come into effective operation and, therefore, the King cannot act at all in external affairs with the authority of this Bill, when it becomes an Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the answer which the Taoiseach gave 12 years ago almost to a day&mdash;12 years ago to 12 days, as we are now discussing this Bill on 1st December, 1948.  Twelve years ago, on 12th December, 1936, the Taoiseach scoffed at the argument which has been submitted to this House by his Minister for External Affairs.  He sneered at it and he told Deputy Norton, his present Tánaiste, that he was talking nonsense when he said that we were then, in a hurried fashion, electing the British King as King of Ireland.  It seems to me that that canard has been disposed of, at any rate.  There was never any substance in it.  So far from electing the King of Great Britain as King of Ireland, we were taking some monarch&mdash;and he was not the King of Great Britain; he was a functionary, if you like, who was recognised by five nations as the symbol of their association, they said; we had another phrase for the relationship&mdash;the effect of which may very well have been that which Deputy Costello so emphatically expressed 12 years ago&mdash;&ldquo;the symbol of their co-operation&rdquo;.  But the King to be used was not the King of Great Britain <i>per se</i>, nor the King of Canada nor the King of Australia <i>per se.</i>  He was the King who was recognised by these States as the symbol of their co-operation, and we did not bring him back here into Ireland, nor did we elect him King of Ireland.  We used him merely as an organ or instrument for giving effect to Irish Government policy.  We used him in the same way as we might use a lawyer, if we retained him and asked him to act for us, or as we might use a builder, or a scribe, and indeed as one might use a rubber stamp.  That is precisely the position the King was in under this External Relations Act and there was nothing that infringed Irish sovereignty, either in internal or external affairs, in any provision of that Act.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to repeal the External Relations Act.  What did that Act do internally?  It did to a certain <Col N="822" /> extent, by the will of this Parliament, impose conditions upon the Government in relation to the exercise of the powers given to the Government by sub-article 4 of Article 29 of the Constitution. I do not know whether any of the Deputies who are pretending to be greatly concerned with the External Relations Act have read that Article or not.  I advise them to read it and study it and study it very carefully. Sub-clause 2 of Clause 4 of Article 29 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here is a very important phrase&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international co-operation in matters of common concern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The critical words, I think, in that Article are: &ldquo;Subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law&rdquo;.  At the present moment the only law which prescribes the conditions of the exercise of that power is the External Relations Act.  Repeal that Act, as you are doing, and the Government can use whoever they like, outside the State or inside it, without qualification.  I say that on the assumption that Section 3 of the Bill will become law.  If Section 3 and the Bill as a whole become law, without any significant amendment, the position will be that the Government under the Constitution may use anyone they like for the purpose of exercising any executive authority of the State in connection with its external relations. That opens up a fairly wide range of possibility.  Of course somebody will say that they are limited to some extent by Clause 5 of the Article which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every international agreement to <Col N="823" /> which the State becomes a party shall be laid before the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>but I think the Government can be considered apart from the State.  The Government is a separate, corporate personality.  The Government can be changed or overthrown; the State remains the same; the State is not overthrown.</P>
    <P>It would be quite possible, at least I think it would be arguable, that the Government could enter into an agreement which would bind its members in honour and in conscience.  Remember, we had a civil war fought, with ten years of domestic turmoil, because men felt that they were bound in honour by the letter of the Treaty and by the Constitution which flowed from the Treaty.  It is possible therefore, for the Government composed of such men &mdash;I think all Governments should be composed of men who regard their word as their bond&mdash;to enter into an arrangement whereby some other person, some person external to this State, would act for them in external affairs.  It seems to me it is possible and as I have said it opens up a wide range for apprehension and fear.</P>
    <P>I have wondered why it was that the Government decided, apparently so suddenly, to repeal this External Relations Act.  I have ventured to express an opinion as to what did happen.  I may have been right and I may have been wrong but I see nothing to allay my suspicions in relation to the matter.  I certainly see nothing to explain away the statement of the present Minister for External Affairs that no mandate had been given by the country to repeal this Act.  That appeared to be the view taken by the Minister for External Affairs and the other Parties to the Coalition of the 18th February of this year.  Apparently a change took place, a change which has not yet been explained to the public.  I think it is not without significance that that change should first have been bruited or mooted in this House at the end of August by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare. Perhaps I might not be permitted by the Chair to express the significance I attach to it, but those <Col N="824" /> who know what I have been saying about the relations between the Tánaiste and other members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I only just want to ask, and I think I am entitled to ask, why it has <Col N="825" /> been decided to repeal the External Relations Act in view of what the Taoiseach said 12 years ago and of what the Minister for External Affairs said on the 18th February.  What is going to be the effect, under Article 29 of the Constitution?  In future the power and authority of the Government&mdash;not of the State, because the State is bound by Clause 5&mdash;is not to be determined or limited by law.  The executive functions in external relations can be discharged by any person they choose. They can use any person they like to perform their executive functions in relation to external affairs.  They could, for instance, select the chairman of the Politbureau of the Soviet Union to express their views at the United Nations Organisation.</P>

      <P>They could choose the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to express their views there.  Under the Constitution, as it stands, the Government could choose anyone because they are now removing the one factor that made certain that the people would know who, if not the Government, was going to do certain things in relation to external affairs.  I think we shall find when this Bill becomes law, as no doubt it will become law, that it will be necessary for Parliament, in order to protect itself and the people, to insist that a Bill shall be brought in to determine the conditions under which the Government may exercise this power under Article 29. It may be essential that that should be done.  I think that when we do bring it in, some of the people who are thinking that this External Relations Act infringed the sovereignty of the Irish people will get a salutary disillusionment. They will realise that, so far from affecting the sovereignty of the Irish people, the External Relations Act made the authority of this Parliament unchallenged, that it prevented the exercise of the executive function in external affairs from being abused by a Government that might be inclined, behind the backs of the Irish people, to enter into such commitments with other Governments as would fetter the discretion and prevent the free <Col N="826" /> exercise of judgment by that Government should a crisis arise.</P>

      <P>Section 2.</P>
      <P>1.  In line 28, before the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann or in the English language.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment that was put down was not precisely in the form that I said it had been my intention to introduce by way of official amendment on the Committee Stage.  I had intended to put down an amendment providing that Section 2 should read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be, in the Irish language, &lsquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rsquo; and, in the English language, &lsquo;The Republic of Ireland.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not quite the same as the form of the amendment that Deputy Lehane has down.  It is very near it but there is rather a significant change.  In the amendment put down by Deputy Lehane he has not the words that I had &ldquo;in the Irish language&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann.&rdquo;  Having taken advice on this matter from the Attorney General and the Draftsman, I was advised that it would not be proper to put down the words in the amendment.  The point that I wished to cover was that when you were speaking English you would refer to the description of the State as &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and when you were speaking Irish you would refer to it as &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann.&rdquo;  I wanted to see that the kind of malicious jokes that have been made on the subject of Eire and the other matters that I referred to on the Second Stage of this Bill should not be possible by <Col N="827" /> reference to the description of this State as &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The draftsman and the AttorneyGeneral have advised me and the Government that, by reason of the fact that this Bill is being enacted in both languages, it might cause confusion, would be tautological and, in any event, it ought not to be done; that in addition to that, it would be a departure from the pattern that has been followed in the Constitution which is enacted in Irish and English and that, accordingly, it should not be done for that reason also.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will refer, for instance, to Article 25 (5) they will find that in a Bill of this kind which is enacted in both languages, both texts are conclusive evidence, so that when you look at the Irish text you have the Irish description of the State, as Poblacht na hÉireann, and when you look at the English text you have &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  In other words, you are doing scientifically and in accordance with the pattern adopted in the Constitution and other articles what I had intended to do by the amendment I was thinking of putting down.  Article 25 (5) provides that where the President has signed the text of such law in each of the official languages both texts shall be conclusive evidence of the provisions of such law.  It is only in case of conflict that the Irish language prevails. There can be no conflict in this because they are both describing the same.  Conflict connotes a different meaning but the two texts we propose to pass have the same meaning.  Therefore, if you do anything like this, you are only introducing confusion.</P>
    <P>That is what I am advised would be the effect of this and, if Deputies look at some of the other Articles, they will see that that was what was done in the Constitution.  Article 34 (4) 1º, for instance, deals with the courts and deals with the name of the courts and in the Irish version the title of the Court of Final Appeal is given in the Irish language as &ldquo;An Cuirt Uachtarach&rdquo;. In the English language it is &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  So that you have the English version, &ldquo;the <Col N="828" /> Supreme Court&rdquo; and the Irish version, &ldquo;An Cuirt Uachtarach&rdquo;.  If this amendment was followed out in this pattern you would have to call the Court of Appeal &ldquo;An Cuirt Uachtarach&rdquo; or in the English language the Supreme Court.  There are several other Articles in which the same design is followed and, accordingly, I was convinced that the scheme as settled in the Bill at the moment being enacted both in the Irish language and English language is the proper one to adopt. People outside this country who may be disposed to jeer at our State, as they have done before in connection with the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;, will look at this and see that in the English text&mdash;which is the only one they can understand&mdash;of this statute, when it is a statute, the description of the State is &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and that is what they are to call it.  I want to stop any further nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was of Deputy Lehane's opinion at the start, and that is why when the Taoiseach mentioned the other thing that I said to him that he did not quite catch my point.  A reason for this would be if one wanted to bring in the use of the name Poblacht na hÉireann into ordinary speech, as the words &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; have been brought into ordinary speech. Although I would like to see as many Irish words as possible come into the institutions of our State, I came to the conclusion that the Taoiseach is taking a better view.  I think it is better for us in this case not to bring the Irish word into the English text; it is better to keep the English appellation, the English description, in the English text for some of the reasons the Taoiseach has mentioned.  I am afraid that nothing we can do will prevent enemies from jibing at us.  Jibing is a very convenient substitute for arguments of various kinds and even when we have done this we will have to face jibes. This is simply a description of the State and declaring that the State shall be described in a particular manner and I think it is better to leave the English text standing as it stands and have the Irish text with the Irish term in it as the two are being enacted <Col N="829" /> simultaneously.  Therefore, I would be against the amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment was dictated by the desire to give the sanction of law to the appellation or description Poblacht na Eireann.  It was with that end in view the amendment was put down.  At the stage when the amendment was put down, I understood that there might be some technical difficulty in the way of preparing for the Committee Stage of the Bill the Irish translation, and of passing the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas in the Irish language.  As the Government have decided to pass the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas in the Irish language and inasmuch as that will give the force of law and legal sanction to the words Poblacht na hEireann, I do not propose to persist in this amendment.</P>

I am voting for this in the belief that we are doing nothing more than declaring that this is the true description of the State, a description which I am glad we are all now agreed on.  Others may approach this matter from a different point of view but I am supporting it because I am of the opinion that it is an existing fact. It is a description of the State as it exists.  It is not proclaiming a new State or anything of that sort and I am in favour of it on that account.</P>

      <P>I do not wish at this stage to oppose the Bill or any part of it any further, but I must say that this section left me very puzzled. I think that the better view is that of Deputy de Valera, that what we are proposing to do here is to describe a republic which exists.  If we are to accept the Constitution of 1937, Article 5 of which says that Ireland is a sovereign democratic State, then we have a constitutional declaration that Ireland is a republic.  Why we should want to put it into an Act as well as <Col N="830" /> into the Constitution I do not know. I do not know what the effect of it is. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's views on this question.  I would have thought that if we wanted to establish the fact of the republic in this way, a better thing would have been to bring in a short Bill to amend the Constitution, Article 5, to read: &ldquo;Ireland is a republic.&rdquo;</P>

I disagree entirely with Deputy Byrne that the better opinion is what Deputy de Valera says.  I fundamentally disagree with both views, but we are going to pass this and so let us not talk about it any more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a point in the Constitution or is it not?  If this State is not capable by its characteristics of being described as a republic, you cannot, by a simple declaration here, make it so.  By the Constitution, this is either a republican State or it is not. If it is not, you cannot describe it to be such.  If it is, you simply make a declaration in the most formal way you can make a declaration.  I am taking that one is correct and you could not do it if it were not.

If I were inclined to play politics, it is a different <Col N="831" /> line I would take.  I am simply out to see that the view held here and as a result of which action has been taken by this State on a certain assumption goes on record as our view.  I believe that we are a republic and that you are doing nothing now that will constitute the State more a republic than it was.  I want to put on record that I am voting for this because I believe it to be a declaration in accordance with fact.  My only regret is that we are doing this when the work is only half done.  I wish that this declaration, this clarification of the position, had come when our work was completed.</P>
      <P>From a constitutional point of view the question was raised whether description and name are the same. They are quite distinct in my mind.  A name is a name.  Pat Murphy is Pat Murphy.  It is his name.  He may be a big man or he may be a small man but his name is the distinction I make in my mind.  I would be greatly surprised if any common-sense individuals were going to declare it to be otherwise. From that point of view I have no doubt of it and from the other point of view I believe it is constitutional, because it is in accord with the position as it is.</P>

There was a situation existing and I was, so to speak, thinking aloud and saying that it might be a very good thing if there were no talk about our status and if there were a declaration.

If it is contended that this <Col N="833" /> State at this moment, before this Bill is enacted, is not a republic, perhaps I might be permitted, with the indulgence of the Chair, to show, by contrast with what preceded it, that it has every attribute of a republic, that it has every appearance of a republic, that it is a republic in form and a republic in character; that it is essentially a republican State and cannot be, by any process of reasoning, put under any other category.</P>
      <P>There is not a standard form of republic.  France is a republic.  But the various organs of Government in the present Republic of France do not conform in any way to the American model.  The Confederation of Switzerland is a republic and differs radically both from the United States of America and the French Republic, and our State no doubt does, in accidental features, but not in essentials, differ from all these.</P>
      <P>What are the marks of a republican State?  First of all, in order that it should be a State at all, it should be sovereign and it should be independent; it should be democratic; and whoever is the symbol of the State should be chosen by some body of electors who are responsible to the general body of the citizens.  That is to say, that in a republic as we understand it to-day the first citizen, the person who in the minds of the people symbolises the sovereignty and authority of the State, is chosen directly by the people or indirectly by the people through some agents given power to act on their behalf.  In the case of this country, the head of the State is directly chosen by the people.</P>
      <P>In the case of the United States, the head of the State, in theory at any rate, though I grant you the practice has become very different, is chosen by a College of Electors representing, not the people immediately, but the States which return electors to that college. But the essential feature is that the head of the State is chosen and derives his authority, and his prestige, and his status, and his precedence directly or indirectly from the people.</P>
      <P>That is the position under our Constitution. Article 13 of our Constitution prescribes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" />&ldquo;There shall be a President of Ireland, hereinafter called the President, who shall take precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we want to know how radically different our Constitution is, say, from a monarchial constitution or a constitution which derives from a monarchy or enshrines the monarchial principle, all we have to do is to turn to Article 60 of the Constitution of 1922 and there we shall see this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be a representative of the Crown in Ireland who shall be styled the Governor-General of the Irish Free State and shall be appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice of making such appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might better illustrate what I am saying by turning to Article 12 of the old Constitution which is a very important Article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The next characteristic that we might consider is the relationship between the head of a State, the chief functionary in a State, and the Legislature.  In America, the President is the Chief Executive.  He cannot make laws and he cannot introduce legislative proposals to Congress.  He can merely recommend them.  In France, I think, as it stands at the moment, the President can neither make laws nor recommend them.  In our case, we have a President who is in precisely that position.  He cannot make laws and he cannot recommend any legislative proposals to the Legislature. In Great Britain, the head of the State there&mdash;a monarch&mdash;does, in theory at any rate, indicate that his advisors have convinced him that it would be desirable to submit to Parliament, from time to time, certain legislative proposals.  In America, the President, I think, is not a member of Congress.  Neither is the President of the Republic of France a member of the legislative Assembly.  In Great Britain, of course, the King is a constituent part of the Parliament.  In our Constitution we have this statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The National Parliament shall be called and known, and is in this Constitution generally referred to, as the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall consist of the President and two Houses, viz.: a House of representatives to be called Dáil Éireann and a Seanad to be called Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a feature of our Constitution. Our President has certain functions in the Oireachtas, but let me repeat again, not the function of making or recommending legislative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that he is going very far from the question before the Committee with this dissertation on constitutional law.  He is going very far from <Col N="837" /> what might be considered relevant to the section.  I have allowed him to proceed to a certain point in regard to similarities between the Constitution of this State and the United States to show that this State is a republic. Surely, he is not going to tell us about the attributes or characteristics of every State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a very good illustration of a republican State is to show what its antithesis is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot contrast every conceivable form of State with this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could if the Chair would permit me.  The Chair has already debarred me from following that line.  I think I could contrast it with an example with which we are all familiar, with the State which existed here in the period 1922 to 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to allow the Deputy to go back on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I am not going to pursue that line.  Take again the question of executive power. There is no general formula except that, in monarchies, executive power is generally vested in the monarch.  In this State, Clause 2 of Article 28 of the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Clause 4 of Article 29 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations shall in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is our position here.  In virtually every monarchial State the executive power is vested in Parliament or in the Government responsible to Parliament, but in theory at any rate, it is vested in the monarch as Head of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here under Article 13 the Head of the Government is appointed by the <Col N="838" /> President of the State.  Clause 1 of Article 13 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann, appoint the Taoiseach, that is, the Head of the Government or Prime Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In monarchial States the Prime Minister, whoever he may be, is appointed by the sovereign, whose prerogative, in theory, is to appoint the person who shall be responsible to the Parliament for the exercise of executive powers. In this State of ours he is appointed by the President elected by the people. In other States which differ greatly from ours, which are of quite a different character from ours, he is appointed by the monarch.  The actual right of selection even may rest in the monarch and in certain cases it is the jealously guarded prerogative of the monarch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

I have already said on the Second Reading of this Bill that this State remains precisely the same after the passing of this Bill in form and in character as it is now.  All that the Taoiseach is doing is equivalent to sticking a poster on the Parnell monument in order that Deputies, like some of those who came into the House recently may know where they are; that is all.  Article 25 provides that: &ldquo;As soon as any Bill ... shall have been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Taoiseach shall...&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I submit that that does not matter.  After all, I am representing my constituents in this House. I am responsible to them for what I do in this House.  I am entitled to give to other members of this House, my colleagues and those who are opposed to me and my constituents, the reasons why I feel called upon to vote for Section 2 of this Bill.  That is my attitude. I can only stand up for it and proceed upon the lines which I have already taken.  This is a democratic Assembly, <Col N="842" /> I understand.  I understand we come here to express our views and to give reasons for our views and for what we do.  I am entitled to give reasons for the view I take that Section 2 of this Bill is a section that should be supported by my vote.  But apparently that attitude does not meet with the acceptance of certain members of this democratic Assembly.</P>

About this time 25 years ago the Minister for External Affairs and I were in an internment camp in Newbridge enjoying the hospitality of <Col N="844" /> General Mulcahy, now Minister for Education, for endeavouring to prevent the overthrow of this republic that is being re-established to-day.</P>

      <P>For a couple of years after that I did not hear from the Minister for External Affairs.  In 1926 a general order was given for the capture of Garda barracks.  We in Cork did our bit.  We captured two barracks. When we looked at the papers subsequently in jail we discovered we were the only fools in the country; no one else moved, even the General had forgotten to take his own barrack.  I joined the Irish Volunteers in September, 1914.  After this I had to make up my mind as to whether I would or would not continue the fight.</P>

      <P>The section states the description of the State will be the &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  I intend to prove that this republic was established in 1937, or even 1936.  We had abolished the Oath of Allegiance to the King of England.  We had abolished the Governor-General.  We had enacted a Constitution which the Taoiseach told us last Wednesday put us out of the Commonwealth.  What were we if we were not a republic?  I think there is no necessity for this Bill.  All the Deputies opposite tramped the country in 1937 asking the people to vote against that Constitution, including the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>With regard to this section, I would like to say a few words, a very few words, indeed.  The discussion has been very restricted here, on this section at least.  I hope I may be allowed to explain why I will vote for this section.  I do so, not with any enthusiasm or excitement, because in the last analysis all that is being done here to-night is the nailing up of a nameplate on an edifice built between the years 1932 and 1947.  I should like to express myself on this measure because I think there is a certain untimeliness about it, a certain unseemliness about it and possibly a certain lack of morality about it.  This name plate&mdash;and it is nothing more&mdash;is distasteful to some small section of the people, but that small section has been the main support of the Fine Gael Party.  I refer to the ex-Unionists in this country.  I think it was rather mean of Fine Gael to keep that name plate hidden in the folds of their Commonwealth mantle and then to produce it surreptitiously&mdash;at least to produce it in Canada rather than in Dáil Éireann for the first time.</P>

They have now discovered that it is a magnificent edifice and they are claiming not only the name plate but the edifice itself.  It is an edifice to which they did not contribute one brick in the building and to which they have not added one brick since they came into office.</P>

    <P>Members of Fianna Fáil, at any rate, are realists.  They believe in the substance. They do not worry too much about words and that is why they gave the people the substance, the real thing&mdash;in a word, the republic.  We are not offering any resistance to this section or this measure as a whole.  Who can blame us for a lack of enthusiasm and excitement?  Who can blame the people for their lack of interest?

      <P>I take it the Deputy is debating amendments Nos. 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They all hang together.  One of the objectionable features of the Act which we are proposing to abolish was the power it contained to have our representatives abroad appointed by the British King. It was stated, and I think it is the intention of the Government, that that position will be remedied and the power given to the President.  I feel that the Bill as drafted and submitted does not contain that power explicitly. Article 13 of the Constitution prescribes the President's powers and sub-Article 10 of that Article says that additional powers and functions may be conferred on the President by law.  The Bill, in Section 3, provides that the President, on the authority and on the advice of the Government, may exercise the executive power or any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations.  Substantially, that is the power given by the Constitution to the Government. Article 29 (4) (i) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations, shall in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Constitution gives to the Government that power, and, if Section 3 were passed as it is, we would purport or endeavour to transfer these powers to the President, admitting, of course, that the President must exercise his functions in accordance with the advice and on the authority of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that this Bill should be a Bill to give specific powers to the President in accordance with Article 13 of the Constitution.  Accordingly, I have provided that the power to appoint diplomatic representatives of Ireland in other countries and the power to appoint consular representatives of Ireland in other countries are hereby conferred on the President.  I believe it is necessary to provide in the statute specifically that the power is conferred on the President, so that these powers <Col N="851" /> will be valid powers in accordance with Article 13.  Article 13 (11) provides that no power or function conferred on the President by law shall be exercisable or performable by him save only on the advice of the Government, so that if the President is given the powers I have set out in the amendment, these are not autocratic powers but powers in accordance with the Constitution which can be exercised by him only on the advice of the Government.  I hope the amendment will be accepted by the Government, because I think it right, when we have changed this power of appointing representatives, that it should be very clearly written into this measure that the power is now vested in the President and will be exercised by him on the advice of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government cannot accept these amendments because they are advised that each of these amendments would be unconstitutional. Accordingly, I must ask the House to reject them, or persuade Deputy Cowan, if I can do so, to withdraw them.  The particular Section 3 of this Bill was drafted with very great care and with the relevant provisions of the Constitution very strictly in front of the draftsman and other advisers.  It could possibly be said with truth that there are certain words in the section which are tautological.  The words &ldquo;on the advice of the Government&rdquo; might not necessarily be there, because Article 13 of the Constitution would operate on the section without those words being specifically inserted, but the view was taken that, as people reading this Bill might not be so familiar with the details of the Constitution, and particularly as it is a new Bill, there should appear on the face of the document what would be implicitly there in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that aspect of the case, the amendments put down by Deputy Cowan do not take any cognisance of the distinction which appears throughout the Constitution between powers and functions.  Furthermore, the amendments appear to be in definite conflict with Article 28 (2) of the Constitution which Article is repeated and <Col N="852" /> applied expressly to the executive power of the State in reference to external affairs by Article 29 (4).  The Government has been advised by the Attorney-General that the proposed amendments would conflict with those Articles.  I think everything that Deputy Cowan wishes to achieve by his amendments is achieved in fact by the provisions of Section 3 as drafted.  The powers must, of course, be conferred expressly upon the President.  That is what Section 3 proposes to do, but it proposes to do it safeguarding the constitutional requirements of the authority and power being vested in the Government and exercisable on their authority and advice in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is this practical difficulty in facing the amendments put down by Deputy Cowan, that in accordance with international usage, certain of the diplomatic representatives are not appointed by a head of State.  There is also the case of treaties.  The normal practice at the moment in international affairs is not to have heads of State treaties.  The old practice which subsisted in the days before the two world wars rather favoured heads of State treaties. Modern international practice favours inter-Governmental treaties.  Trade treaties are entered into and trade agreements are negotiated and concluded between Governments and not between heads of State.  The effect of Deputy Cowan's proposals would be to make every international act exercisable by the head of the State, which is not in accordance with international usage.</P>
    <P>Ambassadors, Ministers and Consuls-General are appointed by the Head of the State and it is intended that that practice shall be continued.  Consular Officials, Chargés d'Affaires, officials of that kind, are appointed by the Minister for External Affairs and it is proposed that that practice, which is a well recognised international practice, should be continued.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, practical reasons connected with international practice, and above all from the point of view of constitutional requirements, the amendments could not be accepted.</P>

      <P>The position of the Taoiseach clearly is that he is advised by the Attorney-General that this is unconstitutional and certainly I am not going to press it, but it does seem to me on Section 3&mdash;I endeavoured to get over the difficulties in Section 2&mdash;that the same objection arises.  Section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President, on the authority and on the advice of the Government, may exercise the executive power or any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems to contain the same defects as the particular amendment that I put down.  I hoped that, having disposed of His Britannic Majesty, we would have availed of this Bill to give clearly to the President those powers that were given to the British King.</P>

      <P>Apparently, from the speech which Deputy Cowan has made, he thinks that Section 3 is necessary because in some way something we have done has disposed of his Britannic Majesty.  Nothing in this Bill has disposed of his Britannic Majesty.  All this <Col N="854" /> Bill has done is two things&mdash;to declare that the description of the State shall be The Republic of Ireland and to free the hands of the Government in relation to its conduct of external affairs.

It did not direct the Government to do that.  If the Government did it, it did so of its own volition, because it thought it advisable, in the circumstances of the time, to do it.  There was no question of His Britannic Majesty. In fact, he has never been in the Constitution of 1937.</P>

      <P>It has been stated on the Second Reading that the 21st January, 1949, would be an appropriate date for this Act to come into operation.  I gathered from the Taoiseach that there were some little technical difficulties in the way.

      <P>In answer to Deputy Cowan, I would like to assure the House that it is the earnest desire of <Col N="856" /> the Government to have this Bill in full operation at the earliest possible date. There may be certain points arising which will require legislation in the British Parliament, as possibly here also.  I mentioned one item to Deputy Cowan the other day outside&mdash;reference to &ldquo;His Majesty's Dominions&rdquo; and things of that kind.  There may be other more fundamental ones, not of any serious import but which have a practical bearing upon the new situation here.  These things will have to be examined and it is a question whether legislation can be got through in the British Parliament before the 21st January or not.  We are endeavouring to the best of our ability to hurry up matters so as to get this Bill into immediate operation and prevent any suggestion being made that we are not doing what should be done and also allay any possible uneasiness that may arise by reason of delay.  I assure the Deputy that this Act will come into operation at the earliest possible moment.  We cannot say whether it will be the 21st January or any other specific date.  The Minister for External Affairs has been in touch with the British Government, with a view to expediting matters and getting the Act into operation.</P>

      <P>May I say, as my name is also to this amendment, that I was anxious that the 21st January, if at all possible, should be the date fixed for bringing this Bill into operation.  I would still appeal to the Government to try to have the Bill brought into operation on that date in view of the fact that so many claims have been put forward during the debate as to the individuals or sections responsible for bringing the republic into being.  There have been so many dates mentioned in our life-time as those on which the republic was declared, or attempted to be declared, that it would be a pity if we handed on to posterity all this confusion as to the date to be recognised as that on which the republic was declared. We have heard of 1916 and 1919.  Then there was a date mentioned in 1937 and now we have dates mentioned in 1948 and 1949.  I would appeal to the <Col N="857" /> Government if at all possible to bring the Bill into operation on the 21st January next, that is the 30th Anniversary of the declaration of the republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I also suggested the 21st January as an appropriate date but I have been thinking about the matter since and, if there is any suggestion of making the day a public holiday, I think that that would be a very bad time.  It is desirable in this case if possible to choose a date which would be a holiday for other reasons also.  If you grant a further holiday, it may lead to all sorts of difficulties in regard to stoppage of work and matters of that kind, and to declare the 21st January a holiday may be a difficult thing.</P>
      <P>It is a bad time of the year for a holiday and I was wondering whether the alternative date suggested, Easter Monday, might not be a better date. That goes back to the Proclamation of 1916.  The choice of that date would indicate that it was the day on which the republic was originally proclaimed. Our view was&mdash;and I think it was shared by other Parties in the House&mdash; that there was a declaration of the republic in 1916, and that what was done in 1919 was to ratify, by the votes of the people&mdash;a very important event in itself&mdash;the Proclamation of 1916.  It is, therefore, a choice between the date which I would generally refer to if I were speaking about Independence Day, the 21st January, and Easter Monday.  I am assuming that there is no immediate urgency about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I at first thought that we should have an early date and that if the Act were going through, the sooner it was brought into operation the better and that January 21st was not too distant.  I felt that there were certain adjustments that would have to be made of one kind or another.  So far as the other date, Easter Monday, is concerned, that would not offer any difficulty for the Government in regard to making the day a holiday.  Somebody may say that we are depriving people of an extra holiday.  School <Col N="858" /> children, for instance, may have some views of that kind, but I think this will have to be dealt with on a different basis.  You cannot introduce State holidays at will.  Many considerations have to be remembered in regard to these things, and, on reconsideration of the whole matter, if I had to vote now I would vote for Easter Monday.  If the Government cannot bring it into operation on the 21st January and if they are inclined to choose some other date, I would be in favour of selecting Easter Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make a suggestion which I think has not yet been offered in the course of the debate.  I must confess that, while I am glad that Section 2 is enshrined in the Bill and while I know it is based, in theory, upon Article 2 of the Constitution which declares that &ldquo;the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its island and its territorial seas&rdquo;, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the city in which I was born, where some of my relatives still live, and other parts of the national territory, are not under the sovereignty of this Parliament.  While I am accepting the declaration enshrined in Section 2 of the Bill, I must accept it with the reservations that a realistic man feels when faced with facts.  For that reason, I am inclined to think that the date mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition and the other dates which have been mentioned do not quite meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil which met in January, 1919, and affirmed or ratified the proclamation of the Republic of 1916, was a Dáil which contained representatives of counties which were cut off by the operation of certain provisions of the Treaty of 1921.  In that Dáil there sat representatives of South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone and Fermanagh, and I think if it had not been for certain untoward circumstances prior to the election of 1918, we might have had representatives from the City of Belfast and from Derry City also.  However, that is the position.  The Dáil of January, 1919, was much more representative of the Irish people as a whole than the present Dáil is.  We cannot <Col N="859" /> disguise the fact that, so far as we are here by the election of the people, we represent the people of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Therefore, I would suggest that we would reserve the date, January, 1919, or Monday of Easter Week, for the day to which we are all looking forward, when we shall have representatives of the whole of the 32 counties sitting in the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland.  I think, moreover, that something is due to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties because, in fact, what we are doing by Section 2 of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was saying that while we owe a very great debt to the people who died for the republic and the people who reaffirmed it, we also owe something to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties who, despite a very large section of their representatives, despite all the arguments that were used to intimidate and deter them, despite the fact that when the issue was before them they were being subjected to British economic sanctions, despite the fact that the kingdoms of the world, if I may use the phrase, were held up to them in order that they might adore false gods, despite the fact that they were told that, if they did not accept this Constitution of 1937 and did not enact this Constitution, they would have all the benefits and advantages that flow from association with the British Commonwealth, nevertheless turned down all those inducements, refused to yield to the attempts to intimidate them and enacted this Constitution on the 1st day of July, 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in view of the debate which has taken place here on this Bill, in view of everything that was said on the Second Reading and everything that has been said on the preceding sections of this Bill, that the 1st day of July, 1947, is a day that is worthy of commemoration in our annals; and, looking at the fact that it was the people of the Twenty-Six Counties who enacted this Constitution, having regard to the fact that our Legislature does not yet embrace representatives from the other portions of Ireland and looking, too, to the fact that we hope that one day they will sit here with us and that on <Col N="861" /> that day, the day on which they do sit here, we may more fittingly commemorate January, 1919 or April, 1916, and remembering that in so far as we are doing anything here in regard to this Bill, we do it because of what the people of Ireland&mdash;of the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;did on 1st July, 1937, I am going to suggest to the Taoiseach that if this Bill is to be brought into operation on any particular day&mdash;I am not suggesting that it should be deferred to this particular day&mdash;but if any day is going to be described as &ldquo;Independence Day&rdquo; under this Constitution, it should be the 1st July, 1937.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment because I attach great importance to this Bill. To the ordinary people of the country the question of the republic means a great deal more than the actual meaning of the word &ldquo;republic.&rdquo; I believe they are looking forward with hope in view of the fact that their elected representatives from all Parties have at last agreed on something that is very definite.  The people should get an opportunity of rejoicing now that this has come about.  The final enactment of this Bill should not be behind closed doors in Leinster House.  I appeal to the Government to declare the day that this Bill becomes law Independence Day, and to make it a national holiday for the people.  There may be many difficulties and I, putting down an amendment, am giving my <Col N="862" /> own view, but I am prepared to accept the considered views of the Government. I have brought the matter before them.  As I have said, the people are entitled to rejoice with us on this momentous occasion when the elected representatives of all Parties agree upon something that is very definite.</P>

It is my feeling, and it is the feeling of a great many people in the country, that this is really a minor matter and should be treated as such.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Land Bill, 1948.  Perhaps it is fitting that having spent the day discussing the realisation of the independence of this portion of Ireland, we should now discuss what is the fundamental of all independence in every country, that is, the land upon which <Col N="864" /> the people live and from which the people live.  This Bill sets out to achieve a two-fold object.  It seeks to ensure for the farmer the right of security of tenure, the right for which our fathers and our grandfathers and our ancestors for years fought to achieve, the right of undisputed ownership in their homes and holdings.  It seeks also to ensure for the farmer that wherever and whenever his holding is acquired from him by the State he will secure for that holding a just and a fair price. Those are the two fundamental objects of this short Land Bill.  Since I tabled this Bill I have received correspondence from every county in Ireland supporting its principles and bringing to my notice cases of grave and serious hardship which have been inflicted under the existing Land Acts.  I am not here to condemn the Land Commission or the officials of the Land Commission or any Minister of State who has occupied the position of Minister for Lands, but I am here to condemn the existing Land Acts which enable or permit grave and serious injustice to be done.</P>
      <P>The fundamental injustice in the existing law is that the farmer, first of all, has no real security of ownership; no farmer can say: &ldquo;My farm which I have purchased or which I have inherited will not be taken from me.&rdquo; No farmer can secure from the Land Commission or from the State a definite assurance that his holding may not be acquired if the State so desires. Surely it ought to be possible to give to the farmer a reasonable assurance of security of tenure.  Surely it ought to be possible to say to the farmer: &ldquo;If you comply with certain reasonable conditions, nobody will interfere with your right of ownership.&rdquo;  I am not going to set out what those conditions are.  They are set out briefly in the Bill, but they may require elaboration. The Bill, in Section 2, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Land Purchase Acts, no holding shall be resumed or acquired by the Land Commission without the consent of the owner in any case where it is used as an ordinary farm according to proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> The section ensures that if land is unjustly acquired, if a farmer feels that he was making good use of the land, not only in his own interests but in the interests of the community, he can take the Land Commission into court and secure that his holding will not be acquired.  That is the effect of this section.</P>
    <P>That some protection is necessary will, I think, be acknowledged.  As the land code embraces up to nearly 40, I think, different land Acts, and having regard to the volume and complexity of that legislation, I am not prepared to pronounce that this section will achieve all it sets out to achieve.  This is the Second Stage of the Bill.  If the House accepts the broad principles involved in those two main sections, if the House agrees that a farmer should have a reasonable measure of protection in his right of ownership, if the House agrees that a farmer is entitled to a fair price for his land if it is acquired, then I would ask the House to give this Bill a Second Reading, and before the Third Stage is reached, such improvements or amendments as are necessary to carry out those general principles can be included in the Bill. Is there any Deputy in this House who will say that a farmer who is using his land properly, who is seeking to produce from that land the maximum output that can be secured from it, can have it compulsorily acquired from him?  Is there any Deputy in this House who will say that a farmer whose land is compulsorily acquired from him should be forced to sacrifice that land at less than what is a just and reasonable price based on its market value?</P>
    <P>This is a country in which the majority of the people belong to the Catholic Church.  We have been taught from our earliest childhood that there is a Commandment known as the Seventh Commandment which says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal.&rdquo;  That Commandment binds not only on individuals but on Governments.  No Government has a right to steal from the humblest citizen of this State, and the acquisition of any title to property at less than a just price by the State is stealing, just the same as if an individual were to commit a robbery.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this <Col N="866" /> Bill if enacted will not retard the progress of the Land Commission in their efforts to provide parcels of land for uneconomic holders and to relieve congestion.  I am satisfied that the existing legislation is retarding the operations of the Land Commission. If the Land Commission were in a position or were allowed by the law to pay a reasonable and fair price for land, they would get all the land they require to relieve congestion, all the land that their officials could deal with and distribute voluntarily without having to resort to compulsory methods.  Compulsion, I think, should be the very last resort.  I am satisfied that at present, having regard to the quantity of land that is on the market every day&mdash;tens of thousands of acres of land appear for sale in the auctioneers' advertisements in the daily and weekly newspapers&mdash;if the Land Commission were in a position to buy that land on the same terms as ordinary purchasers, pay the full market price for it in cash, they would get all the land they require, and perhaps more than they would be able to deal with efficiently.  That is why I say this Bill, if enacted, would speed the work of the land acquisition and division rather than retard it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the price which the Land Commission may pay for land, I want to draw the attention of the House to the anomaly and injustice which exists in the present Land code. Under the 1923 Land Act, the Land Commission may acquire land from any farmer in any part of the country and the Act provides that, in the case of land so acquired, the price shall be based, not on the market value of the holding, but on some sort of calculation as to what is fair to the Land Commission and to the owner; some sort of compromise between what the Land Commission might like to acquire the land for and what the owner regards as a fair price.  That sub-section&mdash; sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the 1923 Land Act&mdash;still remains in force so far as land acquisition is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case, however, of land which is being resumed from a tenant who is not the full owner of his holding, from a farmer whose land is not vested in <Col N="867" /> him, but is still vested in the Land Commission, Section 39 of the Land Act of 1939 holds good.  Section 39, sub-section (5) of the Land Act of 1939 lays down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hereby declared and enacted that whenever the Land Commission resumes a holding or part of a holding, the following provisions apply and shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the resumption price of such holding or part of a holding, that is to say, the compensation to be paid therefor by the Land Commission, shall be the market value of the holding or part of a holding so resumed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the House to realise that all the land of this country held by farmers may be divided, roughly, into two classes&mdash;tenanted land and untenanted land, tenanted land being land which the farmer does not yet completely own, which he holds under a lease mainly from the Land Commission, and untenanted land being all land which farmers own completely.  So far as I can estimate, the proportion of untenanted land to tenanted land would be at least three-fourths to one-fourth. I am sure that at least three-fourths of the farms of this country are owned by the farmers; the land is vested in the farmer as owner and it is his undisputed property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy describing that as tenanted or untenanted land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Untenanted land.  That is the point I want to make.  So far as I can read the Land Acts, untenanted land is land which is vested in the farmer as complete owner.  One would expect that such land, land which is vested in the farmer as complete owner, would carry a bigger and better price on being acquired by the Land Commission than land which the farmer only holds by way of lease. The contrary, however, is the case. Land of which the farmer has acquired complete ownership, for which he holds a certificate of ownership signed by the Land Commission, can be acquired at <Col N="868" /> as low a price as one-third of the market value and has been acquired at one-third of its market value by the Land Commission.  The 1923 Act provides for that and compels the Land Commission to pay less than the market value.</P>
      <P>Since I introduced this Bill I have received letters from almost every county in Ireland setting out the grievances and injustices inflicted upon farmers.  It would be hardly possible for me to go through all these letters. They are human documents.  In these letters there is a cry of distress from individuals who have been robbed, from small farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country, whose rights have been trampled upon. Here is the case of a farmer with 166 acres of land, the market value of which is £5,000.  We have some members of the House who are auctioneers.  I think they will agree that 166 acres of good land should be worth £5,000.  The owner of the lands, in a letter, says that they have been in his family for very many years, and that the Land Commission, against his will and consent, and despite his opposition, have made an order acquiring the lands and fixing the price at £3,000, payable in 3 per cent. land bonds.  The Land Commission have also made it a condition that the redemption price of the annuity will be £1,390.  That would mean that he would actually receive £1,610, or £6 1s. 6d. per acre.  There is the case of £1,610 being offered by the Land Commission for a farm which is valued at £5,000.</P>
      <P>I have another letter from the owner of 72 acres which were taken up and divided.  He says that he is only a poor man, far poorer than some of the people who got a divide of his land. He says: &ldquo;When Mr. Joe Connolly was Minister for Lands he came to Ballyshannon and called in a barber who was in politics.  This man gave the names of people to whom some of the land should be given.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to giving names in the House.  I can give them to the <Col N="869" /> Minister privately.  I have another letter here from a man who says that he lives with his father, brother and three sisters, that he is 32 years of age, and that the Land Commission have made an offer of £1,400, but that £600 have been taken out of that by them. There is another case of a farm of 419 acres of excellent land which has been acquired for £5,500.  The owner says that it has been in his family for 80 years, that he is a young, hard-working man of 44 years of age.  He says that he has a son farming who is 22 years of age.  He adds that this is the home place and that it has always been well worked, and that they employ eight men constantly.</P>
      <P>I want to ask, is there any justice or fair play in offering or paying such prices for land acquired compulsorily? I have another case which, I think, was mentioned in the House at one time by Deputy Beirne.  That is a farm that is worth between £6,000 and £8,000. The Land Commission offered £5,000 for it, less the redemption value of £2,300.  That would leave the owner abut £2,600, and that is what he is offered for a farm valued at between £6,000 and £8,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figure with me, but I think it was a little more than the sum I have mentioned. Here is the case of another farm, value for £7,000 and acquired for £4,000 odd. The redemption value of the annuity was fixed at £2,000, leaving less than £2,000 in cash to the owner.  I cannot see any reason why such injustices should be allowed to continue so long. It is time that this thing should be ended once and for all.  I have received <Col N="870" /> many letters from farmers who, as yet, are not so much aggrieved about the price that is going to be paid for their land as they are by the fact that orders have been served on them in recent months by the Land Commission seeking to acquire their holdings.  The grievance with those men is that they have been working their land.  Some of them have large families, and they can see in the land they have a prospect both for themselves and their families.  Yet their land is to be acquired.  Another man writes and says that he has 165 Irish acres, the poor law value being £181.  He says that the land has always been properly worked, that it has never been sub-let and that the tillage quota has always been fully done.  He says that he was sent to an agricultural college with a view to making farming his career, that he is now 37 years of age, and that the Land Commission have decided to take 110 Irish acres.  He appealed against this decision to lay commissioners and has been to see the Minister for Lands.</P>

      <P>165 acres.  I have a letter here from a farmer who is setting out to establish a pedigree herd.  He considers that it would be a desirable thing for him to go in for dairy farming, and hence decided to establish this pedigree herd.  He went to the Land Commission and asked for an assurance that, if he put his capital into a pedigree herd, his land would not be taken from him, but could not get any such assurance.  What this Bill is seeking to do is to enable farmers to secure from the State a guarantee that, if they comply with certain reasonable conditions in the working of their land, it will not be taken from them under any circumstances.  That guarantee has been refused over and over again to farmers who sought it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the Land Commission because, under the existing law, they cannot give such a guarantee. But the law should be changed.  There is no reason why a farmer who is working his land in the best interests of the community, who is seeking to improve it and produce from it the <Col N="871" /> highest annual output, and who is doing his utmost to preserve and maintain its fertility, should not be granted reasonable security in the possession of his holding.  These are very important issues.  They are issues which cannot, I think, be side-tracked and which cannot be allowed to lie any longer in abeyance.  Land is the foundation of the nation's wealth and of the nation's well-being.  The people who are working the land must be given a square deal.  I have pointed out already and I repeat now that the enactment of this Bill will help in the redistribution and division of land.  It will open up to the Land Commission a vast reservoir of land because when this Bill becomes law every farmer who has a farm to sell will go to the Land Commission and seek them out as possible purchasers.  The Land Commission will cease to be a bugbear and a menace to the farmer and will, instead, become the farmers' friend.</P>
    <P>Auctioneers who are hard-hearted and shrewd business men will naturally bring to the notice of the Land Commission any farms which they may have to sell.  I think it is time that this question was put on an equitable basis. As we know, it is at the present time the settled policy of the Land Commission to bring uneconomic holdings up to the standard of being economic. In other words, the Land Commission, I think, lays down the rule that they would like to see small holdings brought up to at least £20 poor law valuation.  In pursuance of that policy the Land Commission may acquire land from any one farmer who has land in excess of £20 valuation.  That means that there are tens of thousands&mdash; possibly hundreds of thousands, I have not got the number here&mdash;of farmers from whom the Land Commission may acquire a portion.  I want to know what guiding rule they have in selecting the holding to be acquired.  Is there any guiding rule?  As long as there is not anything laid down in our land code which can guide the Land Commission, it is open to them to go in and take any farm in the country, and it is equally open to them to pass over any individual farm and nobody <Col N="872" /> can censure them.  That, in itself, opens up a vast field for favouritism and injustice.  Deputy Commons, when the matter of land administration was before the House on the 3rd June last, drew attention to an evil in the existing land code.  He said, column 353, Volume 111 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been approached by some of these ranchers, with regard to whose lands I have put down questions in this House, who said, &lsquo;Now that you are a supporter of the Government our cheque books will be available to you at the next election.  Do not make any move in regard to our lands....&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a definite offer made by land owners to a young and able member of a political Party in this House.  Does anyone think that if the laws were right and fair it would be prudent or sensible or necessary for a land owner to make such an offer?  If the laws were right, land would be taken compulsorily only from those people who fail to comply with certain statutory conditions and from no others and no land owner would make any offer to any Deputy because no Deputy would have any power to influence the operations of land acquisition and division.  Somebody has said that a Deputy has none.  Does anyone think that the prudent, hard-headed businessmen who made that offer to a Deputy in this House were fools?</P>

The objections that might <Col N="873" /> be raised, and very properly raised, to this Bill are that its enactment would raise the price at which land would be sold to the allottees; that it would have the effect of increasing the annuity which the incoming tenant would have to pay in order to give the outgoing owner a fair price.  I am satisfied, and I have an expert's opinion on the matter, that it is possible to pay a fair and a just price for land without increasing by 1d. the annuity on the incoming allottee.  It is possible to do so either by extending the period of repayment, which can be done, or by reducing the rate of interest at which money is raised for land acquisition and purchase.</P>
      <P>The question of an extension of the period of repayment would not inflict any great hardship upon a man who is getting an allotment of land free from the State.  If an allottee who receives a holding from the State is told that instead of paying an annuity for 50 years he will have to pay it for 100 years, he is not going to be unduly alarmed or perturbed about the additional 50 years being added to the period of repayment.  As far as the question of reducing the rate of interest is concerned, I have never been able to understand why the State, which is the ultimate and absolute source of all currency, should pay a high rate of interest for money which it requires.  Nobody has ever been able to explain why a Government, upon whose authority all paper money is created&mdash;and there is very little money in existence except paper money&mdash; should insist upon paying to certain individuals a high rate of interest for what is the State's own money.  I believe that money could be raised for the purpose of land acquisition, improvement and development at less than 1 per cent.; it certainly could be loaned to the farmer, to the incoming tenant, at 1 per cent.  I think that would enable the land to be let at a reasonable price while at the same time paying a fair price for the land acquired.  This is a very important matter, but in the time at my disposal I am not able to cope with all aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, I think, a reasonable and <Col N="874" /> moderate measure.  The proposals contained in it are simple, straightforward and essential.  The Bill will do justice to the farmer who owns the land.  It will confer greater benefits on the small uneconomic holder and on the people in the congested areas.  It will be a vindication of those who fought the landlords in dark and stormy days in order to get security of tenure for our people.  The people who stood with Davitt and Parnell are dead.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  The Bill is important.  It is necessary.  I think the most important part of it is Section 3.  I can see certain difficulties in implementing Section 2 as it stands at present.  If the Bill can be passed with the deletion of Section 2 it would, I think, achieve the purpose that Deputy Cogan has in mind.  We have had experience in the country of land being taken from people and given to others, and we have had experience of those others turning out worse farmers than those from whom the land was taken.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I protest against this measure.  I do not think any Deputy from the West of Ireland could possibly support this Bill.  The effect of it would be to put a stop immediately to land acquisition and land distribution. With all due respect to Deputy Cogan, I think that is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy in regard to the problem of the market value of land.  But what is the market value?  How are you going to estimate it?  During war land may go up abnormally in value as it did in the recent war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the market value to be decided?  Prices may rise for two years and fall as quickly again.  I would be in favour of paying a fair and reasonable price to any man from whom land was taken.  But how are you to arrive at that price?  How are you to estimate the redemption value? I believe there have been injustices under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have no illusions as to who will supply the difference between the <Col N="876" /> price and the sum at which the Land Commission will let to the small holders.  The only way in which that difference can be made up is by the State.  Is the State going to supply the deficiency?  If that is the idea, I will support the Bill.  The deficiency cannot be made up by the tenant.  The tenant could not possibly hold the land and work it as an economic unit if that charge were made upon him.  I remember in one instance where a certain amount of money was spent on a holding of land.  The land was subsequently distributed and the annuities worked out at about £45 a year.  No tenant would take the land.  The Land Commission had to forego about £20 of that sum and the annuity was fixed at £25 a year.  Those are the facts.  There is no mention made of that in this Bill. It says here that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Land Purchase Acts no holding shall be acquired or resumed by the Land Commission without the consent of the owner in any case where it is used as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.  That is very wide in its scope.</P>
    <P>We all know what occurred in the past when people endeavoured to defeat the compulsory tillage regulations. We all know the tricks that were played.  We all know the pretended tillage where there was no real tillage at all.  We know how a lot of clever individuals could get around that clause by saying they are farmers conducting their business according to proper methods of husbandry.  That might mean a man and a dog to look after 1,000 acres.  We in the West know these things too well, and I certainly would not agree to any such clause unless it was far more definite than it is there.</P>
    <P>I am very much in sympathy with any effort that can be made towards giving a fair price to the people whose lands are taken from them, but I will not agree to that being given by placing a blister on the backs of the small farmers who will get the land when it is divided.  There is only one body that can supply the difference, and that is the State.  If the State is willing to do it, and if the Minister <Col N="877" /> can get the Government to agree to that, then I certainly will support anything that is done, but not otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy Cogan has introduced this Bill, because what I am afraid he has done is he has spoiled an extremely good case for a revision of the price that should be paid for vested land.  I am afraid the Deputy left us rather confused at the end of the introduction of the Bill as to what exactly the Bill purports to do.  I do not think I would be overstressing it if I said that the Bill as drafted does not at all do what Deputy Cogan suggests he wants it to do.</P>
      <P>As I understood Deputy Cogan, Section 2 is the fundamental section to him in this Bill.  I do not think Section 2 matters at all if we have the Land Commission paying, when land is acquired, the proper value for the land, a reasonable and proper market value, and paying something further in addition. I accept it as a matter of social justice that occasionally there may be cases where it is necessary that a man would be completely disturbed and, when a man is being completely disturbed, it is but right and proper that not merely in regard to market value but, in addition, that he would be paid compensation for disturbance.  Deputy Cogan has left that completely out of account, a fact which was taken into account in earlier land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is quite a simple one if it is reduced to the proper perspective. Deputy Moylan as he is now, but the Minister for Lands as he was then, and I had a real set-to in the Seanad some two or three years ago and, with all respect to Deputy Cogan, I think the issue I put before the Seanad at that time was a much clearer issue than the issue that is put before this House tonight. The position is that one price is paid for vested land and another price for unvested land; that the unvested land is taken in pursuance of the powers of the Land Commission to resume land; that the price paid for unvested land, for resumed land, is fixed by Section 29 of the 1923 Land Act and Section 43 of the Land Act of 1931.  In fact, as I think Deputy Moylan will at once agree with me, <Col N="878" /> Section 39 of the 1939 Act only restated the existing position.  The same position was already there before, but in respect of unvested land the price to be paid is the market value, plus, in certain circumstances, compensation for disturbance.</P>
    <P>The real difference that arises in fixing the market value arises, as Deputy Cogan said, in the redemption of the Land Commission annuity.  The person in whom the land has been vested has a very much stronger case to be paid a fair price than the person in whom the land has not yet been vested, and it is, as those of us who know the country are aware, undoubtedly a fact that whether land offered for sale is subject to a Land Commission annuity or is free from rent, that is a factor which contributes little to the price of the land that is being offered.  You will have two farms of equal area, approximately the same quality of land, one subject to an annuity of £25 a year and the other free of rent, and those two parcels of land will in the open market make exactly the same price.  In practice that always happens, even though in theory it should not happen.  What happens is that the redemption value of the annuity is taken out of the vested land and is not taken out of the unvested land, and, in consequence, therefore, the land that should have the greater right gets the worst price.</P>
    <P>If the price that was being paid for land was a fair price, the market value or the value that it was worth to the man from whom it has been acquired, then Section 2 would become utterly and completely unnecessary, and I would suggest with great respect to Deputy Cogan that the line to be adopted in respect of the Land Acts is not towards the restriction that he has set out to achieve in the fundamental principle of his Bill, but towards ensuring that a much more fundamental principle should be carried into effect, namely, that where the State, in order to achieve social justice, decides to acquire the property of a man, it would pay that man a fair and a reasonable price.  But if that is made a fundamental objective, if it is made a fundamental principle of a measure such as this, then everything follows from it <Col N="879" /> and it will be unnecessary to provide as Deputy Cogan has provided in Section 2.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I strongly urge on Deputy Cogan that he should try to get the Minister to introduce a Bill that will provide for vested land the same price as is provided for unvested land.  If he did that he would be doing not merely what is proposed in this Bill, but a very much better job for the farmers and, while doing it, he would at the same time make it quite clear that the Land Commission would be able to operate to clear up a social injustice and, when clearing up a social injustice by acquiring and allotting land, at the same time they would not be creating any injustice to the persons who own it.  For that reason, I think the House could not accept this Bill with Section 2 in it, but would welcome a Bill if the Minister could see his way to introduce one along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Cogan's point about changing the interest on the annuity to 1 per cent. is concerned, I will ask him to consider, if that were done under his Bill, all that would happen is that the owner would get one-third of the price he is getting at present, because land bonds carrying only 1 per cent. interest would presumably be worth about one-third of their present value.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned accordingly.</P>

      <P>Last week a number of Deputies in this House, including myself, spent a week-end in the country.  I proceeded to Donegal through my own constituency of County Louth, and there I met a number of people who were interested in the price of oats.  A number of farmers in County Louth have oats to sell, and, notwithstanding the hints thrown out recently by the deputy Minister for Agriculture when he got his chief's back turned, that he was going to buy oats, nothing happened up to last Saturday in County <Col N="880" /> Louth.  A number of farmers have been in this condition for the past couple of months: that the bills for conacre are due and that they have oats to sell which they cannot sell at a price which could cover the rent they paid for the land, for the seed and for their hired labour, not to speak of their own labour.  When I reached Donegal, I was shown a paper with three advertisements in it almost a foot square, offering to pay the East Donegal farmers 2/- per stone, or 28/- per barrel for oats.  When I came home, I searched all the local papers I could get my hands on, and in no paper from Kilkenny, Wexford, Cork or Kerry did I find any such advertisement.  The East Donegal farmers were offered 2/- per stone for oats last week-end, but the County Louth farmers, even though it is now coming up to Christmas, got no such announcement.</P>
      <P>There is a new version of the Grace Before Meals down in County Louth at the moment.  They say that the East Donegal farmers' Grace Before Meals runs something like this: &ldquo;Some have oats but have no votes and so they have no market, but we have votes and so can sell our oats and let the Lord be thanked&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the present attempt of the deputy Minister for Agriculture to buy votes in Donegal is frightfully crude and amateurish.  He has forgotten the old tricks they had a long time ago.  When the deputy Minister spoke here about giving a price for oats, he did not say that he was going to give it to the East Donegal farmers alone.  He gave us to understand that he was going to correct the ill-effects of the policy of the Minister for whom he was deputising and give a reasonable price for oats all round, to every farmer who had oats to sell in any part of the country. When the Minister for Agriculture asked the farmers of the Twenty-Six <Col N="881" /> Counties last spring to grow oats and promised they would get a remunerative price, he did not confine the promise of a remunerative price to the East Donegal farmers, and, all over the country, farmers, acting on his advice, changed from wheat to oats.  They dropped 63,000 acres of wheat and grew an additional 57,000 acres of oats.</P>
      <P>On 3rd March, the Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;&ldquo;I ask you to do all you can to increase the area planted in barley, oats and potatoes.  For each of these three commodities, there will be a certain and profitable market all next year.&rdquo;  He put in several advertisements to the same effect&mdash; grow more oats, increase the acreage of oats and you will get a remunerative price; and some of these advertisements he wound up with:&mdash;&ldquo;We'll show them.&rdquo;  They certainly have shown us.  The country has been shown that we are to borrow and pay interest for 50 years on an extra 5,000,000 dollars in order to buy the wheat we could have produced ourselves if the Minister for Agriculture had let the wheat policy ride.  If we had these 63,000 extra acres of wheat, they would have saved the borrowing of 5,000,000 dollars, and we would not have had this great surplus of oats which is bursting the farmers' barns at present.</P>
      <P>The deputy Minister for Agriculture promised when the motion of no confidence was brought in here that he was going to do something about it. According to this advertisement, what he proposes to do in East Donegal is to offer to farmers 2/- a stone or 28/- a barrel for best oats.  I understand that there are some people up there who have been corn buyers for a long time.  They did not get the right yet to offer even the 2/- per stone.  However, it is alleged that the 2/- per stone will only be for oats bushelling 40 lbs., that for oats bushelling 39 lbs. it will be 1/8, and for oats bushelling 38 lbs. 1/4.  I should like the Minister to confirm or correct these figures.</P>
      <P>The method which the Government are adopting in relation to this matter was, of course, subject to very severe condemnation from the Minister for Agriculture himself.  He said down in Waterford on 17th September:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" />&ldquo;Price fixation for farmers' crops means crop control and crop control means inspectors pushing farmers about and dictating to them how to run their own business.  If the farmers want that, they must get a new Minister for Agriculture because I will not give them inspectors and control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was because he would not give them inspectors and control that he went off and left the deputy Minister for Agriculture to carry the baby.</P>
    <P>The deputy Minister for Agriculture seems prepared to give the farmers plenty of inspectors and control if necessary.  Nothwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Lands was boasting here last week that the Minister for Agriculture had taken inspectors off the backs of the farmers and left them free, we had an advertisement appearing in the same paper from the Department asking for six further junior agricultural inspectors at salaries ranging from £335 to £725 per annum.  If the deputy Minister for Agriculture does not smarten up when the boss comes home he may be using some of these inspectors to go round and inspect the books of a lot of farmers who are going to be broken by the dilatoriness of the Government in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>We will take it for granted that the advertisement that appeared for East Donegal&mdash;even the one advertisement that appeared here in a Dublin paper was from an East Donegal merchant in Letterkenny &mdash; will be extended throughout the country, and that farmers will be given the offer of 2/- a stone for 40-lb. oats and 1/8 for 39-lbs. to the bushel, and so on; but what is going to happen to the farmers who were assured by Deputy Dillon that they were going to get a remunerative price for oats, and who have already sold their oats?  The Minister for Agriculture himself, speaking recently, on the 10th October, just shortly before he skipped, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In some districts last week, farmers sold oats at 21/- to 22/- per barrel to corn merchants... I advise farmers who received less than <Col N="883" /> 26/- per barrel for their oats to go back to the man who bought them and ask him what he did with them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to know from the deputy Minister for Agriculture what he is going to do for the farmers throughout the country who sold their oats at 21/- to 22/- per barrel and who will now&mdash;we hope&mdash;see their neighbours getting 28/- a barrel.  The Minister for Agriculture was asked on a dozen occasions by a dozen different deputations in various parts of the country&mdash;some of them approached him in his own Departmental rooms here&mdash; asking him to put a floor under the price of oats, to live up to the promise he made that they would get a remunerative price for all the oats they would sell.  They beseeched him not to break his bond, but he refused, and in despair, with threatening notices to pay up their debts, a number of farmers, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, sold their oats at 21/- to 22/- per barrel.  Now farmers, we suppose, will get 28/- for oats that are no better. What is going to happen the difference? Has the Government any scheme for recouping the farmers who sold their oats under value, because of the pressure of their creditors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at 21/-, and now oats are worth 28/-, according to this here. Why did the Government keep this scheme back to this time of the year? It reminds me of what happened in <Col N="884" /> 1931, when German oats were allowed to come in here at 5/- a barrel and drive our farmers to despair.  We had a by-election in Kildare, and the night before the election, the then Minister for Agriculture, a Cumann na nGaedheal man, went down to the farmers in South Kildare and said: &ldquo;If you want a tariff on oats, I will give you a tariff on oats.&rdquo;  He gave them a tariff on oats, but gave it to them in the neck.  The tariff did not come into operation until November, until the farmers had sold their oats.  Now we have the same game repeated, when the farmers are being offered a floor of 28/- a barrel for 40-lb. oats, after most of them, and those who were hardest hit and in greatest need, had already sold their oats.</P>

      <P>We know the Minister for Agriculture wants to drive the people from tillage.  He believes in the utmost efficiency, the utmost output per man year.  He will get that with the one man driving the bullocks.  Undoubtedly, this upset to the tillage farmers, who trusted him that he was giving them a guaranteed price for oats, is going to disgust them with the growing of tillage crops and probably drive them out of them.

    <P>I hope that the deputy Minister for Agriculture will indicate, in replying, that the advertisements that appeared in the East Donegal papers last week-end will appear in all other papers throughout the country this week-end. It is only a couple of weeks before Christmas, and the farmers who may want to sell oats in order to get some cash for that period should know where they stand.  I take it that the <Col N="885" /> Government is hardly going to stand over their initial step, and confine the giving of a price for oats to the farmers in East Donegal.  It may have had some effect in getting them some support up there, but, after all, they must look to the time when they will be seeking votes in constituencies other than East Donegal.  If they are going to do something about this situation, let them do it quickly.  Let them make an announcement that this arrangement is going to obtain all over the country, that wherever farmers have oats for sale they will be bought at this figure. Also, I want them to make some announcements to the farmers who have sold their oats at 21/- or 22/- per barrel, and say what the Minister is going to offer them, to make it up to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just take about two minutes.  I was interested in what Deputy Aiken brought before the House, and there are some questions that occur to me which I think are very relevant to this matter.  I thought his case was based upon an alleged discrimination against Louth in favour of East Donegal.  So far as this House is concerned, I think we would be more intimately concerned in the matter if we knew by whom these advertisements were issued.  He first talked about three advertisements being issued in East Donegal and he said later that according to these advertisements the Minister offered certain prices for oats. I should like to know from the Minister or from Deputy Aiken whether these advertisements were issued officially by the Department of Agriculture or whether they were issued by the merchants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they did it on behalf of the Government or on their own initiative, private profit would be the more compelling motive in their case.  In regard to Louth, the Deputy mentioned that there were a number of producers who had oats to sell there and that, though they were offering the oats for sale, nothing had happened.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the surplus quantity of oats in Louth which would be available for sale to these dealers and how many agents there would be available now to handle the surplus oats about which Deputy Aiken spoke.  Finally, I should like to know if there are in Louth any dealers who have premises and equipment capable of handling these oats, whether they are eligible to be appointed as agents in the same manner as merchants in East Donegal, whether they would fall into the category of appointed agents, whether they would be appointed by the Government, and whether they can purchase oats at the same price as in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Aiken with a considerable amount of amusement.  I have been following the Deputy's activities for the last few weeks.  Three weeks ago himself and his colleagues were capering round Donegal and shedding bitter tears before the farmers of Donegal because there was nobody to buy their oats and because the bottom had fallen out of the market for oats.  That was three weeks ago.  To-day we are to be lampooned, and for what?  Because we are buying oats in Donegal and because we prevented the bottom falling out of the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In Donegal and in Louth and in every county in Ireland. Now, I want to put it to the House that I am not dealing with an immature junior who is in this House a day or two.  I am confronted with a man who has held Ministerial position for 16 years too long, an old Deputy who is in a position to know how to get information <Col N="887" /> and where to get it.  We are to believe like an innocent lot of children that if he wants to learn anything on behalf of the farmers of Louth, the only way to get information is by buying all the provincial papers and searching them for advertisements.  It never struck Simple Simon to lift up the telephone and ring up the Minister, the Minister's private secretary or the secretary of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Now let the little Rathmines boy sit down.  It never struck the Deputy to address a Parliamentary question to the Minister to find out if agents had been appointed only in Donegal.  It is true that an enterprising merchant of Donegal rushed into print because of the Deputy's speeches saying that there was no market for oats, and he advertised for oats.  It is equally true that a merchant in Waterford and a merchant in Wicklow did the same, and, if the Deputy were concerned about the farmers in Louth, surely he should make it his business to find out if anybody had been appointed in County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Louth is the smallest county in Ireland and Donegal is one of the largest.  Three agents have been appointed in County Donegal and two in County Louth.  I am going to tell the Deputy something about the county which he so blatantly misrepresents. If he were representing Louth in any kind of competent or adequate manner, if he were perturbed about the nonpurchase of oats in Louth, surely it would be his duty and responsibility to ascertain whether anybody had been appointed to buy oats in Louth.</P>

He started off by saying that the only place where we were buying oats through the merchants was in East Donegal.  No.1 statement was completely false and No.2 statement was thoroughly false.  His whole attitude and presentation of the case were disgracefully and blatantly dishonest.</P>
