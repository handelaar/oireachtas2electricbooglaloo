      <P>Proceedings are in progress for the acquisition of an area of 231 acres of the Cashman estate at Tonreigh, County Kerry.  A resale scheme for the division of the lands is in course of preparation but it is not yet possible to say when the lands will be allotted.</P>

      <P>Under the Department's general scheme for the clearance of arrears of telephone applications, service will be provided for the pre-1948 applicants in Tuam area in December.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he will state the reason why Mr. James Tarmey, Carraroe, Williamstown, was dismissed without notice from the position of temporary postman in Williamstown Sub-Post Office and a Mr. Thomas Connaughton engaged to replace him; also, if he will state the service (if any) given by both in the emergency forces and what other means of livelihood both men have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Tarmey was not dismissed.  He has been employed as a substitute from time to time at Williamstown Post Office, to cover annual leave of regular postmen.  First preference is given to men nominated by the labour exchange.  On the last occasion when substitution work arose Mr. Tarmey was not registered and the only available registered man was Mr. Connaughton, who was consequently employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House rose last night I was defending the policy initiated by me of consulting on the spot with local authorities.  The more I have seen of the result of that policy the more I am convinced that it is a very wise one, and is calculated to give very good results and to settle a number of problems on the spot that would involve very prolonged delay and a great deal of correspondence to settle otherwise.  I am, therefore, quite satisfied that this is a useful feature of local government policy.  I intend to carry it on until the consultations have embraced the various counties in the State.  Furthermore, in elaboration of that practice I hope occasionally, and even frequently if necessary, when problems arise in connection with local bodies where consultation with the Department may be considered necessary in order to resolve the difficulties that may arise, to arrange that there must be a new approach to that position.  I propose, therefore, to make available, so far as possible and within the limits of the staff of the Department, officers of the Department to attend occasional meetings of local bodies and help, so far as possible, by advice and encouragement towards the solution of whatever difficulties may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that the policy of setting up a housing council for the City and County of Dublin and the borough of Dún Laoghaire and the treating of that area as one area for housing purposes has been made the subject of some derision by my predecessor.  He has referred to it as window-dressing, and I understand that, in my absence from the House recently, another Deputy suggested that it was a way of evading <Col N="1504" /> or shelving my responsibilities.  As at a later stage before the final word on the Estimate is spoken I shall have to deal with housing in a wider way, I only want to say now that I am satisfied that the appointment of this housing council is a very useful step in the right direction.  Deputies have referred to the need for a housing board.  That is a matter that need not be ruled out of consideration ultimately. In the meantime, I think the selection of this council, composed of representatives of the various interests as it is and presided over by a local government officer with very considerable experience of local affairs and with a special high record in the matter of attention to housing in the various areas in which he worked, is bound to give good and satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any general quarrel in this House with the view that the housing problem in this city and the other areas which are added to the administrative area in the city for the purpose of the work of this council could not be regarded as anything but a special problem.  I should like at this stage to express my gratification and my warmest thanks to the members of the Housing Council who have accepted willingly and cheerfully the responsibilities of the work attached to it.  They have been selected without reference to political Parties or without any desire to show favour in any particular quarter.  They have been selected with a view to getting the best brains, the best advice and the most willing co-operation from all the elements in this city who, by reason of their membership of local authorities, their connection with trade unions, their connection with the building industry or otherwise, can bring some special help and advice to bear on this question.  I am, therefore, defending that proposal as one that I believe will justify itself and give, in a very large measure at least, the results that are desired.  The members of that Housing Council, like myself, realise the very heavy task imposed upon them.  From what has already happened at the few meetings which have taken place, I know that they have approached the consideration of the problem with very <Col N="1505" /> great diligence and I believe that they will ultimately help to resolve this problem with credit to themselves and advantage to the area that they represent.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that the abandonment of the proposal to make investigations into the question of a piped water supply to every home in the country has been dictated by certain reasons.  I am responsible for that decision and I have taken it largely because of the fact that in my approach to local authorities I have found a number of such authorities quite undecided in connection with the proposed provision of water supplies in their own areas because of the hope that the result of the investigations of this commission would, in the end, come to their assistance.  It would be a serious matter if a large number of local authorities&mdash;and there was an increasing number of local authorities concerned in this matter&mdash;came to any such conclusion.  It would mean that the work on housing would be very largely impeded or handicapped in a number of areas.  It seems quite clear that the final deliberations of this commission could not be reached until a very considerable time, perhaps a number of years, had elapsed.  I, therefore, felt that it was necessary to take this step in order that the local authorities and the people interested in the provision of water supplies would understand the position.  This does not prevent or retard in any way the question of the provision of regional water supplies being considered and undertaken.  Deputy Gilbride referred to that matter yesterday evening, and I do not think he need have the least fear that the step taken will in any serious way impede the development of regional water supplies.</P>
    <P>In addition, this matter is to some extent bound up with the progress of rural electrification.  It does seem to me that the completion of a substantial part of the work of rural electrification would be a very necessary preliminary to any substantial development regarding the provision of a piped water supply to every home.  It does seem to me that <Col N="1506" /> the ideal in mind of conveying a supply of piped water to every home in this country, while it may be possible to attain ultimately, is still a very considerable distance off and I want to make the facts in connection with that matter clear to the House and to the satisfaction of every section of repre sentation in the House.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters arising out of the statement of Deputy MacEntee that I want to refer to also. He did suggest, as far as I remember, that there was a complete close-down on the issue of building licences to any section other than housing dealt with by local authorities.  That, of course, is not so, the simple fact being that preference and precedence is given to the claims of the local authorities and that private persons and other sections are considered afterwards. I think that is quite a reasonable proposal and I stand over it.  I would even be inclined to push forward to a higher priority, if it could be secured in any way, the work of local authorities in connection with the erection of houses.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter and, as it involves a personal statement and, I think, to some extent, my honour and the honour of my advisers in this matter, I want to refer to it.  I do so with very considerable hesitation because, again, the honour and the reputation of an official of a local authority down the country, not perhaps occupying a very high executive position in that local authority, but still a citizen of this State, who is entirely unable to say a word in his own defence here, has been raised.  It is suggested that I came to a certain decision that could not be sustained by the facts.  That was supplemented to the extent that there was at least a suggestion that the course of justice had been influenced or impeded in a certain way in connection with a matter in which a local official was concerned. The suggestion was made that a local official was responsible for a felonious act, that the Guards had got possession of the facts and that, suddenly, through some influence or another, from which the name and work of the Minister were <Col N="1507" /> not separated, all official action in the matter was suspended and the official was reinstated.  It was added that a member of this House, the parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, interfered in this matter and, presumably, his interference in this matter led to a certain decision.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that neither directly nor indirectly did the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance approach me on this matter.  I want to say, further, that the decision I took in this matter was a decision in concurrence with the advice I received from the officers of my Department and one that I am quite satisfied represented a fair decision on the facts of the case.  I should make it clear to the House that at no stage, so far as I know, was any action taken by the Guards in this matter.  I do not see how any action of the kind could be taken when I reveal to the House that not one penny of public funds was misappropriated even for five minutes in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>The decision that I took was not exactly the decision recommended or suggested or taken by the county manager.  I do not hold myself bound, nor do I think the House would ask me to feel bound, by all the decisions taken by county managers.  I am bound to pay a certain amount of attention and to give due weight and consideration to their views but, when an official such as the particular official whose case is under discussion exercised his legal right of appeal to the Minister and when I was fortified by the advice of the officials of the Department in this matter, I do not think I have anything to explain or to apologise for.  I regret that in an otherwise harmonious, very clean and happy debate an atmosphere of this kind was introduced.  At most, it could be said that the official concerned was guilty of a stupid indiscretion.  I do not think people ought to be punished very severely for indiscretions, because, in fact, if that were the case, Deputy MacEntee would be undergoing very serious periods of punishment from time to time.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, it will not be easy to cover the various points that have been raised in a very long debate and, if I omit to refer to certain matters that may be important, I hope I may be able to give to the Deputies concerned some of the information that they require in another way.  Deputy Michael O'Higgins referred to certain works in County Dublin and I hope I may be able to supply him with the up-to-date information on that question.  He also referred to the question of road safety, a matter that was touched on by a number of Deputies, and the extension of traffic lights to the country.  A number of Deputies referred to the difficult position in regard to road traffic in this city.  I should say in that connection that it is a very difficult problem so far as the city is concerned.  I think the members of the previous Government who were dealing with the matter will readily agree with that.  It is not one that admits of any easy solution.  I can only explain to the House now that certain discussions between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice and with the corporation are in progress at present and it is hoped that some early improvement in the position may be secured.  I am not in a position to give any authoritative view on the extension of traffic lights to the country generally. I would say that there does seem to be a case, in the larger areas at least, for an extension of a system which, on the whole, seems to have given satisfaction in Dublin.  I am having the matter examined into further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers referred to some matters that were also touched on by <Col N="1510" /> Deputy MacEntee, and to the present position of the Road Fund.  In that connection, discussions, which were interrupted by the London Talks, were taking place with the Minister for Finance.  I hope that they will be resumed in a short time.  Meanwhile the House will understand that I am not in a position to give a definite answer.  I notice from the records that the previous Government took a decision on this matter in principle, and that the exact manner in which that decision would be given effect to was not finally settled.  I may say that the decision on it was taken on the 13th February.  I hope to have all the information and all the arguments available for further discussions on this matter.  Deputies will, I feel, be satisfied to learn that the position is no worse than it was some time ago.  As a result of those discussions I may be able to inform the House in a short time as to what the exact position is.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also referred to the question of the circular that was issued to the officers of local authorities by my predecessor, intimating to them that they were not to make any representations either to the members of local authorities or to the elected representatives of the people in connection with their positions, their remuneration or their emoluments.  I considered at the time, and I have not since altered by view, that the circular was an objectionable one.  It is true that it has not been officially withdrawn because its withdrawal would have to be simultaneous by the Department of Local Government, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  It will be sufficient for Deputy O'Higgins to know that this circular has fallen into complete disuse. If it is necessary, the matter can be discussed with the other Ministers concerned with a view to seeing whether it should not be officially withdrawn entirely.  In any case, it does not cause any impediment at the moment to the legitimate representations of such people being considered in the way that they desire and believe to be best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins also referred to delays in the matter of correspondence.  It is true that there have been delays, even in the last two or three months, but such delays were inevitable.  When I took over responsibility in the Department of Local Government the Housing Act of 1948 had been passed, but not one single regulation had been made under it. Now, I am not blaming anybody for that because the period that had elapsed was short.  The Act had been pushed through hurriedly at the end of the session, and even if regulations were adopted they would take some considerable time.  There was also the question of staff.  That matter has now been settled, but up to this the members of the housing staff in the Department of Local Government were being asked to tackle a job that physically and mentally was quite impossible for them.  I feel sure, therefore, that the people in the country who are very interested in this matter will understand that there have been no avoidable delays in dealing with correspondence in connection with housing applications, and that the arrangements <Col N="1512" /> which have now been made to enlarge the staff of the housing section will result in the working off of the arrears as rapidly as possible.  We have found an enormous amount of correspondence which requires to be dealt with daily.  In my own particular portion of this office the number of letters in arrears has run into hundreds. We can only promise to deal with them as rapidly as possible, and meanwhile ask for consideration by the members of the House in dealing with that matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers desired information in regard to the labour force in this city, with particular reference to the number of apprentices and to the position generally arising in that connection. We are endeavouring to get that information.  It is a very necessary beginning in connection with housing. The housing director, Mr. O'Mahoney, was actively engaged in getting that information some weeks ago, but I regret that at the moment his activities have been interrupted owing to illness. I hope that, in a very short time, he will be available again to give me, and, if necessary, through me, to the House the most up-to-date information in that respect.  It is sufficient to say that the number of skilled operatives who may be available for housing is a cause for anxiety, and that every effort that can be made to have the number supplemented and increased by attracting back people who have already left this country to take up similar employment in another country in order to get their services for this work will be made, and in whatever way that effort can best be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of derelict sites.  I want to say that I am entirely with him on that.  I feel that the present position in many of our towns, and particularly in the smaller villages through the country is a serious reproach to all of us.  If one goes to some of the prettiest and nicest parts of the country one very often sees derelict sites in the main streets or in the principal parts of some of these towns and villages which are altogether out of keeping with the general surroundings of the place.  I have encouraged <Col N="1513" /> the members of local authorities to use the very restrictive powers that the Derelict Sites Act confers on them for the purpose of acquiring those sites either by agreement or otherwise, and to explore, first of all, the possibility of getting the individuals who own those sites to make their own personal contribution to housing by building on them, and if they are not agreeable to do so to hand them over for public purposes.  I know that in a number of counties that policy is being followed, and I have very considerable hopes of success along those lines. Now, in a number of cases the pursuance of that policy will involve a modification of housing standards. Those sites are not wide enough, in many cases, to permit of the addition of a large and substantial garden to a house, but I think that, at the present time, in view of the general housing position and in view of the difficulty there is sometimes in acquiring sites as well as the necessary legal delays that ensue, this work should go on at the same time as the ordinary work for the acquisition of the land for housing purposes. My regret is that the provisions of that Act are not more flexible and that speedier results cannot be obtained as a result of its operation.  He also referred to the interest manifested by the previous Government in the matter of the conditions of road workers with particular reference to broken time.  I have before me a number of files of various local authorities.  They do not bear out in any way the statement made by Deputy Childers.  For the information of the House, I may say that when I issued a circular to the various local authorities in May of this year I found that there was no change in the position. If my recollection serves me well, as a member of a local authority I have never heard of any inquiry from the Department or any evidence of solicitude on the part of the previous Minister in regard to the wet time conditions of county council workers.  I have before me also replies to a number of Parliamentary questions on this matter. They all indicate that Deputy Childers is entirely mistaken in saying that there are any official records that go <Col N="1514" /> to show that he, during the time of his association with the Department, had taken any steps in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the Minister must have misunderstood me.  A suggestion had been made that the wet time conditions of county council workers were of a very strict character&mdash;that the men were given hardly any wages at all if the weather was wet for a period.  The suggestion was made during the election and even before it that the then Minister for Local Government was the person who was holding down particular conditions there.  What I meant to convey to the present Minister was that the previous Minister had not insisted that these strict conditions be observed and that he had not opposed requests, when made, for improvement in the wet time conditions of county council workers.  I do not say he himself initiated correspondence in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be glad to know that I have initiated these inquiries.  I have asked the local authoritties for information in regard to this matter.  I hope to be able to get from the local authorities an indication of their willingness to co-operate in making up for this difficulty, which is a very real difficulty and hardship for road workers in many parts of the country.  On the general question of road workers raised by Deputy Keane and others I want to say that I think the first step towards stabilisation of their conditions must be a reduction in the number of grades of road workers.  There are in all, I think, 40 different grades of road workers in this country.  I would welcome a very considerable reduction in the number of these grades, when the whole question could be examined with a view to doing something along the lines which have already been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lehane has referred to the question of housing on a national basis and long-term planning accordingly. As I hope to say a word generally on that subject afterwards, I will leave that matter over until I have an opportunity of referring to it in a general way.  A case has also been made for <Col N="1515" /> some special consideration for the lower paid officials of local bodies. That is, of course, as members of the House will understand, primarily a matter for the local bodies themselves in the first instance.  If proposals for dealing with those cases are put forward, Deputies may be assured that they will get the fullest possible consideration.</P>
    <P>Amongst other matters Deputy Burke referred to the exorbitant cost of the erection of labourers' cottages. I agree that it is very difficult to understand the wide discrepancy that exists between the figure for the erection of labourers' cottages in County Wexford, which is roughly £650; in West Cork, which is something around the same figure, perhaps slightly under it; and the figure of £900 and much higher in adjoining counties.  I have urged the local authorities to re-examine the whole position&mdash;to go into the question of the plans and specifications with a view to doing whatever is possible to stimulate local interest and local competition for a work of this kind in order that there shall be some general resemblance at a lower price throughout the country in the case of one county and another.  I do not think I can say any more on the matter at the moment except that in that connection we have suggested to the local authorities that contracts for a number of cottages might be sub-divided.  The smaller person, not possessed of a great deal of capital, who may be willing to tender for the erection of a few cottages would not, in that way, be discouraged. If necessary, also, portion of the joinery and other work in connection with the erection of rural cottages, and even town houses in many cases, might be sub-let for the purpose of encouraging the smaller man in the execution of that work.</P>
    <P>Certain local authorities have been considering other methods of dealing with the matter but, generally speaking, I recognise that the position is not uniform or, in many cases, satisfactory, and everything possible that can be done officially will be done to improve it.  But again it is a matter in which the local authorities can be the best <Col N="1516" /> judges and can be the best agents towards effecting an improvement. Deputy Burke also dealt with the position in connection with the local authority who went out of office when the Commissioner was appointed in County Dublin.  I do not want to go into that matter now except to say that I have every confidence that, when the membership of the local authority is open to the people for the selection of their representatives in the election to be held this year, the result will be for the good of County Dublin, and to the advantage of local administration as a whole.  He has also referred to a number of other matters including some local works and the provision of protective clothing for road workers.  The local authorities are being encouraged in every possible way to provide protective clothing for their workers. There has been, and I have personal knowledge of this, some difficulty in the matter in the past due to the fact that the materials supplied to the local authorities were in some cases quite unsatisfactory and unsuitable.  I am hoping that the combined purchasing section of the Department may be able to help in the matter in the future and that the clothing that is provided will be of a durable and substantial nature.</P>
    <P>The question of repairs to labourers' cottages has also been raised.  I am quite satisfied that the position regarding repairs to labourers' cottages is not satisfactory in many parts of the country.  Local authorities, on the occasion of our housing conferences, are being encouraged to take the most expeditious steps possible for the repair of labourers' cottages.  I do not think we can disguise from ourselves the fact that actually many labourers' cottages in this country were very defectively built.  Consequently, they left the tenants and the local authorities with a legacy that was not a very happy or an enviable one.  A number of local authorities all over the country have abandoned the old system of repairing labourers' cottages by contract.  They have instituted a system of direct labour, dividing the county into regional areas for that purpose.  I am informed that in a <Col N="1517" /> number of counties the new system is working quite satisfactorily and I think it will be the line of development on which labourer's cottages will be repaired in the future.  In the meantime, every effort that can be made will be made and I am satisfied that local authorities are quite alive to this matter of preventing long delays.  I know the Department made a contribution to this matter some considerable time ago, in easing the requirements by which specifications for repairs covering small amounts had at one time to be submitted to the Department.  I know that position has been eased, with the result that officers of local authorities are freer in that connection than they were previously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the question of housing and house purchase, in regard to labourers' cottages. An Act of Parliament was passed some years ago for such purchase and on the whole it has not led to any widespread transfer of the cottages to the labourers.  A very large majority of the occupants are still fighting shy of entering into purchase arrangements. We would need to give the matter some further time before we could consider any extension of this scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme has also led to certain peculiar difficulties with regard to vested cottages.  They have been the subject of a number of cases of litigation in the High Court in recent years and I think the position is one in which we should hasten slowly.  Generally, the ideal of everyone in this country, whether in town or rural areas, having facilities to own his own house is an extremely good one, and one to which I subscribe.  The peculiar position of labourers' cottages and the whole set up of the Labourers Acts as framed up to the present, presents difficulty and the whole matter should be examined much more fully and carefully before any further steps are taken.  I think that any steps that will be taken will have to involve certain amending legislation, to remove difficulties that have been revealed already in connection with the working of the Act up to the present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also referred to this long-standing and vexed question of the house owned by the Irish <Col N="1518" /> Soldiers' and sailors' Land Trust and to the consequences that have flown from a decision of the Supreme Court, given in this country a number of years ago and the terms of which will be well within the recollection of members of the House.  The position has been quite unsatisfactory over a number of years and all the House could expect me to say is that the matter is now being considered and has been under consideration for several weeks past. It is hoped to bring the two contending parties in this dispute together to a meeting, in which certain heads of agreement might be reached and ultimately securing the concurrence of the trust both here and across Channel &mdash;and of the British Government, to whatever extent they enter into the matter&mdash;with a view to ending these difficulties, so as to give security to the tenants of the houses.  What the future will hold in regard to housing from that quarter is another matter. It is a big question and I do not want to say anything about it at the moment, or raise any hopes that may not be realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan asked that restrictions on the work of local authorities should be removed as far as possible and I assure him that he is pressing an open door.  I feel that the local authorities should be given, inside certain broad limits, the widest possible control over their own affairs.  There should be no irritating restrictions in their way and there should be a broad basis of co-operation between the local authority and the Department.  He also made a very valuable suggestion, that local authorities who have made very considerable progress already with housing schemes should now consider transferring, with the consent of the tenants, some tenants from smaller houses&mdash;tenants who are of good financial standing- to larger houses that may be more suitable to the size of the family and the rent of which it may not be beyond their capacity to pay.  That would help in many areas and I know that not alone in Cork, for which Deputy Sheehan speaks, but in other areas that policy is being considered. It is a matter for the local authority and, generally speaking, it is one of which I would approve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> On the question raised by Deputy McGrath, I want to say that there was no intention whatever to slight the Chairman of the Cork County Council, who was not present at the housing conference held in Cork.  Deputy McGrath must know as well as I do that the chairman, to the regret of everyone who knows him, has been very seriously ill for a long time and that, due to certain changes in the political situation and the set-up of the Government, there was no permanent vice-chairman of the council available on that occasion. I am satisfied that the public representatives in Cork did not misunderstand my action in that matter and I would certainly like to remove the idea that any reflection was intended. They have made in the past, and I am certain they will make in the future, their contribution to housing in a very fair and very progressive way.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see there was a sting in the tail of Deputy McGrath's remarks, in which there was a suggestion that the idea of the present Minister for Local Government was to put certain people in the building industry out of business.  He said that it may be so, that he did not know. The suggestion was very definitely contained there and it follows on a certain letter that appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> from a very new builder who appeared in Cork recently.  There is no foundation whatever for that statement. Any suggestion for the employment of direct labour was in order to secure more competition, to accelerate housing development, and not with any sectional interest or any desire to further the interests of particular trade unions or particular political parties. I do not accuse Deputy McGrath of having that view, but I think it was a pity it should have been put in the House.  We ought to get credit for intentions which are slightly better than those suggested.</P>
    <P>There was also raised the question of the amount of grants to private persons in respect of houses built before November, 1947.  This was left in a very indefinite manner when the Act was going through.  Suggestions were made to the Minister and I am not quite clear as to whether any promise <Col N="1520" /> was given, but the position was not quite satisfactory and, unfortunately, the terms of the Act are there to be carried out.  I can only say that the spirit of the Act will be carried out as fully and as sympathetically as possible. As will be generally recognised, however, I must have regard to the letter of the Act and so must the officials who have to deal with this matter and who are answerable to the Public Accounts Committee and to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for their own actions, individually and collectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I will, but the Act, in fact, is very new, and, as Deputy Allen knows&mdash;he is a very old member of this House&mdash;it is unusual to have an Act amended within a very short time after its passing.  I can only say that we shall endeavour to assess the extent of the difficulty in this matter and it will then be further considered. I cannot promise legislation in connection with a matter of this kind.  I realise that in cases of this kind there is bound to be a considerable amount of hardship involved in a certain number of cases.  However, the matter will be considered further in the light of experience.</P>

    <P>Deputy Cogan suggested the stanardisation of the type of houses to be erected in this country.  I am not sufficiently an authority on that matter to say whether such a policy would be good or bad in the end.  As the House knows, there is a committee set up for the purpose of considering and giving a certain variety in the matter of design in housing.  I would not like to feel that we would set official sanction to a policy of standardising houses generally throughout the country.  I do not think that would be a desirable thing to do.  So far as that can be given effect to for the purpose of keeping costs down to the lowest possible figure, it is a matter which might bear examination.  Deputy Cogan also <Col N="1521" /> made a very interesting suggestion in regard to the future of local authorities. He suggested that certain members of the local authorities should be asked to devote themselves to the work of particular departments.  I am not so sure how that would work out in practice, but I think it would be a good thing for local authorities in the future to appoint certain sub-committees at the annual meeting to act as executive committees in matters requiring rapid decision.  Such committees would, too, provide a useful liaison for the local authority itself in the full and free use of its powers as the elected representatives of the people.  That matter will come in for early consideration in connection with whatever proposals or changes will be made in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera made, in my opinion, certain very useful suggestions towards the solution of certain difficulties with regard to sites for housing in the City of Dublin.  All those have been noted and they will be considered as fully as possible.  Certain suggestions were made as to the location of sites for large groups of houses and I feel sure that those suggestions, when brought to the notice of the housing council of the local authority, will get full consideration.  Like him, I, too, am concerned with the rather steep increase in rates throughout the country.  The present increase in rates is, of course, due to a large variety of causes, causes well within the knowledge of members of this House. Increases in salaries have had to be provided for officials of the local bodies, as also have increases in wages. I am not suggesting in the latter case that the demands of the employees have been met to the extent to which I would have liked to have seen them met.  But all those factors contributed to the increases in rates.  Other factors bearing upon the increases came into effect in recent years and they all tended to add considerably to the charges imposed on local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more active interest taken in local affairs by the members of local bodies.  That is a hope I entertain in connection with whatever changes are made in the <Col N="1522" /> structure and management of local government.  One of the things I have observed in recent years is the gradual waning interest shown by local representatives in their own local affairs.  I regret very much that that should be so.  I have been present at estimates meetings of a local body where very large sums of money were under consideration for disbursement over a period of 12 months, the programme having been laid down.  I have often regretted the paucity of comment on these very large commitments under consideration.  I remember a time when every single item was closely scrutinised at the estimates meeting.  I am not so sure that I was then happy about that close scrutiny but, in the end, I realised that it was a good and useful policy to examine closely into expenditure and to show the result of that examination in whatever alteration could reasonably be made.  I would encourage local authorities to have in future a preliminary examination of their estimates made by a special committee of the council in order that a careful examination might be made of expenditure. It is inevitable that certain substantial increases in rates should have occurred. I regret that they should have occurred at a time when the responsibilities of local authorities in connection with housing and other matters are increasing. To a large extent, however, we are powerless to avert these increases at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keane referred to a number of local matters in his constituency, including the case of a rate collector in Cork who was a temporary official of the council over a number of years and in respect of whom repeated applications were made by the county council over a number of years for sanction for his permanent employment.  It is a fact that he was successful in qualifying for appointment to a permanent post by passing the examination of the minor legal appointments system arranged by the local bodies.  He will be happy to know that the matter need no longer trouble him because the question has been settled and sanction has been given in that particular case to a permanent appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to the question of the issue of licences and the delays that occurred.  It is inevitable that there should be certain delays in connection with the issue of licences.  I hope that we shall reach a stage shortly when the whole position in regard to the issue of licences will be considerably eased.  The recent removal of the internal control of timber&mdash;a very important commodity in regard to building&mdash;is an indication of the progress that has been made in that direction.  But, having regard to the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce before they can issue licences will have to ascertain from the Local Government Department certain particulars which will ensure that the building materials will be based on the size of the house and the requirements of the house, it will be understood that there are reasons for delays that cannot be entirely overcome. With regard to by-roads or minor roads, I shall have something to say on those before the debate closes. The Deputy referred to a particular case in Leix-Offaly where flooding has resulted on a road because of an alteration in the old course of a river.  I think he will agree with me that it is, in one form or another, a very old problem; but that does not suggest that its solution should be shelved, if the problem is capable of solution.  It is suggested in the Department that this is a matter that may again be considered under the recent Sanitary Services Act and it has, therefore, been referred to the legal advisers of the Department for further consideration. Already we have had technical advice from an engineering inspector in the Department and it may be that ultimately the powers of the local authority will be so ineffective to deal with it that it may form part of a wider problem of drainage in that area.  I can only say that whatever service the Department can give the local authority, within reason, towards a solution, will be given.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the needs of the country places in the matter of housing.  I realise there is still in the rural areas a considerable need in that direction.  When I say <Col N="1524" /> that private persons, a very large number of whom reside in the rural areas, are expected to make a contribution towards the solution of the housing problem to the extent of 40,000 houses, I think the Deputy will realise that we are not losing and cannot lose sight of the rural areas in this connection. I feel sure that the rural areas will benefit very considerably by the operations of the Act and the easing of whatever regulations can be eased or liberally interpreted in connection with the working of that Act.</P>
    <P>I have known for a very considerable time about this problem of cul-de-sac roads.  I wish I could suggest an immediate solution.  I promise to have that matter further examined with the object of seeing what can be done.  I know it represents a difficulty and is a source of discontent in many parts of the country.  I would like to see some remedy.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot adopt the advice given to me in the matter of housing, that we should hasten slowly. On the contrary, our idea is that we should accelerate our pace as much as possible.  It is true that there are difficulties because of certain costs, but I am afraid we cannot afford to wait very much longer as all the circumstances point to this, that it is a problem that has grown enormously in the five or six years of the emergency, during which it was quite impossible to give it the amount of attention it deserved.</P>
    <P>We had also from Deputy Fitzpatrick a contribution on housing.  He spoke on lines somewhat similar to those suggested in a plan received in the Department some weeks ago with regard to the erection of temporary houses.  That plan is being examined and certain inquiries are being made There would be no difficulty in approving generally the principle he outlined once the question as to whether we should proceed to erect temporary houses for an interim period was settled.  Once that matter is settled some decision will be taken in reference to this, and I may say it will be taken in a short time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made, in common with other Deputies, a plea for the <Col N="1525" /> white-collar workers.  We have encouraged the local authorities and also the boroughs to acquire sites inside and outside their boundaries for the purpose of helping those people to make a contribution by housing themselves.  We have encouraged the making of sites available at a fair price and giving them all the facilities that can be given to enable them to erect houses for themselves.  That will show how earnest we are that private persons of that class should be enabled to make a contribution to their own housing.  The grants available in the Department, plus sites at a reasonable cost, plus the operation of the Small Dwellings Act and the facilities afforded under that Act, should enable a very substantial contribution to be made.</P>
    <P>I also hope that groups of workers in various forms of employment will come together for the purposes of forming utility societies and make a combined effort towards erecting their own houses.  I promise that if any general evidence of a development of that kind is shown to me, I will do whatever I can to see that the local authorities give them the fullest possible facilities in acquiring sites and in erecting the houses they require.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak with any degree of knowledge on the question of ground rents for shops and houses, which was raised by Deputy Byrne.  It is a matter on which I have very little knowledge and I have not had an opportunity within the past few days of studying the official information that is available.  I will ask the officials of the Department to let the Deputy have information to whatever extent it is available in a short time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Brennan had some criticisms to offer in connection with the constitution of the housing council. I should like to explain to him that my difficulty there was as regards the size of the council.  My desire was that in order to do the work well and speedily the council should be a small one.  I know there are very many worthy and useful persons whose names could be added, If it was possible to have a larger council.  It is intended that this council should work, not over <Col N="1526" /> and above the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, but rather along the same lines and that it should contain advantages that are not entirely available to the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, which is a very large body and in regard to whose work I have nothing but what is good to say.</P>
    <P>I think the members of local authorities will agree that there are very definite limitations in the working of a large body, and in this and other matters a small committee is preferable. I may say, for the Deputy's information, there will be an addition made to the membership of the housing council when the local elections are being held in County Dublin and it may be possible to reconcile in a satisfactory way the needs of County Dublin when that opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, and I think Deputy Byrne also, advocated the appointment of a Minister for Housing.  I do not think we have reached the stage yet when that matter can be fully considered. There could be a very much better case made for that some years ago than there can be made now, because then the Local Government Department dealt also with health and social welfare.  The setting up of separate Ministries to deal with health and social welfare relieved the Local Government Department considerably. I do not know that that proposal could be fully justified at present and I do not think that we can offer any final opinion until we see what progress can be made under the existing position.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the acquisition of sites in urban and other areas. I have already dealt with the point that sites should be made available to private persons at a fair price and so enable them to avoid the difficulty of trying to get sites&mdash;vainly in many cases&mdash;and in the end purchasing them at prohibitive prices.  With regard to the statement that housing should be considered on lines altogether apart from mere budgetary considerations, I sympathise very much with that view. I am inclined to think that the final solution of the housing question in this country must depend on how far we can go in that direction.  I am satisfied <Col N="1527" /> that we want to make very considerable progress in that direction and I think he will find that, so far as I am concerned, I shall not be unmindful of what I believe should be a very useful asset towards putting housing on a higher plane in this country in future than it occupied before.</P>
    <P>The same remark applies to certain criticisms offered by Deputy Hickey in connection with the present financial requirements of houses.  I am glad that he referred to the question of direct labour in Cork in the matter of housing, because there seems to be in certain quarters of this House an impression that direct labour was a system that had already been tried and found wanting.  It is, of course, a system that requires good and active supervision.  I believe that supervision can be secured in many cases in close association with the skilled operatives employed or through their trade unions. I am glad to say that in one borough in this country already we suggested to the local authority&mdash;and they very readily accepted the suggestion&mdash;to initiate a scheme for the provision of 74 houses through direct labour.  In that particular case the local trades council offered to make their contribution to the success of the experiment by setting up a committee to consult with the engineer and to supervise output and the general control of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should say without being unduly optimistic in this matter that I have every hope that this experiment will justify itself.  In fact, the report of the Dublin housing council, published some time ago, did not suggest, as was stated by some members of the House, that the experiment was a failure in Dublin.  It, in fact, showed that certain costs in connection with direct labour were very considerably lower than they could be otherwise, but it did suggest that the experiment as a whole was somewhat dearer, and gave some reasons in mitigation of that view.  It suggested that in future 25 per cent. of the work done by the local authorities should be carried out by direct labour.  I look forward to the time when local bodies can proceed <Col N="1528" /> with well-defined plans for the provision of houses by direct labour, and I am quite satisfied that with the co-operation forthcoming in certain areas, direct labour and the contract system also, working side by side, testing and checking prices, results and values, will be able to do excellent work in that direction and will be able to give us an amount of information that will be very useful in the matter of arriving at final costs and furnishing suggestions as to how future schemes should be carried out.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to the question of construction of houses in urban areas.  It is a fact that reconstruction grants are available in urban areas to ordinary persons now&mdash;small farmers or labourers.  The term &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; is a wide one under the meaning of the Act.  The Housing Act also affords facilities for the reconstruction of houses in urban areas owned by persons who let them for rent provided those houses are subject to examination by the local authority and that notice is served on the owners of such houses requiring them under the terms of the Act to reconstruct the houses and provided also that the local authority is in a position to give certain financial facilities to the owners of such houses for the purpose of that reconstruction.  I hope that provision will be availed of to a considerable extent and that, in cases where it is not possible for the owners to avail of that provision, they may, in agreement with the local authority, dispose of their property and that, where these houses are suitable for reconditioning, the local authority will undertake that work.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other matters that would require replies but it is not easy to deal with them in the course of a reply of this kind.  In a general way, I may say to Deputies that the suggestions that have been made&mdash;and a number of them have been very useful&mdash;will be examined as fully as possible.  I feel sure that a number of them can be utilised with advantage to the Department and to the work of local government generally in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to say something in a general <Col N="1529" /> way about two or three matters that have occupied a very considerable portion of the time of the House in the discussion on the Estimates and on which speeches have been contributed by Deputies from all sides of the House.  The first is in connection with the future of local government.  In my judgment, local government in this country should, in future, in order to be successful, be local.  It seems that the tendency in this country for a number of years has been in another direction altogether.  I have always held the view that the Local Government Act, passed by a British Parliament a number of years ago, was perhaps the first and the most substantial instalment of Home Rule for this country.  I regret very much that it seems to have been in the time since we got control of our affairs a sort of play-thing, to be changed and moved about in all directions from time to time.  It seems to me a matter of great regret that there has been no stability in regard to local government policy in this country.  I think the foundation of the success of that policy must be confidence in the people to manage their own affairs locally.  It seems entirely inconsistent to suggest that we can manage our affairs in Parliament here and that our local representatives down the country cannot be trusted to manage their affairs.</P>
    <P>I certainly have no patience with all these pious generalities that are talked about corruption all over the country. There has been no such thing as widespread corruption.  I would say in this country, local administration as well as national administration has been on the whole, taking into account the general position of many other countries, up to a good standard.  If here and there representatives stumbled and fell and were, perhaps, to some extent not quite honourable in their dealings with the people in local matters, that is no reason why the system generally should be condemned. Neither am I satisfied that the County Management Act has made for any great degree of efficiency in this country.  Even if it did, I think you could have in the country that soulless kind of efficiency which is not of such <Col N="1530" /> advantage to the people as a whole. I know&mdash;and it is a remark I have made more than once in this House&mdash; no service in the State which requires to be administered on broader lines of human sympathy than the work of local government.  The local authorities come in contact with the needs of the people every day of the week.  They come in contact with the needs of people who are the most helpless in preparing their own cases and defending their own interests.  Broad and comprehensive sympathy for that work is required and I know nobody who can do that better than the members of local bodies.  I pin my faith, after long experience of local affairs and as a member of a comparatively small minority Party on a local body, to the integrity of our people in such matters. They must and can be trusted to manage their own affairs reasonably well, with advantage to local administration generally.</P>
    <P>This debate has revealed a very remarkable change.  I can remember that when the question of management arose in this House in legislative form the opponents were very few.  The position has in fact been completely reversed now, because neither here nor in the Seanad recently were there many who thought it well to do any honour to this system, this much boosted system, of county management. It was regarded as a readymade recipe for resolving all local difficulties and ills.  It has, in fact, proved to be nothing of the kind, and I know there has been a growing feeling of discontent with the system all over the country for a number of years.  It can, in fact, be said that many of the local authorities and many intelligent people on the local authorities have been in revolt against the system for a very long time.  It is quite well to tell them what powers they have.  We know that certain powers are conferred on them if certain provisions of the Act are invoked, but the plain fact is that they regard themselves as the providers of money in the spending of which they have no say whatever. Therefore my policy will be to restore to the local bodies the greatest degree of control of their own affairs that can be devised by in the first place transferring <Col N="1531" /> certain powers from the managers to the local bodies, and, in the second place, taking whatever other action is necessary for the purpose of adding to and supplementing these powers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to one or two other matters which were touched on only very lightly.  One of these is the care and control of cemeteries.  I should like to take this, the first, opportunity I have got in this House of asking for a new approach to this problem all over the country.  I say definitely that the present position of most of the old cemeteries, and I have a fairly wide knowledge of this matter, is very discreditable to all of us.  We have a great deal of reverence for our dead, and, amongst many people, we are conspicuous for our reverence for the dead, but unfortunately, for whatever reason, we give very little attention to their last resting places, and the present condition of some of our cemeteries is not one on which we can be complimented.</P>
    <P>I feel that one of the advantages of combined engineering services would be to enable more thorough attention to be given to this matter by employees of local authorities in future.  I wish to encourage the local authorities to make sure that their staffs, when not otherwise engaged, will be asked to concentrate on bringing the last resting places of the dead, and particularly the older graveyards which are not now in such general use, up to a good standard of decency and care.  It is true that in many cases in recent years the tendency has been to have the cemetery in close proximity to the church, and, under the control of the clergy, an entirely different story is revealed.  I suggest that this is a service with regard to which we could have a good deal of useful voluntary effort, and I ask good citizens generally to assist in the formation of committees in their various areas to give attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>The old practice of paying a caretaker of a cemetery a few pounds and asking him not alone to open the gates when a funeral came along but also to be responsible for the general upkeep of the cemetery is completely useless, <Col N="1532" /> from the point of view of getting any reasonable standard of care, because the amount allowed in such cases was so small as to provide no reward whatever for that person's labour.  The employees of the local authorities, under combined engineering arrangements, can make a contribution in this respect.  It is also a matter in which many other sections of the people could make a very useful contribution, and I hope that the practice that prevails in certain ecclesiastical areas in the country of devoting a Sunday, or some few days in a particular week, to the general visitation and care of the cemetery in the area, will be universally adopted in the country.  I hope that I may be able to record in 12 months' time a considerable improvement and advance in that direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, the fact is that the whole position has changed considerably in recent years.  The roads are now carrying a degree and a weight of traffic which they were never originally constructed for.  It is a very peculiar position that we should at present have railways rapidly going derelict from the point of view of traffic and incurring very heavy financial liabilities, while a large and increasing amount of the traffic has been steadily diverted to the roads and, strangely enough, to a large extent, by the people responsible for running the railways.  I feel that this is certain in the end to involve a very heavy burden on local bodies, a burden which, in my opinion, it would be scarcely fair to impose on them.  The remedy is not easy to find, but it must be found, and I have certain very strong views as to how that remedy will ultimately be found.  I am satisfied that limitations must be found in order to make as sure as we can that as much traffic as possible is diverted to the railways and that the roads are retained at a reasonable standard of construction and improvement, consistent with the financial position of local bodies and their capacity to bear that burden.</P>
    <P>As to the future I found when I came into the Department plans for the survey of a certain mileage of main <Col N="1533" /> road&mdash;widened, double carriage roads&mdash; the results of which might be available in 50 or 60 years, or perhaps sooner.  I doubt it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a complete misrepresentation of the position and the Minister knows that.  Why did he not outline that policy when he was introducing the Estimates and we could have answered him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my doubts about that policy at local bodies before I came in here.  Local bodies have been driven into that policy for the purpose of getting the grants. That is part of the crippling of local bodies that has led to the unsatisfactory situation in this country in recent years and there is going to be no more of it as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a happy ideal but not an ideal capable of attainment in a reasonable number of years and it is a scheme that does not suggest that it can be applied.  My thoughts turn more and more along the line of a national scheme for the improvement of minor roads.  I want to express my entire sympathy with those members of the House who have drawn my attention to the need to do something in order to bring secondary roads in this country to a good standard. I have given that matter very full consideration and I do hope that we may be able to reach the point where the ordinary person, the farmer and the farm labourer, who from the point of view of employment and facilities are driven, often perilously enough, over the main roads, will have roads to their own door and employment on roads to their own door.  I differ in my views from my predecessor. We are both entitled to hold our own views but I am satisfied that the view which I have is the view most suitable to the needs of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say any more in that connection.  Time will vindicate which view is correct and I am not afraid at all of what the people of the country think in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>My final word will be in connection with housing, and I want again to express the view very sincerely felt that this task would have fallen to somebody else to discharge if that were possible.  The changing political fortunes in this country have brought this task to my door and I accept responsibility for it in, I think, the very full consciousness of my own limitations to discharge that responsibility.  I want the support of the local authorities in the country.  The proportion of the work to be discharged by the local authorities is not in the end the most appalling aspect of the problem in size. The appalling size of the problem in this city and in the surroundings of Dublin is one that intimidates anybody who has tried to make any close study of it.</P>
      <P>With reference to the various difficulties that stand in the way and that have been referred to, I have certain information in connection with the supply position in this country that I would like to bring to the notice of the members of the House so that they would have an up-to-date picture of that position at the present time.  They will be glad to know that with regard to the various items that go to make up a house, the position has improved very considerably since last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply of building materials has improved since last year.  Regarding supplies from Great Britain generally it may be said that they are much easier to obtain than six months ago; variety and sizes are practically unlimited; many of the substitute materials available are comparatively expensive. The supply of timber is now sufficient to meet demand and control has been removed.  The production of sheet glass by the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Limited, is normally sufficient to meet full demand.  The sheet glass plant was, however, temporarily out of commission early this year.  It is now back in production and it is <Col N="1535" /> expected that full output will be available shortly.  Bricks and slates are in satisfactory supply.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure about slates.  I fear that there is in certain areas a shortage of slates but I find that every effort is being made to employ additional persons and open new deposits in that connection to increase the production of slates.</P>
    <P>The demand for cement still continues to exceed production by Cement Limited.  A system of priority certificates for its purchase is in force.  3,000 cons a month are being imported since last April.  In the supply of lead there is a slight improvement.  Baths, practically unobtainable six months ago, are now available in steady quantity and if the present rate of progress continues, another six months should see the end of the shortage.  With regard to sanitary ware generally, articles made of earthenware are scarce and fireclay substitutes are dear.  Steel windows: slight improvement of late. Water piping: supplies are fairly satisfactory. Roofing tiles: local shortages exist.  Cast iron goods, gutters, tanks: shortages are still acute but aluminium substitutes are available in fair quantities. Roofing felt: supplies are fairly satisfactory.  Steel, fireclay goods, electrical goods and copper piping continue to be in short supply.</P>
    <P>It is hoped generally that the position will improve from day to day and I feel that the House will be glad to know that there has been in that period a very substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>Let me turn in a general way to another question, the question of the scarcity of labour.  While that is true to a certain extent all over the country, it is true to a remarkable extent in connection with the City of Dublin. We have been trying to get figures of the number of people available, and I know in one trade, a trade which is most important in the building of houses, we could only depend on about 800 operatives and, I think, 200 improvers or apprentices.  The whole position with regard to that question is, therefore, difficult at the present time, and I would like to avail of this opportunity to make an appeal again <Col N="1536" /> to skilled workers who are outside this country to return to this country in order to take up employment in their own country in the construction of houses for their own people and, I hope, in many cases for themselves. Unfortunately, many of them are constructing houses in another country in unhappy conditions while their wives and children are living in very unsatisfactory houses here at home.  I will go so far as to ask local authorities to reserve a number of houses for those people, if possible, in return for their services in work of this kind.  Their coming back to this country to take up employment is, I think, largely a question of what we can offer them.  I suggest, and I think there can be no doubt about the possibility of having this promise realised, that a number of years' continuous work is before these people if they return.  I invite them to come back and to be assured of regular employment at good wages over a number of years in the construction of houses in Dublin and throughout the country&mdash;they can go to whatever district they normally belong to&mdash;and thereby make a contribution to the solution of this problem.  I also ask for the full co-operation of the trade unions in this country catering for building workers by encouraging in every way possible their members who are away from the country to return to help in this work.  I feel that they can be very powerful and influential agents in this direction.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of alternative methods of building. It does seem to me that this matter will have to be considered in the very near future.  No matter what may be said about certain types of building work, no matter what objections may be entertained, if we depend on the traditional method of building houses so far as the problem concerns this City of Dublin we will not make the impression that we desire on the problem in reasonable time.  I am not so sure even that other and different methods that have not been suggested at all may not have to be used for the purpose of pressing into service certain types of houses in order to make some impression on this ghastly position that prevails in the Metropolis at the present <Col N="1537" /> time.  We are having a close examination of this matter made and Mr. O'Mahony, the housing director, is in consultation with the various interests who are actively concerned in this matter.  I should like to feel that the trade unions could have removed from their minds any fear that even a temporary departure from the traditional methods of building would, in the end, make any serious difference to their rights or to their prospects of employment in the future.  I feel that they will be willing to adopt a far-seeing and patriotic attitude in this matter. If an approach has to be made to them as to what their contribution will be towards a solution of the housing question I feel that I can confidently rely on their considering the matter sympathetically and, in the end, favourably.</P>
    <P>The position of housing in this country is, as has been said from various quarters, a matter of paramount importance.  We must use any and every means towards its solution as rapidly as possible.  It is bound up, first of all, with the physical welfare of our people.  It is bound up with their health.  It is bound up with the sorrowful story of disease and deformity that arises.  It is bound up also with the good citizenship of our people in the future and with removing permanently those social handicaps that many children suffer because of being reared in cramped, unhappy and unhealthy surroundings.  It is in another way a far deeper problem which raises a question that I do not feel I ought to touch upon in this House.  It is a challenge to all of us.  It will require the best efforts that all of us can put forward towards its solution.  It will demand all the resource and all the persistency that we in this country claim very often to possess.  I feel that not alone in this House but throughout the country I will have sympathy and understanding in discharging this duty. It is the highest duty, in my opinion, that this Government can discharge.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to disappoint the people in regard to this matter.  With the help of everybody concerned, with the help of the various interests who have set themselves to consider this <Col N="1538" /> matter and to make a contribution towards it, we will not fail the people in the end.  I feel that by a solution of this problem of housing we will have justified fully our claim to be capable of managing our own affairs, because it seems to me that if we cannot house our own people we will not establish beyond doubt the fact that we are capable of managing our own affairs. I am grateful, therefore, for the encouragement I have got in this debate.  I hope and pray that God's blessing may be with us in this work and that in the end we will not fail the Irish people in this great need of theirs.</P>

      <P>Yes.  A circular has been issued to officers of local authorities that if they had any grievance to be redressed they were to employ the machinery of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations.  The Minister stated that circular had now fallen into complete disuse.  I stated that there was a case pending in his own Department. The fact is that there is a case pending of an employee of a public institution in Cork who invoked the Local Government (Officers) Regulations and sent an appeal to the Minister for Local Government about four months ago.  I have since ascertained that the case has been transferred from the Department of Local Government to the Department of Health for decision there.  In that respect I misrepresented the case as it affected the Minister's Department.  Nevertheless, the fact is that a decision has been pending for four months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after paragraph (b) of Section 10 (4), line 41, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) Entertainments duty shall not be charged, levied or paid on any payments for admission on or after the operative date, to any entertainment consisting of the showing of 16 mm.  films in a village hall, rural hall or travelling unit, duly registered with the Revenue Commissioners and subject to whatever conditions are required by an Order made under this Act.</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment in the form in which I thought it would be most acceptable to the Minister and to the Revenue Commissioners.  I put it in this form in order to leave as open a door as possible for the Commissioners to make whatever regulations they may think would be necessary in order to guard against abuses.  I understand that the abuses involved would be chiefly with regard to commercial undertakings taking advantage of any relief that might be given.  If the form in which I have put it down is not acceptable but if the principle of the amendment is acceptable, I suggest that the Minister might deal with the matter when the Bill comes before the Seanad, as it can hardly be dealt with here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we discussed this matter before I have found considerable reaction in favour of the proposal from unexpected quarters not at all confined to any particular Party.  The present position is such that the 16 mm. undertakings are actually going out of business altogether owing to the restrictive conditions.  The renters rent their films according to two different methods.  One is a flat rate. These small people who have undertakings of this kind found the flat rate too onerous. Other renters rent on the basis of 50 per cent. of the profits but, unfortunately, there is a revenue regulation which does not give relief in the case of educational and cultural films if the expenses exceed 50 per cent., with the result that it is impossible for people <Col N="1540" /> to take advantage of any relief that might be coming to them otherwise.</P>
    <P>The effects of giving relief in this matter could be very great indeed.  It gives an opportunity to individual effort.  It would allow people who are imbued not by any commercial motive but by public spirit and who wish to give public service to their localities to make a modest amount of money which would help to build a hall or to purchase plant or even to purchase cameras and to make their own local films.  Ultimately they would be of very great interest to the people in showing local history, local folklore and archæology.  There could even be films of the comic and amusing kind.  Local people would like to see themselves on the films.  The thing is capable of being used to remove what has been called rural depression.  I remember one lecturer saying that rural depression is mental depression.  At least, this is one factor which has been realised in some places as helping greatly to remove that and also to remove one of the causes of emigration.</P>
    <P>There are various bodies that have been interested and that would be very interested in the development of the 16 mm. film.  For instance, the Gaelic League could use it as an instrument for creating a greater interest in the language.  We are very often apt to scold people because they do not talk Irish.  Irish is regarded by the children as having been a task at school.  In that connection, no attempt has been made to use this instrument of films, which has been called by educational authorities the only adult education that takes place for the ordinary public.  I remember one prominent educationist saying that the education of the country had passed out of the hands of educationists into the hands of people who make films.  Certainly, it is true of the boys and girls who go to work early in life and have not the opportunities of other educational resources that their main mental pabulum is going to the films.  Therefore, there is no sense in abusing people for going to the films or in abusing films. That is a purely negative attitude.  We ought to be able to give the people something constructive, something they <Col N="1541" /> can do themselves.  If they take an interest in local films, they will begin to take an interest in having films made for themselves.  From that point of view it could be used as a very valuable instrument.  Young farmers' clubs in many cases have instructional films which give them an opportunity of learning things which they otherwise would not get an opportunity of seeing in action.  Muintir na Tíre for some time took up this idea and had to drop it because it did not pay.  All these bodies which are non-political and which are interested in developing the amenities in rural life have in this instrument something they could use if they had this relief.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need press the matter any further.  If the amendment is not found verbally suitable, the Minister could take his own opportunity to adapt it and to give the relief which is asked for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reinforce what Deputy Little has said in regard to this amendment.  It seems to me it is one that could be accepted without involving the Central Fund in any great loss.  The purpose which moves us in putting down the amendment is to try to provide for the position of those small rural areas where it is not possible to maintain a cinema in the same way as cinemas are maintained in the larger centres of population.  We feel that it would be attractive, from the point of view of providing some of the amenities for the rural population which the urban populations enjoy, if they could cater for themselves in respect of cinema entertainments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a person who takes a very narrow or limited view in regard to dance halls, but there are people who think some alternative form of amusement to dance halls might be provided in country districts, and this is one of the things that suggest themselves to us.  The amendment is drawn in such a way as to enable the Revenue Commissioners to draft regulations to prevent the concession given from being abused.  A limitation could be imposed as to the size of the hall and as to the type of the programme.  I do not, of course, think that a programme composed entirely of cultural or educational <Col N="1542" /> items would be a very popular one or unduly attractive, and, therefore, the purely entertainment aspect of the programme would have to be catered for.  The amendment as drawn does permit a concession of this sort to be given within such limits as the Revenue Commissioners may devise with a view to protecting the revenue, but, at the same time, enabling the rural populations to enjoy one of the amenities at any rate which is a commonplace entertainment of the urban population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument has got somewhat confused.  As the amendment goes, it is related to any entertainment, as long as it is a 16 mm. film and on the amendment that would be exempt.  If that is the suggestion, it should be put forward with the realisation that that is what is the effect of this amendment.  As I say, the argument has been confused because reference has been made to cultural and educational films and films of that sort. The situation at the moment is that if the show consists of films which are of an educational type, there is an exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking of the object to which the proceeds may be devoted.  If the film is educational and if nothing but educational films be shown, there is no question of expenses, there is exemption.  There are certain shows with regard to certain film entertainments, which may be regarded as being for the promotion of the Irish language.  Again, it is not a question of the proceeds being devoted to anything; that is a question of exemption and there is provision enough for that.  There are then certain exemptions which are permissible where the proceeds are allocated in a particular way, and there the question of expenses may come in.  But that is not being discussed here.  The Deputy did bring in the film which was for entertainment&mdash;this was the purport of his remarks&mdash;to enliven the countryside.</P>

I do not abuse people who go to films, or abuse the use of films, and certainly not in relation to the office that I hold. What I am asked to do here is to provide that there is to be no entertainment duty as long as&mdash;I am summarising the amendment&mdash;the entertainment consists of the showing of 16 mm. films, and as long as they are shown in a village or rural hall or by a travelling unit.</P>

      <P>If I have to take the mobile unit which goes around the rural areas I must say that I do not accept the Deputy's contention that it is not a paying proposition.  There have been indications recently that the owners of some of those mobile units have extended the area over which they work.  Quite clearly they would not do that unless they had discovered it to be profitable to do so and, apparently, it was profitable when the tax was heavier than it is now being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the information that I got from some people who are interested in this.  I was told that they were extending their area because they were not making money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have information about certain mobile units where the circuit has been extended.  However, I do not think any firm conclusion can be founded on the fact that the mobile unit as such does not pay.  I cannot <Col N="1544" /> say that this matter has been thoroughly investigated.  It is a rather new proposal.  There has not been time to get it investigated and all its reactions looked into.  The areas one might take to measure the effect of the amendment would be areas in which the admission charges would be very low.  Consequently, the tax would be very low.  If the answer is made to me that there would be no great loss of revenue I would have to admit that if my premise is correct.</P>
      <P>This amendment introduced a differentiation between the countryside and the towns, and at the moment I am not prepared to accept it.  I do not know what the reactions of it are, how far it would go, what reservations would have to be made or what type of regulations or conditions would have to be put into the Order.  The most that I can say to the Deputy is that the matter can be examined, not, however, with a view to its being thought of this year though it may be later.  I am not making any promises in that regard.  Investigation may show me that it would be quite impossible to carry out such a proposal.  In any event one would need to have a case made for it in a more emphatic way before this principle of differentiation should be allowed.  If it were allowed with regard to one thing it would be pressed in regard to other things.</P>

      <P>The aggregate amount of the nine Votes is £3,436,360, which shows a decrease of £21,000 on the Estimates (including supplementaries) for the year 1947/48.  The figure £3,436,360 is made up as follows:&mdash; Vote 32&mdash;Office of the Minister for Justice, £66,380; Vote 33&mdash;Garda Síochána, £2,891,190; Vote 34&mdash;Prisons, £167,970; Vote 35&mdash;District Court, £65,950; Vote 36 &mdash; Circuit Court, £84,710; Vote 37&mdash;Supreme Court and High Court, £70,800; Vote 38&mdash;Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £64,280; Vote 39&mdash;Public Record Office, £7,040; Vote 40&mdash;Charitable Donations and Bequests, £4,040.</P>
      <P>Vote 32&mdash;Office of the Minister for Justice&mdash;The Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice, at £66,380, shows an increase of £1,150 on the Estimate for 1947/48.  There is a decrease in the estimate for headquarters staff, and the increase is accounted for mainly by increases in the cost of censorship of films and publications, and travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> The Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, established an appeal board and transferred to the censorship board the functions formerly exercised by the Minister for Justice under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929.  These changes made it necessary to increase the staff of the Censorship of Publications Office, and the secretary's salary was also included.</P>
    <P>The sum of £350 under sub-head A(5) for the remuneration of a joint secretary of the Irish Legal Terms Advisory Committee should now read as £400. He is a barrister with special qualifications in Irish, employed on a part-time basis.  Three legal terms Orders have already been published under the auspices of this committee.  They set out Irish equivalents for legal terms relating to (1) landlord and tenant law, conveyancing, and the law of property; (2) criminal law, and (3) workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that a sum of £300 is provided under sub-head E for expenses in connection with awards for acts of bravery.  Comhairle na Mire Gaile, which makes the awards, was set up last year.  The comhairle's report for the year 1947 has been laid on the Table of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head A (4) there is a sum of £600 for &ldquo;Legal and Technical Assistance.&rdquo; This is mainly to cover the fees of outside legal draftsmen engaged to assist the several rules committees who make rules of court.  One important set of these rules was completed during the year and is now in operation, viz., the new rules of the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Garda Síochána at £2,891,190, shows a decrease of £37,530 from last year's figure.  The bulk of the decrease is under sub-head A, which provides for salaries, wages and pay.  The explanation of the decrease under this sub-head is that retiring members, on or near the maximum of their scales, are being replaced by recruits coming in at the minimum.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is prepared on the basis of an estimated strength of 7,494 officers and men, the same figure as last year.  The actual strength on 31st May was 7,496.  Further recruitment has been suspended pending an <Col N="1547" /> examination of the whole question of Garda strength.  Losses by deaths and retirements are at present at the rate of 18 per month.  The average strength over the year will, therefore, assuming that recruitment remains suspended, be about 100 below the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In connection with sub-head H, Transport and Carriage, I have arranged that the Taoiseach will make use of a State car in the same way as other Ministers.  In view of this arrangement the Taoiseach will not, of course, avail himself of the motor car allowance provided in sub-head E of the Estimate for his own Department.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the Garda Síochána, I want to say a word on the use of influence.  It appears that every time there is a change of Minister there are always a few members of the force who think they see an opportunity of securing personal concessions by the use of influence.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I want to point out that any such approach by a member of the force is a breach of discipline, expressly forbidden by the Discipline Regulations made in 1926 by the then Minister for Justice with the approval of the Government.  In addition to these Regulations, the use of influence is prohibited by the Garda Síochána Code in specific and clear-cut articles published in 1928, 1932 and 1933 and finally in December of last year when the articles came up in the ordinary way for revision and re-issue.  There have also been periodic reminders emphasising the relevant provisions of the Regulations and of the Code; thus there were reminders in 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1937.</P>
    <P>Deputies and other public men who are approached by members of the force to use their influence on their behalf should bear in mind that the member is asking them to do something which is contrary to the regulations and, if done, may result in injuring the applicant instead of helping him.  What I have said applies to attempts to use influence to obtain promotion or to escape punishment as well as to secure a transfer, but transfers are, in practice, the source of most of the trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> Before I leave the subject, I should like to make it clear that every member of the force who has (or thinks he has) a legitimate grievance can be certain of having his case fully and fairly considered by making appropriate representations through the proper channels. Moreover, a member is allowed, if he so desires, to address representations directly to the Commissioner in a sealed envelope and can thus be sure that anything he may have to say will be brought to the Commissioner's personal notice.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Prisons at £167,970, shows an increase of £13,120 over last year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe the principal increases are: sub-head B, victualling, £830; sub-head E, fuel, light, water, cleaning articles, etc., £3,606; sub-head H, maintenance of buildings and equipment, £6,340; sub-head K, incidental expenses, £929; sub-head M, maintenance of criminal lunatics in district mental hospitals, £700; sub-head O, contributions to discharged prisoners' aid societies, £925; sub-head P, manufacturing departments and farms, £2,320.</P>
    <P>The increase on sub-head B is due to the increase in the cost of foodstuffs for prisoners.  The estimate of the cost per head per annum has been increased from £23 7s. 2d. for 1947/48 to £26 15s. 7d. for 1948/49.</P>
    <P>The increase in sub-head H is mainly due to provision being made for a new boilerhouse at Mountjoy Prison, repairs to the roofs of Mountjoy and Portlaoighise prisons and further improvements in St. Patrick's at Clonmel.  As I have mentioned St. Patrick's, I may perhaps take this opportunity to draw attention to the very interesting illustrated booklet on the institution recently compiled by the visiting committee and published by the Stationery Office with my approval.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head K is due mainly to provision being made for the purchase of miniature film units for Mountjoy, Portlaoighise and St. Patrick's, Clonmel.  for the supply of cigarettes (or tobacco) to prisoners in Portlaoighise, and for the purchase of <Col N="1549" /> games for the use of prisoners during recreation periods.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M, Maintenance of Criminal Lunatics in District Mental Hospitals, is based on estimates obtained from district mental hospitals throughout the country.  The cause of the increase is an increase in the costs of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head O is due to the grant to the Catholic Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society being increased from £50 to £1,000.  Discharged prisoners' aid societies look after discharged prisoners, buy clothes and tools, and endeavour to obtain employment for them.  The Catholic Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society is a subsidiary of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and the latter society asked for an increase in the grant.  The increase was, in fact, granted before I became Minister but I quite approve of it and I am sure that the money will be spent to good advantage.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head P in respect of the expenses of the manufacturing department and farms is accounted for by the fact that provision is made for the purchase of finishing machines for the shoemaking shops at Mountjoy, Portlaoighise and St. Patrick's, Clonmel; for the replacement of worn out mail-bag making machines; and the purchase of an electric washing machine and an electric hydro-extractor for Mountjoy.  There is nothing that I need add at this stage with regard to the changes of the several sub-heads on this Vote.  There are, however, two topics of more general interest on which I should like to add a word.  Firstly, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are making provision for the first time this year for a post of Inspector of Prisons.  The actual provision will be found in Vote 32.  The appointment of a whole-time Inspector of Prisons is long overdue and it was recognised by my predecessor, who took the initiative in having the appointment made shortly before he went out of office.  Secondly, I should like to refer to the change in the name of the Borstal Institute at Clonmel.  This Institute will be known in future as &ldquo;St. Patrick's, Clonmel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> In connection with the last-mentioned Votes (Garda Síochána and Prisons), it is usual and proper to make a short statement on the position as regards crime&mdash;the fundamental reason why the taxpayer has to provide £3,000,000 a year for these two services. I shall not go into details.  Deputies will find a mass of information in the annual reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, which are issued to the Press and copies of which are to be had in the Oireachtas Library. The final report for the year 1947 will not be available for another month or so, but I have received from the Commissioner an interim report.  The outstanding items in it are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Indictable Crime: The total number of indictable crimes reported to the police in 1947 was 15,302 as compared with 15,078 in 1946 and 16,786 in 1945. The figure of 15,302 was made up as follows:&mdash;Offences against the person (murder, manslaughter, wounding, etc.), 450; offences against property with violence (burglary, house-breaking, robbery and malicious damage), 2,736; offences against property without violence (larceny, receiving, embezzlement, etc.), 11,931; other indictable offences (forgery, perjury, unlawful possession of firearms, etc.), 185.</P>
    <P>Non-indictable Offences: The total number of prosecutions for nonindictable offences in 1947 was 153,081, as compared with 150,928 in 1946 and 150,862 in 1945.  Of these prosecutions 89,110 were under the Road Traffic Act, 59,209 being in respect of offences against the lighting regulations.  There were 11,634 prosecutions under the licensing Acts, 13,655 in respect of unlicensed dogs, and 9,328 for offences under the school attendances Acts.</P>
    <P>Juvenile Crime: The number of persons under 18 years of age who were charged with indictable offences in 1947 was 2,604, as compared with 2,409 in 1946 and 2,833 in 1945.  Of these juveniles, 739 were charged with housebreaking, 306 with larceny from shops, 163 with larceny from unattended motor cars, and 1,049 with other larcenies.</P>
    <P>Vote 35 for the District Court, at £65,950, shows an increase of £3,200 on <Col N="1551" /> last year's figure, and Vote 36 for the Circuit Court, at £84,710, shows an increase of £770.  Deputies will observe that there is, at the end of each of these Votes, an appendix giving particulars as to the grading and pay of the clerks.  Except in the case of the clerks in the Dublin Metropolitan District of the District Court, the grades and figures shown in these appendices are those arrived at recently, after discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance as to the reorganisation of the Circuit Court and District Court staffs.  These reorganisations have not been completed.  The position is, broadly, that the Department of Finance has indicated how far it is prepared to go and the clerks are pressing for better terms on various points.  I hope that the whole business will be settled in course of the next few months and I shall do my best to see that a fair balance is struck between the claims of the clerks and the purse of the taxpayer, who has to meet the bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the Circuit Court end of the problem, I may perhaps refer to the figure, etc., shown on page 190 under sub-head A (9)&mdash;Salaries of Staff in the Offices of County Registrars.  In this table, the total number of staff for the new year is shown as 141, as compared with 119 for the preceding year, an apparent increase of 22 persons, whereas the figures for remuneration for the new year add up to a little less than in the preceding year.  It might, therefore, be thought that the numbers are being increased, but that the salaries are being cut.  The truth is, however, that of the 80 odd temporary clerks some 20 have in the past been shown in a group as &ldquo;temporary staff&rdquo; and not counted by heads, whereas they are now classified and numbered as so many clerks of such-and-such a grade.  Also, the fact that the total remuneration appears to be lower for the new year than for the old year is an illusion, arising from the fact that last year's estimate was about £3,000 in excess of actual requirements. What all this comes to, taking it broad and large, is that the staff remains much the same in numbers and personnel, <Col N="1552" /> but is arranged under different classifications, and the total remuneration is estimated at about £2,500 more than was actually paid last year. Lastly, the figures shown for the new year are in many cases only an approximation because, as I have already said, the new scheme of staffing has not yet been translated into reality and until that is done and the position and pay of each individual is definitely settled it is not possible to give an absolutely correct figure.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the District Court clerks is much the same, but with this difference, that the scheme in the latter case has been put into effect to the extent that each clerk was actually advanced some months ago to the salary point appropiate to him under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that in Vote 35, sub-head A, a sum of £1,000 has been provided for a District Court Valuer in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The valuer assists the justice who has been assigned to the hearing of applications from tenants of small premises under Part III of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned in connection with the Vote for the Minister's Office, new District Court Rules were made during the year and are now in force.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Supreme and High Court, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and Charitable Donations and Bequests show only very small fluctuations from last year's figures.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything on these Votes, except in regard to the Land Registry.  I believe that in this case the provision made is inadequate.  As Deputies know, there have been complaints about delays in the Land Registry.  Even during the short time which has elapsed since I became Minister, it has become clear to me that the volume of work coming into the Land Registry has greatly increased, and that it will continue to increase.  For example, on the &ldquo;first registration&rdquo; side, the number of new folios which have to be opened annually is now double what it was a few years <Col N="1553" /> ago, and will go even higher, probably up to three times the old rate.  This is the result of the acceleration of vesting work in the Land Commission. Arrears of &ldquo;first registration&rdquo; work have already accumulated to an undue extent.  A considerable increase in staff is inevitable in these circumstances, and the question of additional accommodation also arises.  I have given a direction that the matter is to be dealt with as one of urgency.  So far as the general taxpayer is concerned, there is the consolation that, owing to the larger revenue in fees, the office is and will remain entirely self-supporting so far as the cost of actual staff is concerned, with a considerable surplus towards incidental expenses such as pensions, buildings and stationery.</P>
    <P>I feel I should say a word upon the question of law reform.  It is one that cannot fail to be of concern to a Minister for Justice and it is at present engaging my attention.  In this connection we shall give due consideration to the proposal of the previous Government for the establishment of a permanent or quasi-permanent law reform committee.  Meanwhile it may be possible to proceed with some reforms in non-contentious matters, reforms that are long overdue.</P>
    <P>On the question of charitable donations and bequests I am satisfied that there is an urgent need for consolidation of the statute law in relation to charities.  This law is spread over three confused and confusing statutes. We hope to have this work undertaken and completed during my term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to notice that the intentions expressed by the former Minister for Justice last year have been carried through.  The Minister mentioned a sum of £13,000 which has been spent on improving conditions in our prisons.  The former Minister, on the occasion when he advocated prison reform, said that he did not want to turn the prison into a Gresham Hotel but at the same time he wanted to give the prisoners better conditions, always maintaining the necessary prison discipline.  It is clear now from this Estimate that the food provided in the prison is better; it is clear that the <Col N="1554" /> prisoners have more recreation and more games and that the system is working very well.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has decided to stop recruiting to the Guards. The Guards have always provided a source of excellent employment for the best elements in the country.  There is an increasing need, especially in the City of Dublin, for more Guards. Judging by the extraordinary traffic accumulation, the Guards in the City of Dublin must be heavily overburdened. I hope that this temporary suspension of recruiting will be very temporary indeed.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that arises on this Estimate to which I should like to refer.  Our Government has been accused by the present Taoiseach of having made legal appointments solely and purely on political grounds. All legal appointments made by our Government were made strictly on merit.  If the Minister will examine the list of such appointments he will find that in every rank of the judicial appointments made there are a good round dozen about whose politics we could not be certain.  I am certain that the present Government could judge what their politics were but, so far as we know, they were not to our way of thinking.  Naturally one does not appoint very active politicians who are opponents.  It would be an insult to offer an active lawyer who was also an active politician in the Opposition a job because that would be tantamount to a bribe.  In making such accusations against us the inference is that lawyers are simply on the hazard to take jobs from any Party irrespective of whether they are supporters of that Party or not.  Perhaps in some measure many such appointments, according to all the traditions of Government, are confined to one side rather than to the other.  At the same time where merit is involved and where it is clear that people deserve certain appointments, such appointments are made and have been made in the past.  I take it that such appointments will always be made on this basis.  On that basis it is necessary for me to say that at no time in the past have we made our appointments purely upon political grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Another matter which requires the careful attention of the Minister is the increase in embezzlement and pilfering which arises chiefly from gambling, and more especially from gambling on dogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Some tragic cases have occurred in the Post Office.  But I think the Minister's own detective force will tell him that the present extraordinarily high percentage in these crimes is due to the craze for gambling on the dogs.  I do not say that one should take restrictive measures against dog racing.  In its own way it is a good sport, but it is also true that it has led to considerable abuses.  The way in which these abuses can be dealt with is a matter for consideration by the Department of Justice.  How can one control the appetite which it develops? Men have told me that when they become obsessed with the passion for gambling they eat, drink, sleep and dream dogs.  It so obsesses them that they can think of nothing else.  The State must take cognisance of abuses of that kind and the State should be able to find some remedy to restrain such abuses.  They are spoiling a good sport.  One hears a good deal about the racketeering that goes on at dog racing tracks.  That in its turn is likely to spoil the export trade of dogs from this country.  It is the breeders and the owners who suffer most from these abuses.  Strict rules are in force in reference to horse racing and the turf generally.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Department of Justice to find some way, either by administrative regulation or legislation, to remedy these evils.  It is a very important matter and I hope that the Minister will give it his careful attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Justice on the introduction of his Estimate.  As an old comrade of his I am very pleased to see him in the position of Minister for Justice in this Government.  I sincerely hope that we will be able to discuss this Estimate without any advertence to petty or <Col N="1556" /> Party politics.  At the beginning, I might say that the Minister has shocked me a little by his reference to the change of system with regard to the provision of a motor car for the Taoiseach.  When the Vote on Account was being considered, I mentioned that I hoped the system that applied to the late Taoiseach, of paying him an allowance in respect of a motor car, should be extended to the other Ministers.  I find now that instead of that it has been decided to discontinue the allowance to the Taoiseach and to make available to him a car in the same way as to the other Ministers.  I think that is a grave mistake and I am very sorry that it has happened.  One of the things we should try to do is to reduce expenses and it would be an acceptable earnest of our intention to reduce expenses if the practice of providing each Minister with an allowance instead of a motor car was carried out. That is the only matter on which I have to criticise the Minister's Estimate.</P>
      <P>I should like, before dealing with the Garda in a general way, to say that after many years' experience of the Garda&mdash;experience of them in the ordinary way as a citizen, experience of them as an Army officer who came in contact with them very frequently, and as a solicitor practising in the Dublin courts for a number of years&mdash;the standard of efficiency and the standard of conduct of our Garda is very high indeed, and that we as a Parliament ought to be proud that we have such a high standard of efficiency and conduct in our Garda force.  We know that Gardaí are not overpaid; in fact, in my view, they are underpaid.  I believe their opportunities for promotion are unduly limited.  Notwithstanding the fact that many of them have very heavy responsibilities, it is a splendid thing to be able to pay tribute to their high standard of integrity and conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have felt, over a number of years, that the grievances of the Gardaí&mdash;and those grievances are many; personal grievances, in a way&mdash;are not being handled in the way in which they ought to be.  I think the disciplinary code of the Gardaí is too rigid and almost inhuman.  I feel that the disciplinary code does not guarantee to <Col N="1557" /> the individual member of the Gardaí ordinary justice, and I will take this opportunity of appealing to the Minister to set up a new code which will guarantee justice to individual Gardaí. I cannot follow, from any legal principle, on what the Garda disciplinary code is based.  I think the regulations were made by the Minister for Justice in 1926 or 1927 under the Police Forces Amalgamation Act and those regulations which, under that Act, are supposed to be issued with the approval of the Government&mdash;and I must take it they were issued at that time with the approval of the Government&mdash;are unique in that they set up a number of extraordinary offences.</P>
    <P>The main provision for the hearing of charges, in the ultimate analysis, is by means of a form of sworn inquiry. One would imagine that where a charge is preferred against an individual&mdash;in this case a Garda&mdash;and where that Garda denies the charge, there would be some hearing at which he would be entitled to be present, to which he would be entitled to bring his witnesses and at which he could cross-examine the witnesses against him.  So far as I can gather from the peculiar provisions of the disciplinary code, charges may be made against a Garda and he may deny them in writing, and that file containing the charges and denials in writing is referred to the Commissioner.  In a week, a fortnight or a month the Garda may find that the Commissioner has found him guilty of some offence.  I say that is contrary to all principles of justice and I know that it is only necessary to bring that matter before the Minister to have it examined so that it will be put right.</P>
    <P>I had before me recently a case of a Garda who was discharged for disobedience of orders, neglect of duty and insubordinate or oppressive conduct. The matter was rather trivial, I must say, but the charges sounded very serious&mdash;disobedience of orders, neglect of duty and insubordinate and oppressive conduct.  The matters that gave rise to those charges were dealt with summarily. The Garda was transferred from the position he occupied.  A penalty of approximately 10/- a week, loss of pay, was imposed on him while <Col N="1558" /> the charges were under investigation. The Garda denied the charges in writing and the decision of the Commissioner was: &ldquo;No decision is entered in regard to charges 1 and 2; he is found guilty on charge No. 3, and he is cautioned.&rdquo;  That was the decision of the Commissioner.  In the meantime, while this was going on, the Garda was transferred from his station and penalised to the extent of 10/- a week. I say to the House that as far as the Minister is concerned, he would be anxious that that form of discipline would be changed.</P>
    <P>I have often heard that a Garda is expected to bring a certain number of charges against members of the general public in a period of a month, a year, or some period of that kind.  I have often heard that and I have often denied it, and I am quite sure there is no member of the House, including the Minister, who could believe that a Garda would be guilty of any offence by not bringing charges against members of the general public over a period.  I am glad to see the Minister shaking his head and saying he would not believe it.  I am just going to read a charge&mdash;and I want the House to listen very carefully to it&mdash;preferred recently against a member of the force.  &ldquo;Neglect of duty&rdquo;&mdash;that is a standing sort of charge in the Garda&mdash;&ldquo;that is to say that you evinced continued apathy, neglect, indifference or inefficiency in attending or discharging the duties of your rank, in that during the period from the 1st January, 1947, to the 31st December, 1947, whilst engaged mainly as a sergeant on outdoor duty in the district&rdquo;&mdash;I shall not mention the district&mdash;&ldquo;you failed to take proceedings against any person either by arrest or summons for breach of the law.&rdquo;  Could anyone in this House believe that is possible?  I ask would any Deputy believe that it is possible for a member of the force to be charged in that way?</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to listen to this.  There was a second charge against him in which the wording was exactly the same except that the period was longer&mdash;from the 1st January, 1946, to the 30th April, 1948. What is that except charging a Garda because he did not bring a charge against anybody in a period of a year in one case and in a period of two years in the other?  I am only availing of this opportunity to bring that before the House and before the Minister in support of my contention and of the case I am making here that the disciplinary code, in so far as it applies to the Gardaí, is antiquated, out of date, and needs absolute revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the misfortune on a few occasions to represent Gardaí at these things that are known as sworn inquiries. They are a sort of bad cross between a military court of inquiry and a military court martial.  What happens there?  The Garda is charged with an offence and the charge comes down to him.  He writes &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; or denies the charge and it goes up to the Commissioner who directs a sworn inquiry. The Commissioner appoints two Garda officers to hold that inquiry and a Garda officer to prosecute.  The Garda who is being charged, if he makes application for permission to the Commissioner to employ legal aid, may have a solicitor or counsel to defend him but he has not that as of right. He must apply for permission.  He receives the documents which contain a summary of the evidence against him but, under this very peculiar code, he is not supplied with a copy of the charge against him.  That I submit is wrong.  He is not supplied with a copy of the charge although he is supplied with a short summary of the evidence.  The Garda code does not allow him to receive a copy of the charge and it is only when his defending solicitor reaches the court and hears the charges read out that he is in a position to know what the charges are.  The Garda may recollect from the time he received the written charges originally that those are the charges against him but the actual charges are not in his possession at any time except at an early <Col N="1560" /> preliminary stage and until they are read out at the court.</P>
    <P>The code provides that evidence must be taken down in longhand and that there must not be any interlineations or alterations of the evidence as recorded. They have adopted a system now of providing a typist to take the evidence and this sworn inquiry carries on in leisurely fashion over days and perhaps over weeks.  When I said I had the misfortune to appear at a few of them, I was saying what was perfectly correct because the procedure is, if I am cross-examining a witness, that I ask a question and the typist proceeds to type the question.  When the typist has typed the question, the witness answers and that is typed also and the result is that an ordinary investigation which should take only a day lasts for five or six days.  There is no hope in the world of ever catching out a witness by quick or clever cross-examination because he has all the time in the world from the time the question is put until it is typed to think of an answer. However, I am not concerned with that aspect of the matter.  The aspect with which I am concerned is that the unfortunate Garda has to pay for his defence and he has to pay six times the amount he would have to pay if the inquiry were held under any modern system that is known.  I ask the Minister to avail of the earliest opportunity to change the whole system of investigation, of charges against Gardaí.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he could very easily adopt here in Dublin City, in the metropolitan area, the system of the orderly room, where, on one day in the week, the assistant commissioner who is responsible for the area would have before him all Gardaí who are charged with breaches of discipline. He would be able to see them and would be able to make up his mind as to whether they were telling lies or telling the truth.  The system would be speedy and it would be just, in the long run.  At the moment, the Commissioner has to decide whether he approves or not of findings on written evidence, which can show him nothing as to the demeanour of a witness before the court, as to whether it is patently obvious that he is telling lies or not. <Col N="1561" /> He must decide on a written record. Only within the last few days, I was at one of these sworn inquiries.  The matter has not got to the point of reaching the Commissioner and being decided, and consequently I do not propose to refer to it on this Estimate&mdash;I may have to refer to it on the Estimate next year&mdash;but I ask the Minister to make sure that he will have an opportunity of examining the record of that sworn inquiry.  I think I have dealt sufficiently with that aspect of the matter.  I think it is important and I think it is necessary that the matter should be investigated.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Army Estimate, I made a recommendation to the Minister for Defence, in which I was supported by Deputy Vivion de Valera, with regard to courts martial, and I heard to-day that the recommendations we made to the Minister have been accepted, which, I think, is a good thing.  I sincerely hope that what I am now recommending to the Minister with regard to discipline in the Garda will receive the same sympathetic consideration as our recommendations to the Minister for Defence in regard to courts martial of soldiers.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Garda are men of efficiency, of integrity, and, in the great majority of cases, of honour.  To a large extent, the administration of the State depends on the Garda.  If the Garda are a good, reliable force, it will have a good reaction, but if the Garda are not a good force, it will react against the public good, and I say to the Minister that the Garda are entitled to reasonable conditions.  Some of the barracks throughout the country in which they are compelled to live are a disgrace.  The quarters in which the Garda are compelled to live in Dublin Castle are an absolute disgrace. I ask the Minister to carry out a personal investigation of the sleeping quarters of the Garda in Dublin Castle. I think he will be shocked by the conditions he will find there.  We want a good police force and we are proud of a good police force.  Let us make the conditions under which the Garda live and work as up-to-date and as decent as we can make them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> That brings me to the matter of promotions. One sees here in Dublin Gardaí of the greatest efficiency kept on the one class of work for 25 or 30 years.  They are never promoted because they are efficient in that particular job.  We have quite a number of men on point duty, some of whom are the finest point duty men in Europe.  We also have detective officers whose capability and efficiency are well known to those of us who have experience of the District Courts in Dublin.  These men are in their jobs for 20, 25, and more, years without promotion.  I say that is unfair.  There should be an opening for the capable and efficient man after a certain number of years' service and the Garda establishments should be amended from time to time to provide for these promotions.</P>
    <P>One other matter which I should like to mention is the matter of activities of the special branch of the Garda.  I want to mention this only in a very incidental way.  The special branch of the Garda was formed for, and used mainly in, the investigation of political matters, and, over a period of years, there was a serious conflict between the citizens and that branch of the Garda.  I had hoped that, with the change of Government and the installing of a Minister who had shown a completely new outlook by his decision to release all the political prisoners from Portlaoighise prison, there would be a change, but when the Easter Week commemoration ceremonies were on, when the Bodenstown ceremonies were on last Sunday, when a train was taking a big body of Dublin citizens to Belfast for the Seán McCaughey commemorations, a notable feature in connection with all these events was the presence of a very large body of the special branch of the Garda.  I am quite sure that that attendance has been what you might call a carry on in the system and it was not done on the direct instructions of the Minister, although the Minister must bear the responsibility because he is Minister.  I only mention the matter to make a recommendation to the Minister.  A great deal has been done to end what I might term the political <Col N="1563" /> bitterness in the country; a great deal has been done towards that aim by the setting up of this inter-Party Government, and it would be a great pity if any new conflict were to develop between the special branch of the Garda and our citizens.  I would say to the Minister, unless the necessity for it does arise, if it ever arises&mdash;I hope it will never arise and I believe it will never arise&mdash;he should make a special Order that when these national commemorations are taking place the special branch of the Garda should not be permitted to go near the place.  In that way he will help to break down a number of the things which have caused bitterness over a number of years.  I am satisfied that the Minister will look at it in the same way as I do, and being the man he is, with a big, broad, human outlook, I am sure that he will accede to the recommendations I make to him in that connection now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little praised the Minister for the improvements he has made in the prison services and for the improved conditions he has got for ordinary prisoners.  I am sure I support all improvements of the conditions of prisoners in our prisons and our jails, but one thing I would say to the Minister is that there must be an improvement in the conditions of prison warders.  Take the warders here in Mountjoy.  The quarters in which they live were built in 1868 and they have never been improved since that.  They are decorated every seven years.  I understand that there are 60 cottages in which 300 members of the staff and their families, the majority of which are young children, live, and only in one of these houses is there a bathroom.  In only one house of 60 is there a bath, and that bath happens to be there because a deputy governor happened to be provided with one of those houses a couple of years ago, but there is no bath in the other 59 houses. A warder can be fined or otherwise punished for not giving a prisoner a bath every week, but he has no place to bath his own children or himself.</P>

      <P>They would be safer there.  These houses would have been condemned years ago by the local authority but for the fact that they are outside the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation. The prison staff must search the clothes of prisoners often suffering from unspeakable diseases, but they have no opportunity of washing their hands as only one wash-basin is provided in the prison, apparently, and officers cannot leave their posts to go to this wash-basin.  Their hours of duty are long and I have here a record of the hours done by one particular warder in a week; it is 68 hours.</P>
      <P>They have no regular hours and they do not know whether they are on in the morning, in the afternoon or in the night.  They are under the most rigid discipline and must be available whenever they are required.  These warders are very anxious that they should have something in the nature of the Garda Representative Body to look after their interests and I would ask the Minister to take up this aspect with the warders, the members of the prison services, so that improved conditions in housing, improved conditions with regard to hours of duty and improved pay may be made available to them.  I have plenty of material in regard to that matter of hours of duty and pay, but I would leave it entirely to the Minister on the suggestion I make that he should set up in consultation with the members of the prison services a representative body that would advise him and advise the Department on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While dealing with hours of duty, I should mention the hours of duty that apply to members of the Gardaí on duty here in Dublin City.  At an earlier stage I mentioned the Garda code and the Garda code contains very specifically the hours of duty in Dublin area. Those hours were fixed at the time they were included in the Garda code in consultation with the Gardaí in the different barracks in Dublin and that system of hours which is acceptable to the Gardaí was carried on for a period of 20 years.  Recently the Assistant Commissioner, General Murphy, changed those hours.  Complaints were <Col N="1565" /> made in this House and to the Minister regarding that change.  Let me say that I do not know whether those changes in hours were properly made, because under the provisions of the Garda code they could only be made by the Commissioner himself and any alterations in them could only be made as amendments to the code.  Whether that correct procedure was carried out or not I am not in a position to say.  At a recent inquiry I tried to get the regulations which were made, but all I could get was a stencilled copy of the instructions that had been issued by the Assistant Commissioner, General Murphy.  If there was nothing beyond General Murphy's instructions that change in hours is not a regulation at all and any Guard who breaks the rules cannot be found guilty by any tribunal or court, but I was not able to find that out at the sworn inquiry and it may be that the regulations were validly made. Under the old hours a man was entitled to have meals at regular times. As a result of representations which were made to the Minister a change has been made, but it did not go right back to the old and acceptable hours. Now we have this sort of hours for a Guard in Dublin: from 7.30 p.m. to 3.30 a.m., with 45 minutes off for a meal to be cooked and prepared by himself. He gets that at 12 midnight until 12.45.  He goes on duty at 7.30 and comes off at 3.30 in the morning, when he goes to bed, and he has to have the whole three meals of the day packed into the few hours from the time he gets out of bed before he goes on duty. One night he starts at 7.30 p.m. and goes off at 3.30 a.m.  The next night he goes on at 11 p.m. and comes off at 7 a.m.  He goes to bed at 7.45 a.m. and then he takes up duty at 7.30 p.m., and he has his three meals in the space of a couple of hours.  The day duty is from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and he gets home to dinner at 3.30.  The next day he goes on from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., with a meal whenever he can get it.</P>
    <P>The result of that arrangement is that a Garda has to have meal hours of his own and his family have to have meal hours of their own.  The whole arrangements of these men are being completely upset.  Arrangements which <Col N="1566" /> were good enough for 20 years and which could have been carried on without any upset to a Garda or his family in my respectful submission should have been continued and should not have been changed without the consent and approval of the Gardaí.  I am informed that every member of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin metropolitan area, both married and single, is opposed to these hours of duty.  The Gardaí are not paid very generously and that is a very severe handicap on a Garda.  It means extra expenditure as he has to have his meals at a different hour from the hour at which his family have their meals in the ordinary way.  I ask the Minister to look into that particular matter with a view to restoring the hours agreed upon between the Commissioner and the Gardaí over 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Gardaí have grievances.  All forces that are run under a disciplinary code have grievances.  The method by which a complaint is made to a superior officer and is sent right up along the line to the Commissioner is not the best way of dealing with these grievances.  I have come across cases and other Deputies have come across cases where for a sort of half disciplinary reason a Garda is transferred maybe 50 miles or 100 miles away.  He may be transferred in the last two years of his service.  He may have built up a home and his children may have been attending a good school. Then he may be transferred in the last couple of years of service to some place where there is no school or no opportunity for him to have his children educated.  There may be no house for him in that place.  The result is that he has to leave his wife and family in one place and go to live in the other station many miles away.  Many of these transfers have come to my notice over a period of years.  They have all been imposed from the point of view of discipline, as a sort of punishment.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that there ought to be set up some type of independent tribunal invested with full powers to inquire into what I may call personal or semi-personal grievances of the Gardaí.  If that were done, I am quite sure that a lot of this discontent <Col N="1567" /> that upsets Gardaí would be removed. From the point of view of the efficiency of the force it does not matter very much whether Sergeant A is in Ballydehob or in Ballinamuck.  It makes no difference to the efficiency of the force, if the sergeant is competent, whether he is stationed in one place or in the other.  I, therefore, strongly recommend that an independent tribunal invested with full powers to inquire into and remedy the grievances and complaints of individual members of the Garda Síochána should be set up.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters with which I should like to deal, but many of them would involve legislation, and I am not permitted to mention them in this debate.  I ask the Minister, however, to take serious note of the recommendations I have made.  I will conclude on the same note as I began. I welcome his appointment as Minister for Justice and I sincerely hope that when this present Dáil has run its course the grievances to which I have referred will have been remedied by the present Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>I take it that what really Deputy Cowan has been suggesting is arbitration for the Garda.  That is a matter that perhaps the Minister could consider.  I would be more concerned, however, for the purposes of this debate, with two things: one is the fact that the strength of our Garda force does not appear to be adequate for our requirements.  The second, which is tied up with that, is that the present conditions, particularly in the city, are imposing a pretty severe strain on the force and that the question of their morale is something to which the House might pay attention. That morale would depend very largely (1) on their strength and conditions of service; on the position in which they are placed to do their job; (2) on the extent to which that force is backed by the Government.  That force is the executive arm of the Government in preserving law and order.  Its efficiency and effectiveness and the ultimate fate and future of law and order will depend on the support the Garda get from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> There are few other Votes on which a question so touching the whole root of social order in the State comes up. For that reason, the part of the Vote apportioned to the Garda is one of great importance.  I should like to deal with the two aspects of that which I mentioned.  Firstly, our responsibility to the country in seeing that the force provided for the maintenance of order is adequate to that task.  Secondly, the question of factors affecting their morale, and particularly the factor of the support which that force will get from the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, one thing strikes one: The strength of the Garda is inadequate.  I think the last Government was coming to realise that after the war.  It was apparent during the war that extra police duties had been thrown on to the Garda but, as long as the Army was there, under the emergency conditions, discharging certain security functions, the full effect of this extra load on the Garda was not felt.  Now, however, the Garda must carry the whole burden.  What burden have they to face in addition to the burden prior to the war? Generally, and at large, a number of administrative details have been passed on to the force imperceptibly.  When some Government Order or some new Act has to be enforced, a provision would creep in by which certain forms would be filled at the local Garda station or certain particulars would be collected by the local Garda and forwarded to a central headquarters. Imperceptibly these things multiplied and, as they multiplied, the burden on the officers of the force became greater, with the result that in country districts particularly the Garda had little time for ordinary police duties in many cases by the time they had discharged many of these duties which in former years were not considered proper duties for police officers and which, in any event, did not arise.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that you had in the City of Dublin&mdash;and I presume in other towns&mdash;a certain police problem developing.  The main civil police problem developing in Dublin is the traffic problem.  In order to keep <Col N="1569" /> traffic in Dublin in a fairly workable order, a large number of Garda are required.  Take the parking of cars alone.  In order to try to enforce the parking laws a considerable number of men are employed in checking on cars. The bottlenecks in the city still require personal traffic control by Gardaí. There are certain spots that do not seem suitable for automatic control, and, in any event, the necessary apparatus is not immediately available. Be that as it may, because of the traffic problem in Dublin and because of the fact that the parking regulations require greater attention from the Guards than they did formerly, the burden on the Guards has increased.</P>
    <P>In regard to crime, I am not going to suggest, as was suggested on other occasions in this House, that we are abnormally bad in respect of crime in this country or anything else, but it is undeniable that there are certain types of crime to eradicate which attention and careful organisation is needed. There have been certain series of house-breakings.  There have been offences against order, such as brawling&mdash;at least I get the impression from the newspapers&mdash;slightly more frequently than formerly.  Arising out of this house-breaking epidemic, larcenies, and so forth, there seems to be a suggestion that the people concerned in these activities are showing a degree of organisation not previously found. If that is so, it is obvious that it is going to require a greater degree of organisation and planning on the part of the Guards to meet them.  That, in turn, will entail a greater demand on personnel.  It is also rather disquieting to find, on reading the evening papers of the last week, that there have been prosecutions of people for the possession of firearms and that these prosecutions arose from Garda inquiries into ordinary crime, and that there have been times in the last year when, it seems, firearms were associated with ordinary crime&mdash;a thing that was almost unknown in this country&mdash;and that we may now expect firearms to be associated with the ordinary criminal, in certain respects at any rate.</P>
    <P>These are all circumstances which necessitate co-ordinated police action, <Col N="1570" /> and the availability at every and any particular time of a force adequate to meet such a threat.  If the Guards are then to bear in addition to that, their civil duties, statutory duties and traffic control and so forth, I am afraid we will be forced to the conclusion that the strength of the Garda in the country as a whole is, to say the least of it, not sufficient.  How far any adjustment can be made in that, I do not know.  I see, for instance, that you could offset an increase in the strength if you took off the Garda some of the duties that have been unloaded on to them, such as the interminable filling up of forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, Deputy. I am granting you that.  I am taking facts as they stand at the moment.  If the facts as they stand at the moment are to continue, then I feel, and I think many other Deputies feel, that the strength of the force is inadequate.  On the other hand, if certain duties which are not police duties properly so called and even certain quasi-police duties, are withdrawn from the force and charged elsewhere, I admit that that is another way, and I would go so far as to agree with Deputy Collins that it might perhaps be the preferable way of dealing with it.  Be that as it may, as the facts stand, the Garda are a taxed force.  I can talk with some knowledge of the City of Dublin, and I say it is because of the inadequacy of their strength in Dublin that the change in the hours of duty has imposed the serious burden on them that has been already referred to in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In maintaining the efficiency of the police force, I would, in a nutshell, recommend to the Minister considering the whole problem from the point of view of the strength that is required to keep the Garda at an efficient level because, with the best men in the world, they cannot achieve that efficiency if there are not enough of them to do it.  Secondly, in connection with this problem, I would couple two things, namely, the question of the extra duties imposed on them and the question of hours of duty.  These are <Col N="1571" /> really all aspects of administration. These details should be so co-ordinated as to give the maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, as has already been suggested to him, the Minister might cause this question of hours of duty to be considered again and also the question of the additional tasks that have been put on the Garda with a view to trying to minimise the burden so that you will get the maximum efficiency for the duties which are charged to that force.</P>
    <P>I come to the question of morale. It is hardly necessary to say that practically the whole social order depends on the morale of that force and that morale will depend on, firstly, the conditions under which the force itself operates.  They have got to be given the chance of being efficient and of having a high morale.  Secondly, it will depend on the support which they get from the Executive.  Adequate provision must be made for the force under both of these heads or the morale of the force will suffer, and if it suffers public order suffers and the whole social fabric of the State is threatened. In regard to conditions, there is obviously a case for that section of the community, apart from the general case to be made for others, of trying to give them the best living conditions possible.  In other words, a Garda is an important member of the community. He is in a position of public trust and should, therefore, be able to live in a way befitting the nature of the trust reposed in him.</P>
    <P>The Guards did get some increases last year.  The present Minister for Finance criticised the increases severely in last year's debates and intimated that they were not sufficient at all.  I am not going to go into the merits of the figures at this moment beyond pointing out that there is a case for paying a police force adequately and of saying that that should be done, and that, in addition, proper facilities in regard to houses, for children's education and so forth should be afforded to the officers of the force.  In that connection, I think that the increases given last year by the last Government amounted to £350,000.  It was not as <Col N="1572" /> much as many people would like to see given, and the present Minister for Finance in particular criticised the situation very severely and suggested, by implication at any rate, that much more should be done.  I would like to suggest some ways which might perhaps help.  One is to try to accommodate those officers with special regard to their family situation in posting them. In other words, if a Garda is a happy, contented man himself, he will be an efficient and reliable officer.  There are a number of these officers who, because of restrictions in establishment, cannot easily get promotion.  Many of them are men who have served from perhaps the inception of the force and are receiving pensions for the services which they rendered to this country in other days.  Now, these officers.  I understand, in spite of the 1945 Act, still suffer certain abatements of their pensions.  In any event, abatements were made in the past.  If the Minister wants to do something to help the morale of the force I suggest that he should take up this question in the case of those men who may not be able to get promotion and thus have their long service to the country recognised in that way.  The Minister, I think, ought to give them some recognition by looking into the question of the abatement of the pensions which they have in so far as that has not been remedied by the 1945 Act.  Now, of course, there will not be openings for promotion if the force is allowed to dwindle and if the establishment falls, so that if the point made by Deputy Cowan were to be considered, a <i>sine qua non</i> for that would be, I imagine, the maintenance of the establishment.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the morale of the force, maintained under two successive Governments and now under a third, has been excellent.  The members of it have given very efficient service. I think it is not unfitting to recall some things at this stage.  The morale of that force has been high.  During the war years few people in the City of Dublin, or in the country as a whole, realised what they owed to the Gardaí in conjunction with the Army.  We are now dealing with the Gardaí and their part I say was conspicuous.  During the years of the emergency, the <Col N="1573" /> ordinary citizen went his way, and even though he knew there was a war in Europe and saw his own troops around the thing did not touch him, but in that strained atmosphere the ordinary system of law and order went on, and the silent work of the Gardaí was responsible for that.  If we got through the war years in peace and with no social upheaval here it was largely due to the devotion of that force.  The years have passed and we are apt to forget things, but few people realise, because of the efficiency of that force, what they were spared, and I am afraid that we are inclined to forget now the sacrifices that were made by that force. We forget, for instance, the detective officer who fell riddled with Thompson-gun bullets in Rathfarnham; we forget another officer who was murdered near his own home during that time.  I am glad to say that that tradition has followed the Gardaí, and that we still have officers who can unarmed face guns in the hands of a criminal.  There were two officers of the force decorated recently for bravery of that nature.</P>
    <P>Now, the morale of that force must be maintained.  The ordinary citizen hardly knows what is owing to it and how much is owing to it, and we should all, irrespective of where we sit in this House, be solicitous for the well-being of the force.  I have no apologies to make in pleading for exceptional treatment for that force, seeing the part that it played in maintaining the social fabric of the State, and seeing the way they have discharged their duty&mdash;the fidelity and devotion with which they discharge their duties.  For that reason, I think I can join with other Deputies in pressing on the Minister if it is necessary&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is necessary but I simply add my voice to theirs&mdash;to consider the problems relating to the Gardaí in a sympathetic manner, and to realise that he is dealing with a loyal and a tried force, a force with a high morale.  I think the country will be only too glad to furnish the necessaries for maintaining the force at the standard which is required.  The Minister need not hesitate in adjusting conditions which will improve the <Col N="1574" /> lot of the Gardaí or tend to improve their efficiency.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which arise on this Vote, of course.  People are getting perturbed about the incidence of road accidents of a certain sort.  I made a promise on the Local Government Vote to raise this matter with the Minister.  One is always in the awkward predicament in this House that, in referring to the type of offence to which I wish to refer now, one can hardly ever get a time when a charge of this nature is not pending and when a Deputy has got to be careful so as not to prejudice such a proceeding. Notwithstanding all that, I am talking perfectly generally now and without any reference whatever to any particular case.  It is desirable that some comment should be made on the question of competency in driving motor cars.  When I say competency, I mean both a permanent physical capacity to do so and a temporary physical capacity to do so.  Some steps will have to be taken in the interests of the public, of the ordinary man in the street and of the ordinary driver, to see that nobody drives a mechanically-propelled vehicle who, whether by an act of his own in consuming certain liquor or otherwise, or from any other cause, is incapable of driving that car with the degree of skill which modern conditions require. No person should be tolerated driving a vehicle on the road unless he is able to afford that degree of skill.  I am afraid that the position will have to be faced where, if a person puts himself in danger of diminishing his capacity to drive below that minimum of skill required and then attempts to drive a motor car, he will have to be very severely treated indeed, and all other considerations will just have to be put out of the case.</P>
    <P>Too many people have been killed on the roads.  Too many people have been maimed.  If a person is free but if he, by some act of his own, diminishes his capacity for driving and then drives, he will have to answer for it.  I am afraid we shall have to face up to that situation.  All sentiment and such like apart, there is only one remedy for it, and that is a severe sentence of imprisonment. Fines are not sufficient.  In <Col N="1575" /> fact, unless there is a direction under the present system, the position may easily be that a driver of a commercial vehicle who has been guilty of such an offence when convicted and unable to pay the fine is sent to jail, while, on the other hand, somebody who is relatively opulent and who is coming from some place of amusement, when convicted, is given a big fine.  It is a big fine, but it is only a fine.  He pays it and that is that.  Of the two hypothetical cases which I have given, surely there is a greater case for leniency in the case of a man who is earning his bread and butter, not so much for his own sake as for the people depending on him.  In the other case there is no excuse.  But at least some mitigating circumstances can be pleaded in regard to the man who is sent to jail.  The other gentleman only pays money.  The time is approaching when some very definite action will have to be taken in such offences and when a severe sentence of imprisonment will be the only remedy.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point.  I want again to mention that I am talking generally with regard to these crimes and I am talking with great reserve because of the danger that anybody might think I was referring to anything specific.  The point I want to make is that it became the habit some time ago&mdash;I do not know under which Attorney-General it happened&mdash;automatically to prosecute for manslaughter where a death had resulted in a road accident.  I think that was a mistake in policy.  If one looks at the record of what has happened in these prosecutions it will be seen that invariably, generally anyway, such a prosecution has resulted in a dismissal and a prosecution for dangerous driving or anything like that afterwards has brought very little in the line of punishment. I am thinking in particular of a case which was decided so many years ago that it would be difficult for anybody who might even remember it to associate my speech in this House this evening with it in which a man was prosecuted for manslaughter.  A jury, who would perhaps have convicted him of another crime, hesitated to convict him of manslaughter and he was <Col N="1576" /> allowed to go.  In the District Court, on a lesser charge, the district justice, rightly feeling that to do otherwise would be to usurp the functions of a jury, strictly limits the penalty to the legal level of the charge with which he has to deal, the net result being that in a very bad case a man gets off very lightly.  I remember reading that at a time when I saw in the same newspaper that, for a relatively minor offence&mdash;I mean relatively, when compared with the one I have just mentioned&mdash;a taximan was deprived of his licence and so lost his livelihood.</P>
    <P>These inequities and these discrepancies in our prison law can only be met by abolishing this question of manslaughter, unless you can establish the facts that would normally lead to manslaughter in other cases&mdash;some extra grave feature which makes you bring it as a manslaughter charge as distinct from a motoring offence.  A special provision should be made for dealing with these cases.  After all, why judge the offence from the public point of view just by the fact whether the person was killed or not?  Our attention is naturally drawn to the seriousness of the case if a death results, but when all is said and done the serious angle of that offence has happened before, in that the person who was responsible has firstly made himself incapable of driving and, secondly, has been driving improperly.  That is the real offence and that is what we have to deal with in a different way.  Some people would be lucky enough to escape death in an accident caused by such a person while others would be killed. It is a mistake, however, to judge it merely on the question of death.  In either case the criminal driver is equally guilty whether he has been fortunate enough to escape actually killing his victim or whether the accident has had a fatal result.  The crime is the same.  The danger to the community is equally great.  I do not think a differentiation should be made just on the actual consequences of that particular case.  Realising as I do the difficulties he is up against in this matter and the difficulties of framing such a thing, and realising that the <Col N="1577" /> ultimate sanction of law depends ultimately on public opinion, I cannot, in conscience, ask the Minister to do the impossible, but I can ask him to have the problem considered.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, now that the motor car has come back on the road, when we have reason to fear that such crime is on the increase, the practice of levying manslaughter charges neither covers the case nor is effective. The ultimate sanction rests with public opinion.  We have to make people realise the criminal nature of the act of any person who, by his own act, renders himself incapable of driving a car or&mdash;equally dangerous&mdash;the person who, by his own act, puts himself in a position where he might be likely to lose his skill in driving a car.  Such a person taking over control of a motor car is nothing short of a criminal.  He is in the same category as a man who would wantonly discharge a gun up a frequented highway without caring to look whether people were there or not. Certain measures must be taken sometimes for the public good and in the case of this public evil strong measures will have to be taken to remedy it. At any rate, the problem could be examined, particularly as regards the practice of prosecuting on the basis of manslaughter when some other method might be more adequate to bring a better penalty.  That penalty, in any event, should be imprisonment, if the charge is proved.</P>
    <P>There is a question that the Minister suggested to me when he was opening. He said it was a consolation for the taxpayer that if he expanded the Land Registry the fees would compensate for the expansion.  It has been a cause of considerable complaint in recent years that the fees in the Land Registry have been excessive.  Last year on this Vote, when I was sitting on the far side of the House, certain representations were made by me about the costs in this regard.  Many of us have pointed out from time to time that the difficulty for the ordinary citizen, especially the poorer man, in having his legal rights asserted or determined is often the question of cost and that a large proportion of these costs to him comes from administrative charges, such as <Col N="1578" /> Land Registry and court fees.  Many of these are necessaries, in the sense that they occur on the devolution of title on a death and must be considered necessary in the succession of lives; and to that extent they are part of the costs of certain living people.  These, together with the charges for conveyancing and stamp duties, are often a burden on the poorer man.  They often occur where there are no great charges from professional men&mdash;legal charges in the way that some people think of them, such as those of the country solicitor.  If the Minister is considering the Land Registry, as he obviously intends to do in connection with the old chestnut of delays, perhaps he would deal with the question of fees and see if they could be adjusted in the case of poorer categories where small holdings are concerned.  That should be done, if they have not been adjusted already; and I must confess that my information is not exactly very recent in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin City, the traffic problem, as well as other factors, has resulted in parts of the city being relatively poorly policed.  It is not the fault of the Gardaí, as there is not sufficient of them there.  Many citizens feel that they have not the security which they had years ago.  There are many areas of the city where years ago the policeman on his beat was a familiar sight and where nowadays a Guard is rarely seen.  That gets back to the old problem of supplying a force of sufficient strength in Dublin.  Having made my general plea, I would ask the Minister to consider also the specific police problem in the city and to remember that things have changed for the Gardaí as well as for other people in modern times.  The single man on the beat, except as an observation patrol, is hardly likely to be effective in dealing with the criminal as we find him developing to-day.  He must be reinforced by something else&mdash;perhaps the combination of the detective and the uniformed man, for general patrol work of that nature, is the best we can do.  The patrol car has only a limited application.  I noticed in an English paper recently where certain people there were agitating to get their men <Col N="1579" /> back on the beats, and the phrase was used that &ldquo;the patrol cars charging around everywhere are not able to deal with crime.&rdquo;  The solution obviously is a combination of the two.  You need the patrol car and also the man on the beat, but the latter is not much use unless reinforced, preferably by a detective suitably equipped.</P>
    <P>If we were able adequately to police the city, the incidence of some of the smaller crimes&mdash;such as housebreaking, larceny and so forth&mdash;might be reduced. We know that our Guards can be very efficient.  If we look back upon the bicycle stealing during the emergency we must realise the efficiency with which the Guards handled that problem and solved it as an earnest of what they can do if given a chance.  As I have said so many times already, they require not only the requisites for being efficient, but the requisites essential to the building up of a good morale and, above all, the essential requisite of the confidence and support of the central executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long but there are one or two suggestions I would like to make to the Minister.  Like Deputy de Valera, I have a good deal of sympathy with the Gardaí in the position in which they find themselves at present. I do not think the solution to their problems lies in an increase in the actual force itself.  I think the best line the Minister could take is to restrict as much as possible the duties of the Gardaí to what are really Garda duties.  In other words, their duties should be restricted to the maintenance of law and order in so far as the criminal code is concerned rather than that they should be made servers of notices of all descriptions or the distributing point of forms for completion. That is a practice which has grown up during the emergency.  The emergency has now gone and the time has come when the Minister should tell those of his colleagues in the Cabinet, who are responsible for placing these duties upon our Gardaí, that they must find some other means of having that work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> Deputy Cowan outlined very specifically the difficulties under which the Gardaí operate at the present time, particularly in regard to beats and meal times.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the possibility of supplying mobile canteens in the City of Dublin so that at certain points at certain times hot coffee and sandwiches would be available for Gardaí on night duty or for men who might find themselves unable to get a meal or unable to obtain one at a price within their normal budget.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the difficulties under which the Gardaí work at the present time in regard to the traffic and parking problem in Dublin. I would earnestly urge upon the Minister that he should consider the parking problem as one outside the scope of normal Garda duty.  Perhaps in that connection he would examine the system that has been adopted in Australia.  There they have a force under the control of the police but delegated to one specific task.  That task is the policing of car parks.  This force does not require the same degree of competence, general knowledge or specific police knowledge necessary in the police force proper.  As parking is mainly a city problem, I think the Minister could usefully take up with the local authority in the bigger metropolitan areas the possibility of establishing some kind of parking police.  In that way the Gardaí would be relieved of the onus of wandering from street to street taking the times and numbers of cars, and wandering back again after a certain period to see if the permitted time has been exceeded.  If such a force could be established, more of the trained personnel would be available for normal Garda duties.</P>
    <P>With other Deputies in the House I would like to pay tribute to our Garda force.  I think they deserve the utmost consideration the Minister can give them to ameliorate their conditions. Many Guards have suffered under transfers which have created a definite grievance in the force.  In many places they are living under impossible conditions. In some places they cannot find accommodation for themselves and their families.  I would urge upon the <Col N="1581" /> Minister, as Deputy Cowan and Deputy de Valera have done, that he should give this excellent force every possible consideration and every practical consideration that he can.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with a problem with which Deputy de Valera has already dealt.  I shall approach the problem from a different angle from his, but ultimately I shall arrive at the same effect.  The time has come when motorists who are in an advanced state of intoxication will have to be put into a special category where specific penalties will be laid down and where there shall be an irrevocable decision by a court of summary jurisdiction with regard to the driving potential in the future of a person convicted of the crime of being drunk while in charge of a motor car.  Very serious accidents have been occurring on our roads. There are enough hazards on the road to-day without adding to them the hazard of indiscriminate driving by motorists under the influence of drink. The Minister will have to face his responsibilities in that matter.  I do not think it is the ultimate result of a man's condition that should be his guiding factor.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that it is not the consequence of the action that should be the guide as to the level on which to set the crime.  The problem should be approached from the point of view that any man driving a modern car when his condition is such that he is mentally and physically incapable of adequately and properly controlling that car is taking on to the road a more deadly and lethal weapon than a machine-gun. The Minister's attitude will have to be that there must be a summary, severe and ready-reckoning for such people.</P>
    <P>There is one particular matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  In the Minister's Department there was a certain official.  He was subsequently appointed a district justice, but before his appointment he served in the National Army in a legal capacity.  I would ask the Minister to consider his case with a view to permitting him to reckon his service with the Army as Judge-Advocate General for pension purposes.  This is an unusual type of case and I urge it on <Col N="1582" /> the Minister for his sympathetic consideration because there is a continuity of service on the part of this individual and I understand the addition of the number of years involved would substantially benefit him when he retires.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter to which Deputy Little referred.  I should like to assure the Deputy that no member of the legal profession, no matter to what political Party he belongs, would take it as an insult to be offered a judgeship, and Deputy Little need not worry too seriously about the argument addressed to the House that all judicial appointments made by the late Administration were made purely on merit.  I am honest enough to believe in the saying, to the victor to a certain extent the spoils, and I suppose one of the spoils that one may associate with political Parties in the matter of judicial appointments is that the legal supporters of the winners have a fair claim on the judgeships.  That has been the system since the commencement of the State, and I have no desire that the present Minister should in any way change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the position of District Court clerks.  Apparently they are a forgotten battalion in the Department of Justice.  Those people render a very useful service outside their ordinary official duties.  They act in the capacity of philosophers, advisers and in various other categories throughout rural Ireland.  I would not like to say too much about the remuneration they get for their official services.  I would like the Minister to consider favourably any appeal that is made by those people in the future to improve their conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I would like the Minister to consider.  In 1933 a certain force was recruited.  The majority of its members were old I.R.A. They served with distinction as Gardaí, but for pensionable purposes their period of service was very short and it would not afford them the amount necessary to keep men of their age in a position similar to that which they held before being discharged.  I should like the Minister to consider taking <Col N="1583" /> their I.R.A. service, even though it may not be taken in full; they could take a certain service that they gave in the I.R.A. and add it to their Garda service, so that they would come out with a full pension.  I am sure that every Party in the House appreciates that these men have earned such treatment.</P>
    <P>With regard to prosecutions for dangerous driving and other serious offences of that type, I think we are too lax.  As Deputy Collins said, a man driving a motor-car has a useful conveyance, but it can very easily be turned into an instrument of destruction&mdash;and a very destructive instrument it can be.  When a man is brought before the court he may get a severe sentence.  What should be taken into consideration is the loss of life there would be if a man takes drink to excess and, in his motor-car, exceeds the speed limit, as any man under the influence of drink is inclined to do. There should be more serious penalties to bring that type of person to his senses and to afford protection to the community, protection to which they are entitled and which it is incumbent on us as a Parliament to give them. Accidents, sometimes fatal, are occurring on the roads every day.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Local Government Estimate, Deputies were asking for autobahn roads, but I am afraid if we do not take steps to restrict the speed merchants the autobahn roads will be turned into death-traps for the people of this country.  If a man drives a car while under the influence of drink and he is caught by the Garda, his licence should be forfeited and he should never again be permitted to drive.  That is the only way to bring these people to their senses and it is the only way to protect the public.  I remember reading at one time <i>I Met Murder on the Way.</i>  Every day you go on the roads of Éire you meet murder on the way.  It is not premediated. Through a slight deviation of the steering-wheel, or because of something that causes a blank in the mind of the driver, that man can become a murderer within a second.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to bring <Col N="1584" /> the seriousness of this matter to the minds of drivers now on the road and potential drivers who may take up motoring as a vocation.  The only way effectively to bring it to their minds is by imposing very drastic sentences. Anybody committing a crime, such as is being committed every day in the week on the roads in this country through faulty driving or being under the influence of drink, should get something more than a suspended sentence, with the licence held up for 12 months.  In my opinion, penal servitude and taking the licence off motor drivers for ever, is the most effective lesson they could learn.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has control over the Chancery Division.  There is a very noticeable lack of staff there. The discharging of some estates&mdash;I do not know if that is the proper legal terminology&mdash;had to be held up for a long time because of lack of staff.  The Minister should pay attention to that matter and supply the staff necessary to carry out the work more rapidly.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one thing in conclusion, and that is that the Garda force has been a credit to this country since its initiation.  The Garda deserve everything good that we here can give them.  I hope the Minister will consider an improvement in their conditions and also consider the possibility of relieving them of certain duties imposed on them during the emergency and so make them what they were intended to be&mdash;officers for the prevention and detection of crime.  I am sure these men will appreciate very highly any steps taken to relieve them of work that is not concerned with the discharge of their ordinary duties.  At the moment they have more duties to discharge than they are able to perform. I believe that the Minister in future when dealing with this body of public servants should bear in mind that they have under very adverse conditions carried out very onerous duties and that they can bear favourable comparison with any other police force in Europe or even in any part of the world.  I hope that the Minister will give due consideration to my remarks so that the Garda will become a body of men marching on their objective&mdash;that objective being the <Col N="1585" /> prevention and detection of crime&mdash; quite satisfied as to the conditions under which they serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that that circular bearing the signature of John E. Conway, ex-sergeant, Secretary of the Garda Pensioners' Association, draws attention to the fact that no account was taken, in the recent adjustment of pension allowances, of the claims of those members who retired prior to the 1st July, 1940, and says that keen disappointment was felt at this decision.  He refers to the 1947 Pensions Act which excluded the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Garda and Royal Irish Constabulary men who retired prior to 1940.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been brought to the notice of my association by a recent announcement in the Press that it is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation at an early date further to adjust Garda pensions on a still more equitable basis of a permanent nature.  Having regard to modern conditions generally, my association again makes the request that in any readjustment of pension all members, including Dublin Metropolitan <Col N="1586" /> Police pensioners, whose number is now dwindling, be included in such a scheme.  We trust that this final appeal will meet with favourable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Mr. Conway says, the number of old Dublin Metropolitan Police is rapidly dwindling.  Again the ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were promised, in words used by some of the leaders in public life at a certain time, that they would always have conditions not less favourable than those who remained in the service, have not had their pensions increased.  They are suffering grave hardships and they complain that the last Government did not fulfil the promises made to them.  They earnestly appeal to the present Government to fulfil these promises.  I strongly support that appeal and I ask that those old hands should get reasonable increases in their pensions to enable them to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>I also desire to be associated with the remarks of one of my colleagues who drew attention to the fact that there is growing discontent in the Garda and amongst the warders of the country.  Their wages and conditions of service generally are not what they should be.  The easiest way to ensure a contented public service, which is a great asset to any community, is to see that the personnel get good pay, fair conditions and reasonable pensions when they serve their country well.  I hold that there are a number of various types of public servants in this category who are not treated as they should be treated.  If one starts to talk about Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners, Garda pensioners, ex-school teachers and all other public servants one would have to go down a very long list.  One can only say that there is a number of Government pensioners of all sections anxiously looking to the Government to give them decent conditions and permit them to end their days without suffering hardships, because in many cases at present their allowances are not sufficient to enable them to purchase the necessaries of life. Some of them have pensions only just sufficient to bring them within the means test and to prevent their getting <Col N="1587" /> the old age pension.  I hope the Minister will see to it that any of them who come under his control will get favourable treatment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transfer of Gardaí, there is no housing accommodation for them in Dublin and the allowance the Gardaí get is the same as it was 25 years ago.  The rent allowance is insufficient, and I appeal to the Minister to see that, when transferring men, the allowances for rent will be sufficient to meet the demand made by those who have property for letting or sale.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have drawn attention to traffic conditions in this city. The traffic Guards do splendid work, but I have often thought how easy it would be to help them clear a traffic block, say, between O'Connell Bridge and the top of Dawson Street, St. Stephen's Green and around that area if we had half a dozen Guards on horses.  They could step out from O'Connell Bridge, go around to Dawson Street and give a signal to the traffic Guard to let the traffic go in certain places.  I remember when we had horse police in this city.  They were a delight to see, and, if any Deputy saw half a dozen Guards on horseback rendering assistance in the clearing of traffic blocks, he would be very proud of both horses and men.  I make the suggestion to the Minister that he should introduce the mounted Guard for this purpose.  It would help to ease a position which is becoming appalling. In present conditions, it is easier and quicker to walk from Nelson's Pillar to Stephen's Green than to go by taxi or car.</P>
    <P>I rose particularly to draw attention to the conditions of those who are expecting better treatment from this Government in the matter of pay and pensions.  It is a long time since the allowances given to the Gardaí for boots and upkeep of clothing were increased. The cost of these things has doubled and I hold that the allowances should also be doubled.  Looking down the Estimate, I note that the commencing salary of a Garda is something under £4 a week.  Who can live on £4 a week now, even when living in barracks? I might add also that the <Col N="1588" /> Minister ought to inspect the barracks and see that the conditions of the single men living in these barracks is improved.</P>
    <P>As has been said by other Deputies, we are all proud of the Gardaí and of their achievements, and of the Minister's staff generally.  I join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on the position he has accepted and I express the hope that, at the end of the year, many improvements on the lines put forward by Deputies will have been brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the appeal made by my colleague, Deputy Keane, in connection with members of the Gardaí who came into the force very late in life.  They are mostly Old I.R.A. men and, because of the age limit, will have to go out early and will find themselves in very straitened circumstances.  I should like also to call the Minister's attention to the position of the section of the community who get no pay.  We have heard about various people who wanted increases of salary for something they did or did not do, but I should like to put before the Minister the position of jurors.  On Monday last, I happened to be in Cork and I met a number of my colleagues, some from Deputy Halliden's area and more from the far western points of the county. They were all collected there, something over a hundred of them&mdash;dragged away from their businesses to serve on juries.  Deputies are paid for coming here and county councillors get their travelling expenses.  Everybody who attends any kind of court is paid&mdash;even the prisoner is paid when he gets his sentence&mdash;and I think the time has arrived when something should be done with regard to the men who are dragged away from their businesses to serve as jurors.  One of these men told me that he had to get up at 4 o'clock that morning in order to milk his cows and get his business done before coming up to serve his country for the day at his own expense throughout.  I think it is unjust and unfair, and I suggest to the Minister that he ought to turn his attention to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very worried by Deputy Cowan's statement in connection with Guards being charged and disciplined <Col N="1589" /> because, in plain language, they had no cases.  The Minister and I have a mutual viewpoint as to what should be the duties of a good Guard.  Speaking in the House some time ago, the present Minister said in the Official Debates, Vol. 88, No. 3 of 14th October, 1942:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I knew the sergeant to be a reliable, steady officer.  I thought that there would be no harm, if I met him accidentally, to mention the complaint to him, which I did.  He said: &lsquo;Everybody knows that on Sunday I enforce the licensing law until 1 o'clock.  While the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is on from 1 o'clock to 8 o'clock I do not run into every pub to see who is in it because I know that Paddy and Johnnie, who have been working hard all the week, are getting a pint.  I am not going to follow those people.  When the dance hall opens at 8 o'clock and when a bunch of brats come, armed with poteen, take a few glasses, distribute the rest and then go down to a pub and get a couple of pints, to throw on top of it which sets them mad&mdash;these people I will prosecute and persecute so far as lies in my power.&rsquo;  I said: &lsquo;Good luck to you.&rsquo;  That is a situation in which a Garda sergeant was himself legislating.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, before this Bill, which has for its purpose the increasing of taxation, passes its Final Stage here, that another opportunity should be given to those Deputies, who sought and obtained election to this House with the declared intention of reducing taxation, of protesting against it.  These Deputies are sitting opposite me now on the benches behind the Minister.  They are aware of the fact that they campaigned throughout the country on the need for a reduction of taxation; they are aware of the fact that they frequently reiterated their opinion that a reduction of taxation was practicable, and they <Col N="1590" /> are now dealing with a Bill introduced by a Minister of their own Party to increase taxation.  Surely they will have something to say about it.  I do not expect that any of them will be prepared to vote against the passage of the Bill.  That would be to expect too much, but there are obvious reasons why they might think it desirable, if not actually necessary, to put upon record some protest, however feeble, against the imposing of increased taxation by the first major Bill introduced by their Government.</P>
      <P>I am not going to assert, as they asserted, that an increase in taxation is always objectionable.  An increase in taxation for the purpose of providing funds to finance some service which the public needs or the public desires is quite justifiable, but they opposed increases of taxation regardless of the purpose of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy has yet joined the Party to which I am addressing my remarks. Personally I have no knowledge of the campaign which the Deputy fought, but I have ample knowledge of the general line which was taken by those people who opposed taxation regardless of the purposes for which that taxation was imposed.  May I remind the Deputy that their principal campaign was directed against taxes which were introduced in order to subsidise food prices.  Nobody, I am sure, will quarrel with the need for reducing the cost of food.  I think not even for that purpose were they prepared to support proposals to increase taxation.  Despite the fact that that was the purpose of the taxation they announced their intention of reducing it.  We are now increasing taxation, and those who support this Bill are supporting an increase in taxation, and for what purpose? I submit that it is not sufficient defence for Deputies who took that line and who are departing from it to assert merely that the cost of public services is such as to require the imposition of new charges on the public.  That is not what they told the people.  They told the people that they could give them all the services they required, adequately and efficiently, at a lower <Col N="1591" /> cost with no extra taxation and no added impositions on petrol, fuel oil or anything else.  An increase in taxation is objectionable when it is proposed by a Government supported by Deputies who secured election on a programme of reduced taxation.  That brings in a question of faith and morals, a question of public faith in the integrity of public men.  It is not moral to seek and obtain election on a programme to which it is not intended to adhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  The Deputy has been misled by Cumann na nGaedheal propaganda.  Taxation is, of course, always objectionable when it is of such a character as to constitute a handicap to trade and one of the main taxes imposed by this Bill is a handicap to trade.  It is a bad tax because inevitably it means an increase in the cost of the production and distribution of merchandise and will, therefore, be passed on with additions to the public.  An increase of taxation is, of course, always bad at a time of rising prices and falling trade.  I make that statement almost without reservation and we have here now a situation of rising prices and falling trade. Not merely are prices rising and our trade declining, but the Government is doing nothing about it.  I do not think it is fair once again to remind the Deputies opposite that in addition to undertaking to reduce taxation they undertook to reduce prices and that since this Government came to office prices have risen continuously.  Not one single price has been reduced over the whole range of the foodstuffs, which are generally regarded as necessities of life.  These prices have risen as a direct consequence of Government activity or of Government inactivity and that rise in prices is associated with a decline in trade.  I do not know if it is necessary to produce here statistical evidence of the stagnation in trade which is now developing. Everybody knows about that, except apparently the members of the Government. Again the Government is watching with complacent indifference and without apparently any idea or any intention <Col N="1592" /> of doing anything about it. Deputies on this side of the House might accept this Bill and might accept the increased taxation for which the Bill provides if there was any evidence of a worth-while policy behind it.  We have had, however, from the Government no evidence of a policy.  We have merely a mess of negatives.  We know what they are against, but we do not know what they are for.  I think it is high time that some effort was made to elucidate for the information of the public, for that section of the public who supported the Government Deputies, what precisely it is their aim to do.</P>
      <P>We are receiving from different Ministers contradictory statements with no effort forthcoming from anybody to attempt to reconcile them.  I have said that the cost of living is rising; I have protested against the imposition of additional taxes at a time when the cost of living was rising; I have protested against the particular tax which was inevitably bound to increase still further the cost of living; but let me say this, I cannot give the House any precise data as to the exact degree of the rise in prices which has occurred, because I do not know them.  For some reason the publication of the usual quarterly cost-of-living index number has been delayed.  Normally the mid-May number would be published early in June and it is now the end of June and the figure has not appeared.  May I ask the Minister for Finance why there has been this delay in the publication of the figure and when it will appear?</P>
      <P>I do not know if I would be in order in making any reference on this Bill to the announcement which appeared to-day concerning the trade agreement which has been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to discuss the agreement.  I want to impress on the Government the importance of giving early information on that precise matter.  The absence of precise information is bound to have an adverse effect on trade and, therefore, an adverse effect upon revenue. The Minister based his taxation proposals following on his Budget statement on a certain assumption concerning the procuring of wheat at prices indicated in the draft agreement concerning wheat negotiated early this year in Washington.  The indications are that that agreement is not going to be implemented.  It is now fairly clear that the United States Senate will reject it and that, consequently, the arrangements contemplated for the purchase of wheat at fixed prices will not proceed.  On the contrary, there was published this morning in the American papers a statement by a spokesman of the American Department of Agriculture to the effect that American exports of foodstuffs, regardless of any arrangement that might be made in connection with the European Recovery Programme, but particularly exports of grain, would be less in the next 12 months than in either of the previous two years.  In these circumstances, in the absence of an agreement such as was contemplated and the diminution in American shipments, it is almost inevitable that wheat prices will rise higher than those contemplated by the agreement and those upon which the Minister based the cost of the wheat subsidy.</P>
      <P>It is not a financial matter but clearly, having regard to the information which is now available, some reconsideration should be given to the desirability of expanding, or at least maintaining, our own wheat crop.  I do not know if the announced commitment which the Government have entered into to arrange future wheat and maize shipments in consultation with the British authorities involves or implies the giving to these authorities of any right of veto or of limitation on our wheat purchases</P>

      <P>It is at least possible in such circumstances that our wheat imports will be less.  Presumably, it would be difficult for the British authorities to maintain here at their expense a bread ration larger than their own.  If that is so, presumably the basis of the Budget is altered, because the Minister informed the House that the basis of the Budget and the taxation proposals in this Bill were based upon a certain assumption concerning the quantities of wheat to be imported and the prices at which they were to be imported.  If these assumptions are proved to be incorrect, the House is entitled to be informed as to the measures which the Government propose to take in the matter.</P>
      <P>I want to protest also against a further development of the Government attitude to the Dáil in relation to financial matters.  I protested previously against the remission of taxation by Government Order and without giving an opportunity to the Dáil to express its view on that proposal. I now want to protest equally emphatically against the Government's imposing taxation by an administrative decision and without previous discussion here or without the consent of this House.  I refer to the increase in the postal charges.  So far as I know, on no previous occasion in the history of this House has there been an increase in postal charges made without the matter being mentioned in the Budget statement and presented here as part of the Government's general financial proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, in my view, sharp practice for the Minister for Finance to bring a Budget before this House, to get approval of the Budget from the House, <Col N="1595" /> to submit a Finance Bill to give legislative effect to the taxation proposals of that Budget and, at the end of that, to impose a new charge upon the public by Ministerial decision of which the members of the Dáil learned for the first time from a news item in the Press.  I have expressed my view that the most important of all the powers possessed by the Dáil is the right to control the imposition of taxation on the public.  If the Dáil surrenders in the least iota its power over public finance, its right to say whether or not a charge should be imposed on the public and how public money should be spent, then we are adopting a new conception of democracy.  This experiment in democracy to which the Taoiseach has repeatedly referred has taken a new significance.</P>
    <P>I understand fully that on this stage of the Bill I can refer only to what is in it.  I am not at liberty to discuss what is not in it or what should be in it.  I want merely to emphasise for the information of Deputies opposite that in the Bill are proposals to increase taxation and I want them to relate their support for these proposals in their own consciences to the means by which they secured election to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The few words that have been said by way of what the Deputy aptly described as a feeble protest in connection with the financial proposals of the Budget have been based upon an assertion that the legislation that has been discussed carries an increase in taxation.  The Deputy appears to forget that there are two parts of the Finance Bill which confirm Orders which reduce taxation.  The reduction in taxation amounts to over £6,000,000.  The proposals for taxation amount to round about £1,000,000.  The Deputy who was recently a Minister left a situation in which, if he was still in control of affairs, the country would be faced this year with new expenditure amounting to over £10,000,000. The Deputy has despised, criticised and cast aside all efforts at economy.  He would not have made them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy now says that the wheat agreement is not likely to go through. I am afraid he is reading too much of <Col N="1596" /> the gentleman who calls himself &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo; and who writes in one of the papers.  I do not know where he gets his advance information. But the Deputy who is now criticising the wheat agreement, thinking it may not go through, openly and not surreptitiously as in the <i>Irish Press,</i> stated that the wheat agreement would go through; that it was his development and that he was responsible for the conclusion of the agreement.  It is difficult just inside of the space of six weeks to have it both ways.  It could be done over six months, as we know from the Deputy's practice before.  The period is too narrow.  He catches up with himself so to speak.  He approved of that agreement and indicated that it was certain to go through and that anybody who took credit for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except those who would give credit to Fianna Fáil were speaking falsely.  Now, of course, it is at least cheap political tactics to go on the other line.  I make this assertion just as boldly as the other assertion was made&mdash;one is as much without foundation as the other. Nobody knows what is going to happen.  In any event, the Deputy's main point is that there is an increase in taxation.  I invite him to consider the facts.  His Government, if still a Government, would be imposing upon the people at least £10,000,000 of taxation. We know that £6,000,000 of that was to be achieved through taxes which the public so cordially disliked that they removed the Deputy and his colleagues from office.  One of the aggravations which the Deputy has and which his whole Party shares with him is that we carried out certain pledges that were made in response to an active public opinion to which we were sensitive.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen is in his old frame of mind again, forgetting the sell out, unsuccessfully, which he and his colleagues made to big business. We were not selling out to any small group.  We sold out to the public and, if the Deputy does not consider <Col N="1597" /> that, will he answer the question I have phrased often in this House before?  When he speaks of selling out, he accuses one Party.  We are an amalgamation of Parties, a coalition of Parties, a group.  It is amazing how all the people forming the different groups all found themselves up against public opinion which opposed the taxes which we removed.  If Deputy Allen were not so much under the control of his ex-Ministerial group, he would be more open to the sway of public opinion.  It is because he was not so open, he now finds himself subjected to adverse public criticism.</P>

It was not these taxation proposals.  I am glad to hear it.  We feel otherwise.  We feel we are responsive to public opinion both in remitting these taxes and in going on the line of economy, economy that cuts out extravagance and that saves the public of this State, not merely that £6,000,000, but an additional £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 which the Deputy who now speaks for the Party would have imposed on the people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, who was the only one who had the courage to stick to his guns in this matter, has lamented the efforts at economy that have been made.  I apologise for these efforts at economy.  They have not been sufficient.  I will go a good deal further, if I can manage it, on the same lines of cutting out extravagance because there is requirement and necessity here for money for productive purposes from the limited resources that this State has.  It is only when one stops the wide gaps that have been created in any sound economy by Fianna Fáil that there will be any possibility of having money that can be applied usefully to development purposes and to socially desirable purposes. These are the objects we have and to them any money will be devoted. We must save and we will save on the Cushla Machree extravagance for which the Deputy was responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do, however, feel that it is not really tolerable to be addressed on faith and morals by Deputy Lemass and it is hardly tolerable to be spoken to by the same Deputy on the integrity that attaches to public office.  Faith and morals and the integrity attaching to public office!  All we have to do is to have about a five-minutes' silence to think back over the Deputy's relations to public office in the view of these <Col N="1600" /> principles.  Deputies will recall them without any urge from me.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has spoken of the one great tax I have imposed and the difficulty it is going to impose on the trade. I presume that is the petrol tax.  The Deputy knows that in 1941 he had a tax on petrol of 1/3.  I have not raised it as much.  I am at least a penny short of that.  If that tax on petrol is a handicap on trade and agriculture, if it is going to increase the cost of living and the costs in every trade and business, including agriculture, then the Deputy had it at a penny higher from 1941 to 1946.  It is amazing that these criteria with regard to the hardship going to be imposed on people did not operate to prevent at least the back-benchers of the Party, who were moving amongst the people, from precluding the Minister, as he then was, from imposing this addition on the difficulties under which trade, industry, and agriculture in particular, were labouring at the time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy fears that there is no developed policy with regard to trade or industry in this country.  I do not know where the Deputy gets that fear of his.  I have made statements here with regard to the attitude we have towards both agriculture and industry. We have shown signs of bettering both of these.  We have removed certain handicaps.  As the years go on, we will remove certain other handicaps by changing a policy which, through its extravagance, had raised taxation, that had imposed burdens well-nigh intolerable upon all the productive capacity of the country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says costs of living are rising.  I do not know where the signs of that are.  He complains that the index figure has been delayed.  I do not know that it has but, if it has, I wonder is it because it is difficult to reconcile the new index figure with the figure which the Deputy when a Minister fathered in order to delude the people of the country by building up a new index figure, the relationship of which to the old was hard to discover, so that, by bringing about a reduction on paper, he could pretend that in reality the cost of living in this country had been reduced.  I assert again, as <Col N="1601" /> I have asserted right through the debates that have taken place on the Financial Resolutions, that the cost of living in this country has been reduced since the 18th February and, if anybody hesitates to believe that, will he weigh in the balance that inside a few weeks of our coming to office we remitted taxation to the extent of £6,000,000, and that the only major tax I have imposed in this Bill is one of less than £1,000,000?  How can anybody expect to be believed in this country when he clamours that the costs of living have been raised in the face of that calculation I have given and which is a sound calculation?  It is hard to believe that anybody can be so simple as to accept the view that costs of living have been raised in this country when, in fact, taxes to the extent of £6,000,000 have been remitted and have been substituted by one major tax costing the people less than £1,000,000.  That is a remarkable proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that hits the Deputy.  He is very concerned about the wheat agreement and throws in his view that wheat will not <Col N="1602" /> be sent&mdash;maybe it will not&mdash;and about the whole question whether wheat prices will drop.  In any event I promise this Dáil&mdash;not knowing very much about the future and not believing in prognostications in the way that &ldquo;a Dáil reporter of the <i>Irish Press</i>&rdquo; does&mdash;that wheat prices will not at least reach the level of the shocking bad bargain which the ex-Minister made in connection with that deal about Argentine wheat which was so much discussed in this House.  It was a bad thing in any event, and a shockingly bad thing done on the day before the ex-Minister knew he was going to be removed from office, blistering the people of this country with a subvention amounting to in or about £2,250,000 for one bad deal in Argentine wheat.  I will make no such bad deals, and by avoiding such bad deals, even if the wheat agreement does not go through, there will be no necessity to impose the taxation which would have been necessary if the ex-Minister was still able to make that type of deal over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is very concerned about the rights of the Dáil in connection with taxation and referred to the postal charges.  There is nothing irregular about those postal charges. The Deputy laments the fact that the Dáil is not empowered to deal with these.  The Dáil will get an opportunity of dealing with them at the proper time.  That such criticism should be put up by the expert person, the most expert over ten years in removing from this House immediate control of charges, puzzles me.  Nobody was more expert than the Deputy, and no one more experienced than the Deputy in imposing taxes by Order, the Order having later to be confirmed. What has been done with regard to postal charges is quite regular.  It has been done in accordance with the financial procedure of this State.  If the Dáil wants to discuss these charges an opportunity will be afforded, sooner or later, to do so.  Nothing irregular has been done, and the charges when they come to be discussed will be justified and the Dáil will be asked to accept them.  Powers of the same type have been exercised over and over again, and exercised more particularly <Col N="1603" /> by the Deputy who has spoken than by anybody else.</P>
    <P>If I had known of the particular expenditure against which these charges have to be set at the time when the Finance Bill was being introduced I would have mentioned them.  Certain demands were made by civil servants. These demands have been, in part, met, and in order to meet them money had to be found.  There was nothing more appropriate than to meet part of those charges, such part at least as devolves on the State, by having recourse to postal charges particularly when these have been running at a low level for many a day, one of the most significant of them running for a very long time at an ancient rate.  I think I am entitled to take advantage of these in order to meet particular charges which have come upon me suddenly.</P>
    <P>I hope the Dáil will accept the assurance from me that when I introduced the Finance Bill I had made no commitments in respect of civil servants.  If I had known I would have mentioned them.  If I knew and had not mentioned them that would be in accordance with the practice of the Deputy.  I do not propose to adopt his practice or to follow the malpractices that the Deputy indulged in when he was Minister for many years.  The Dáil will get notice from time to time of anything done subject to the control of this Bill, and if not it is because the Dáil has given certain powers to the Government.  It did not give them by our gripping them.  All these matters can be discussed on the Vote for the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I present this Finance Bill to the people as a Finance Bill which, in fact, remits taxation.  It operates to decrease taxation, and because taxation is being decreased it means a lower cost to the community.  I give that in contradiction to what would have happened if the old Government was still in office.  Not merely would the £6,000,000 which I am remitting still be in existence, or the £900,000 which I am looking for from petrol, but there would be, in addition, a sum of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 extra which <Col N="1604" /> would have to be got.  I ask the people through this House to believe&mdash;and I believe they will accept the situation as I have disclosed it&mdash;that taxation has been reduced and reduced substantially, notwithstanding advantages which the last Government never thought of giving and which are going to be given in abundance to the people who have a priority call on the means of the State.</P>

I wonder whether we could get rid of this disagreeable condition of affairs.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister consider easing the situation down the country and so prevent the Guards doing work that they evidently do not wish to do, for there is no law as bad as an unjust law, and no law so bad or so upsetting to the conditions of justice <Col N="1605" /> as laws that have to be ignored.  I am glad that we have on record here the views of the Minister for Justice on this.  I wonder if I would be going too far in suggesting that this statement which I have read out should be cut out and sent in leaflet form to every Garda station in the country in order that the Gardaí may know the views of the Minister for Justice in this particular matter and so avoid unnecessary, annoying and irritating prosecutions of the general public.  I do not intend to elaborate on that particular condition of affairs beyond saying that if we are to have a good Garda force and if we are to have respect for law in this country, the first law must be the recognition of equal rights for all our citizens.  That is a law above all other laws and it is only when that law is broken, by laws made in this House or elsewhere, that the law is brought into contempt.  When the law is brought into such contempt that it is ignored right through the country you have a condition of affairs that calls for remedy from the Minister for Justice and his Department.</P>
      <P>I am not a bit concerned that a Deputy who, when he was in opposition, voted for the opening of public houses for six hours every Sunday, now announces that he is going to vote against opening them for four hours because he is on the side of the Minister. I am, however, very definitely concerned with respect for the law; with the recognition of the law, and with the prevention of a condition of affairs in this country where the law is so definitely and openly unjust.</P>

      <P>My sole reason for raising the point is the fact that Deputy Cowan pointed out in his speech that those Gardaí are now being disciplined for not enforcing the law.  I should not <Col N="1606" /> like, and I am sure the Minister for Justice would not like, to see that kind of discipline applied, after what he has said about efficient Gardaí.</P>
      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister in the matter of juries in this country. It is unjust and unfair that farmers can be dragged 40, 50 and 60 miles away from their business and from their homes into courts day after day and week after week at their own expense, whilst every other individual attending that court is paid.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the Minister, as a rural Deputy, understands the particular annoyance and the injustice of that condition of affairs as well as I do.  I am not concerned with higher pay for Tom, Dick or Harry.  I am particularly concerned with the agricultural community who are dragged away from their business on this particular mission.  I think it is unfair.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to give the matter his earnest consideration so that every unfortunate farmer in the country will not be running off to the nearest doctor in an endeavour to get a certificate to the effect that he is deaf.  The present system is unjust to the farming community and I feel sure that the Minister in his wisdom will deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like first of all to refer to a matter which has been mentioned by Deputy Byrne and perhaps by some other Deputies also.  It concerns the transfer of Garda officers.  I have one specific case in mind&mdash;a case which has been raised in previous debates in this House on this particular Estimate.  It concerns the transfer of a Garda officer from County Dublin to the West of Ireland.  That transfer was surrounded, on the face of it anyhow, by considerable political influence and political intrigue.</P>

      <P>In that connection I would say to the Minister that it is a very wrong thing to have Garda officers interfered with in the exercise of their duties by any public representative.  Nevertheless, there have been cases of victimisation over a number of years past.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should cause an inquiry to be made into such cases with particular reference to the Garda officer who was transferred some two years ago from County Dublin to the West of Ireland.  In my view, and I have brought this matter to the notice of the Minister already, this was a clear case of victimisation which should be remedied as quickly as possible. The Garda officer concerned is a senior sergeant in the Garda force. He has been separated from his family. He is in a small town in my constituency at present and he is, and has been for the last two years, suffering a grievous wrong.  That matter should be inquired into by the Minister.  It is unfortunate that it is necessary for me to raise it and unfortunate that any matter like this should be raised in a particular case in this House, but I find it necessary for me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister's reference to the case of District Court clerks and clerical officers in his Department.  The District Court clerks undoubtedly have a very strong case for recognition by the Minister.  I am aware personally, as a result of a deputation when I was present and met the Minister, that they have his wholehearted support.  As these District Court clerks had made claims for the solution of their grievances and had been asked at the commencement of the war to postpone their claims for the duration of the emergency, and since as a result of their patience then eight years have now elapsed, some immediate steps should be taken, if not to find a complete solution for the grievances, at least to remedy them partially. They require establishment and they require better conditions of service <Col N="1608" /> generally.  They fulfil a very important function in the administration of justice.  Those associated with the practice of law realise that the important officer, more often than not, is not the judge delivering judgment or the barrister or solicitor pleading a case, but the officer in a very humble position who has to prepare the documents for the hearing of a case in court.  This is particularly so in the District Court, where justice is administered locally and often, of necessity, very quickly. I would impress on the Minister that, although the numbers of these officers may not be large, the duties they fulfil are onerous and often thankless.  They have received from a succession of Ministers in recent years very little recognition of their claims and I press these claims upon the Minister very strongly.</P>
    <P>I have certain hesitation in raising another matter.  I raise it as a lawyer, and I know that when a lawyer talks about legal costs or fees he generally meets with a very hostile reception from laymen.  It appears to be the general belief that those in the legal profession have taken the cream of the earnings of this country for hundreds of years back and that particular belief is so strong that nowadays those who engage in the practice of law find it very hard to get any of their grievances remedied.  In the regulations prescribing fees and costs, particularly in the circuit courts, a position of affairs has now arisen where the practice of law by either solicitors or barristers in the Circuit Court has ceased to be a paying proposition.  I have no brief to speak on behalf of the solicitor's profession, but I appreciate their difficulties. Under the Circuit Court Rules brought into operation in 1930, certain counsels' fees were prescribed in the schedule.  These fees have remained exactly as they were for the last 18 years.  A young barrister starting off practice and going down on circuit to learn his trade&mdash;as any man starting practice must&mdash;has to pay more to-day for the clothes he wears and the food he eats, if he is running a car he has to pay more for it, and his own personal expenses have considerably increased; yet there has been no increase whatsoever in the very miserable fees <Col N="1609" /> allowed to him under the Circuit Court Rules.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court Rules Committee has recently suggested some increases in fees, which in no way meet the situation but which go a certain distance in alleviating it.  If the Minister, as a layman, has any doubts about the merits of what I am saying, he should have this question of the approval of these fees referred for the opinion of the Attorney-General.  If that is done, I am certain that some measure of recognition will be given to lawyers generally.</P>
    <P>I agree to a large extent with what Deputy Corry said in connection with jurors.  I am sure this is a matter which has been discussed in this House time after time and I have little to add as a contribution to it.  We all know that the jury system is essential to the administration of justice.  Jurors play a very important part and, just like any other class playing an important part, their conditions of service should be made at least not onerous on them.</P>
    <P>I again urge on the Minister to pay particular attention to the question of the Garda officer to whom I have referred and also to the question of legal costs generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed in the Minister's opening statement, that he did not say anything about fixing the jurisdiction of the District Court.  I understand this matter was considered favourably by his predecessor, as being one of the most effective means of reducing the cost of litigation.  The District Courts have proved most effective and popular courts in the country, where people get through whatever litigation they have very quickly.  The litigation there is inexpensive and is satisfactory.  As a matter of fact, they are the most successful courts of any, from the countryman's point of view.  The jurisdiction of these courts is too limited.  I understood that a Bill was practically ready for introduction to this House to increase the jurisdiction of the District Court to at least £50 in contract and tort and to enable country people to litigate simple questions with regard to fences and rights of way where the <Col N="1610" /> valuation is under a certain figure.  It is absurd that when two litigants have to go to court on the question of trespass in connection with a fence, where the valuation of the holdings is possibly not more than £2 or £3, a question of title is raised and they are transferred to the Circuit Court with counsel and engineers and all the other attendant expenses of a title action in such a court.  It puts the unsuccessful claimant out of court because its only result can be that he is beggared for life.  Many of these people cannot take that risk.  The obvious defect is that the District Court is not given jurisdiction to deal with such questions.  I hope that the Minister will re-examine the proposals of his predecessor in connection with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating new legislation but if the Minister feels constrained to introduce new legislation to remedy this defect he will have my sympathy and help.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would do something to hurry up the work of the Land Registry.  We all know that there was a serious shortage of staff there and, as we go on from day to day, there will be more and more work for that particular department.  I was glad to hear the Minister say, though he did seem to suggest that it was a matter for congratulation, that any extension of this department would be covered by the increased charges that have come into operation where Land Registry work is concerned.  Those increased charges have been a source of worry both to the ordinary people and to legal practitioners throughout the country.  These charges are a definite tax on the small farmer.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the revision of these increased Land Registry charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not put them on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is found out in practice that it does not work out and that <Col N="1611" /> it tends to stop people, particularly the poorer sections of the community, putting the titles to their places in order, then it calls for revision and modification. I have come across many cases in which small farmers down in the West of Ireland have been unable to go through with putting their titles in order due in the main to the increased charges in the Land Registry.  The vast majority of my profession as a whole and the vast majority of the people do not approve of them.</P>
      <P>I think it is in the interest of the State that people should be encouraged to keep their titles in order.  The longer such things are let go the greater the difficulty in the long run because people are then forced to come into court looking for orders under Section 52 of the Local Registration of Title Act, thereby holding up the work of the courts, in their efforts to get over the fact that their titles have been allowed to lapse over a number of years.  I would appeal to the Minister to re-examine that problem.  I would suggest to him that where the valuation is only £20 or £25 in the rural areas these increased charges should not operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to some of the comments made by the Deputies in connection with the Gardaí throughout the country.  There is one matter to which I wish to refer.  I do so with a certain amount of reluctance.  I believe in the Gardaí doing their duty.  Having said that, I believe also that there should be a limit to what the Gardaí will do.  I listened to Deputy Cowan this evening talking about a Garda who was put on charge because he did not bring a prosecution within a period of 12 months.  I can assure Deputy Cowan and the House that that Garda would not last for one week in my particular town.  I do not know who is responsible. I believe in the ordinary law being enforced.  But I believe that it is carrying the enforcement of the law a little too far when you have members of the Gardaí going around to individuals who pull up with motor cars and taking out a tape measure to see whether they are within 15 inches of the kerb.  Prosecutions are being brought to court after court against <Col N="1612" /> people parking their cars without lights outside their own houses in quiet streets in country towns.  I deplore that tendency in my own town where you have approximately a population of 7,000 and where the record is unequalled as being one of the towns where there is a complete absence of crime.</P>
    <P>The effect of this petty vigilance destroys the co-operation that should exist between the public and the Gardaí.  I want to see the laws enforced and I want to see the Gardaí do their duty.  But the Minister will appreciate that that can be overdone. I fear that if we have a serious outbreak of crime in this particular area the Gardaí will not have the co-operation of the people&mdash;that co-operation so essential in maintaining law and order and in the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>Some of the Gardaí have their complaints. One of the main grievances seems to be connected with housing.  I would suggest to the Minister that houses should be provided for the Gardaí in country towns.  There is some difficulty at the present moment in transferring Gardaí because of lack of accommodation for them.  There is a regulation that Gardaí who marry local girls must be transferred to a distance of something like 15 miles away. Owing to the present dearth of housing a number of these men have been left in these areas and they cannot be transferred because there is no accommodation for them.  Ultimately the Minister will have to tackle this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That regulation has been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that it had been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been amended within the last three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a scarcity of housing in towns now that it is virtually impossible to get decent accommodation except where a member of the Gardaí is sufficiently lucky to have a house and his successor is lucky enough to get the same house.  I think the Minister should introduce some <Col N="1613" /> scheme to provide special houses for the Gardaí.  Until that is done we will not have a contented force.  I have heard complaints that the rent allowance is not sufficient.  I do not know to what it has been increased but I am told that the increase bears no relation to the actual rents which Garda officers are constrained to pay at the present time.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that matter because, although we have had such legislation as the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act, there are many cases to which that Act does not apply.  In these times anybody looking for a house in a country town&mdash;and, of course, the same thing applies in the cities&mdash;is not going to question what rent will be charged; it is more a question of endeavouring to secure the house.  To meet the special circumstances, I suggest to the Minister that this rent allowance should be increased.</P>
      <P>There has been a tendency during recent years to shift everything on to county registrars.  I do not quite agree with the principle of making the county registrar chief probate officer and sheriff and concentrating these positions in one individual.  I do not see how any county registrar, let him be a superman, can efficiently keep track of all these branches.  This should never have been done.  I think that in one Act passed by this House, dealing with sheriffs, discretion was left to the Minister with regard to the office of under-sheriff; it was left to his discretion to make the office of under-sheriff separate in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not contradict the Minister, but my recollection is that the Minister has discretion to do it in a particular instance.  Be that as it may, I know that taking the positions of probate officer and under-sheriff and adding them to all the other responsibilities of the county registrar is asking too much.  You should not have that state of affairs.  The county registrar's responsibilities are sufficiently onerous and if he carries them out efficiently that is all that should be asked of him.  I am leaving out the <Col N="1614" /> absurdity of a county registrar having to sign an execution order and directing himself to execute it.  Where this joining of offices has been carried out I ask the Minister carefully to examine the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister is no doubt as well aware as I am of the tendency towards complexity in modern legislation. Every day we have new Orders and new laws put in force, all entailing more work and more difficulties for those officers.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter and to leave the county registrars as county registrars proper to deal with the work that has always been allocated to them and make the other offices separate.  Where county registrars have had this work shoved on to them, they should be paid for it.  They are responsible for all the chancery or equity work; they are responsible in case anything goes wrong or if moneys are missing.  All the probate work is now thrown on them and they have to supervise and check the money that is collected through their offices under the court decrees that they are now executing.  The responsibility is tremendous for any man and I think he should be paid in accordance with that responsibility.  I do not suggest that the county registrars are not doing their work efficiently, but if you place additional responsibilities on any individual it is good policy to pay him in accordance with those responsibilities.</P>
      <P>One Deputy referred to the old question of costs which is generally mentioned on this Estimate.  I do not want to say much about Circuit Court costs and I will not advocate further legislation, but I suggest that the Minister could abolish pleadings in the Circuit Court, which are responsible for a great part of the heavy costs of litigation in those courts.  Any practitioner, and particularly the older practitioners who had experience of the county courts, can assure the Minister that with the old county court civil bill, without any pleadings and with a simple notice of particulars, except in a few specified types of action, they got through their work more expeditiously and more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert that many of these pleadings <Col N="1615" /> are completely unnecessary in the Circuit Courts.  In nine out of ten cases where people have litigation in the Circuit Courts the parties know well what they are fighting about and their legal advisers know it too, and there is no necessity for elaborate pleadings.  Invariably these have to be scanned by counsel and that involves further fees.  Then there are stamps, which mean further costs for the litigants.  The preparation of these things takes up quite a lot of time. The solicitors have to pay staffs for typing them out and in nine cases out of ten they mean absolutely nothing and are of very little help in the conduct of the case.  I think the Minister should consider, as we practitioners consider, that the cost of Circuit Court litigation is excessive and is in many cases beyond the means of the people; they simply cannot afford it.  The Minister should concentrate on abolishing pleadings in many of the cases which come into the Circuit Courts. That could be done very easily.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister in regard to one matter that I raised by way of Parliamentary Question some time ago&mdash;I hope I did misunderstand him.  On the 9th March last I asked the Minister if he was aware that some officers in the county registrar's office in Mayo were still unestablished, although they have been in the service for upwards of 40 years, and if he would take steps to have them made permanent, with suitable pension rights.  I should mention, in passing, that this does not alone affect Mayo; it affects practically every county in the Twenty-Six Counties, although the number of officers that I have in mind is limited.  The Minister stated in reply to a supplementary question that these officers did not avail themselves of an offer to become established, that rules were rules, and if people would not accept what they were offered, what could be done with them.  I venture to suggest that these men were not made this offer that the Minister alleges.  These men have been there for 40 years and are still unestablished and it is simply because there are only a few people concerned <Col N="1616" /> throughout the State that they are being treated in this way.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me, some Labour Deputies some time ago were also interested in this matter.  They certainly helped me in a previous debate when the Minister's predecessor had control.  We got an undertaking that something would be done for these men, that they would be included in some new scheme that would be brought out by the Department.  I cannot see any good reason from a common-sense or equitable point of view why these men are being excluded. I would not mind if they were part-time officers, but they are full time.  These two men have worked there for 40 years.</P>

      <P>I think I am correct in stating they were in the other office before this State was established.

They were full-time officers and they worked day in and day out all these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not mind, or at least I could understand, if there was some sort of regulation precluding the establishment of these men.  But, as the Minister is aware, he has power to deal with these men to-morrow if he wishes to do so.  The Minister shakes his head; I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the power which he possesses but if he is not I want to point it out to him that power is conferred by Section 62, sub-section (1) of the Court Officers Act of 1926.  The Minister has <Col N="1617" /> ample power under that section to deal with these men and all I want from the Minister is simply an expression of good will.  Surely if these men have given efficient and satisfactory service, even since this State was established, and are now about to retire they should be established in the same way as their brethren and should be given the same rights on their retirement.  There is only a very small amount involved. There are only two such officers in my county and there would not be many more of them in the remainder of the Twenty-Six Counties.  It would take a very small amount to meet this fair and reasonable demand.  I ask the Minister to go into this matter again.</P>

      <P>I have told the Minister that his predecessor undertook to deal with these men.  I am merely asking the Minister to do the same, unless of course his colleague, Deputy McGilligan, on the grounds of economy, cannot spare the few &ldquo;quid&rdquo; to deal fairly with these few men who have been working in the service of the State for the last 25 years.  At all events, if some of the Labour Deputies were present I think they would support this demand.  Deputy Davin, so far as my memory serves me, was interested in the matter and the mere fact that I advocate the rights of these particular officers should not preclude a decision in their favour.  I shall call on Deputy Davin if he is in the House to speak again in support of the case of these officers if the mere fact of Deputy Moran advocating their case, should be <Col N="1618" /> a deterrent as far as the present Minister is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be extremely brief.  I should like just to contribute my appreciation to the many that have been uttered as to the efficiency of the work done by the Gardaí.  There is one case of recent date which came under my notice which seems to be analogous to many of those which have been described here.  About a fortnight ago a gentleman whom I had seen for the first time came to my place.  When he was admitted, I discovered that he was a Guard.  He wanted to speak to me and I brought him into my office.  He told me that he had spent 24 years in the service and during these 24 years he never had to answer any charge, under any disciplinary code, for neglect of duty or anything else.  Because of an alleged interest in a greyhound, not established in fact, he was transferred about 50 miles away and could not find a house in the particular town to which he was sent.  He had to stay in the barracks, contribute his share for his maintenance and maintain a wife and six children 50 miles away, in the place wherein he had served for a number of years.  I thought, on the records indicated to me, and on the charge not established in fact, that there was arbitrary action taken by some people in authority.  He asked me if I could do anything about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not knowing the disciplinary code and the regulations which preclude such people as I from interfering, I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; I then wrote to the Department of Justice.  The man again came to me last Sunday&mdash;it was about three weeks before that he first approached me&mdash;and I never saw a man in such a terrible state of nerves. He was really shaking and full of apprehension.  The answer he got to my intervention was a letter from the Commissioner here telling him that he had used political influence in a manner which he should have known was in contravention of the code and threatening him that he would have to answer a disciplinary charge.  There is an old pagan dictum in philosophy: <Col N="1619" /><i>Fiat justitia; ruat coelum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Let justice be done though the heavens fall.&rdquo;  There was tyranny clearly here.  If the facts are as represented to me, that young man gave 24 years of very efficient and very meritorious service to the State.  If such a man because of an alleged interest, not established in fact, in a greyhound is transferred 50 miles away leaving his wife and his six children to look after themselves and because of a request that the matter would be reconsidered, is threatened with a disciplinary charge, I should like to know from the Minister is there any court of arbitration whereby such men can have their grievances considered or must they be treated in such an arbitrary fashion as I have indicated?  Is there any court where these men may plead, or have they to live under such a code of tyranny and injustice such as seems to be reflected in the case I have mentioned? These remarks may strengthen the hands of the Minister, coming from a Deputy of the House, and I say the facts are analogous to those of other cases already mentioned.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>I will not delay Deputy Flanagan as long as I would be delayed if the positions were reversed.  As a dispensary doctor, it is my privilege to work quite often very intimately with members of the Garda and it is scarcely necessary for me to pay tribute to their patience, their integrity and, more especially, to their generosity and their help to others.  I have had occasion to observe all these qualities in the members of the force but, if I have, I have also had occasion to observe the deplorable condition in which members of the Garda are compelled to live in the barracks allotted to them.  It is really appalling that men from whom so much is expected should be asked for so many years to live in such dim, dank and dreary dungeons as these Guards are compelled to live in.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I had occasion to view the sites for the successors, in the matter of building, of these dungeons to which I have referred, and I ask the Minister seriously to inquire into the qualifications of the men who selected the sites for these contemplated Garda stations.  I assure the house that, had I been consulted, as I consider I should have been, as medical officer of health for the district, I would never have selected a site&mdash;I am referring now to a particular instance in my district&mdash; with such an aspect as has been selected in this case.  Only recently I asked a question here with regard to the site for a Garda barracks in another town in my constituency, a major town compared with the village to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain, but I did inspect the site, which will occupy half the fair green of the town. The frontage of the fair green is 60 yards and the frontage of the site selected for the barracks 25 yards.  It is anything but a desirable site for a Garda barracks, apart altogether from curtailing the amenities of the town in the matter of the fair green.  When the selection of a site for a new barracks is contemplated, the dispensary doctor should, at least, be consulted with regard to it.</P>
      <P>In the matter of promotions, I know of a number of cases of Gardaí, otherwise perfectly efficient, just missing the boat in respect of promotion.  What effect the stoppage of recruitment will have on promotions in the future, I do not know, but I should like the Minister to see to it that Gardaí will not be victimised merely because of the cessation of recruiting.  On the question of driving licences, it appears extraordinary to me that in this country&mdash;I think it is alone in this respect&mdash;anybody can walk into a county council office, and, irrespective of his or her mentality, can be furnished with a driving licence to drive a potentially dangerous vehicle. It is scarcely necessary for me to enlarge on that and I am sure the Minister will see to it that the regulations governing the issue of driving licences will be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister that the old-world custom of deciding by direct medical evidence whether a person is incapable, by reason of drunkenness or alcoholic intake, of driving a car should also be abandoned.  It is a quite unsatisfactory mode of decision and I may tell the House that it is quite unsatisfactory <Col N="1622" /> from the point of view of my profession.  It will give us very great pleasure if it is abandoned entirely and the more modern system, which obtains in most countries, of the blood test, the test for alcoholic content, is adopted instead.  When a person is taken into a Garda barracks after an accident, perhaps involving life, the customary thing is that the dispensary medical officer is sent for by the Guards to decide whether the driver is under the influence of drink or was capable of driving a car.  What invariably happens is that, about an hour after, when the driver becomes <i>compos mentis,</i> he insists on the services of another doctor who is brought in, with the result that there is the customary clash of evidence in the court subsequently.  That is not pleasant for the dispensary medical officer or for the driver's consultant, and we would be much happier to be rid of it all.  The Minister should decide to have the distinction of introducing the modern technique in matters of this kind.  It is not quite fool-proof, but it is at least a summary punishment and does ensure that people consuming alcohol will not drive a car, at least unless their consumption is infinitesimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned that there was dissatisfaction amongst the Garda by reason of the disciplinary code.  I have had unsolicited expressions of opinion in this matter from various members of the Garda during my 15 years practising in this country and I can say that I have never heard any of them bemoan their fate in that regard. I really think that, when discipline is tempered with humanity and with the spirit of human relations, as I think it is, even in the Garda, and amongst the senior officers, there is no room for complaint.  On the contrary, I think they are very happy with regard to the attitude adopted by their senior officers towards them.  Admittedly, there will be isolated instances in which the circumstances perhaps make it appear that the discipline was rather strict, but I know that, during the past 15 years, they have been more than satisfied with the attitude of their senior officers towards them and I am sure that the advent of the present <Col N="1623" /> Minister will not in any way alter that position.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, by the way, seized the opportunity also of asking the Minister's support in connection with legal fees.  It would interest Deputy O'Higgins to look up for comparison the medical fees allowed to dispensary and other medical officers coming up from the country to attend <Col N="1624" /> even the High Court and to see the fraction which our fees represent compared with legal fees, and as he appealed to the Minister to submit to the Attorney-General their case I would also ask the Minister to submit our case to the Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, probably, as much to say on this debate as in previous years.  I rise to-night for the purpose of making a few very brief remarks and for the purpose of making known to the new Minister for Justice some matters which I believe are of very great importance and to which he should give sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Maguire, in his address to the House, certainly contributed a great deal of common sense.  He made a reference to the question of driving licences.  I believe that sooner or later the Minister for Justice will certainly have to take some steps in regard to the issue of driving licences.  Certainly it is an appalling state of affairs to say that any man outside a lunatic asylum can walk into the county council office and on payment of the prescribed fee take out a driving licence despite the fact that he may have no knowledge whatever of driving any lorry, motorcar or whatever he may be going to drive.  I think very serious steps should be taken with regard to people driving motor-cars under the influence of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were a justice and a case came before me of a man driving a car under the influence of drink I would stop at nothing short of the largest term of imprisonment I could give him.  I think it is a downright disgrace that when so many of these cases are brought into the district, and other courts, that the district and other justices are so lenient.  I would recommend to the Minister for Justice and appeal to him, believing and knowing that he has no functions in the court, that he should recommend that these drivers of lorries, cars and similar vehicles should be dealt with as severely as possible.  I would go as far as to recommend that no fines should be imposed but a term of imprisonment. These drivers are a danger to <Col N="1625" /> themselves and they are certainly a danger to the community.  I think that many of the accidents which have occurred and most of the accidents that will occur have been brought and will be brought about through carelessness and in most cases because the drivers are under the influence of drink.  For the safety of the general public I believe that the Department of Justice will have to take a very serious view of that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Maguire in the course of his address made a reference to a case of political victimisation that was raised here by my colleague, Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  Surely if Deputy O'Higgins did not avail of the opportunity of raising the matter in this House where could he raise it?  Deputy Maguire probably thought that the proper channel should have been to approach the Minister.  If victimisation were to be carried out at the request of the Minister of the time I believe that a person who approached that Minister would not get a very sympathetic hearing.  For that reason and from my own experience, I believe that the right place to raise such a matter is in this House.  I join with Deputy Tom O'Higgins in making a very strong appeal to the present Minister for Justice to have this complaint investigated.  There is a case of the downright barefaced political victimisation of a Garda officer in my own constituency who was transferred there from Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have been talking about for the last six years.  That is what I and other Independent Deputies have been talking about and surely we are not going to begin ourselves.  In this case there has been, beyond yea or nay, political victimisation where a certain Fianna Fáil <Col N="1626" /> Deputy approached a Garda officer and told him that he would see &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo;&mdash; those were the words he used&mdash;and have him removed to the heart of the country.  Apparently the Deputy saw &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; and was successful, and the officer found himself separated from his wife and family at great inconvenience to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not endeavouring to influence our own Minister, but in the interests of fair play and on merit, I am asking him to examine the conditions under which this officer was transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it necessary to raise it in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  That is what I am elected for.  I believe in the case of any Deputy with a genuine grievance that that is what he is elected to this House for.  I do not know this officer; the officer never approached me on it, but I am very well aware of the facts that led to his transfer under very shady political manoeuvr-ing. I know that in the County Dublin where this Garda officer was this particular Deputy would assemble his friends on a Sunday in the broad daylight, walk straight into a licensed premises and crack his fingers at the Garda and say: &ldquo;What can you say? If you open your beak about it I will see that you are transferred.&rdquo;  These are the threats the Deputy used, not in one case, but in several cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the last Government, Garda officers were afraid to carry out their duties.  They were afraid to walk into a licensed premises after hours and capture thereon a member of a Fianna Fáil cumann who was drinking there. I have known many cases even in my own constituency where Garda officers were afraid to carry out their duty because of the intervention of the Minister for Justice and Fianna Fáil Deputies. That is something that must stop. We have as good men in the Garda to-day as ever we had.  I believe that we have one of the finest police forces in the world.  It is most regrettable, therefore, that these men could not <Col N="1627" /> carry out their duties without interference. It is disgraceful and appalling. Where you have an officer of this State who swears to be obedient to the regulations and carry out his duties impartially, it is wrong that there should be any interference to prevent him carrying out his duties in a straightforward and honest manner.</P>
    <P>The case that Deputy O'Higgins referred to is open for any investigation. I am sure the Minister for Justice will have data on the files concerning this case, but he will not have on the files the private conversations that took place in this House between the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, and the Deputy who was responsible for the removal of this Garda officer. I am not hurling wild charges.  I am stating facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point I want to say that he is not stating facts.  I rely on the Minister to be honest about this matter, and I believe he will be when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <P>Furthermore, it is the duty of a Deputy to guide a Minister as far as possible.  I believe that in the past we have had several cases similar to the case that Deputy O'Higgins referred to.  I join with Deputy O'Higgins in making an appeal that this Garda officer be transferred back to his former station in County Dublin in order that he may join his family, because sheer political victimisation was responsible for his removal. Strange things have been carried on in the past.  Very strange and shady things have been done so far as the administration of the Department of Justice was concerned.

      <P>After making repeated applications for permission to visit the prison the Minister refused me permission and the reason that he gave in this House this time 12 months was that I was too young and that he would permit me to visit the prison when I grew up.

Another reason that the former Minister for Justice gave for refusing to allow me to inspect the prison was that he believed that if Deputy Flanagan was allowed to visit the prison he would not give a true account of what he saw.  These words are recorded in the Official Reports of this House&mdash;that the Minister for Justice would not believe any statement that I might make after visiting the prison.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to let Deputy Boland and this House see that I am prepared to speak with an open mind on what I saw within the four walls <Col N="1632" /> of Portlaoighise Prison, which I am quite entitled to do.  When the present Minister for Justice permitted me to go in I was met by the Governor and was asked what part or what place in the prison I would like to see and was told that I could inspect any part I wished.  I inspected the prison and, as a result of my inspection from stem to stern of the prison, it has gone up 100 per cent. in my estimation.  I found the prisoners spotlessly clean.</P>
      <P>I was given to understand that every prisoner must take his weekly bath, that the conditions as far as the health of the prisoners is concerned were excellent. I asked to see the cookhouse. I saw the food being prepared for the prisoners and, while they had not the same menu as would be produced in the Gresham or the Shelbourne Hotels, it was an excellent menu.  There was plenty to eat for all the prisoners. There seemed to be a very good supply of butter and a supply of jam was available for all prisoners.  I was given to understand that in recent months conditions have improved considerably.</P>
      <P>May I say, in order that it may be placed on the records of the House, that we made many an appeal to the deaf ear of the former Minister for Justice for the release of the political prisoners?  We on this side of the House thank God to-day that there are no political prisoners in Portlaoighise Jail, thanks to the Minister for Justice and to the Government.  We have kept our promise.  The men that we have been speaking about and fighting about in the past were locked up in that prison by the last and the past Government because of their political views and outlook.  To-day, thank God, there is no man bound in chains or no man kept to stare at the dreary grey walls of a prison cell under this Government. Members of the House should express their appreciation to the Minister for Justice, to the Taoiseach and to the Government in general for the release of the political prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Year after year, came appeals from various Deputies for the release of these men.  At last, we see them free men and they can take their place to-day with other citizens as free men. The men who kept them in chains and <Col N="1633" /> behind locks are meeting in groups, in despair, lamenting how they lost their power and lost the grip they had in the country.  I am very proud I lived to see the day these men are free.  I am glad that the Government have seen fit at last to comply with the wishes of Deputies and others, organisations and parties sympathetic to the release of those political prisoners.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand, as a result of inquiries I made in the prison, that the prisoners are now not locked up until 7.30 whereas under the former regulations it was 4.30.  I took it on myself to question various prisoners and to ask them were they properly and well treated, properly fed and well fed.  I did not get one complaint.  I questioned them with the Governor and without the Governor.  I asked to go into the cells to see the beds.  I picked out what cell I liked and had it opened. The beds were second to none.</P>
    <P>There were five blankets on one bed. Those blankets were not used but I counted five blankets allocated to each cell.  The cells were airy and are washed regularly and spotlessly clean. Each of the prisoners could smoke freely all he possibly could get to smoke.  I found also that the prison farm was worked to its fullest productive capacity.  It is a credit to the management of the institution.  Some of the produce is sold at a profit.  I walked through the farm and can safely say that the manner in which it is worked is a credit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully recommend to the Minister for Justice that, instead of being locked up at 7.30&mdash;although I grant that that is a considerable relief to being locked up at 4.30 under the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;that some system of useful work be adopted for the men from 7.30, say, until 10.30.  I believe in view of the fact that many of these convicts cannot read and as they are locked up in their cells at 7.30 at night, they must find it very hard to put in their time and, therefore, I suggest that some useful work should be provided within the prison for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Corish wishes to make a skit on the conditions in that prison he is free to do so.  I am giving the House a true picture of the conditions within the prison as I saw them.  Deputy Boland said that I would not do that.  I think it would have been dishonest of me, so far as the present Minister for Justice and the prison staff are concerned, if I did not tell exactly what I saw.  I believe that the conditions within the prison have considerably improved and from inquiries that I have made that they have improved in other prisons.  I suggest to the Minister that the present type of uniforms supplied to prison warders is unsuitable and that a brighter and more attractive type should be supplied.  The present tunics are of the old-fashioned type.  I am sure the Minister will go into that and see that a more modern type of uniform is supplied with an open-neck shirt and tie.  I think that it is only right that I should strongly recommend that on behalf of those people.  I was very pleased to see the billiard rooms and the recreation rooms that are provided within the prison. Everything that could possibly be provided in the outside world is provided within the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was only one part of my visit to the prison that gave me thought for grave and serious consideration.  I do not propose to elaborate on it but I do ask the Minister to lose no time in considering the question of having the remains of the two men who were shot within the prison removed to their native places.  I asked the Governor if I could see their graves.  Accompanied by the Minister for Health I was brought to the spot where these men are buried.  When I looked at the graves I felt that I was ashamed to be an Irishman.  It was unchristian. They are buried in the open yard in flattened out graves with a stone cover and with the end of a galvanised bucket to mark the grave of one of those men.  It was kicked aside for the <Col N="1635" /> purpose of showing the Minister and myself where the bodies of these men lie.  Now I am sure the Minister for Health will tell the Minister for Justice what he saw when he asked to see the graves left there in the open yard for convicts to trample and walk on.  I will say no more.  I could say quite a lot.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make arrangements for the removal of the remains of those two men to their home cemeteries and have them buried in consecrated ground.  I am doing so as a Deputy, as a Christian and as a Catholic, and I trust that the words that I have used in this House to-night, as far as the remains of those two Irishmen that were murdered by the past Government are concerned, that their remains will rest in their own native graveyards.  It was the only part of my visit to Portlaoighise Prison that was marked with sorrow and regret as far as I was concerned.  I ask the Minister to consider most sympathetically the plea that I am making on my own behalf for the removal of the remains of these two men.  I will say no more on that at the moment for several other reasons.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that within recent months an officer in the Department of Justice has been appointed as an inspector of prisons.  I think it is not this year or last year that such an inspector should have been appointed.  There always should have been an inspector of prisons.  I am open to correction by the Minister as to whether or not there always was an inspector, but during the time of the Fianna Fáil Government I never heard of such an officer as an inspector of prisons.</P>
    <P>I believe that if such an officer does his job conditions will be made better and brighter for those who are unfortunate enough to be locked up within the gates of those prisons.  I believe that, as a result of the making of such an appointment, several improvements have been carried out in Portlaoighise and in other prisons as well.  Such an officer can be very useful. I believe his functions are such that he can arrive at a prison unexpectedly <Col N="1636" /> and question prisoners as to their complaints, question attendants and question all those with any authority within the prison.  I hope that such an officer will always be in existence.  It will mean a betterment of prison conditions.  I want to pay a very high tribute to the Minister that was responsible for the appointment of an inspector of prisons.  It was an appointment that was long overdue, and I hope that the system will always prevail so that we will have an independent inspector of prisons to watch over and look after the conditions that prevail within the walls of a prison.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in order to take their minds off the fact that they are convicts or prisoners, games should be provided for those who are in prison.  I believe that inter-matches in hurling or football should be arranged between a team from the prison and a team from the town on the prison grounds.  If such attractions were provided it would certainly help to fit those men to take their place amongst the community when the term of imprisonment had expired and I am sure that is the real aim of those responsible for the administration of prisons&mdash;to try and help those people so that they may be able to take their place amongst all the citizens when they are released from prison.  I hope the Minister will be able to arrange that.  It would also help to keep those men fit.  Many of those men in the prisons are quite young and in order to keep them physically fit it is necessary that they should have as much exercise as possible.  I ask the Minister, where it is possible, to encourage the establishment of football, hurling or other games amongst the prisoners.  It would help to keep them fit and keep them in touch with the outside world if there were inter-matches between town teams and a prison team. If they are long-term prisoners that would make it easy and convenient for them to take their place amongst the community when they are released.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that Deputy Boland is satisfied to-night that I have given this House a true account of what I have seen in Portlaoighise Prison.  I can assure you, Sir, and Deputy Boland, that if I had been admitted <Col N="1637" /> four or five years ago to Portlaoighise Prison I would have given as true an account them as I have given in this House to-night.  If Deputy Boland is not prepared to accept my word for it there is nothing I can do about it.  I went as far as to ask the Governor if I could see a cell known as &ldquo;The Digger&rdquo; that was so much under review in debates in this House in connection with the treatment of political prisoners.  At my request the Governor escorted the Minister for Health and myself to that cell which is now unoccupied and clamped up with turf.  I saw every part of the prison I asked to see.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of saying to the Minister for Justice, through you, Sir, how much I appreciated the kindness of the Governor and his staff in showing me any part of the prison I desired to inspect.  May I pay tribute to the way in which the grounds are kept, and the cleanliness and the healthy spirit which prevails in that prison?  It has gone up 100 per cent in my estimation since I carried out that tour.  If I did not say so I would be dishonest to the House, to the Governor and the staff of that institution, and to myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a reference to the question of the recent escapes from Mountjoy Prison?  The only remark I want to make on that subject is that a great deal of public uneasiness has been created.  I recommend that the Minister for Justice hold an inquiry as to how these escapes took place.  I believe such an inquiry is necessary.  The Minister should be equipped with whatever information is possible to satisfy himself that there was nothing whatever behind these escapes.  I am not throwing any blame on the Governor or the staff of the prison&mdash;I want to make that quite clear&mdash;but I believe that this is a case where an inquiry should be held.  I believe the Minister will make some reference to it in his reply.  I feel sure that an inquiry of that nature would serve a very useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy S. Collins, I think, referred to political influence in the matter of judicial appointments.  Again, in the <Col N="1638" /> case of the last Government, the machine was actively at work in the matter of political appointments even to the judiciary.  Within the past 12 months I have, in this House, directed the attention of the previous Minister for Justice to the fact that a Fianna Fáil urban councillor was appointed an acting district justice any time he wished.  I am not questioning that man's ability or his standing in law but I say that there were other men equally good as he available but that the rating that made it possible for him to qualify completely for his appointment as an acting district justice was the fact that he was a Fianna Fáil councillor not too far from the City of Dublin, well known in political circles, who did not deny that it was on account of his political affiliations that he was appointed acting district justice.  I hope I shall not have to rise from this side of the House to speak about political appointments.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice can look back on his own past if he wants to know why he is sitting on that side of the House to-night.  He can see clearly that it was because of political jobbery.  It was bad enough for the ex-Minister's own Party to be going down but it was a dreadful thing to endeavour to pull the judiciary of the country down with them.  I believe it is all for the best, and good for law and order and clean and efficient administration, that men such as Deputy Boland and his colleagues are sitting on the Opposition Benches to-night, and may God keep them there.</P>
    <P>May I make a reference to Daingean Reformatory and ask the Minister for Justice to make an inquiry with regard to the conditions of the employees there?  I understand that they are not being very well treated as far as a fair wage is concerned.  I do not know what power or jurisdiction the Minister may have in the matter, but I would ask him to make special inquiries and to look into the matter himself in regard to the rates of pay and the hours of work of the night men and the other officers who work in Daingean Reformatory. The reformatory in question is conducted by the Oblate Fathers, but I believe the Minister for Justice is responsible for the appointment of <Col N="1639" /> staff there and for their rates of remuneration.</P>
    <P>Now for the Garda Síochána. Deputies who happen to be members of local authorities, especially in urban areas, realise the grievance married members of the Garda Síochána have in regard to housing accommodation. The question of housing for the Garda Síochána is of very great importance. The Minister for Justice should consult with the Minister for Finance and with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Mr. Donnellan, about getting the Board of Works to provide a special set of houses in every town for the members of the Garda Síochána.  Every town where there is a Garda station with a sergeant and six or eight men should have at least six houses specially built by the Board of Works for the members of the force.  They will then have no trouble in this matter and the members of local authorities will not have to be endeavouring to provide members of <Col N="1640" /> the Garda Síochána with housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I believe that this question will be tackled and that it is under consideration by the Government.  The quicker action is taken in that respect the better.  I know that in my constituency it has reached the stage where Gardaí are living in unhealthy houses with bad sanitary accommodation and sometimes even in old hovels.  I have known cases of Gardaí who were glad to accept houses even though they had been condemned by the county medical officer of health.  I could give the Minister umpteen instances of Gardaí who are living in those condemned hovels.  A Garda has to live up to a certain standard.  He is respected by all and everyone.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.</P>
    <P>Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 24th June, 1948.</P>
