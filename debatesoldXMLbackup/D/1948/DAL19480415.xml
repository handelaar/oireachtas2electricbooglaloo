      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it was with his approval or consent that a member of the Government recently attended a commemoration ceremony at which, according to a newspaper report, an appeal was made for support of an illegal organisation, and if he will state what is the Government's policy on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The attendance of a member of the Government at a public function does not require the approval or consent of the Taoiseach and no question of giving or withholding such approval or consent arises. A Minister who attends a function is not responsible for any statements that may be made by other persons present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if at this particular commemoration an address is made in which recruits are asked for an illegal organisation, is not the presence of a Minister tantamount to helping that appeal and does it not lend countenance to it?  Are we to take it that that is to be tolerated and that the question of collective responsibility will not arise in such a matter as that?</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Boland's query, I would like to recall to his attention the fact that the particular Minister to whom he refers attended this function for the last 25 years prior to his becoming a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government has yet adopted the new method for selecting county registrars and sheriffs in accordance with the statement issued on 1st March, 1948, and, if so, if he will give particulars of this method of selection, and if he will state to what classes of State officials it is intended to apply; and if he will further state whether the recent appointments of Circuit Court judge and State solicitor were made in accordance with this new method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement referred to by the Deputy referred only to the appointment of sheriff for the County Borough of Cork.  Steps are being taken, in accordance with that statement, to invite applications for the post by public advertisement and to establish machinery to ensure that the best qualified applicant will be appointed. It is proposed to have the qualifications, experience and suitability of candidates investigated by an <Col N="777" /> interview board whose report will be submitted to the Government.</P>
      <P>No decision has been taken as to whether this procedure will apply to any other classes of State officials.  It was not adopted in connection with the recent appointments of a Circuit Court judge and State solicitors.  The appointment of a Circuit Court judge was made, in accordance with the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government, and the State solicitors were appointed by the Attorney-General, on whom the responsibility for selecting the best qualified candidates rests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, will the Taoiseach say why it is proposed to adopt this method of appointing sheriffs, of which I think there are only two in the whole country, when it is not proposed to adopt the same method in the case of county registrars?  So far as I know, there are only two sheriffs, one in Cork and one in Dublin.  Why must this method be adopted in the case of one particular office?  I am not objecting to the method, but I want to know the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the information as to why the procedure was adopted.  This post was vacant when the Government took office.  There were large numbers of letters from Fianna Fáil Deputies advocating the interests of various solicitors for this particular job.  We do not want to have anything to do with jobbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell me how many letters there were for the State solicitorship in Tipperary and the post of Circuit Court judge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my belief there were no letters whatever for the Circuit Court judgeship, and I have no information with reference to the State solicitor for Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state (a) the present position in regard to the negotiations which have taken place between the Governments of this State and the United Kingdom on the question of reciprocal arrangements for the payment in each country of unemployment insurance benefits accrued from employment in the other; (b) the major difficulties which still remain unsolved; and (c) when it is hoped that the matter will be successfully completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of the British Ministry of National Insurance and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Labour and National Insurance on the subject of reciprocity in social insurance, including unemployment insurance, took place in Dublin towards the end of November last. The matters which were discussed have since been under examination and it is expected that a further conference will be held at an early date.  The British National Insurance Act, 1946, which enables reciprocal arrangements to be made, will not come into operation until the 5th July, 1948, and any arrangements for reciprocity which may be made will not operate before that date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether representations have been received in his Department from trade union organisations and members of the Bar and of the judiciary, urging the necessity of amending the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, in order to eliminate the defects in that Act, which have become apparent since the Act was passed; and further, whether he will consider introducing legislation to amend that Act so as to provide a fair system of compensation for workmen in keeping with modern views on the rights of workers and the responsibilities of employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to answer Questions 4 to 6, which relate to the Workmen's Compensation Act, together.</P>
      <P>I am having the provisions of this Act examined together with the representations received on the subject.  It is not yet possible to say what action in the matter will be necessary.  I might add for Deputy Hickey's information that there is no provision in the present Act which would enable me to apply the Act by scheme to workmen suffering from any manifestation of pneumoconiosis other than silicosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that within the past 12 months two cases have been before the courts where the doctors are satisfied that men are suffering from this disease, but as it is not a scheduled industrial disease nothing can be done by the courts? That is my reason for pointing out the necessity of extending the schedule of industrial diseases so as to cover pneumoconiosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not take me as being unsympathetic to his representations.  What I am pointing out is that there is no provision under the present Act by which I can extend <Col N="780" /> by scheme, or make any regulations in regard to the disease in which the Deputy is particularly interested and which he wants scheduled as an industrial disease.  I am, however, going to have the matter examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an examination of the Workmen's Compensation Act has been under consideration not merely in connection with the structure of the present Act, but in connection also with a comprehensive scheme of social security.  That examination is proceeding.  The matter which requires to be determined in the first instance is whether the existing Act should be allowed to continue in a new form or whether workers' compensation should be brought within the comprehensive social security scheme.  That is under consideration at the moment and a decision on a point of principle has not been taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) Timothy Joseph Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Five tenders were received in August, 1947, by the Westmeath County Council for the erection of 58 (not 62) houses at Green Road, Mullingar. The tender of Messrs. Kelly and Sons, Mullingar, was the lowest and its acceptance was submitted for sanction. It was found that the provision in the tender for development work amounted <Col N="782" /> to £30,000 approximately, or about one-third of the total contract price, whereas the estimate for this portion of the work was only £8,810.  It was, accordingly, decided to revise the development plans and to invite each of the contractors who had tendered for the original work to submit fresh tenders on the basis of the revised plans and bills of quantities.  Three such tenders were received and on the 16th December, 1947, the lowest, that of Messrs C. Doyle and Sons, Mullingar, was accepted on the advice of the council's responsible technical officer.  On the information before me, I consider that the facts and circumstances were fully examined at the time and that the decision made is not one which could now be properly or usefully reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in order to mitigate, within a fixed period, the gravity of the present housing problem, he will consider the establishment of a National Housing Board, which, acting in co-operation with local authorities, would be charged with the main responsibility for the provision of working-class houses; the board to have definite priority in respect of supplies; powers to acquire sites (including reservation for future use); financial resources at very low interest rates on amounts commensurate with the problem; and, finally, powers to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of labour on the basis of a guaranteed week and continuity of employment for a stated period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since assuming responsibility for the direction of the housing programme, I have had under continuous personal examination all aspects of the housing problem.  In the course of this I am not overlooking the desirability of establishing a special board to assist me in tackling the problem, particularly in its bearing on Dublin City.  From my initial examination of the problem I can assure the Deputy that its magnitude and severity have only confirmed my view that priority in respect of supplies of all kinds must be conceded to local authority housing.  As an initial step towards the expedition of progress I am seeking the co-operation of local authorities and their responsible officials by personal contact and I intend to continue this line of policy with a view to accelerating progress generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> So far as procedure is concerned I am keenly aware of the necessity for expediting the arrangements for the acquisition of land and the provision of adequate financial resources and I am seeking the co-operation of all concerned towards removing every obstacle arising under these headings. The provision of a continuous supply of labour coupled with continuity of employment for the workers concerned is a matter which I regard as of vital importance and which I hope to achieve with the good-will of the interests involved.  Generally it may be taken that the overriding consideration in my mind in my approach to the problem is that of ensuring the erection of houses at the greatest possible speed and so far as I am concerned any obstacles which tend to impede this work will be set aside as soon as ever possible.</P>

A scheme for the provision of about 1,000 cottages is at present in progress.  As regards houses for newly-weds in Dublin City, it would not be possible at this stage to state when all eligible applicants for houses will be accommodated.

This rule is, I understand, to be the subject of discussion between the Federation of Rural Workers and the council's officers.  I am also informed that excessive loads are not demanded of men on stonecrushing work and that rubber boots and protective clothing are supplied where necessary.  Where conditions of service give cause for complaint it would be of advantage if the union made representations locally.  The Minister's intervention should be necessary only in cases in which a satisfactory settlement could not be reached between the parties immediately concerned.</P>

      <P>The roads to which the Deputy refers are tracks along the banks of the Grand Canal in County Kildare.  They are not public roads, and the county council has no power to incur expenditure on their maintenance. Under an agreement made in 1918 with the Grand Canal Company the county council maintained certain of these canal tracks.  Subsequently the agreement was found to be invalid and the expenditure on maintenance illegal.  In 1934 the council applied to the Minister for authority to cease maintaining part of the tracks as they had been doing.  As the tracks were not public roads they needed no authority to abandon them.  It is not proposed to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

His reasons for the decision are presumably to be found by an examination of the White Paper published by the Department (P. No. 7146).

      <P>In view of the shortage of accommodation for maternity cases in Cork City, the provision of a maternity block in the new regional hospital, which will have priority in construction, is at present under discussion with the local authority.  If the proposal is approved it will be the responsibility of the local authority to expedite the work.  In order to relieve temporarily the present shortage of maternity accommodation in Cork City, a scheme has been approved for the provision of approximately 30 additional maternity beds in Cork County Home and Hospital, and the local authority have appointed an architect to prepare the necessary plans.</P>

      <P>In the confident hope that, under God's providence, the international Communist conspiracy to prevent world recovery and disturb international peace will fail, I do not anticipate any necessity for the employment of 250 inspectors to compel the farmers of Ireland to discharge their ordinary duties as farmers or as Irishmen in the foreseeable future.  As essential supplies of maize, wheat, fertilisers and machinery become available through the princely generosity of our American friends under the Marshall Plan, I know that our agricultural output will embark on a period of profitable expansion, provided that those who live and work upon the land are permitted once again to call their souls their own.  The tillage inspectors whose services will no longer be required will in some cases revert to their previous occupations in the Irish Land Commission or other Department from which they are at present seconded to my Department, in others their services will be eagerly sought and well rewarded in the expansion of agricultural output which will develop over the next five years.  If any of their number should find difficulty in securing suitable employment, it will be the earnest concern of my Department to assist in every possible way in placing them in suitable positions where their special qualifications can be fully availed of.  I take this opportunity of saying that, with a possible rare exception, these temporary officers of my Department have served the State loyally and efficiently, and that such strictures as may have been passed upon them should be clearly understood to have attached to the duties prescribed by Oireachtas <Col N="805" /> Éireann for performance by them, and not to the inspectors individually, who ordinarily discharged the often distasteful obligations of their positions with an uncomplaining sense of duty which is the proud hallmark of the Civil Service which this country is so exceptionally fortunate in having to serve her.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) the manner in which home-made butter was disposed of in 1947; (b) the amount of home-made butter sold to registered buyers in creamery areas; (c) whether such butter was produced, packed and transported under the direction of inspectors of his Department; (d) whether such butter was tested or analysed by officials of his Department, and, if so, with what result; and (e) whether any of this butter became unfit for human consumption, and, if so, what amount, and how it was disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The greater part of butter produced on farms in 1947, as in previous years, was consumed there. Surpluses of farm butter are sold (1) locally to shopkeepers and others, (2) to butter factories and other registered persons and (3) at markets to confectioners and others; (b) practically all butter factories and other registered buyers are in creamery areas and the total quantity of farm butter sold to them in 1947 was 43,064 cwts.; (c) and (d)  the Department's inspectors sample butter regularly at butter factories and <Col N="807" /> other registered premises, including public cold stores, and in transit, and the samples are analysed at the Department's butter testing station, Dublin, for water and salt content.</P>
      <P>During 1947 arrangements were made by the Department with registered butter factories to supply the Butter Marketing Committee with non-creamery butter suitable for household use, to supplement the domestic ration. This butter was examined by the Department's inspectors at the factory premises; (e)  the quantity of butter which was found unfit for household use during 1947 was approximately 2,000 cwts.  This butter is, however, quite suitable for industrial purposes. The question of its disposal is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that the officers of my Department and others responsible for superintending the storage of this butter exercised the usual precautions, but that they encountered conditions, in the course of settling a new scheme, with which they had not been familiar in previous years.  I think it right to say that, so far as I have been able to find out to date, a scheme was propounded which depended on honest co-operation by those whom it was intended to benefit. A very small section, and they were not the producers, who were to benefit under the scheme slipped over a quick <Col N="808" /> one.  No ordinary vigilance could have prevented that, but ordinary vigilance in the years to come will effectively prevent the like of that being done again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that arising out of an announcement made last year to the effect that the price of milk supplied to creameries was to be 1/2 per gallon for the summer and 1/6 for winter, without any percentage for butter fat being mentioned, grave dissatisfaction was caused amongst creamery suppliers, who expected that price to be paid for all milk supplied, when one creamery in Cavan paid suppliers on a butter-fat basis and had differences ranging from 10.5d. per gallon to 16.4d. per gallon in the same month; furthermore, whether in the circumstances he will make an announcement clarifying the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement made in April, 1947, guaranteed average prices of 1/2 per gallon during the months May to October and 1/4&mdash;not 1/6&mdash;per gallon during the months November to April in respect of milk supplied to creameries.  In calculating the production allowance payable to creameries regard is had to the wholesale price of butter and the average fat content of the milk supplied to all creameries, which determines the number of gallons required to produce a cwt. of butter.  The differences in milk prices to which the Deputy refers are probably due to the fat content of the milk supplied being much higher in some cases than in others.  It would not be feasible to pay a uniform price for milk irrespective of the fat content. It is, therefore, dependent: (1)  on the butter-fat content of the suppliers' <Col N="809" /> milk; (2)  the efficiency of the creamery management, and (3)  the dimension of the milk supplied to the creamery what price will be payable to each individual supplier for his milk.</P>

The final date then specified for lodgment of applications was 31st May, 1947.  The period was, however, extended to 31st October, 1947, so as to give all farmers who suffered losses of stock an opportunity to apply for these loans.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill dealing with an increased duty on felt hats and caps for men and boys. The purpose of the Bill is to implement the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, 1947, which increased the customs duty on felt hats and caps from the duty effected under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, to a 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> (United Kingdom and Canada preference rate, 50 per cent.), with a minimum duty of 5/7½ per article (United Kingdom and Canada preference, 3/9 per article). For many years prior to 1939 there had been in existence a customs duty on such hats at the flat rate of 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  At the moment the duty is 3/9½, with the full rate 50 per cent. higher in each case.  As it is necessary, Sir, to get this Bill through before the 24th of this month, I propose asking the House to be good enough to allow me to take all stages to-day, as otherwise the Bill will fall through.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned last night, I was dealing with the question of Army strength with a view to substantiating the criticism which I have to offer of the Minister's present proposals.  I may resume my argument by mentioning that during the five years prior to the war, the strength of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve dwindled. During the same period, the Volunteer Force was developed, into which some 15,000 men or more were in the aggregate recruited, but the paper strength of which was maintained generally at approximately 10,000.  The forces, then, nominally available in 1937-38 were 5,000 regulars, 5,000 &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; reservists and 10,000 in the Volunteer Force, making the total Army available 20,000 approximately. All this time, however, the war establishments existing on paper presupposed a much greater strength.  These war establishments were designed to implement the declared defence policy of the State, but the men and equipment available made it impossible to give effect to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1938 two events occurred, which, coupled with the worsening international situation, led to a review of the defence situation and organisation. These events were the handing over of the Ports and the Munich crisis.  An examination thereupon of circumstances of the Army revealed that there was no possibility, having regard to the forces that were available or that were likely to be available, of giving effect to the war establishments that had been envisaged and the Government of the day found it necessary to review the war establishments with a view to having something effective done.  It was decided to have war establishments of approximately 38,000 based on the number of men actually available or estimated to be available and the <Col N="823" /> equipment available rather than upon the requirements dictated by the approved policy.  Deputy Collins last night made the imputation that there had not been a facing of reality. The war establishment with which the war was faced was dictated by the situation that in fact existed and it was rather dictated by that than by what should have been the real requirements for the defence policy. With that war establishment steps were immediately taken to implement them.  The first was to increase the strength of the Regular Army and the second was to reorganise the Volunteer Force in order to make it effective. The Regular Army was increased to 7,500 all ranks and the Volunteer Force reorganisation put under way in 1939 involved a decrease in the paper strength in order to make the paper strength reflect the actual strength. Some success was achieved at the expense of a reduction of the paper strength so that, notwithstanding the increase in the Regular Army, which was in the region of a couple of thousand, the corresponding decrease in the Volunteer Force resulted in leaving the net available strength of 20,000 which existed previously. Undoubtedly, if the war had been deferred for a few years longer the programme then envisaged would have built up the available forces to 40,000, or to the then envisaged war establishment. But that was not to be.  In September, 1939, when these reorganisations were under way and while efforts were being made to get equipment&mdash;I will deal with equipment later&mdash;war officially broke out.  With the outbreak of war, the total forces of the State were mobilised.  The position seems to have been that we mobilised, besides the 7,500 regulars that we had, approximately 4,500 A and B Reservists and approximately 7,000 Volunteer Force personnel, giving a total army mobilised in September, 1939, if these figures are correct, in the region of 19,000, all ranks.  That, you will note, with the 15 years of defence experimentation behind it, was approximately 50 per cent. of a war establishment dictated <Col N="824" /> by the hard facts of the situation rather than by the requirements of defence as laid down in the policy accepted.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, however, the acute phase of the war in Western Europe did not develop at that time and there was a certain amount of time for coping with the chaos which resulted from that mobilisation.  It was to some extent chaotic due to the fact that there was an inadequate regular cadre to handle even the reserve forces that were then available.  The whole root of the trouble lay in our inadequate conception, on all sides of the House, of the defence force which could cater for mobilisation in time of crisis.</P>
    <P>After that, because of other factors that were not foreseen or not foreseen sufficiently clearly&mdash;dislocation of civilian employment, exemptions, and so forth&mdash;the Army strength decreased during the phoney war period in the autumn of 1939 and the early winter and spring of 1940.  That mobilised force decreased so that when it came to the crisis of 1940 there was available a force of about 14,000, or perhaps a little less, upon which to build and to meet the crisis which then faced this country in common with other countries in Western Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not have been or there may have been. France was relatively badly prepared. Britain had got slightly more rapidly ahead than France and was facing up to war.  But we are now dealing with our own problem here, and I do not want to chase a red herring in that regard, if the Deputy does not mind. The position, therefore, was&mdash;and this should be noted&mdash;I stressed it in last year's debates, either on the Estimates or the Defence Forces Bill and it is a <Col N="825" /> point of vital importance in considering Army strengths&mdash;that you had six months in which to increase your regular Army cadre to approximately 14,000 men.  The A Reserve was fairly well trained, but even they took a few months to get accustomed and to be absorbed into the machine.  The Volunteer reserve, which was not anything like as accustomed to taking its place as a whole-time military organisation, took considerably longer.  But there were six months of grace, which may never again be afforded to this country in such a time of crisis, available to us on that occasion, during which period those elements of the reserve were so assimilated with the elements of the regular Army that you could say that when the crisis of 1940 broke upon us you had a regular Army of approximately 14,000 all ranks.  It was on that strength, not on your peace-time cadre, that you built the emergency Army.</P>
      <P>In regard to that I will give just a few instances.  Holding office in the battalions and in the training centres, holding offices that were essential key points in the mobilisation of 1940 were officers of the reserve, of all categories. There are at least two ex-officers in this House who held appointments at that time which would not be suitable appointments for an officer of the reserve to assume on the day after the day on which he was called in.  In the regimental depot in Portobello Barracks alone, the Dublin focus for building the emergency Army, the officer commanding the depôt and a large percentage of the company commanders in that depôt charged with the training and organisation of emergency volunteers and leaders and sending them out to units, and so forth, were reserve officers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I am making is that you mobilised in 1940 your emergency Army on about a strength of 14,000 and that was hardly adequate because, as pointed out already in previous debates&mdash;the facts are very easily ascertainable; the Minister will have all the information available to him now&mdash;it was barely and <Col N="826" /> inadequately done.  After the local security requirements were met, such as garrison and essential protection duties, there were practically no forces left available in the mobile sense, even to deal with such things as threatened diversionary attacks much less anything in the nature of a serious effort. And that during a time when it was very possible that an invasion of England would take place from the Continent. I think it is only common sense to say that had there been any onslaught on England at that time we, geographically placed as we are, could not have escaped the maelstrom.</P>
      <P>Last night and to-day you have had in brief the history of our strength experience before the war.  The factors which governed us were, first of all, the financial problem, the problem of providing the finance for maintaining the force; secondly, there was the problem of dealing with people who said that you could defer such commitments until a later stage&mdash;and there were many people who thought that way. These will be factors at the present moment, and the Minister for Defence of the day will always find it difficult to deal with these factors.  Now, however, in the light of events, we must admit that if we spend money on defence at all, it is only reasonable to spend a sum that will support a defence force which will meet your requirements when it is needed.  If it does not meet the requirements when it is needed, you have been throwing money down the drain.  Even if you are prepared to spend, you must be prepared to develop your forces sufficiently in advance.  There is often a problem of balance but you cannot leave it until the last moment, as the experiences of that time prove.  There must be a continuing provision, especially for the cadre which will support the force which you visualise.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go in further detail into some of the arguments which I have developed.  In Volume 104 of the Official Debates at column 704, continuing, and in Volume 105, column 107, continuing, a certain number of these points will be found developed in greater detail.  Also Volume 100, column 634.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The net result of all this was that, after careful consideration of the strength situation in the past, with due regard&mdash;and the Minister knows that his staffs are responsible staffs&mdash;to all the factors, the General Staff found that it could not recommend the maintenance of a force less than 12,500 effectives&mdash;and that excludes the Construction Corps and the Equitation School, which do not properly come into the military picture.  With due regard to the financial and other commitments, that basic figure is arrived at, on the basis that if you go below it you are only playing and the money you spend on the Army thereafter runs the risk of being lost; in other words, the defence insurance policy which you propose to support cannot be supported by the premium that is to be paid for it on any lesser basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the 12,000 decided by the General Staff or was it decided by the Minister for Finance? I would like that point to be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would let me, I will deal with that angle afterwards.  I think I am accurately stating the position of the last Government when I say that that figure was recommended by the General Staff as a basic minimum and that the Government, anxious and all as it was &mdash;and remember that the previous Government was as anxious as this Government is to economise on such a head, the emergency having passed&mdash; having regard to the incontrovertible arguments put up on the basis of the historical experience gained in the years which I have traced, felt, as did also the Minister of the day, that a decision on a force of lesser numbers would not be warranted.  Consequently, unpopular in some senses as such a measure might be, it was decided to go forward and to ask for a permanent force of that strength. That is the genesis of that figure and it is for that reason that I feel it is a mistake now for us to revert to a lower figure and run the risk of repeating an experience which we had in the past and from which we can learn very useful <Col N="828" /> lessons.  It would be a mistake to run the risk of finding ourselves in the same position, particularly as the providential features of the last war, its opening phases, may never repeat themselves for us.  I feel I cannot stress that point too much.</P>
      <P>The present Minister, if I understand him aright, proposes to take the strength as it is&mdash;approximately 8,500&mdash; and not to provide for the greater strength.  We know nothing of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would excuse me, I think it would be unfair to let him develop an extensive argument on a wrong foundation.  As I followed him, I think he is under the impression that the Book of Estimates provides for an Army of 12,500.  It provides for 9,358&mdash;exactly 764 all ranks more than I am looking for.  At the end of the page the Deputy will find &ldquo;Deduction for over-estimation,&rdquo; so it is some few thousand less than 12,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Minister for that, but I was not making a mistake.  I do not know if it is still the aim to maintain a force of 12,500 or not.  It was the aim of the last Government to try to reach and stabilise at that figure.  I do not know whether the present Government intends to keep to that.  The position of the last Government, in regard to Estimates, was that the target or basis was 12,500 and the policy was to recruit up to that, if possible.  It was found&mdash;understandably&mdash;that after the emergency the full strength was not forthcoming, but it was hoped to build up further, and provision was made in the original Estimate for what I might call a foreseeable proportion of the strength which might be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That figure allowed for continued recruitment and I think it should.  What the Minister is doing, in providing for 8,500 or thereabouts, is providing actually a little less than the strength at the beginning of the year; in other words, he is providing for a strength estimated on wastage, without making provision for recruiting or going on to <Col N="829" /> the building of the minimum cadre visualised by the General Staff and by his predecessors.  That I think is a mistake, for two reasons.  Even at this stage, we should try to build towards the General Staff minimum.  We can expect that, as we recede further from the last crisis, the recruiting will improve to some extent.  It is desirable at all times to keep up the habit of recruiting to your Army. There is something in such a habit and you want, if possible, to keep the proper age categories flowing in.  That is the first reason.  In regard to the reserve, what corresponds in the first line reserve, to the old &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve, its strength depends on the outflow from the regular Army.  In any provision which stops recruiting, you are introducing a hiatus or interruption in the flow into the reserve&mdash;which will manifest itself in an unbalancing of age groups and it will certainly react on strength.  I think it is not good to limit your recruiting, especially when we are so much below the minimum&mdash;and I think it was preferable to provide for the greater number.</P>
    <P>After all, in regard to economy, what you pay will be paid on the actual numbers you have.  The only difference in regard to money, in what the present Minister proposes and what his predecessor proposed&mdash;notwithstanding the sum appearing in the Estimate&mdash;will be the difference between the number recruited and wastage.  Your net gain is the only sum that will be chargeable. It is possible that the total number provided for may not have been achieved in the year on the original Estimate.  It is also certain, however, that some recruits would be got.  The sum of money involved would not be so extravagant as to preclude you from having the benefit of those recruits.  In a nutshell, I would object to this provision in so far as it tends to stabilise the Defence Forces at a strength which is below the minimum required for the implementation of an agreed policy.  I object also because it will have its reaction on the reserve, part of which is derived from the regular forces.</P>
    <P>Finally, to deal with something suggested by Deputy Cowan.  The experience with the Department of Finance in the past is that, when a <Col N="830" /> certain set of facts becomes habitual it becomes not only the <i>de facto</i> situation, but also, as far as the Department of Finance is concerned, the <i>de jure</i> situation.  In other words, I see the Minister putting himself in the position that, even though he is accommodating the Department of Finance to-day by his agreement to this figure, he may find in the future if he wants to increase his strength to the minimum of 12,500, perhaps under some new situation, the fact that it has been maintained at a factual level lower in previous years will then be used as the overriding argument against him.  The principle will have been established, and that principle will be alleged to have been sufficient. I think that is a fair lesson to learn from the financial situation of the Army of the past.  As a matter of tactics, even for the Minister in his own Department, I would go so far as to say that it is a mistake for estimate purposes to come down off a basic minimum which has been agreed to. Let the actual finances of the situation work themselves out as they may, but you should never surrender your right to achieve the minimum strength that would justify the existence of your forces.  Those, in general terms, are the objections.</P>
    <P>Now let me take, not in any spirit of carping criticism of what the Minister has said, but again in the light of the lessons to be learned from our history, some of the aspirations of the Minister in presenting this Estimate.  He reiterated something that was first said by a Minister for Defence in 1926; perhaps it has been stated by every succeeding Minister for Defence since, but, for reasons I shall give, it is not quite accurate, or rather not realisable.  That statement was that the aim would be to have a small, highly-trained army in which every officer, N.C.O. and man should be qualified to fill higher vacancies and that this cadre of, so to speak, leader material would be a cadre to expand upon.  Everyone will agree that that is a very proper attitude.  It is a very good thing that the Minister has decided, even when he is considering his reductions, to retain the officer <Col N="831" /> and N.C.O. establishment without reduction.</P>
    <P>But the lessons of the past are these: Firstly, in the Army recruited in that way, it is inevitable that the standard of character and education on the average will be such that not all will be capable of the advancement visualised in the principle enunciated by the Minister and his predecessors. In other words, inevitably in the Army there will be a certain number of men and N.C.O.s and possibly one or two of the officer category&mdash;that is unlikely now, because I think the present officer corps will meet requirements&mdash; who will not be up to the standard. Among the N.C.O.s and men you will find some excellent individuals who because of deficiency in education may not be quite up to the required standard of ability and character, and they will be found not to be quite ready for promotion in the sense the Minister visualised.  No matter how you may manage, only a proportion of your force will be capable of living up to the aspirations of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second factor which will militate against him is one which may have been remedied since I left the Army, but I know it was a serious feature in the pre-war Army, and the Minister, who served as an officer, will also probably know what the situation was. Whether it exists at the moment I do not know, but there was then a pernicious financial arrangement by which the strength of the Army was maintained at a figure from 10 to 16 per cent. below establishment and, coupled with this semi-official attitude of the Department of Finance, which even restricted you in your establishment, there were restrictions on promotion, on the granting of marriage allowances and such things, which prevented the adequate expansion and development of the Defence Forces in the way the Minister visualised.  I do not know whether that difficulty exists, but if it does, I hope the Minister will consult the General Staff and see what a serious obstacle that was to the development of the forces prior to the war and what a serious obstacle such a practice is likely to be in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> The next thing that will defeat the Minister, unless special provision is made to guard against it&mdash;and it defeated aspirations in the past&mdash; formed one of the big factors in the decision of the last Government in arriving at the peace-time strength, and that is the question of guard duties.  Every officer who served in the old Army saw that the regular Army was so small that when it had afforded the training personnel for its own recruits and certain necessary elements of the reserve, even though these were inadequately catered for, the whole time of the soldier and line officer went in a monotonous routine of guard duties and this prevented the Army from developing as an efficient Army. The interminable routine of guard and garrison duties prevented any organised training taking place.  Indeed, it was a wonder to me how it did not break the morale of the officers and men of that Army.  The greatest tribute that can be paid to the members of the old Army is that when it came to 1940 they could bob up fresh and willing in spite of the demoralising influences of such a régime in the past, a régime that went back to 1925.  We completely under-estimated the burden that guard duties can be on the Army. These guard duties when imposed on a force of insufficient strength will prevent that force achieving any degree of efficiency, much less training a reserve and providing the expandable cadre for that reserve.  The position was so bad that the regular units of the old peace-time Army could never do their field training properly.</P>
    <P>Right from the time of Homer, the time when the Trojan Horse motif appears in war, the outbreak of an emergency situation poses internal security problems.  The history of war from the Trojan time down to the invasion of the Netherlands provides ample instances for consideration. Hence, when a crisis breaks upon you the force you had envisaged as being available for expanding your Army tends to find itself absorbed in the increased garrison and protection duties made necessary by the new situation. In 1939 when the Army mobilised not only was a large percentage of the <Col N="833" /> regular troops tied down to such guard duties but some part of the reserve was utilised for the same purpose.  That is particularly true of the so-called &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; war period.  I remember in Portobello Barracks such units as the Second Regulars and the Seventh Battalion, which was a reserve unit, being literally unmanned by guards of 48 hours on and 24 off.  The records are there.  The facts are incontrovertible. Such a situation could never be conducive to the building up of a defence force for the purposes of implementing the defence policy upon which we are all agreed.  In the preemergency period all these factors militated against the Minister's ambition to develop a highly trained nucleus upon which to expand subsequently. Even if one succeeds in surmounting, in peace-time, obstacles which I have enumerated, on mobilisation, the whole regular force will not be available as a cadre to expand upon.  Some regular units must inevitably as such be disposed in protection and security duties leaving only a fraction to form the skeleton upon which the mobilised reserves can be embodied.</P>
    <P>It is common sense that the technical factor assumes a very large proportion in the development and operation of a modern army.  You have the training of a signal corps, the training of engineers, the training of specialised artillery, the training of specialised mechanical troops, the air-corps and so on.  All these require a high degree of technical skill and organisation.  Not only do they require a high degree of technical skill on the part of the individuals but they require a high degree of what I describe as collective technical skill and collective technical efficiency. Such skill and efficiency can only be ahieved by experience and presupposes adequate peace establishments.</P>
    <P>All the arguments I advance now demolish some of the opinions held by some people on all sides of this House prior to the late war.  There were people who believed that one could wait until hostilities were imminent in order to develop our Defence Force. The lessons of 1940 prove the fallacy of that argument.  It is in time of <Col N="834" /> peace that one must build one's foundation. It is in time of peace that one must establish the nucleus upon which to build up an efficient Army for the future.  You must provide the country with an Army of sufficient strength to provide for guard duties without taking away the personnel essential for the building up of an efficient Army to be mobilised should war break out. Provision must be made for all these things.  Over and above that you must overcome the administrative difficulties which in the past militated against the development of the Army.  For that reason I maintain that we should adhere to the target of a specific minimum force not less than that recommended by a competent General Staff. We will have to have regard to the actual position, but we must recruit up to the limit, because otherwise we run the risk of defeating our object.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that there was a strength of 8,500.  His reserve is only 5,760.  That is the first-line reserve.  He has now available approximately 14,260 first line.  In other words, excluding Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, you are now in the same position in which you were in 1940.  In May, 1940, a further 5,000 first line were available, namely those exempted since the previous autumn. In fact, the position is somewhat worse.  Even if you were given the necessary period for incorporating that 5,760 reservist Army you would then be left with a force not appreciably greater than the force which proved inadequate for mobilisation in 1940.  As against that you have 48,000 in Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  I am not sufficiently conversant with their terms of service, and I have made no comparison between that and the terms of service of the Volunteers, but they are not in the same category as the first-line reserve and can never be considered as such.  They would take just as long to incorporate into the Army as the Volunteers took in 1940.  It was only in 1941 that the Defence Forces of this country can be said to have been adequately organised.  That means that if we were to continue on the present basis our position in the future <Col N="835" /> might be worse than that in which we found ourselves in 1940, plus the added disadvantages of finding ourselves without the benefits of factors which came to our aid most opportunely during the late war.  I will leave the strengths at that.  Perhaps I have laboured it to some extent, but I have only argued as an officer of the Defence Forces who knows his facts would argue.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that on paper he had approximately a force of 48,000 in Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  He told us that only 12 per cent. reported for training last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's anxiety in that regard and it may be a good thing to concentrate on the leader material with a view to future development.  We were perhaps too hasty in the past in trying to do the whole job without having made adequate provision for leadership. There is something to be said for the point of view of concentrating on the development of leaders first before taking men in wholesale.  If the figure of 12 per cent. is a low one I would console the Minister by telling him that the result of our experience with the Volunteer force in the past was that one seldom got more than approximately 50 per cent. at annual training.  I doubt if in any volunteer force one will achieve a higher figure than that.  You will achieve a higher figure with what is called the first line reserve.  That used to approximate to 80 per cent.  With the voluntary force you are unlikely to get more than 50 per cent.  However, when it comes to mobilisation they give a good turn-out. The Volunteer force, I think, gave 86 per cent. of its strength in 1939 notwithstanding its relatively low attendance in training.  It is a question that needs looking into particularly as there is no provision for a first line reserve in the old sense.  We are, therefore, as things stand, to be compelled to rely on the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  It is important then that we should concentrate upon that.  I might at this stage express a personal view.  I have had <Col N="836" /> some experience of the Volunteer force in the past and I have given the matter some study.  Expressing a purely personal view I feel that the only way to provide a proper reserve to our Defence Forces, to complete the defence force picture and adequately to implement the defence policy which we have, is to introduce as has been done in every other country some scheme of compulsory military training.  However, I also realise that there is for any Government here a problem posed by the partition of our country where we have been anxious to try in the past to prevent our northern brethren from being conscripted into another army.  That being the situation I see it imposes serious difficulties down here.  I merely mention the fact in this connection now as well as expressing my own purely personal view that the best that can be done with a reserve force of a voluntary nature is to provide a force which can rapidly be assimilated on mobilisation: that, as far as mobile forces are concerned anyway, it is beyond the bounds of reasonable possibility to hope that you can take voluntary reserve units and train them in peace-time on the basis of a few weeks every year and then hope that on the call to arms they will fall into line and be capable of being treated as units straight away.  I think that any voluntary system of that nature will take time for incorporation and that in developing a reserve of this nature we must face the fact that when mobilisation comes it will take time, as with the emergency Army and as with the Volunteer force in the past, to incorporate them.  For that reason I would ask the Minister in his provision for reserves to consider some way in which he can augment the numbers of the first line reserve in order that between it and the regular Army there will be a force available to answer the requirements of defence policy immediately on mobilisation without waiting for the necessary time lag incidental to what I might call the purely voluntary portion of the reserve.  Perhaps of all the figures that disturb me the figure that after the emergency we have a reserve of only 5,750 first line disturbs me most. These are general thoughts but it is absolutely essential to the development <Col N="837" /> of the reserve that the cadres are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last point last night was that to every unit a cadre is required.  If you are going to retain a voluntary force and learn the lesson of 1938 and 1939 and provide the cadre, that will mean, of course, a certain expansion of the regular Army.  Therefore, the first step in implementing a defence policy and the first step towards building up reserves is to provide in adequate strength a permanent force with adequate equipment and facilities for discharging its mission.  That is why I think again the Minister's policy in letting the figure stand at its present level while, at the same time, restricting recruiting is wrong.  There is even a danger that the policy now about to be adopted may result in the bleeding to death of the Army&mdash;a result which, of course, would not be visualised at all by the Minister.  He would seek to guard against it as much as any of us, but this policy seems to me to be the first step to that undesirable end.  Apart from the fact that it is inevitably demoralising and depressing to the personnel of the Forces to know that they have not reached their establishment, their one and only opportunity of achieving the object for which they exist is being denied.  I would very seriously ask the Minister to reconsider this Estimate; to allow the recruiting drive to go on; to allow for continuity in the building up of the Army so that if ever the day should come&mdash;please God it will not come, but we have to be realists&mdash;they cannot point back to this day in 1948 and say that it was the fatal day.  I am sure the Minister would not like to find such a situation developing. Therefore, the one thing that I would ask him&mdash;it does not mean much money &mdash;is to allow the recruiting drive to go on.  It will be some time before you fill your establishment, but you will be working towards that aim on which we are all agreed.  Even though the Minister has the unpopular and difficult job of finding the money for this purpose, he knows that everybody will be behind him after the lessons of the past.  He knows that the experience gained by two Governments before his own is <Col N="838" /> there to support him.  He knows he has an unanswerable case.  I press him, as an ex-officer of the forces, to press for that.</P>
    <P>It is difficult enough in a post-war and post-emergency period to get recruits but that should not prevent our trying, because there would be some recruits and we could get them. The logical effect of stopping recruiting now, if that is maintained, is that the wastage will go on and strength will decline.  Some recruits are absolutely necessary to maintain the strength.  If the strength was 100 or so more a few months ago than that now allowed for the Minister is actually budgeting for decreased strength through natural wastage. Where will we find ourselves if that policy is allowed to continue?  Again I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to certain financial aspects of Army administration. One of the great inhibitions from which the Army suffered in its previous history was the restrictions imposed by the Department of Finance.  Perhaps it arose in an understandable way during the demobilisation years of 1924, 1925 and 1926, but the fact remains that a system was allowed to continue where the influence of the officers of the Department of Finance was allowed to preponderate and to overrule the military and the Department of Defence point of view. Now the officers of the Department of Finance have their proper functions to perform and no one can criticise them for so doing.  My criticism is that the system was unduly balanced between the functions of the Department of Finance on the one hand and those of the Department of Defence on the other.  The result was that not only did the Department of Finance in the past unreasonably restrict expenditure on the Army, but they practically found themselves in the position of dictating defence policy.  I think that is not too strong a statement.</P>

      <P>I have already mentioned the pernicious system by which establishments were kept down in the past.  Here are some figures that may be illuminating.  I have gone to the trouble of taking them from the Appropriation Accounts and the Estimates for the years previous to the war.  They show a very extraordinary picture.  You had from the year 1924 to the year 1939, approximately £28,456,623 voted for the Army, of which, however, only about £25,192,474 was spent on the Army, leaving a net saving on the Army Vote all over these years of something over £3,260,000. That is a surprising situation, as I shall show you in a moment, having regard as to how the Estimates are arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1924 to 1939 there was always a saving on the Defence Force, sometimes up to 20 per cent.  If you average out the figures for these years you will find that on the average, although the Minister for Defence came in and got his Vote, when it came to spending the money, the Department of Finance succeeded in securing that 11 per cent. on the average was not spent.  I have said that that was an amazing situation when you have regard to how the Estimates are arrived at.  Each year in the autumn, if my memory serves me, the Army people are asked by the Department of Finance to supply their Estimates.  They have got to supply these Estimates under the detailed subheads that you will find in the Book of Estimates, and they have to be in a fairly standardised form.  These items are examined first of all by a number of officials of the Department of Defence, and afterwards by the officials of the Department of Finance, and detailed explanations have to be given for every item of expenditure visualised.  Looking at the Estimates, Deputies will see how every particular item has to be accounted for.  Everything at that stage is pared down both by the Department of Defence and by the Department of Finance.  The Department of Defence itself has a very efficient staff, who will ensure that there is no extravagance on the Army <Col N="840" /> side, even if there was any temptation towards extravagance.  It would be a gross calumny on Army officers to say that there is any such tendency, because in these matters the General Staff is as responsible a body of men as is to be found in any Department of the State.</P>
    <P>The fact is that after a very careful scrutiny and after much cheese-paring the Estimates emanate from the Department of Defence.  There then usually follows a long series of correspondence, communications and negotiations with the Department of Finance in order to justify these Estimates. Very properly the Department of Finance, charged as it is with the duty of safeguarding the public purse, will ensure that no commitment is entered into which in the least way could be described as unwarranted or extravagant. The net result is that after a considerable delay, the Book of Estimates comes out providing with detail for the expenditure in the next ensuing year.  This has been thoroughly examined by the staffs of the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance.  Agreement has apparently been reached between them in regard to these commitments.</P>
    <P>One would have imagined that when it came to the expending of these moneys which are so carefully scrutinised, presented to the House and voted by the House for the Army, the way would be smooth.  But no.  What happens is that when it comes to buying any particular article of equipment the whole thing has to be gone into again.  For instance, take the Vote for warlike stores.  Let us say that there is an allowance for certain equipment. Before that got into the Estimates, it was sifted and analysed and the details were worked out to the last degree.  Notwithstanding that, when it comes to buying or placing the order for that equipment, the whole process is gone into again in detail with the result there are interminable delays. It is heartbreaking to the personnel who have to deal with it, and it seems to me to be an unnecessary complication of the machinery and an unnecessary administrative expense.  The net <Col N="841" /> effect is that it will be late in the year of the Estimate when the order is placed.  Then what happens?  When you come to the Appropriation Accounts, you will find a note stating that the stores were not purchased to the extent anticipated or something of that nature.  These notes have escaped comment in the past but what they really mean is that the Department of Finance, by a successful delaying action, has been able to prevent the expenditure in the current year and therefore has been able to show so much as a saving.</P>
    <P>When the order is ultimately placed, what happens is that it is paid for in another year and the money that should have been expended in this year is charged to next year with, of course, a brake on the normal expenditure for that year.  The whole thing works out in what I can only term a kind of vicious snowball with the result that the Army does not secure half the stores necessary for it.  It is alarming enough to find that there was a saving of 11 per cent. on Army expenditure as a whole over all these years but when you come to warlike stores the situation is positively frightening and it explains to a large extent why we were so badly prepared for the emergency when it came upon us.  From 1924 to 1939 there was an average net saving of 14 per cent. on the Estimates for warlike stores, notwithstanding a substantial over-commitment in the years 1925 to 1927 and an extra £5,000 in the year 1937-38.  Between 1928 and 1937 you find that on the average one-third of the proposed expenditure on essential warlike stores was saved.  Then, if you look to find how much of the total Army Vote was spent on equipment, you are presented with the staggering fact that the total sum voted for the purchase of warlike stores, over the years I have been taking, amounted to about 5 per cent. of the total Army Vote.  You have the extraordinary fact that only 5 per cent. of the total Army Estimate was voted for warlike stores and of that totally inadequate provision some 14 per cent. was saved.  Of that inadequate Vote, on the average about 5 per cent. only was allocated for the equipment which <Col N="842" /> is necessary to an army if it is to be an army at all.  Of that 5 per cent., it appears that during the greater part of the period about one-third was saved. Is it any wonder that when it came to mobilisation, when it came to a review of the position in 1938, when the administrative screen was pierced by those in authority above it, it was found that the Army had practically no equipment, not even for the inadequate strength which was actually available?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that.  If Deputy Collins will refer to what I said on the Estimate last year he will find that expanded.  Dealing just with the question of finance, there was the situation which resulted in 1940 in our not having sufficient rifles and light automatics, or even pistols. When the Local Security Force was established, we could do no better than to give them shotguns.  Dealing with Deputy Collins' remark, which would be the next in logical sequence, there were many people before the war who said that we should not buy equipment prematurely, that we should wait until war threatened to buy the equipment. On the face of it, it was a fairly reasonable argument.  Apart from the impossible financial barrier, there was always a certain break in that regard on the purchase of equipment.  What happened in fact?  After the Munich crisis and after the strength problem was faced, it was even at that late hour decided to try to get equipment. The Government of the day was perturbed by the fact that the moneys which had been voted or appeared to have been voted for equipment in the past had in effect been filched through the efficiency of the Department of Finance.  I am not criticising the Department of Finance in any way to which objection could be taken.  They were trying to do their job.  I am dealing with a question that goes back over the history of two Governments and which seems likely to repeat itself in the history of a third.</P>

      <P>No.  On that occasion an effort was made and it seemed to be just at the right time. From 1936 onwards, the Deputy will remember that the international situation worsened.  It was round about 1936, 1937 and 1938, that efforts were made to find equipment.  In 1937 and 1938 we succeeded in trying to make up for lost time to the extent of an excess of £5,000.  In 1938-39 there was a deficiency of 15 per cent., but that 15 per cent. was forced upon us through the fact that we could not get deliveries of our orders.  For the year 1939-40&mdash;that would be the Estimates of 1939&mdash;a very substantial programme was embarked upon and orders placed, but it proved in fact to be too late, because on that Estimate there was forced upon us a saving of 87 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to about 1937 there was not much difficulty about getting equipment.  Orders were placed, in so far as they got through Finance. But there is a lesson to be learned from that&mdash;that you cannot wait until hostilities are immediately imminent to purchase equipment.  If you do, you will not get it.  Therefore, the Minister for Defence of any day has got a difficult problem to face and as I see the problem facing the present Minister it is a two-fold one.  For his own part, he has the problem of deciding when and how to embark upon an equipment programme or the equipment to purchase each year.  In deciding that, he has to balance the danger of purchasing obsolete equipment on the one hand and, on the other hand, the danger of being too late.  Then he must overcome the opposition of the Department of Finance to further expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I expressed the view that it was premature to embark on an equipment programme <i>in extenso.</i>  I do not know if the situation is changed.  It would depend largely upon a certain decision of other Powers in <Col N="844" /> regard to the standardising of equipment. But this much can be said: that you can lean too far in the opposite direction, that certain small arms and certain equipment are likely to be serviceable anyway and that some equipment should be provided for.  After all, before the last war we heard a lot about &ldquo;this or that becoming obsolete.&rdquo; Yet when it came to war, rifles, light machine guns and even the heavier ones, anti-tank weapons and artillery remained virtually the same type of weapons as they had been previously. There had been some improvements, but the weapons that were current in the 30's were still good weapons for the war, at least they were better than nothing&mdash;they were serviceable.  If we had them we would have done well. Actually, in the late stages of the war we got some of that type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard a lot about all these things before the last war, and they were used as an excuse for not getting equipment.  Still, as the facts worked out, equipment was an important factor, and, if we had it, it would have been serviceable if the opportunity presented itself as the last war developed.  That is an argument that has a certain amount in it, but one could push it too far.  To sum up, the Minister has, first of all, the difficult problem of deciding on getting his equipment, and all I urge upon him is that he should try to ensure that the Army is so equipped that training can be a reality, not what went on in some of the days far back when a battalion would have to lend its equipment to the next battalion in order that that battalion could do its annual training. We should get away from those days. There should be equipment for units to train independently and to fulfil their mission to some degree.  That is in regard to certain standard equipment. We should, in other words, guard against the danger, which we now know exists, in the light of the lessons of the past, of waiting too long.  On the other hand, I fully concede to the Minister that there is always the problem of exercising a proper judgment <Col N="845" /> and seeing that the stuff is not obsolete.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the places from which to get the equipment. Be that as it may, for this Estimate the important thing is that the second obstacle that the Minister will have to face, the administrative one, is not allowed to hamper him any further, that a situation such as existed in the past, where less than 5 per cent. of the Vote was for warlike stores, and of that up to 35 per cent. was saved on certain occasions, even 50 per cent. was saved on occasions, should not be allowed to repeat itself.  Warlike stores come under sub-head P.  There is a considerable saving to be effected in that.  The Minister has not disclosed to us the details of the savings which he intends to effect on the warlike stores sub-head.  But, just as he was pressed in regard to strength, I press him in regard to this.  An Army unequipped loses all its meaning, is an unnecessary expense, and is wasteful. If you are not going to provide it with the equipment, then you might as well not provide the force at all.</P>
      <P>I have dealt at some length with the history of the Army, both in respect of strengths and in respect of equipment. I have done so in the hope that the experiences of the past and the lessons which were in the end appreciated by the last Government after they had been marshalled and put forward by those responsible, would be appreciated by their successors, and that we would not fall into the trap of thinking that an inadequate Defence Force is fulfilling the job that we think it is fulfilling, as some people fell into the trap in the past, and that we also should not fall into the trap of thinking that, if we have numbers of men on paper, they will be an effective Army even though they have not got the necessary equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand the provision of an Army at all is going to mean money. The provision even of the Army which we had before the war is going to mean more money to-day&mdash;even of that strength&mdash;than it would have meant then.  The Vote before the war was in the region of £1,500,000.  We can expect a substantial increase now <Col N="846" /> because the cost of men's rations, clothing, maintenance and so on will have gone up, having regard to depreciation in the international value of sterling.  On that basis alone, if we were to do no better than we did before the war, I fail to see how the Army Vote could be much less than £3,000,000.  If, before the war, that force was totally inadequate for the purpose for which it was there, what is our position to-day when we are only spending approximately the equivalent amount?  It is a subject for very careful thought and analysis.  It leads one to ask very seriously whether we are not indulging in make-believe with the Army, and to that extent paying the luxury of £3,000,000 per year for make-believe. Somebody spoke about realists last night.  Let us be realists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting factor developing to-day.  We have a general policy of neutrality. One would have to have regard there to the actual world situation.  What is the situation if war is likely to develop? We have, on the one side, a very extensive country with large territory, land and air force, but it has not a big surface force.  On the other hand, you have the American and the British Navies which in capital ships and in surface craft are dominant on the water. We also have the picture that the British apparently feel it unnecessary to maintain the same capital strength as they might have maintained heretofore&mdash;in this I am merely expressing a personal opinion&mdash;possibly on the basis that the likely enemy is not going to be overwhelmingly equipped in capital or surface ships.  What is the inference to be drawn from that?  That, in so far as war can be visualised, it is in the water rather than on the water it will develop, and that with the present set up it is likely that the naval warfare that will emerge will be a war by submarines.  That submarine warfare will probably be both operational and also directed against the communications of the island power, as it has been directed against it in the past. In other words, the war to be visualised in so far as it may come to our waters <Col N="847" /> is most likely to be a war of submarines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, in regard to our defence problem, if we are to preserve our neutrality we will want to be in a position to preserve neutrality in our territorial waters from in-lying submarines. We will want to be in a position to deal with any attacks in which submarines take part and to patrol our own waters.  With that object in view the corvettes were purchased.  Before the war the most economical craft it was thought for us to purchase were motor torpedo boats.  It was thought that they would be most useful for the defence of Cork Harbour and places like that.  But they are not suitable for sea patrol that has to be maintained in bad weather or over distances.  Defence of that sort would have to be committed to vessels of somewhat greater weight.  Having regard to the State's purse, the only thing to be done was to purchase the corvettes, which we got very cheaply. In war-time they would fill the rôle of patrol.  They were designed as convoy craft and were equipped with anti-submarine devices and with a gun. They are also equipped with a depth-charge throwing device for dealing with submarines under surface.  They were the best thing that the staff could think of.  They were valuable for the dual work of patrol and for handling the complications likely to arise from war in which submarines played a large part.  Certain considerations also arose, I understand, as regards international law.  I have not made up that question in detail, but I understand there were some considerations of that nature as well.  Apart from their war-time use, they could in the meantime be used for the purpose of keeping naval personnel trained.  You could use them in peace-time in connection with our fisheries, though they are not exactly designed for protection work of that sort.  They may be a bit slow for that purpose.  Our naval force could also be used for a survey of our waters which is long overdue.  These are just a few general heads which I have run through as a justification for the Navy as part of our defence <Col N="848" /> policy.  If we have this policy of neutrality which I endeavoured to outline last night and even if we were to visualise the co-operation of another Power at war then, on the basis of that view, you do need a naval element that will provide for the patrol of our territorial waters, that will deal with such things as in-lying submarines and that will do a certain amount of water reconnaissance. A case is undoubtedly to be made in that respect, just in the same way as a case is to be made for an Air Force here.  A case is to be made for the Air Force, particularly in regard to fighter squadrons, because the geographical position of this country makes it, in certain events, comparable with a potential large aircraft carrier which would be important if the present set-up resulted in war. Therefore, we should develop an Air Force here, with a preponderance of fighters, and, as a corollary to that, a certain high proportion of anti-aircraft artillery.  However, I am afraid Deputy O'Higgins has lured me off on a track&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, before concluding, to refer again to the general necessity for being alive with regard to our Defence Forces.  One of the difficulties in the past, during the régime of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, was that during that period there was no very clear picture of how hostilities might develop.  In spite of all the potentialities of the then situation, the line-up was not clear enough to suggest that there was a great war in the offing, and for that reason many people were lulled into a sense of false security, and it was felt justified in those days to leave the Defence Forces at the inadequate level at which they were in the years from 1925 to 1936.  That habit unfortunately <Col N="849" /> continued, and the insidiousness of it was apparent in the time-lag in reacting to the worsening international situation from 1936 onwards. It was only from about 1936 onwards that the line-up could be seen and that one could say that a war was likely to come.  From about that date it became apparent that it was a question of Axis military might against other combinations, and right from the time it became apparent that war could ensue from such a line-up, action was taken by the then Government to deal with it.  The trouble was that the inertia of the machine, and the sense of security from the happier days when the line-up was not there, prevented the speedy reaction to it which one would have liked; but during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939 there was this experimenting with the Defence Forces and the attempt to get them ready for war.</P>
    <P>Now we have, not a situation comparable with the situation from 1925 to 1936, but rather a situation comparable with that which existed from 1936 to 1939.  We cannot say to-day that there is no probable line-up in the offing.  We cannot say with truth to-day that one cannot guess at the potentialities of the present situation.  We can say, however, that there are two definite <i>blocs</i> of Powers in this world who, to say the least of it, are not on the best of terms and to that extent we find ourselves in a situation comparable with the situation from 1936 to 1939 rather than the other.  How long there is before us is anybody's guess. I want carefully to refrain from anything like alarmist statements.  I should like to hope that it was not there at all, but we have to be realists. Therefore, now is the time to profit by the experiences of these years, to accept the recommendations of the General Staff which examined this problem with care and with, I assure you, due regard for economy, knowing the force and importance of the economic factor.</P>
    <P>The work which the previous Government initiated in trying to have these problems examined, so that history would not repeat itself, as we might not get the same fortunate <Col N="850" /> opportunities as we got in the past, should go on.  There are other elements still to be handled, I know.  In the past, the correlation of industrial production, questions of the co-ordination of research and transport with defence were only touched upon.  Before I left the Army, it was hoped that some measure of co-ordination could be achieved and plans for the future on these lines drawn up.  I should like to feel that that work would go on, because remember that, in the net, if hostilities, or even a very strained state of affairs are to develop in this world, a situation something like that of the past may develop here again. We are on the flank of one of the Powers involved.  If we are not strong enough, if we are not prepared enough to account for our own unit of territory, that is, to garrison our own country, to provide our own local security, to protect our own neutrality to the extent of being able to meet diversionary attacks and take for a reasonable time the shock of any attack against us, certain Powers will be compelled in their own interests to occupy us.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to what I said in previous debates in that regard. If there was any danger of our being invaded&mdash;and, mind you, there was by our neighbour in the last war&mdash; it was not so much from a desire to use us, not from any fear of our co-operating with an enemy of theirs, but more from a feeling that we might be the Achilles heel in the territory of these islands and some adequate steps would have to be taken to protect the open flank.  Fortunately, thanks to the period of grace given to us in 1939 and to other factors, for which we must thank God, we were able ourselves to supply sufficient protection, and perhaps it was fortunate also that, after Dunkirk, our neighbour was in such straits that the protection we could afford here, deficient as it was, during 1940, was comparable with what they could afford if they were to come in here.</P>
    <P>These are all considerations touching vitally our neutrality.  If you do not make an effort and if you do not effectively account for your own territory, you are not only inviting but you <Col N="851" /> are forcing somebody else to take on the task, and that is something which none of us would like to see happening. It would be better for this country, on any showing, whether we are neutral or participants, to account for our own territory, and, even if we were participants, to dispose our troops in units rather than as individuals, or have the complication of an occupying Power.</P>
    <P>You all know the mess made of any country by the occupation of foreign troops.  Morally, even physically, it is nearly a population problem.  That is one of the acute dangers, quite apart from the question of the likelihood of an attack by a belligerent at all, and now is the time to lay the foundations to prevent it.  The Minister's predecessor tried to do that and he was hampered and was in the same difficult position in which the present Minister now finds himself.  He found himself in an even more difficult position because the people then on these benches had started to urge retrenchment in the Defence Forces, while the present Minister, however, finds himself in the position of being supported by the whole House.  Again I appeal to him to listen to the voice of his efficient General Staff in regard to the strength of the Army, and not to stop recruitment.  Let him make provision for the equipment of the Army, and then let him go on with the intention of co-ordinating the other aspects of defence with the military aspect which the Minister mentioned already.</P>
    <P>I conclude with the remark which I made last year, and I think I heard Deputy Traynor make it in the course of this debate.  After all, this Vote on defence is in the nature of insurance. If, however, you do not pay an adequate premium there will be no money to pay on the policy if it ever matures, and in such a situation the moneys which you have paid as premiums are thrown away.  By the payment of an inadequate sum on defence you are taking the risk of throwing all the money away in annual instalments, and we cannot afford to play with sums which are in the region of millions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> These are the factors which I would ask the Minister to take into account. One could sympathise greatly in regard to his problems of finding the money, but it is difficult to sympathise if that problem is going to be extended to a degree which will mean the eventual depletion of the Defence Forces. Where are the interests of the non-commissioned officers, the men and the officers in developing these forces if they feel from the start that the old history is going to be repeated and that the dice is loaded against them?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of alarmist rumours and of the disability suffered as a result, but these rumours originated from statements which were made on this side of the House when the Minister's Party occupied it.  The apprehension in regard to the Defence Forces is due to statements which were made before the last general election and to criticisms in regard to the Defence Force and it is only fair that the charge should be laid at the right place.  The point should be made that it is not a question of alarmist rumours with the Army but a question of having a solid realistic insurance policy.  I hope that the Minister will revise his Estimate to the extent of providing for a Regular Army of the size visualised.  I should like to see him making an effort to get recruits.  I would like to see the first line reserve built up and I would sympathise with his efforts for building a second line so that we may be able to say in the future that we have learnt the lessons of the past and that we shall be able to say that we have the Defence Force which it was intended that we should have.</P>

      <P>While the Army was being built up, agriculture was being destroyed, for the farmers, and not the Army, are the first line defence of the country and the farms have been going into senile decay.  I certainly believe that we have to look to the future, but the way to look to the future is to build up a contented people.  We have not got a contented people in this country, and I am satisfied that there is only one way to bring this country to a proper sense of its duty to itself, and that is to get our people nationally-minded, spiritually-minded and morally-minded and to get them away from tin-pot soldiering.</P>
      <P>While we should not have a standing Army, we should have every young man a trained man; trained, not in the military sense, but in the moral, spiritual and national sense.  That is what is needed before we put a rifle on a soldier and, if we do that, we shall have a martial people.  The true fact at the moment is that we are a degenerate people, always brawling and fighting, and that the whole world is laughing at us.  We are running helter-skelter all over the world showing off our grievances and shouting for help. Why can we not help ourselves?  Every young man in the country should do his duty and should be trained morally, physically and nationally.  I do not believe in a standing army at all. Standing armies are the curse of this earth, for young men are depraved and destroyed, not in our Army, but in the British and American Armies.  That is why they are suffering from moral corruption and we, small tin-pot country that we are, should show a headline by cutting out this nonsense of soldiering, by getting down to feeding the people and by making the people happy and prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may talk of defence but does not God know that we are not capable of defending ourselves?  During the last war it was not the Local Defence Force <Col N="854" /> or the Local Security Force or the Taoiseach's shouting that defended us, for that is the greatest tommy-rot.  We did not have half a dozen aeroplanes and suppose that 25 or 30 bombers of the latest type came over the country with destruction in their minds what would have happened then?  The people would have run helter-skelter into any pigsty or hole they could get and we could not hold out for five minutes.  We know that Ireland would fight to the death.  What good would that be?  For we would all be dead in five minutes.  What defended us in the last war?  Our geographical position defended us and in the future nothing else will defend us.  Whether Britain likes it or not, she will have to defend us and we should realise that.</P>
    <P>We may talk about our neutrality or about putting up a defence but we know we cannot even produce a blank cartridge.  Every bomb, every bullet and every machine-gun has come to us from our traditional enemy, from Britain.  Even some of our uniforms were dyed from khaki to our native green.  You may think that the people in the country are goms and fools but they are not such fools and they know where the cods are, they know that they are here in this House.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing for the country and that is to have a common line of defence with the North.  Now, I am satisfied that this country is one and that there should be a common defence between the North and the South.  In fact, I am satisfied that there should be a common defence between the two islands, between the British island and the Irish island. That is, of course, unpatriotic, antinational. I believe in facing the situation honestly and manfully.  I am convinced that if one island falls, the other will fall with it.  I know that Britain would be satisfied to have some defence policy with this country.  The accursed Border must be abolished.  It is the cause of all the trouble.  Then we could face the British authorities and evolve a mutual defence policy.  That can be secured only on the strength of national unity.  The time is upon us now.  I believe that North and South, seeing the war clouds gathering, can sink many of their differences and <Col N="855" /> evolve a proper defence policy for this country.  That is not done because it would not do politically; it would not do nationally, because the Orangemen might get the better of us.  That is all rot.</P>
    <P>How are we to be prosperous if we do not rid ourselves of the fallacies that at present exist?  Give the country half a chance.  We realise that there is only one line-up in the world of to-day, that is, Christ against Anti-Christ.  We realise that, yet we sit here whining.  There is only one line-up in a country that stands for the Cross.  It is the Cross against the crooked cross.  There may be war in six months or in 12 months or in four or five years' time but there is one thing certain, namely, that war is coming and must come.  Thanks be to God that it is coming because there are in this world the greatest scoundrels that God ever made, who must be wiped out or brought to their senses.  May the hand of God fall heavily upon them.  I am satisfied that it will.  There is only one policy for us at the moment, that is, to be on the right side and there is only one right side.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Government not to be concerned so much about armies.  They will count for very little.  It is quite certain that this country will not send a separate army to the international brigade that will be formed, perhaps, in the next year or two.  I am satisfied that we will not be asked to do that.  We will, I suppose, be asked to contribute financially and otherwise, and we may be asked to allow our young men to go to that brigade.  I believe we should do that.</P>
    <P>During the last 25 years, men who served in the Army have been thrown on the world in their old age. I have met men who wondered why they ever joined the Army and who told me that after 25 years' service they received a pension of a few shillings a week which would not keep them in tobacco.  That has been the case from the days of the old I.R.A. to the present time.  We boast about this being a grand little country while we make wrecks of the young men who made an effort to defend it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> I say, if you have soldiers, treat them well.  The former Minister for Defence spoke in this House and throughout the country about what he would do for the young men who joined the Army during the emergency.  They were told that they would get any job that was going.  That promise was not fulfilled.  They did not get the jobs; they did not get anything, while those who never went into uniform got jobs as gangers.  They got those jobs because they belonged to certain clubs but the young men who joined the L.S.F. and the L.D.F. and the National Army got nothing.  Where are they to-day?  Where are our exArmy officers to-day?  They are trying to make sweets in the back streets of Dublin.  We ought to hang our heads in shame.  These men, these farmers' sons, should be planted on the land of Ireland.  The big estates should be taken over and decent holdings of 50 or 60 acres, at least, should be provided for them.  We should be proud to give it to them and we should march them into those holdings with bands and banners.  That is not being done. Instead, they must go into Moore Street or Mary Street to make sweets. Is it not a humiliating position for such noble men?  To-day they are wrecks, the Irish soldiers of yesterday. I say that there is good work to be done in looking after these men. There is no use in building up another Army to-morrow which will discharge another group of men on the scrapheap. I would say to the present Government, if they have schemes for the relief of unemployment, if there is unemployment, they should see that these men get priority.</P>
    <P>The spirit of patriotism and nationalism has disappeared and the spirit of materialism has crept in because people have witnessed the treatment given to our ex-soldiers.  No man to-day will give service free because he knows what he got for past service. Now, it is a question of what is your price.  That is not the spirit we want to see in this country.  That is not the spirit that we went to prison for.  That is not the spirit that Collins and Griffith died for.</P>
    <P>This country should he able to solve <Col N="857" /> its own problems by its own effort and initiative.  We had a big standing Army during the last war and it cost a good deal of money.  Why was that standing Army there?  Was it at the behest of the Irish people or at the behest of gentlemen across the water? I would like to have that answered.</P>

So, I would ask the Minister for Defence to be a brave man and not to be afraid to meet the people across the Border, with a view to seeing if we could have a common defence for this country.  I am satisfied that we could get it and that it would help to clear away the Border.  It can be done in our generation if common sense prevails.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has had a very unusual experience for a Minister for Defence in time of peace.  Instead of speeches like that of the last speaker being made from the Opposition Benches, as they were made during the years prior to the last war and for the last couple of years, constructive, helpful speeches were made by members of the Opposition. I would ask the Minister for Defence to try to use his influence with his colleagues to get the money that was proposed <Col N="858" /> in this Book of Estimates for the Department of Defence this year.  A couple of the proposed savings which the Minister outlined here will be disastrous for the Army and disastrous for this country in case the world situation disimproves.  I am perfectly certain that the cuts in Army and defence expenditure outlined here by the Minister for Defence yesterday had not the approval or were not undertaken voluntarily by the General Staff. The General Staff is naturally interested in keeping up the morale of the Army.  It is going to be disastrous for the Army, for the morale of all ranks, the officers as well as the men, if they are in an organisation that is dying through want of the recruits that are necessary in order to keep it up to strength.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has made a very valuable contribution to this debate by outlining the history of Army recruitment, Army strengths and equipment over a number of years.  A few months ago, when the then Minister for Defence put up this Estimate, I approved of it as Minister for Finance, not because I contemplated with any equanimity, as Minister for Finance, the raising of the money to provide the expenses involved but because I thought it was necessary and I thought the people should be asked to bear the taxes to provide the money.  It was generally agreed by the General Staff after the war that we should aim at having at least 12,500 men in the permanent forces.  It was pointed out that, because the Army was starved of funds prior to the last war, we had a very difficult defence problem here when the war broke out.  It was pointed out also that peace has not yet arrived in this world and that the flames of war may leap out again without any great notice.  It was in those circumstances that I agreed, as Minister for Finance, to provide this sum of £4,750,000 for defence purposes in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the proposals that have been made for cutting down the expense of the Army make up a total of only £750,000.  It is a very small fraction, either of the total State expenditure <Col N="859" /> or of our total national income.  It is foolish for a man to build a roof on his house and save a couple per cent. on the expenditure, and leave the roof in such a state that it may collapse on himself and his family.  It is foolish for us, if we are going to spend £4,000,000 on the Army, not to spend the extra £750,000 in order to provide an Army that will be efficient and that has a reasonable chance of doing its job in the present international situation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the arguments that were advanced so capably by Deputy Traynor, Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera here to-day, as to why we should aim at keeping the Defence Forces up to the strength envisaged in the Estimates and envisaged in the establishment approved of by the Government a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disastrous step not to call up the reserve this year.  The Minister was not very clear on the amount of money he proposed to save, but in any event it must be a very small fraction of the total.  By not calling up the reserve, he is in my opinion definitely breaking a contract with the men who agreed to go on the reserve, with those men who joined the regular Army for two years and opted to go on the reserve for ten years.  They not only contracted to give the service when called upon but they also had a contract from the State to get a month's employment each year with the remuneration involved appropriate to their rank.  It has always been difficult to get men to join the reserve &mdash;to join the Army and then afterwards to join the reserve&mdash;and nothing should be done, particularly nothing which costs very little money, which would break their faith in the State contract. There have been many rumours of various proposals for saving State expenditure, but I have not heard of any other proposals in which the State or the Government proposed to break the contract with State servants, as members of the Army and members of the reserve are.  I think it is a very bad policy, even to save a few thousand pounds, to break the contract with the men who undertook to give service, to <Col N="860" /> come up when called upon and help to complete the Defence Forces of the State in times of emergency.</P>
    <P>It is also &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; to stop recruitment.  It is difficult enough to get recruits, but when recruitment is stopped for a while, it is going to be very much more difficult still.  Through the ordinary wastage, the Army will decrease in this next year or so and if the vacancies are not filled up it is going to cause all sorts of confusion when units are not up to strength.  It will cause organisational chaos within the Army and it is not worth it.  If we are prepared to spend £4,000,000 on the Army, it is worth while spending the other couple of hundred thousand pounds as the most that would be involved in taking the number of recruits that the former Minister for Defence hoped to get in this particular year.</P>
    <P>One other expense that the Minister for Defence outlined was a saving on barrack services, on maintenance.  He did not go into details on that and I would like to know if he is going to stop the repair of buildings or stop necessary additions that were contemplated for the comfort of the men in the Army.  It is a very bad saving, if one can at all afford it, to save replacing the slates or to save on painting. If one thinks of having a satisfied Army, it is a very bad expense not to go ahead with providing whatever additional amenities were contemplated in the Estimates in the book we have before us.  I trust that the Minister for Defence, even though he cannot do anything about it here to-day without consulting his colleagues, will talk again to the General Staff, and having got, as I am sure he will get, their urgent plea for the extra money that will enable them to keep the Army in good shape, he will go back again to his colleagues and ask them not to impose these disastrous small cuts in State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Former Ministers for Defence had a bad time here in peaceful years.  The Opposition members saw a very easy way of appealing to their constituents by pointing to the other ways in which the money spent on the Army could be expended.  Undoubtedly £4,750,000 <Col N="861" /> could do a lot of other work in the State but I suggest a man who is running any business is foolish if he tries to save on his fire insurance.  The nation that hopes to survive through the difficult days that lie ahead, so far as anyone can see, is very foolish if it tries to save to the extent of these few cuts which would represent .01 per cent. of the total national income or 1½ per cent. or less of the State Budget. Other countries in the present situation are spending 25 per cent. and in some cases 40 per cent. of the national income on military organisation.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that even if we were to spend twice £4,750,000 we could not absolutely guarantee to save our people from any attack, but we can at least by wise expenditure get good men into the Army and by giving them reasonable conditions and keeping up their morale we can make it a very dangerous experiment for any other country to attack us, an experiment that might be too costly.  It was on that assumption that the Government that was in office from 1932 to 1939 proceeded.  Thanks to the courage of our young men, thanks to the wisdom of our people and thanks to the help from the Almighty, we succeeded in saving our people from the most disastrous effects of the last war.</P>
    <P>We undertook, when the then Taoiseach made his statement in 1934 or 1935, that we would not allow this country to be used as a base of attack on our neighbour.  The country as a whole approved of that and the Dáil approved of it.  If we leave a vacuum here it will be filled, by some sort of soldiers in modern warfare.  No country will allow any spot that is accessible to remain unoccupied.  It is our job, in the interests of our own self-respect and of our people and their survival as a nation, to make certain that there is no military vacuum that can be filled by foreign troops.  Our young men would be willing, in time of war, to come forward, but if they are to do so effectively for the purpose of national defence they must have some army to join, an effective army capable of rapid expansion.</P>
    <P>In the last war, before the real crisis occurred, we got a long time to <Col N="862" /> prepare.  In the next war we may not get anything like that.  Everyone knows that the methods of delivering attack far from a base were very much improved during the last war.  In the intervening years every Government in the world has been trying to speed them up still further, to speed up the methods by which they can fling their troops further and faster in order to strangle their enemies.  It is only wise on our part to make certain that our young men, when the danger becomes more immediate, should have an Army to join in which they can help.</P>
    <P>If too many recruits flood into a small army they simply drown it.  The troops can neither move nor can they organise the recruits who offer.  I trust the Minister will take advantage of the situation and ask his colleagues not to proceed with the proposed cuts which, in my opinion, would destroy the morale of the Army and destroy its efficiency as a force.  I hope that he will try to persuade them between now and the Budget to provide the money to enable them to go ahead with recruiting on the scale proposed, if not on a greater scale.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister should carry out his contract with the reservists.  If the reservists do not come up this year it means their training is postponed, it means that the habit of coming up for training will be broken, and the effect of that will be felt for several years. It will destroy the Army reserve.  I hope the Minister will put these considerations to his colleagues and that they will agree to call up the reserves and continue the recruiting policy so that our Army can be kept in at least as good shape as it was when he took it over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Estimate is concerned, it seems to me that it is a very sensible one.  It is a welcome change from the type of Estimate introduced in this House in recent years, because it is an Estimate which is based upon both the requirements and the capacity of the country. We all know that in time of war an Army of 8,000, of 12,000 or even of 50,000 would not be adequate or proper for the defence of this country.  If we <Col N="863" /> were now, in estimating the cost of the Defence Forces for the coming year, to plan on the basis of a war situation that estimate would be just so much nonsense.  But we must ensure that if and when such a situation does arise we have a sufficient nucleus from which to build up an efficient force.  Much has been said as to the proper strength of an Army for this country.  I do not propose to enter into that in any great detail.  I would, however, like to point out that the last speaker, Deputy Aiken, was Minister for Defence for a number of years.  Deputy Traynor was also Minister in charge of Defence for a number of years.  These were the two Ministers who were responsible over a certain period for the Defence Forces of this country, and who were responsible during the war period for the defence of this country.  No doubt they had difficulties.  They were faced with a situation in which it was necessary to expand our Army as quickly as possible.  In that task they received the full support of all Parties in this House.  An Army was built up and fashioned.  Despite the amazingly fine response given by the young men of this country there are to-day two men at whose feet one can lay the blame for the fact that last year only 12 per cent. of the F.C.A. reported for training. Those two men are the two exMinisters for Defence, Deputy Aiken and Deputy Traynor.  In 1940 we had a volunteer army.  In the light of experience I doubt very much if we would get another volunteer army should we find ourselves faced with the same situation.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much if the 50,000 or 80,000 who joined the L.D.F. would again offer themselves for service because of the treatment meted out to them.  No regard was had for them; no attention was paid to them.  I doubt if any of those men would volunteer for service again.  The treatment meted out to those men by both Deputy Aiken and Deputy Traynor has done more harm than if the country had actually been involved in and suffered as a result of war.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I repeat that, from the point of view of a volunteer army, great harm has been done in the past.  The Minister, in introducing this Estimate, expressed the hope that if a war situation arose in the future the young people would respond as they did in the past.  I trust the Minister is correct in that.  When there is talk of war now nobody can dissociate from his mind the fact that such a war will be one in which we here in Ireland will have a real and genuine interest because it will affect more than our country merely and something that is perhaps dearer to us than even our country is.  For that reason I am sure that the response to an appeal would be immediate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, Deputy Aiken and I think Deputy Traynor referred to an agreed strength of 12,500.  They deplored the fact that the strength now budgeted for is something less than that.  They were not prepared to give us the basis or the reason for that strength of 12,500.  Whether that is a figure taken at random or whether it is one decided upon in the light of experience it does seem to me that a strength of 12,500 is one decided upon in the knowledge and belief that at some time conscription must be enforced in this country.  Whatever may be the reason behind that figure it is clear now that as a result of the activities of Deputy Aiken and Deputy Traynor that strength would not have <Col N="865" /> been achieved.  When the emergency ceased here and the men were given an opportunity of either remaining in the Defence Forces or returning to their peace-time avocations I doubt if the percentage who opted for continued Army service exceeded 1½ per cent. The one desire of every man was to get out of the Army.</P>
    <P>We are dealing now with a new situation and we must get back to a realisation of the fact that the defence of our country is only one part of our national economy.  We have other and more important work to do.  We have other more important national activities to which to direct our attention and we cannot allow considerations of defence to outweigh the more important considerations of production.  For that reason I think that the strength of the Army budgeted for in this Estimate must be one which will appeal to the people.  They are heartily sick of extravagant expenditure and war talk.  They want to go back now to a spirit of realism and they want realistic government based on the needs of the country.  I think this Estimate satisfies that need and I hope that it is the forerunner of many more which will be introduced by this Government.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be brief.  I appeal to the Minister to look after the rank and file of the Army.  I heard very little talk about the rank and file during the debate.  All the speakers seemed to concern themselves with the brass hats and commissioned officers.  It is the men, the P.B.I., who count in any army in the world.  It is the men who compose the P.B.I., who are the people we should look after.  No wonder recruiting failed to the extent it did.  The conditions under which soldiers were expected to live during the emergency both as regards poor food and other matters were horrible.  The only contribution made by the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures to improve the conditions of those soldiers was, I believe, a turf range which, according to my information, went in scrap very soon after the emergency was over.  Those people who were supposed <Col N="866" /> to be so interested in the neutrality of this country, of which in my opinion there never was any danger, are now very solicitous with regard to the strength of the Army.  What I am solicitous about is the manner in which the 8,500 men, the figure mentioned as the strength, will be treated.  I am thinking in particular of the conditions under which they live.  I would also urge on the Minister that any little anomalies, such as those mentioned by Deputy Cowan, which are imposed on them at the moment should be removed.  These men should be treated as men and they should get all the privileges that are due to an Army. After the 1914-1918 war the strength of the great German Army was 100,000 men.  Through that figure of 100,000 men we all know what happened in 1939.  That calculation, roughly, gives about one soldier to every 800 of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the figure of 8,500 I find it gives us one to about every 340 persons.  Are we in a position to maintain that Army on a war basis&mdash;highly mechanised, highly trained and, as referred to last night, co-ordinating the navy and the air force with it?  I am afraid that we are dealing fantastically with a situation which does not exist at the moment and which, I hope, never will.  However, if we look back and study the way the old officers of the Army were treated we will find that some of the greatest tacticians and strategicians we have in the Army&mdash; they proved themselves to be so in the manoeuvres of 1942&mdash;were badly treated.  I am afraid there is nothing creditable to be said for the last Minister for Defence in regard to the manner in which these men were thrown out in the world and I am afraid that there was an ulterior motive in that connection. I know of one man who was in the Army since 1922.  He was an old I.R.A. man.  His standard of education was sixth or maybe fifth book. That man educated himself in the Army and he attained the rank of colonel.  It was agreed by practically everyone on the Army Council that that man was the brains behind the manoeuvres of the regular Army in 1912. What happened to him?  His rank <Col N="867" /> of colonel was unsubstantiated.  He was reduced to the rank of major and then he was given Hobson's choice.  He was told&mdash;&ldquo;If you do not take that get out&rdquo;&mdash;and on principle he did get out. Those are the people who are talking about introducing discipline and <i>esprit de corps</i> into the Army.  I am afraid the promotions were very rapid for a certain category in the Army during the emergency.  I have been conversant with the affairs of the Army since I was a young man of 22 years of age.  I know very well that some people could become lieutenantcolonels while others never got past the rank of lieutenants.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister primarily on behalf of the men in the Army to make the conditions in the Army worth living under, to make it a life that will appeal to those men so that they will not be serving under duress and, after that, to pay attention to the good loyal soldier-officer who was in it since 1922 and who for some reason or another was prevented from getting promotion on his merits and who at a late stage was promoted.  I am speaking now of a number of men, not of an individual.  In addition, I would ask the Minister to do away with the age limit that was placed for a purpose on certain officers.  After that I would ask him to realise that if ever we do become involved in a war we will have the unified support and morale of the people just the very same as we had it before and that is about as much as we can do to combat war as we know it in its modern stages.</P>

      <P>He has, in fact, in a veiled manner laid charges against the Headquarers Staff of having had recourse to victimisation in the Army. I would like to know if Deputy Keane has any evidence to produce that he can stand over that such was ever the <Col N="868" /> case.  He made reference to certain officers who were retired from the Army on reaching the age limit but that was done in accordance with a well-defined policy on the part of the Army authorities that the time had come to infuse new blood into the Army.  Therefore I think that this suggestion of preferential treatment for certain officers in the Army is a slander on the Army authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to the former Ministers for Defence and stated that it was their policy that was responsible for the slowness of the recent recruiting campaign.  That was, no doubt, a very sweeping statement to make but Deputy T.F. O'Higgins did not proceed to tell us in what way these Ministers were responsible.  It is all right, of course, to make a statement like that but it is another thing to substantiate it and I submit, A Chinn Chomhairle, that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins did not substantiate that statement.  The Deputy also referred to what he termed &ldquo;realism&rdquo; and no doubt there must be realism in all these things.  We must all be realistic about these matters and especially about the question of defence, as it affects the lives and welfare of the people of the country in the event of war.  He said that in the event of another world war an Army in this country would have a real part to play. That appears to me to be in violent conflict with what his colleague, Deputy Giles, said when he stated that we had no business for an Army here at all, that it was all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to have an Army here and that we should in fact leave the defence of our country to an outside Power.  I wonder how can these two statements be reconciled? It is not the first time that we have heard conflicting statements from the Opposition Benches.</P>

      <P>We knew when to speak and we did not speak in vain. We do not believe in doing things in vain like other Deputies.  There has been a good deal of talk on the question of a saving in the Army and I should like to say a few words about the much vaunted economy drive that is being carried out by the Government at the present time.  There is a saving in the Estimate of nearly £750,000 but, in point of fact, as far as the taxpayer is concerned there is no saving at all.  It is just a question of transferring that amount to another Department, as the Minister himself said in his opening statement.  In other words, he is robbing Peter to pay Paul or taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another&mdash;a book-keeping transaction.  Still we see in to-day's papers, especially in those papers which favour the present Government, big headlines about the saving that is being carried out in the Army Estimate.</P>
      <P>There are a few other items to which I would like to refer.  The Minister gave us a lot of figures and it would be very hard to find time to study these figures but I shall pick out a few.  There is a saving on warlike stores of £63,000 but the Minister did not tell us exactly how that saving is to be effected.  I think the House is entitled to know because it could very well be that these stores when diminished would prove insufficient.  That would be a very serious development for the Army.  The same thing may be said in reference to general stores.  There is a saving of £35,000 but no indication has been given as to how that saving is to be effected.  The Minister also told us that the naval arm of our Defence Forces is not going to be interfered with and still there is to be a saving of £44,000 in that item alone.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us no indication of how exactly this £44,000 would be saved.  However, I am glad to see that he recognised the importance of the naval arm and that he does not see eye to eye with his colleague in the Government, the Minister for Finance, who, when replying to the debate on the Vote on Account, said that he did not know how many corvettes there were but that, whatever the number was, he believed there were too many.  People could not be blamed if they inferred from that that it was the policy to cut out the naval arm altogether.  Deputy O'Higgins, Junior, and Deputy Giles referred to the importance of production as compared with keeping the Army in a state of efficiency.  I submit that if hostilities broke out again and if there were a state of emergency in this country, those producing food and working on the land would not have much chance of going about their business if the country were invaded, and if there were no Army here to prevent invasion.  When we are discussing an Army Estimate there is no use talking about production and other things.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he did not believe in a continuation of recruiting, especially in the early spring.  He said that the early spring was no time for recruiting.  Are we to gather from that that the stoppage in recruiting is only temporary and that it is to be resumed in the near future?  I think the House would expect the Minister to give some indication as to when he expects recruiting to be resumed, because unless the House has some information on that point, it could very well happen that the numerical strength of the Army would be allowed to fall to a dangerous point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ways of reducing the strength of the Army&mdash;a positive way and a negative way.  By stopping recruiting, <Col N="871" /> you are having recourse to the negative method of reducing the numerical strength of the Army.  I think the Minister, when replying, should give us some idea as to when he thinks it would be possible to resume recruiting.  In conclusion, I hope that the appeals that have gone forth from this side of the House to the Minister that he should maintain the strength of the Army, so that it would be there as a nucleus which could be expanded into a big Army in time of possible hostilities, will receive favourable consideration and that the Minister will make sure that the position which obtained here at the commencement of the emergency will never arise again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has had to listen to so many pseudo-military experts in the course of the debate that I am sure it will be a bit of a relief to him to hear someone who does not claim to be in any way a military expert. I am glad that the Minister has found it possible to bring about certain economies in our Defence Department and I am glad that he has steered an even course.  Some people will tell him that the Army is absolutely unnecessary and that it should be scrapped; others will urgently appeal, and have urgently appealed, to him to expand the Army.  Between these two extravagant demands the Minister, I think, has steered an even course.  I think he will, while saving a considerable amount of money for the taxpayer which can be devoted to other useful purposes, maintain the efficiency of the Army and increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waste and extravagance do not mean efficiency.  By its nature, an army is concerned mainly about destruction. There is a tendency on the part of people associated with military matters to err on the side of destruction rather than on the side of economy.  It is no harm for the head of the Department of Defence to encourage those under his control to exercise discretion in expenditure of every kind, not to send lorries careering over the country wasting petrol and wearing out tyres where it is not necessary, not to expend money lavishly on military barracks without being absolutely <Col N="872" /> certain that these barracks are essential for the future defence plan.  The Minister indicated that he can make considerable savings on stores, transport and barrack works.  These are all essential and desirable.  At the same time, I am certain that he will maintain the efficiency of our armed forces. The Minister also indicated that it is his intention and policy to maintain an even balance as between defence and the other essentials of our national life &mdash;the production of food and other necessaries.  If we are to continue to exist as a nation, we have to expand production in agriculture, in industry and in every other direction.  At the same time, so far as it is possible, we have to make provision for our future defence.</P>
    <P>I would not have intervened in this debate if it were not for a statement made and repeated by Deputy de Valera.  He said that the defence policy of this country was clearly defined in 1926 and has never been altered since. He indicated that our defence policy may be summed up as a policy of resisting invasion, of making it as expensive as possible for any possible invader to attack this country.  I am going to ask a question which occurred to me while listening to the Deputy, and it is this.  Is the defence policy which the Deputy outlined to be for all time the rigid and unalterable defence policy of this country?  Are we to adopt for all time the policy of sitting armed at our own front door and waiting until any possible aggressor may reach our shores?</P>
    <P>I think that there is nothing so undesirable and so dangerous as for a nation to get into a rut in regard to defence matters.  We know that there is always a tendency to plan for future wars on the experience of past wars. The Maginot Line would have been a marvellous defence for France if it had been provided in 1914, but it proved to be absolutely futile in 1940.  The policy of planning for resistance to invasion when the invader reaches our shores may have been a sound policy in 1940, but it may be an absolutely futile and silly policy in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to define who or what would be a likely aggressor so far as this country is concerned, but I want to <Col N="873" /> outline a situation which could arise. Suppose a powerful military nation were to undertake the conquest of all the freedom-loving nations of Western Europe and suppose those nations were to attempt to band themselves together in order to resist that attack, should our defence policy be to tell these nations to go ahead and do whatever they liked but that our policy would be to do what Deputy de Valera has said, to remain to garrison our own country and wait until the invader reaches our shores?  You cannot plan for defence unless you have a clearly defined defence policy, and Deputy de Valera has sought to convey that there is only one possible and conceivable defence policy, the one that he says was initiated in 1926.  If we are planning merely for the garrisoning of our country and resisting invasion when it occurs, we may require one type of Army, one type of Defence Force, but if we are planning to co-operate with other nations in resisting aggression at the outset or as near as possible to the outset, then we shall have to plan some other kind of Defence Force.</P>
    <P>One of the duties of the Minister for Defence should be to introduce into his Headquarters Staff some flexibility and some originality in planning for future eventualities.  What happened in 1940 could not have been anticipated in the pre-war period.  What will happen in the future is not easy to anticipate now except we have men in our Defence Forces, men in the Headquarters of our Army who are prepared to apply their minds actively and earnestly to every aspect of future events.  We know that one of the things that contributed more than anything else to the success with which the British nation was able to resist attack in 1940 was the fact that earnest and active men had during the years of peace, during the years when there was little expenditure for expansion in defence matters, concentrated upon the perfection, so far as it was possible, of the British Air Force, with the result that when the crisis came in 1940 Britain had an air force which, though small in numbers, was very highly efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter because I <Col N="874" /> think it is a dangerous thing to let people like Deputy de Valera, people who profess to have made an extensive study of defence matters, seek to impose upon this House and upon the defence authorities a rigid set of ideas which may have no relation to future defence policy.  We can all be assured that, given a small, efficient defence force with the application of the best brains in the nation to all aspects of future defence, this nation will rise to any dangers that may face it.  History has proved beyond question that a small nation has nothing to gain but everything to lose by adopting a cowardly policy in the face of aggression.  It is better for a small nation to go down valiantly fighting on the side of right rather than become a despised and despicable passenger on the band wagon of triumphant wrong. That spirit will inspire our nation in the future.</P>
    <P>If the Minister continues the policy which he outlined when opening this debate, the policy of preserving a small but highly efficient Army, of making it more efficient every day, making it a flexible, vital unit ready to meet any eventuality, our nation will have nothing to be ashamed of in any eventualities that may arise in the future.  The Minister has definitely made it clear that he is endeavouring to hold the balance fairly between matters of defence and matters of production and economic matters generally. I am sure he will continue to do so.  There are a few small matters to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention.  Provision is made in the Estimate for medals for pre-Truce service.  I think it is time that the men who are entitled to these medals should have them.  I know of some men, now in failing health, who are looking forward to receiving this recognition.  No unnecessary time should be lost in meeting the claims of those men.  The hearing of the claims should be expedited. The medals may have very little or no monetary value, but they mean a lot to the men who gave their services to the nation in the past, and who are now perhaps in failing health with very little to look forward to in life.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate has been largely coloured by the fact that a number of the speakers have had the advantage, and if I may say so, also, the distinction of having recently served in our national forces.  Naturally, they have brought to bear on this discussion the impressions they gained from the inside of our national forces.  But the problem that we have to deal with should not be approached entirely from that point of view or from that mentality.

      <P>I was saying that those speakers who had the advantage and the distinction of having served recently in our national forces entered into this debate with the slight disadvantage of approaching the problem from that particular point of view. What we are discussing is the best method, under our national finances, of apportioning whatever money which we are able to apportion, and which we think it is right to apportion, towards the defence services.  I would like to congratulate the Minister, having regard to the short time he has been in office, on being able to come to the House and point out how he is going to bring about certain economies in this particular Estimate.  I think all the speakers have been in agreement on this point, that our forces, be they land, sea or air are to remain at approximately the same strength from year to year.  I will deal first with the land forces.  There is, evidently, amongst all Parties and sections in the House general agreement that our land force should be about 12,000 or 10,000. Therefore, it is a matter for congratulation that the Minister, acting on the advice obtained from his advisers in the Department, has been able to come here and show how a reduction can be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this debate, questions of policy regarding defence have <Col N="876" /> been expounded.  I do not wish to go into policy except to say that in this country, as in every other country, defence policy and the amount of money that you are going to spend on it are complementary and supplementary to each other.</P>
    <P>You start off by deciding what is going to be your attitude towards the defence of the State, and you can either go all out and act as a big belligerent nation, or you can decide to demobilise your forces altogether and maintain nothing better than a super police force; but we have to cut our cloth according to our means.  We have here a State with a small population and a small amount of revenue and we have decided in these circumstances that we will have forces of a certain kind and a certain character. No intelligent person can for one moment advance the theory that the force we have, the force for which we are catering in this Estimate, would be effective to defend this country at a moment's notice.  If we were to take any other point of view, we would, in my respectful submission, be guilty of a gross absurdity.</P>
    <P>Once we go beyond creating here a force which is in a higher category than the semi-military police force, we naturally look for what will be the best cadre and the best foundation of a small permanent defence force, and I congratulate our Army authorities on having produced that little force; but do not let us forget that it is nothing more than a token force, if any war were to break out to-morrow.  Remember also that we have no precendent in history, ancient or modern&mdash;and one usually looks to history for precedents in the events of mankind&mdash;for the situation which has existed on this planet for the last ten or 15 years. Some people might say that there are such precedents in history, where big empires, such as the Roman Empire and others before it, disappeared and little nations on the borders of the Roman Empire disappeared with it, but you have never had a precedent in history for the warfare of to-day. Warfare to-day is a matter of mechanics and machinery, a matter not <Col N="877" /> of the foot soldier armed, in the old days, with a spear and shield and, later on, with a rifle, but a matter of tanks and other expensive equipment.  We cannot afford to have more than this little token force which we have and the Minister, through his advisers, has been able to present to the House an Estimate for the efficient running of that little force and to effect a substantial reduction of very nearly £750,000 in the cost.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree that we can envisage any certainty of any particular happening in the near future.  In 1914-18, you had a certain type of war.  The recent war was another type again and any future war which takes place will be quite different, and must of itself be quite different, from any war in the past.  We can only plan in relation to the experiences of the past.  We have this little force.  Let us cherish it and let us do all we can to let the world know that this nation of ours, which has a high reputation for military valour, both at home and abroad, by its efficient running of this little force, is a peace-loving nation and prepared to demonstrate that fact by whatever that little force can do, if it is called upon to do anything, as I hope it will not be and as it was not called upon during the last war.  Let us have that little force as efficient as it can possibly be, but let us not think of that little force, which, so far as the military end of it is concerned, is of lesser strength than that of an ordinary infantry division, as something in the nature of an expeditionary force to be landed on some foreign shore with artificial harbours created to receive it and transports to bring it across.  Let us regard it only as a token of our individuality as a nation, a token of our determination to resist the invader, and let us realise that there is nothing detrimental to our national honour or national dignity in seeing that that force is run on the most economical lines possible.  What is the good of getting up here and saying that those persons who ask for a reduction in the Estimate are trying to sabotage the nation or that we owe it to the people in the past not to look to other persons to defend us?  Let us face facts here.</P>

      <Col N="878" /> You cannot defend this island with 10,000 or 12,000 men, a few gunboats and a few aeroplanes, but you can defend this island and this nation, and the only practical way it can be defended is by keeping up the morale of the people who live in this State and not turning a debate of this kind into an attempt to embarrass or bewilder the Government and the Minister for Defence.  It is the first duty of us here, who hold the purse-strings of the nation, to see that our money is wisely spent, and if, in the course of an examination of that subject we come to the conclusion&mdash;as I think we, as a deliberative Assembly, will come to the conclusion at the close of this debate&mdash; that there is going to be no interference whatever with the efficiency of this little defence force by cutting off £750,000, then it is our duty to do so. The logical sequence to the other argument would otherwise be for speakers to get up and say that we want another 10,000 men, another £4,500,000, or that we want another 20,000 men and another £9,000,000.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic in this matter and cut out all this business of Party politics and of what we said from these benches the last time the Estimate was discussed or what was said on those benches.  We are here in the year 1948. The Irish Army, the Irish Defence Forces belong to all of us, be they on the Government side or on the Opposition, and it is not right or proper to suggest, because a new Minister comes along and with the advice and the expert advice of his General Staff brings a new mind to bear on the subject, that there is anything unpatriotic in docking some £750,000 which can be well employed upon other Estimates and in building up a better second line defence than we would have if the money was spent as was originally intended under the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Let us, as I said before, face realities and do not let us, as some speakers here have done, conduct this debate as if we were the United States of America with its iron, its coal, its steel, its population and its dollars behind it.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House more than five minutes.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a grievance in the Army that was brought to the notice of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee quite recently in a very determined manner. I would ask the Minister to do something to stop the coercive methods used in trying to force married men out of married quarters, men who have nowhere to go, who cannot get a room or who cannot get a cottage. Long service men&mdash;and it is the real long service men who are entitled to a pension and a gratuity who are the victims&mdash;as a result of this coercive idea in the minds of whoever originated this method, are left without a gratuity and without a pension.  I never knew coercion like that to exist in any other Department of Government.  A man with a family who occupied a three or four-roomed flat in the married quarters gets a little time to get out when his time is up, but owing to the extraordinary demand for rooms and cottages and to the viciously high rents which are charged by people who may have a room to spare, the unfortunate victim who has served his country for 22 or 23 years has his pension stopped.  Who introduced this I do not know but it is in operation for the past 12 months.  I would ask the Minister to meet these men or their representatives and to give them some time longer in which to get accommodation from the public authorities or from private sources if and when it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there is no accommodation in this city for young people, elderly people, people with families, people with no families or newly weds. Does the military Department of the Government think it proper that we should force these men out, whether they have a place to go to or not, or force them to the border-line of starvation <Col N="880" /> by stopping their pensions or gratuities?  It is most unjust and I would appeal to the Minister to see that this method is stopped and that the persons concerned are left at their ease for a little while longer and that the gratuity which they earned and which their country owes to them or the pension which they earned and which their country owes to them will be paid to them without any further delay.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that out of the savings which he hopes to make, the Minister might do what the British Army has done and put up a fund of some kind in order to start a housing scheme for soldiers who have served their country recently or in the days gone by?  One country can do it, and if necessary a fund could be established with a couple of hundred thousand pounds and a housing scheme could be ventured upon for men out of the married quarters.  It would ease the situation very much on the public authorities, because families of all types and conditions are pressing for the inadequate accommodation which is being provided by the builders at present.  The City of Dublin wants at least 4,000 houses each year for the next ten years and we are getting only 400 houses.  I appeal to the Government in that direction to see that something is done quickly to remedy that condition so that the people who are clamouring for houses will get them and that the people in the Army quarters with rooms will be left alone for a little while longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister or others can reply by asking what is going to happen to the young married men who are coming in? Do we not want houses for them?  You must have married men coming in, but you must not provide accommodation for them by evicting others and sending them to the workhouse.  There are 28 families in the Dublin Union at present who cannot get accommodation, families who are anxious for it and who are willing to pay rent.</P>

      <P>I listened with very particular interest to the intervention into this debate of Deputy Sir John Esmonde and I was rather surprised that he should try to interpret the intervention <Col N="881" /> in the debate from this side of the House as being merely references of a carping nature and which he described as being lacking in cooperation. I wonder if Deputy Esmonde would read the debates on the Estimates for the Department of Defence for the past number of years and see if he would regard the criticisms that were levelled from this side of the House as being lacking in cooperation or otherwise.  I commend that to Deputy Esmonde because I propose to make certain suggestions which I hope will be regarded as constructive. I quite agree with Deputy Esmonde that those Deputies who have spoken and who have had experience of the Defence Forces know something about the conditions in the Army that prevailed during the time they were in the Army but there are others in the House who, if they were not themselves in the Army during the emergency, at least had very close connections with those who were in the Army.  One has contact in his public life with a great number of people from various walks of life who express certain criticisms and certain grievances.  One grievance has been alluded to by Deputy Alfred Byrne.  Those of us who happen to be in the Dublin Corporation know that a critical situation has arisen in the case of certain members of the Defence Forces who have served 21 years and over and who, being married, were given married quarters in barracks and who are now asked to vacate those quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think very little of the Deputy, if he is not prepared to produce <Col N="883" /> some evidence.  As far as I can understand, the intention is to bring the Army to a certain position, to bring it to as large a token force as possible within the limits of the expenditure that the Vote now covers.  I would suggest to the Minister, that being the position, the force should be put on a basis that every member of it would be most efficient so that in the event of stress or danger every member of the force, from the top to the ordinary private, could be regarded as an expert.  The Minister, in introducing the Estimate, pointed out that in his opinion in time of stress every member of the force could be promoted at least two ranks to take control of new enlistments.</P>
      <P>There is a matter that I would like to suggest to the Minister, a matter that I have raised before.  It does not follow that because I made the suggestion in previous years and it was not adopted that the matter cannot now be considered.  Certain members of the Army are trained in trades and when, having served an apprenticeship, they qualify, if you like, at a cost to the Army, they are employed as tradesmen at a nominal rate per day over the ordinary pay of the private.  I think that is quite wrong.  If a tradesman is bound to serve in the Army for a certain number of years&mdash;otherwise he will not get the trade&mdash;and if he becomes a satisfactory tradesman and, in the course of time, marries and has a family, 6d. per day or 1/- per day over the ordinary private's pay is not fair to that individual.  I would ask the Minister to see if that particular position can be reviewed so that a tradesman in the Army may get an increase in wages commensurate with the work he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the trouble is that the soldier is a tradesman of a different kind.  Let that point not be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the ordinary private is regarded as a tradesman.  I am talking of the soldier who is a carpenter or who is employed as a mechanic on whatever technical stores there are in the Air Force.  That <Col N="884" /> particular soldier should be regarded as a tradesman superior, from the point of view of the work he performs, to the ordinary private.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
      <P>There are in the Army now craftsmen, tradesmen, in whose case a year or two must run before their service is completed.  In some cases, these qualified men, for instance, the sergeantpilots in the Air Corps, are to be reverted to the ranks as ordinary privates and they will not be released from the Army to take up civilian employment where they are offered positions.  In one particular case I know of, a man who has merely one year to go, if he wants to get out now to secure the employment he is offered, has to buy himself out at something like £140 or £160.  In view of the economy which the present Minister is bringing about, he should take a new view and be somewhat generous with those people, present them with a year, allowing them to go on the reserve, so that they can go out and get employment, rather than revert them back to the ranks as an ordinary private, where they may have held the position of sergeant and, through no fault of their own but through the change of policy, they are reverted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The men have been informed within the last month and I ask the Minister would he not have that particular matter looked into.  Very few men are affected in this particular instance, and if it is possible to permit those who wish it to go out to civilian employment, by going on the reserve this year instead of next year, I would ask him to consider their cases.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions, I have drawn the attention of the Minister for Defence to what I regard as the unsatisfactory conditions under which our Army is housed.  I think the barracks, particularly those around Dublin, are things that have been handed down to us from a past way of living.  I would like the Minister to find out whether it is not possible to have better types of accommodation for the ordinary privates, more hygienic and more upto-date accommodation.  Some people have suggested&mdash;I see there is a Question on the Order Paper to-day&mdash;something that I probably raised two or three years ago, as to whether it would not be possible to vacate, say, a barracks like Portobello and hand that institution or set of buildings over to the Dublin Corporation to alleviate the housing shortage, or to the Department of Health to create even some temporary sanatoria that are talked so much about as being urgently needed. Knowing the barracks as they are, and as there are many members of this House who know individuals who served in the emergency as volunteers or privates, we know there is nothing to shout about, as far as comfort or hygienic conditions becoming possible in those barracks, which were handed down from people who had a different idea of an army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan criticised what he described as the armchair experts on <Col N="886" /> this side of the House when they made certain suggestions and he made particular reference to Deputy Major de Valera.  He talked about a whole change that has come upon the world in the form of warfare and said that, if it came to our defending ourselves, we could do nothing, that we would have to depend on a group of nations to do the fighting for us and all we could do would be row in with them. Am I to understand that his interpretation of the position is going to be accepted as the correct one&mdash;that the only alternative to not having a big army is that our people, the manpower of this country, will in the event of a war be sent into other armies or under the control of other people, purely as cannon fodder?  Surely the position of this country is that whatever nucleus of an army we have should in any time of stress quickly take over the training of new recruits; that the defence line of this country is the resistance of the people itself.  After all, if a country is conquered, it takes an army of occupation to keep the people who are conquered; and if the people who are under the dominion of another force are able to resist and willing to resist, and particularly are trained or have people who can train them to resist, the survival of that country is sure in that way, even when its defence can be regarded as a failure.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Defence to consider the possibility of giving more attractive terms to the privates. I want to see the very best type of our people enlist in the Army, whatever its limits may be, with the best possible conditions and with some future for them in the shape of a career.  With the small numbers we will require under this new policy, we should be very careful to make what are likely to be the N.C.O.s of the future in time of stress the best type of person; and the only way we can do that is by getting those who are not forced to go in through stress of circumstances because of unemployment, or something like that.</P>

If he looks at the Book of Estimates, he will see a certain figure down for all ranks&mdash;12,000 odd&mdash;and a bit lower down he will see &ldquo;Deduct for numbers below strength, 30 per cent.&rdquo;  You then subtract that sum, and my predecessor's <Col N="888" /> estimate for the strength of the Army, leaving out the Construction Corps, was 9,358.  My Estimate provides for 8,594.  The difference is 764 soldiers.

      <P>It looks very well, but the new uniform is not being given to all branches of the Defence Forces.  I suggest that the new uniform should apply to all sections of the Defence Forces.  If a man feels that he is pleasantly dressed he will be much better; he will have a greater keenness of spirit, he will take more care of himself and of his uniform and he will even carry himself in a much better manner. I regret this change of policy in bringing the Army down in numbers.</P>
      <P>There should be some immediate consideration given to those men who have finished their period of service, particularly with regard to housing facilities.  The Minister should consider the men who want to get out now but who have a year or so more to serve.  Consideration might also be given to the difference between the rate of pay given to soldiers and what is given to tradesmen.  That should be investigated with the object of being more just from the point of view of payment for the work they do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some difference of opinion between various speakers as to whether there has been a change of policy.  The strongest criticism that could be levelled in reference to the Estimates&mdash;not so much against the Minister, because he has not had much opportunity to deal with the matter&mdash;would be along the line whether or not there should have been a change of policy.  Yesterday Deputy Vivion de Valera reminded us that we have the same policy now in relation to the basis on which our military expenditure is formulated as <Col N="890" /> we had for a period of 16 years.  During the 16 years there have been not only the usual year by year changes with reference to the development of military science and strategy in the use of our armed forces, but there have been almost cataclysmic changes in regard to the modern conception of armed forces used on behalf of a nation in defence of its rights.</P>
      <P>The fact that policy has not greatly changed in 16 years more or less implies that there has been no fundamental change in outlook.  In these matters Ministers are advised by our military experts.  Military experts have been so often proved wrong in history that civilians surely are entitled to ask for more information if they are sufficiently interested to seek it.  We have heard a good deal of criticism, especially by speakers in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The reduction in this Estimate is largely the result of closer scrutiny.  It is quite common in Departments to find that there is often a surplus allowed. In this case there has been merely a reduction of that surplus.  We have been informed that it is not intended to bring about any displacement of officers or men.  Actually the reduction in the total strength amounts to about 700.  It was stated that under the policy formulated by the last Minister for Defence the strength of the Army was to be 12,000.  It would be somewhat interesting if we were to discuss, not whether there is any reduction intended by the present Minister, but to what extent the last Minister could have achieved his figure 12,000.  In view of the attitude of many men who served during the emergency and who have since come out of the Army, and the manner in which the military mind has been displayed not only to men who are leaving the Army but to men who are still within the forces, it is somewhat unlikely that, without a very drastic improvement in the conditions of service of men in the armed forces, we would ever be able to achieve the figure of 12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is a matter that becomes important only when we have to deal with defence policy.  Having decided our defence policy, then we <Col N="891" /> would have to proceed to formulate the military policy that would necessarily arise.  The Minister has assured us that, so far as the reduction in the Estimate is concerned, it will not adversely affect existing officers or men. Under sub-head C it is proposed to reduce the original Estimate by £50,000. Will a similar assurance be given in respect of civilian personnel in respect of their employment, their rates of pay and their conditions?  Having had experience of the manner in which those who exercise authority continually take advantage of the ordinary civilians working in and around barracks, I can quite readily anticipate a similar situation continuing in the future.  It is as well to bear in mind in that connection that the majority of the civilian personnel working in military establishments must be included in wage adjustments now going through in relation to outside trades.  It is to be hoped that provision will be made to meet such increases for such civilian employees.  I hope that our recent experience will not occur again.</P>
    <P>There were small groups of tradesmen working in barracks who were left for nearly 12 months after the end of the standstill Order without any adjustment in their wages.  A month or so ago they were calmly told that the adjustment would date from the 1st January, 1948, instead of the 1st January, 1947.  When we come to deal with further adjustments in wages in these particular employments I trust that that experience will not be repeated. Under sub-head S there is a reduction of £60,000.  Again I would ask the Minister if that reduction will affect employment on the civilian side. I am not at the moment concerned so much with ministerial policy as with administration.  I feel that many of the difficulties to which Deputies have made reference during the course of the debate arise from administration and not so much from policy.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head X (1) I notice a provision of £24,000 for telegrams and telephones.  I do not know how that Estimate is arrived at but the figure seems to me to be somewhat high in <Col N="892" /> comparison with the Estimate for the Garda Síochána.  In the case of the Garda Síochána the sum estimated is £25,000.  There are over 1,000 Garda barracks scattered throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  They are all provided with telephone facilities as well as radio apparatus.  Why should a much smaller number of military establishments, which cannot have the same necessity for intercommunication as the Garda Síochána have, require an almost identical sum of money for telephones, etc.?</P>
    <P>References have been made during the course of the debate to incidents arising from the possession of married quarters by men who have retired on pension, or have difficulty in getting their gratuities and so on.  On an earlier occasion in this House I made reference to the fact that if we expected the citizens of the State to enter into the armed service of the State we should at least accord to them the dignity and status accorded to civilians.  To my mind, one of the greatest difficulties in securing sufficient recruits for the Army and maintaining its strength or encouraging interest in it as a career is this &ldquo;military&rdquo; mind or this peculiar attitude displayed towards men who enter the armed forces of the State.  I said on a former occasion that that attitude leads to an almost complete ostracism and is reflected at times even in the attitude of civilians.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Defence, Deputy Traynor, vehemently repudiated that suggestion and objected strongly to it.  But I still think that my interpretation is the correct one. Those men who entered the armed service of the State during the emergency complain bitterly of that &ldquo;military-minded&rdquo; attitude towards the lowerranks. That attitude is permitted to continue.  Even in the debate here in the last two days Deputies with experience in the Army during the emergency have themselves reflected that attitude.  I believe that some effort should be made to bring about a change.  Those who are charged with commanding the Army should be made to realise that they are dealing with human beings and that those human <Col N="893" /> beings are entitled to both dignity and respect.  I belong to a movement made up of a large number of men and women.  I have to deal with a body of men and women twice as large numerically as our present Army.  We have been able to maintain for each other a respect for each other, a sense of dignity, an understanding and a sympathy which is the only conducive way to working satisfactorily as a body.  Many of our people are called upon to make sacrifices&mdash;not perhaps of life and limb, but sacrifices just as bitter and heavy on themselves and their families as many soldiers make. If we have been able to establish that atmosphere in our own organisation surely it should be possible to establish it in an army.  In an army you have the added advantage that the people live together during the major portion of the day, are engaged in a common objective and imbued with a common spirit and with an identical <i>esprit de corps.</i>  It should be possible to get rid of this attitude displayed now towards the lower ranks in the Army. If we succeeded in doing that it would be a tremendous advance and we would see an improvement not only in the status of the Army itself but in the attitude of the soldiers towards their organisation.  More important still, perhaps, we would have a change of attitude on the part of civilians in whom a feeling still survives that the soldier is the &ldquo;shilling a day&rdquo; member of a foreign army.  We should do everything we can to get away from that feeling.  We should do everything we can to make the soldier a citizen.</P>
    <P>This &ldquo;military mind&rdquo;, as I call it, is possibly the outcome of an erroneous conception of military life.  I do not think any sensible man or woman can defend the use of military force merely for itself.  The idea of military force alone is a negative one and it is completely contrary to the whole purpose of creation.  It is something in which we have to engage through force of circumstances and we should regard it with a certain degree of reluctance. Perhaps some of the present unhappy atmosphere is possibly due to that wrong conception.  One finds it even in the petty conditions imposed upon <Col N="894" /> and treatment accorded to civilian workers employed around barracks.  I have already mentioned the type of thing where the ordinary adjustments in wages which were accorded in Government Department after Government Department during the past 18 months were delayed in regard to small sections of the civilian employees in the Department of Defence and then given from a much more recent date in comparison with employees in any other case.  Similarly in the case of a mistake made by those charged with deciding the particular rate of wage paid to civilian workers.  The mistake is discovered and a deduction is made in the case of the workers to recover the overpayment to such an extent as to seriously impair the economy of those workers.  No appeal would be listened to and no smaller amount would be accepted because of the danger that some of the men might be laid off. They were treated in the same manner as, possibly, a serving soldier in the same position.  If that had happened in ordinary civilian employment with an ordinary private employer the immediate reaction would have taken place and every fair-minded man and woman would have taken the part of those workers who were not responsible for the mistake which was made by some one else.</P>
    <P>About 1944 a group of men took employment in a Dublin barracks. These men were practically all Old I.R.A. men.  The suggestion was made at the time that there had been an outcry about these men and that work was suddenly made available to them because it was an election period. Whether that suggestion was true or not I do not know.  However, they were given employment at the rate of £2 10s. 0d. per week.  Representations were made and finally, last year, they found themselves paid at the rate paid to labourers in the City of Dublin. They were doing maintenance work in the barracks.  They were suddenly called in, told that they were no longer required, paid off and told that they could accept re-employment at the rate of £4 per week&mdash;almost a £ a week less than they were entitled to on the basis of the rate paid to builders' <Col N="895" /> labourers.  Whether that is suitable treatment for a corps of Old I.R.A. men or not is, I suggest, a matter for those who regard themselves as their comrades.  I have a very strong opinion on this matter and I feel it was an outrageous thing which could only take place where men are regarded as automatic machines rather than as men with certain dignities and self-respect.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made, somewhat indirectly, by Deputy Briscoe to the position of a soldier who had acquired the skill of a tradesman and was paid the nominal sum of 6d. a day for his trade class.  Deputy Cowan suggested that that soldier should be paid his full tradesman's rate and, in addition to that, his allowance for being a soldier.  That seemed logical to me.  We pursued the matter further and decided that the ordinary private soldier with no particular qualifications would be paid the ordinary general rate applicable to a general labourer and, in addition, be paid for his services as a soldier in so far as the ordinary private and tradesman are performing the work which is done by the labourer or the tradesman and, in addition, are giving service as trained military personnel.  Whether we will ever see that day or not I do not know.  Personally I doubt it but at least I can look forward to it.  Let us take, then, the position that has arisen during the emergency in which men were demobilised and it was a question of fitting them into civilian employment.</P>
    <P>A statement was made by the previous Minister for Defence very bitterly complaining about the attitude of the trade unions in this matter, and charging that the trade unions had deliberately refrained from helping demobilised soldiers to take up positions in private life or had deliberately erected obstacles or had refused to relax regulations.  The peculiar thing was that two weeks later the officers in the Army charged with assisting men to obtain civilian employment met representatives of the trade unions at a conference under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce to discuss this particular matter.  They had a list of 12 cases.  Those cases were <Col N="896" /> examined in detail with the assistance of the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and, having gone into them in detail, the responsible military officers were satisfied that in not one single case had it been established that the trade unions had prevented any of those individuals from securing employment.  I think even at this time it would be well if Deputy Traynor withdrew the statement because it was not true and it was not borne out by his representatives at that particular investigation. More work was done to try to assist demobilised soldiers and officers to secure employment and to fit them into civilian life by the trade union movement than by the ex-Minister or the Department of Defence.  Only the other day a man called to see me.  He was formerly a brigade adjutant.  He had had 28 years' service and was out of the Army for the past two years. Apparently he had not received much assistance from the employment bureau of the Army and he has only succeeded in that period of two years in obtaining employment in a semiclerical capacity doing work which any ordinary intelligent man could do with very little schooling.  He had actually offered himself for employment for wages as low as £3 per week.</P>
    <P>A man who was competent to act as brigade adjutant should be fitted into something more suitable to his talent, experience and service to his country rather than to have to offer himself, not merely for unskilled work of any character but at a wage which we term a &ldquo;scab wage&rdquo; and to work for £2 a week below what should be paid to him on an ordinary trade union basis.  That case may not be typical but it is a fact that the trade union movement recognise the service the men gave in the armed forces of the nation and in very many cases made possible provisions to maintain and keep alive their membership and to assist them in every possible way when they came back into civilian life and re-established themselves. That was borne out by the very officers charged by the agency set up to assist these officers to secure employment in civilian life.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that it does <Col N="897" /> not seem to me to be a very good justification for the continuation of a policy that it has been in existence for 16 years.  That has already been indicated in the course of the debate.  I feel that between this year's and next year's Estimate some means should be secured of reviewing that policy in the light of the world our people have to live in to-day.  There is a difficulty in the type of debate we have had during the past two days in which the Minister perforce told us that a certain policy has been adopted after consideration by the Government and on the advice of the military experts, but the type of policy we have to deal with is not merely for military experts or for the Government.  It is, in the first place, the question of the preservation of the lives and liberties of the citizens of this nation.  It should, therefore, be possible at least that the representatives of the citizens as a whole should be able to engage directly in the consideration of that policy and in such a manner as they would consider it representative of the citizens as a whole rather than of particular groups, because when that particular policy comes to be executed in actual armed warfare there will be very few party divisions left and the citizens will have to bear the brunt of that policy and its correctness and incorrectness so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>That is why I feel, on this particular item of defence policy, that here especially is a field of public policy where it would be very helpful to have something in the way of a committee of this House who could have the advantage of detailed and serious review of the whole position with the possibility of meeting face to face the actual military experts and have the advantage of their military knowledge and their information.  From that committee we could receive in the full House, a sufficient and adequate report for the guidance of Deputies in making a final decision as to what particular policy should be pursued upon which State expenditure should be based.</P>
    <P>One peculiar thing, I know, is that the whole basis of the present policy is the constitution and maintenance of a small highly trained force of officers <Col N="898" /> and men, which can be utilised to absorb and train a much larger force of recruits who would be brought in when they are immediately required or on the outbreak of an emergency. That is the basis of our policy.  That is the policy that we are continuing.  To what extent has that policy been related to our present-day position? Reference has been made to the change in the various political alignments that have taken place in the world in the last few years.  It seems to me that in considering our defence policy, we have got to consider the situation which exists in and about our own country. In the last emergency we faced the position of having to defend our neutrality by opposing every attempt to use our country either as a base for shipping operations or aerial operations. Deputy Cowan and Deputy Vivion de Valera entered into a discussion yesterday as to whether or not our neutrality was endangered during that period.  It is very difficult for the ordinary layman to answer that question because there seems to be some mysterious date about which the whole question hinges&mdash;the 4th June, 1940. However, that is not the important question at the moment.</P>
    <P>The important question is whether in future we can expect to be able to maintain our neutrality in the same successful manner as we did in the last emergency.  Personally, I have very great doubts and my doubts extend not merely across the Atlantic and into Europe.  I have the same doubt even in regard to the Government immediately across the Irish Sea because neutrality is not a question of deliberate policy.  Neutrality is part of military policy and military policy often becomes a question of life and death for nations.  From our own point of view, it seems to me that whatever our defence policy may be it should be conditioned on the desires and wishes of our own people, the desire to maintain their nationhood, their freedom and liberty of action.  It should be related to our own possibilities and should take into account the changing features of the scene in and around the shores of our own country.  Whether our island is to be used as a base of occupation in another world war, used as a base for <Col N="899" /> aerial activities or for naval warfare, are all different factors that have to be considered.  We have also to consider that there has been one very tremendous change that applies a completely different conception to the role of the actual military force of the country in this particular type of warfare. It was possible in the last emergency to consider the possibility of an enemy force landing on the shores of this country being held for a period by the actual armed force immediately available, and subsequently being further pinned down by our own professional Army, assisted and strengthened by the armed civilian forces that could be mobilised.  Possibly, as has been pointed out, the cost to the enemy might be so great as to deter him from pursuing the matter further.</P>
    <P>We have got an entirely different position to-day.  It is quite possible that one of the factors that would enter into the minds of military men in other countries would be occupation of a limited portion of our country as a base for military operations.  Under present-day methods of warfare that would not involve the landing on our shores of their opponents in any way whatever.  A statement recently made has been to the effect that the dropping of one of the latest type of atom bombs on the City of London would, as far as human life is concerned, mean the disappearance of the whole of the centre of that city.  Our population is only a fraction of that of the City of London, and for an external attacking force it would be only a question of what number of bombs would be necessary to release to bring about the disappearance not only of the enemy forces using this country, but also possibly the disappearance of the greater portion of the Irish people as well.  What particular value in that situation a small highly trained force is I do not know but we do want to get some clarification on the point.</P>
    <P>The new science of warfare seems to have wiped out completely the whole distinctions between the professional soldier, the volunteer soldier and the civilian.  In the last holocaust in many cases, it was the civilian who had to <Col N="900" /> stand the brunt and the strain of the struggle.  The peculiar thing was that the professional soldier enjoyed a much greater comparative degree of safety. That may again be the position which we may have to face in this country. We have got to face up to the position indicated by the Minister, that it is not now so much a question of military preparedness, military effectiveness or military equipment.  National preparedness involves the industrial strength of the country and its ability to feed the civilian population; it also involves the health and the morale of the civilian population.</P>
    <P>Why I am so dubious of experts is that only the other day a gentleman who was charged at the outbreak of the last war with supervising air-raid precautions and the safety of the people in London indicated in the House of Commons that an effective protection against the harmful effects of the atom bomb, so far as flash effects and radioactive effects were concerned, was a sheet of brown paper.  That is symptomatic of the mentality of experts when it is a question of the protection of civilians.  A sheet of brown paper might be quite effective as far as the civilian was concerned, but when it comes to the protection of the experts, it seems to be necessary to provide an exceptionally deep shelter. In our present position it is the civilian who has got to stand the real strain and stress for whom the real protection must be provided.  I do not think that sufficient consideration has been given to these new features that are going to arise in relation to our present situation. So many different situations may develop that it is almost impossible to find a ready-made, cut-and-dried solution for each and every situation, but it does seem to me that with the change that has taken place in military science, military strategy and the alignment as between nations to-day, our policy of concentrating on a small trained force of officers and men able to absorb a much greater numerical body as and when needed, does require further consideration and that we should consider the possibility, because it will be impressed upon us if the necessity should ever arise, of making it feasible for the whole of our people <Col N="901" /> to engage directly in the resistance to an invading force.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar thing that on the Continent of Europe during the recent war some of the most effective struggles made by small peoples were not made by their professional military forces but by the people themselves after the overwhelming of the professional military forces, and that response grew out of and was built up by the instinctive love of freedom of the people themselves. We had the same spirit indicated in our own country during the course of the national struggle.  It seems to me, therefore, that we should give consideration to that particular factor in relation to the future.  If that is the position to which we have to face up, if we feel that the overwhelming of our small professional group of soldiers will be so instantaneous as not to offer any effective check, then as a nation we have to decide whether our resistance is to be continued or whether we are to submit to force.  If we are going to continue resistance on the basis of our citizens as a whole, it would be neither fair nor proper to leave them unprepared, to leave them to depend in present-day circumstances upon the ability of the national forces of the country to maintain and carry on the resistance and, having been disappointed in that respect, to find that the burden and responsibility were placed upon them without any preparation.  I believe that we should give consideration to these wider factors.  They are factors that govern and influence and condition our whole defence policy.</P>
    <P>Our defence policy is the basis on which we must judge our actual military expenditure.  If we do not do that, I have a feeling that, to a certain extent, we are spending money, not on a basis that is justified in relation to the position of our country and the desires of our people to maintain their independence and freedom from subjection to any foreign force, but on the basis of providing a machine in which a career can be offered to that small number of individuals who seem to have a liking for military life.  I think the figures given us as being necessary <Col N="902" /> to maintain that force are in fact the figures necessary to maintain the higher ranks of that force, to maintain a certain number of officers, etc., and that they are not in any way justified by the actual needs of the country in relation to defence or to the military policy that flows from our position as a nation in the field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity afforded me to-night to speak on the Army Estimate.  As one who served in the Defence Forces during the dark days of the emergency when we were threatened with invasion by different beligerents.  I should like to mention a few of the grievances from which I believe the lower ranks suffered during that period of emergency.  Much has been said to-night on the broader aspect of defence policy, ranging from Deputy de Valera, who visualised an army here on the same scale as one would expect such a nation as the United States to have, to the Deputy who wanted to abolish the Army altogether.  In my belief, both of these views are wrong.  To abolish the Army would be nonsensical. To hope to have a large army here is equally ridiculous.  We are not in a financial position to support a large army.  Our industrial development is such that to-day the most we are able to produce in the way of armaments are shot gun cartridges.  I presume, therefore, that the House is prepared to face facts, that we must have an army at least, and that that army must be as small as it possibly can be without losing its efficiency. At the same time, this small army can be expanded rapidly in case of a further emergency, which we all hope will not come, but of which there are grave signs at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Traynor and Deputy de Valera expressed great concern at recruiting being stopped for the Army. From my own personal experience and from the experience of other men who served during the emergency I say that you would nearly have to lasso a man to get him to join the Defence Forces to-day.  Perhaps it will be said that I am rather biassed as a result of being in the Army during the last few years, <Col N="903" /> that I am too much inclined to speak of things with which I am very familiar.  Perhaps that is so.  But I believe the Minister is adopting the right attitude at the present time, because I am sure that the Minister would, first of all, like to examine and find out the reasons why recruiting has not been so successful as Deputy Traynor would have wished it to be. Deputy Cowan referred to the fact that soldiers were absolutely &ldquo;browned off&rdquo;. I concur with Deputy Cowan in that remark, but I do not intend to give specific instances in order to bring that home to the minds of Deputies.  There are, however, such small things as this. If a soldier wants to have a grievance rectified and wishes to see an officer, he must get an N.C.O. to escort him to that officer.  In other words, in this small country of ours, a private soldier is not allowed to approach an officer. That type of discipline has come down from olden times or it has come, I should say, from the Army across the sea.  Things like that have been remedied in the British Army, and yet in the year 1948, in the case of our own small Army, we are prepared to put up with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned one other small matter last night.  During even heat waves a soldier had to wear his overcoat buttoned up to the neck.  That was done purely and simply because some brass hat at the top considered that the soldier looked much smarter with his overcoat wrapped around him like a blanket.  I was very hurt last night when I heard Deputy Traynor refer, in disparaging terms, to the junior officers and N.C.O.s, the men who took part in the large manoeuvres of 1942.  At great length he went on to explain that, owing to the short time available for training the junior or lower elements in the Army, they were not able to carry out successfully the large manoeuvres of 1942.  He said that the great manoeuvres were a failure because the rank and file and the junior officer element were unable to carry out orders from the top.  I think that is a slur on the men who took part in the manoeuvres, who went through rigours almost as severe as if they were <Col N="904" /> engaged in actual warfare, and on men who to-day are suffering from tuberculosis as a result of being exposed to hardships and as a result of the whims of the senior brass hats who had wonderful plans in their heads to prevent this country from being invaded. Perhaps, I should say that, instead of blaming the men at the bottom for being unable to carry out the orders, we should attach a little blame to the gentlemen at the top who never saw a full brigade or a full division in their Army career before, and who, therefore, were not in a position to handle the great number of troops they saw in front of them for the first time.  I think that the blame for the failure of the manoeuvres can be laid at the door of the brass hats just as much as it can at the door of the rank and file.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the Vote to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  It was referred to by Deputy Larkin&mdash;the question of housing for married men.  I am very interested in this because we cannot expect troops or soldiers who are worried about their wives and children to give their best service to the Army, particularly if they are expecting that one day the family will be evicted.  It was only last week that in the town of Galway I saw a soldier's family of three, the youngest child being 18 months and the eldest five years, evicted on the street by the local authority because, as the county manager informed me, they were just sub-tenants.  I do not propose to go into the question of sub-tenants.  I think that when I brought this eviction to the notice of the Army authorities the least they should have done was to provide alternative accommodation for that soldier's family in Renmore Barracks where such accommodation was available in the form of a hut.  I was informed that the local O.C. in command of the post had not authority to allow a soldier's family in, even in the direst emergency.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to this: that it should not be necessary for the O.C. of a barracks to have to write to Dublin for permission to let in a soldier's family that <Col N="905" /> had been evicted from a house.  I am well aware of the difficulty of securing houses not only for troops but for civilians.  I am also aware of the unevenness in practice on the part of the officer in charge of the barracks when asked could he possibly let this family in.  I say that because only six months ago a soldier's family consisting of nine children was evicted from a house in similar circumstances in Galway.  It was a bad day.  The county manager also on that day had no alternative accommodation for the family, so the officer who was acting in command of the barracks rightly, in my opinion, took it upon himself to allow this family of nine into the quarters in the barracks which were available at the time.  I have been informed on good authority that this officer, although he made formal application on the following day for permission to have the family there, was hauled over the coals, and not only that but that he was threatened with court-martial.  I am also informed that on his personal file to-day there is a reprimand for having carried out what I consider to be only his duty.  I would ask the Minister that, if it is true such a record is on his file, that it be removed, because I see no reason why an officer or a man should be penalised for carrying out a Christian act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to repeat that in my opinion the broad aspects of defence should not be made the subject of Party politics.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Larkin's suggestion &mdash;that a committee, representative of all Parties in this House, be established to examine questions appertaining to defence and to the Army, in consultation with the experts in the Army and with experts on defence itself.</P>

      <P>There are only two matters on which I wish to touch.  When one finds a rather severe cut of £750,000 in the Estimate for Defence, it must make one a little nervous. Listening to Deputy Larkin speaking about the position which would obtain here in the event of another war and with the knowledge we gained during the late emergency as to the first impact of any invading force being borne by the civilian population and <Col N="906" /> knowing the manner in which we were able to arm the young men who offered their services in 1940 and 1941, one cannot but feel somewhat nervous about the effect of such a cut.  I do not pretend to know what arms are available in this country to-day, but I view with alarm a reduction of £63,000 in the amount set aside for that item, when I know, as every other Deputy knows, that the most we were able to offer the young men who came into the Defence Forces in 1940 and 1941 was an old sawn-off shotgun and a few rounds of buckshot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw that condition of affairs prevailing for nearly 12 months and then there came along a handful of American rifles, a very poor imitation of the old Mauser rifle, and we got 30 of them to every 100 men.  We all know that conditions have changed in the world and we all know that any invasion in future will have to be borne not by the Army but practically by the civilian population, and I should like the Minister to give some information to the House as to what arms are available in case of an emergency similar to the recent emergency. I think that is a fair question to ask and it is only fair that we should be told.  I do not pretend to have any wide military knowledge but, as one member of the L.D.F., I know what I got to arm the young men in 1940 and 1941.  I know also that we were very glad to collect here and there around the country some of the old rifles which had been dumped for 20 years and to serve these out to the men.  I would rather have to depend on the old rifle, bad as it was, than on an old shot-gun and two or three rounds of buckshot to keep out any invading force.  From that point of view, I am concerned about this reduction in that portion of the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin was very anxious about the conditions of pay and employment <Col N="907" /> of the civilian employees in the Army.  The Minister, if I read the Press aright, assured us last night that there was to be no reduction in civilian employment in the Army.  How they can employ the same number and give better conditions and pay and, at the same time, reduce the Estimate by £50,000 passes my comprehension.  It is something which somebody else may be able to explain better than I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious about that particular item.  The civilian employees employed around Spike, Haulbowline and other defence areas around the coast are, in the majority of cases, either Old I.R.A. men or exmembers of the Defence Forces, and I am sure the Minister will not like to see one of these men put out of employment.  If it is a matter of over-estimation, as Deputy Davin says, I am prepared to accept it, but I certainly am troubled, and honestly troubled, in that connection.  I do not want to see any man who gave his services to this nation in other days, or during the past 20 years, disemployed now because of any wild idea of economy.  Neither do I want to see what I have brought to the notice of the Minister's Department on a number of occasions, namely, the dissatisfaction that exists amongst the personnel on the launches plying between Cobh, Spike and Haulbowline.  They did not receive the increases in pay which other employees in other branches received and I should like the Minister to ake that matter up.  If he wishes, I will send him a few of the number of letters I have received, stating that the matter was receiving attention, and he can have another go at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave the broader matters of defence in the hands of those more capable of dealing with them.  We are all anxious, and gravely anxious, that the independence of this nation, so <Col N="908" /> dearly won, will not be filched from us at any period by reason of any false economy and I am sure that all Parties in the House will view the matter in that light.  There are Deputies on both sides who have served with distinction in the Army, who know the needs of the Army and of the nation in the military sphere better than I do.  I never pretended to be a military expert and I do not expect ever to be a military expert.</P>
    <P>I will leave that in the hands of Deputy Davin.  I would like to hear from the Minister something definite in connection with the warlike stores and equipment which would be available in the event of another emergency in this country and what arms would be available for the civilian population who will have undoubtedly to bear the first impact.  I should also like some definite assurance in regard to the civilians employed in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Sitting here since 3 o'clock in the afternoon and listening to the many speeches and even disputations, I began to think that if the compartment set aside for the accommodation of the public were filled with those young men who responded to the call of the Dáil and served their country and they were listening to the speeches delivered here in which their interests were so involved, I could imagine each and every one of them saying: &ldquo;What blatant hypocrisy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one point which I wish to capture, because God knows it is nearly nauseating to listen to all the words that have been mutilated.  When the previous Government appealed to all sections in the Dáil to make a unified effort in appealing to the country and to the youth to man the Bearna Baoighill, we forgot Party politics and each and every one of us in our public or our private capacity joined issue on the platforms and appealed to the young men, telling them that danger was nigh and that we hoped that they would be inspired by the sacrifices, the patriotism and the glory that characterised the men of 1916 and subsequently. We made this appeal and we got from the then Government definite and specific promises that when the whole thing would be over and when a <Col N="909" /> normal and peaceful atmosphere had again resumed here, their services would not be forgotten and they would have first and prior call for all positions which individually or collectively they would be able to fill.  Did we fulfil that bond?  No.</P>
    <P>There are before my mind here and now two specific occasions in my own county which came under the jurisdiction of the council of which I am a member.  One was a certain position for which an ex-soldier with all the essential qualifications and with magnificient service in the Army applied.  We as a council tried to put him there, and one day a deputation of ex-Army men came before us.  We gave them an assurance that we would do anything we could to honour our bond, the bond which was supposed to be honoured by the Government in the spirit and the letter.  They gave the position, however, to a young man who never gave any military service and the matter was reported to the then Minister, who is here now.  He took no action to see that justice, equity or fair play was done.  Our promises to the youth of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it would be right to let an Estimate of this importance pass without saying a few words.  Many of the things which I wanted to say have been said already.  At the same time I think that in a matter of fundamental importance whoever sits on this bench should express his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not, I suppose, a country in the world whose people at the present time are not grumbling and complaining about the very heavy burden which the support of their defence establishments entail and I think that it is not anything new in history that that should be so.  Notwithstanding that, all the time, we see nations keeping up their defence forces.  There must be some reason for it.  It is not for fun that people bear the burdens to the extent to which they are bearing them, but because they see that there is no way out of it.  Some people think that there might be a way out of it if we could get collective security by means of leagues of various kinds such as the League of Nations, or the United Nations' Organisation and by coming to some arrangement by which the preservation of the liberty of the people would be secured other than by means of force.  Up to the present that has failed.  No doubt if it proceeded it would lighten these burdens tremendously, for if nations could agree upon some sort of international code and obey it and had need only for a police force to deal with occasional recalcitrants the burden on the nations of the world would be very much less.  But, we have not arrived at that stage, unfortunately, and the people who have to spend their time in armies and the money that has to be spent upon the equipment of these armies are not made available, as they might be otherwise, <Col N="911" /> for productive work which would improve the general standard of living.</P>
    <P>However, the fact is that such an agreement has not been reached and that the nations have to-day, as they had in the past, to try to provide, each one, as best it can for its own security, On the smaller nations the burden is perhaps greater, relatively.  There is this further factor about it, that the larger nations, by their very strength, have got a certain satisfaction in the expenditure, that they feel that the expenditure, if it is liberal enough, will be sufficient to provide them with the security they require.  The smaller nations have the feeling that, even if they make the utmost provision that their means will allow them, it does not provide them absolutely with anything like a guarantee that their independence will be maintained by means of the forces which they raise.</P>
    <P>We are a small people; we are in that category; and one of the first difficulties we have to meet in providing for defence is the impression that, because we cannot guarantee absolutely by the forces which we can raise to protect ourselves efficiently, at least to the point at which our independence would be absolutely guaranteed, we ought not to have any forces at all. That is the first thing that we have to deal with as far as the public mind in this matter is concerned.  Because we cannot provide absolutely and completely a guarantee for our effective defence, should we give up the idea of defending ourselves at all?  Should we simply, tamely, submit to whatever aggression may come against us?  I doubt if there is anybody in this country who, if that is put squarely to him, would take the view that I think has been suggested by one or two of the speakers here and say that we should just tamely submit, that we should allow any aggressor that comes along to take hold of our country.</P>
    <P>We have got then, I think, to agree that we ought not to take up that position, that we ought to do everything in our power to defend ourselves. The suggestion that we should allow ourselves to be defended by somebody else is, of course, foolish. <Col N="912" /> Who is going to defend you for your sakes?  Nobody.  If any other Power defends you you may be perfectly certain that they will look for recompense one way or the other.  They will take possession of you and, if they do, they will use the men whom you will not use to defend you; they will try to compel them; and the moneys that you are not prepared to spend, they will force from you.  It seems to me that it is just foolish to suggest that we ought to allow ourselves to be defended by other people.</P>
    <P>I think it is our plain duty to provide to the utmost in our power for our own defence.  That is fundamental.  If we want to provide for that, we must pay the cost, we must maintain the forces that are necessary to do that as adequately as we can.  Of course, there is a limit.  If there is a question of insurance, the ordinary man insuring his property or his life has to take into account what his income is.  He has to ask himself to what degree he can diminish his effective income for the day in making provision for the future.  But this matter of defence is a matter of life or death, ultimately; it is a matter of independence or dependence; it is a matter of having your own will, your own policy, made effective or being subject to the will of another people.  When provision is made for defence what it is being made for is to preserve the right of our people to decide their own policies in their own way.</P>
    <P>What is that worth?  Nobody can give an exact estimate of it.  The only thing we can all agree upon, I think, is that it is worth making the utmost sacrifice that will ensure it.  Now, we are in a position that people in this country have not been in, perhaps, for generations.  We have passed through a time of crisis, a time of a great world war which was raging about us.  We have got experience from that. We know in general what are the issues that will have to be faced.  That experience ought to be made available, not merely for our people at the present time who are growing up and may not have understood it, but for the future.  One of the things that ought to be done is that those of us who <Col N="913" /> have lived through that and know what it means ought to hand down our experiences and try to make these experiences valuable for the people who come after us.</P>
    <P>The experiences that we have had are these: That, when a great crisis arose we did not have the forces which we should have had to meet the emergency and to save the nation.  At a certain time, if we had not built up quickly our forces, there is not in my mind the slightest doubt that there would have been pressure brought from the point of view of trying to get possession here and to make good that which we had not done for ourselves. We ought not to face that situation again.  We ought to make sure that there will be no inducement to any outside Power to supply here, at any rate, the garrison that will effectively protect this country in so far as we can do it.</P>
    <P>That matter was studied by people who had lived through the emergency, who had seen what the difficulties were, who had experienced the dangers that resulted from inadequate preparation in 1940 and 1941.  I can say this of the General Headquarters Staff, that they were just as anxious as any member of the Government not to put undue burdens upon our people in the way of supplying money.  From the financial point of view, they were as anxious as anybody else but they were, of course, anxious to do their job properly.  We in the Government, having examined the matter with them, came to the conclusion that if we were going to provide a reasonable force we would have to have that minimum amount which has been mentioned here.  It is true that the Estimates do not provide this year for that.  That was because it was considered that recruiting during the year would not come up to that amount.  If that is the attitude of the Minister, we have no complaint about it.  But, our attitude was that if we could get up to that 12,500, which was the minimum set by the Headquarters Staff, who again we believe were cutting it down to the bone, then we should try to meet it. If the Minister is of opinion that the Estimate is simply designed to meet <Col N="914" /> the amount we can get, and that it does not mean that he is not going to work up to that figure, then we have no complaint.  But, our complaint is that the stopping of recruiting suggests immediately that that is not his objective.  Nobody, of course, can say absolutely what the amount is but we have had a responsible body of men, being told that it had to be brought down to the minimum, going through it and estimating that the least regular force which would enable us to utilise our manpower in case of danger by expansion was the amount that was mentioned there as the establishment. I think the House would be wrong in approaching this from any other point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has suggested there should be a committee of the House. What is the Government but a committee? Whatever Government is in office, it is in fact a committee of the House, got by the majority deciding upon it.  That committee has all the opportunities of examining every figure that the Minister for Defence puts up.  If the Government wants to have in front of it any officer of the Department, or desires to have any examination carried out as to any of the figures that are given and the justification for them, it can do that: and I suggest that that is the proper way of doing it.  The Government has its responsibility.  They can go into it in detail and that is the right body, which represents this House as far as the detailed information of the figures is concerned.</P>
    <P>However, I am giving the view, which was the view of the last Government, that the responsible Headquarters Staff of the Army had carefully considered the need of cutting the figure down to the bone.  The figure they would ordinarily give, if that consideration were not there, would be much higher, of course.  The question is as to whether it is safe to continue cutting down.  Is it safe to stop recruiting at the moment?  I do not think it is.  I think the world situation is not such as to justify us in thinking that an emergency might not occur within a year, or two or three years.  No one can say exactly when, but anyone who <Col N="915" /> looks at all at the world situation knows that there is a dangerous situation ahead.  We are told, of course, by the Minister that if an emergency did arise we would have flocking to the colours all the young people in the country.  It is quite possible that that would be so, but surely that only means that you need a bigger standing force, if anything, to handle them, so that these people's lives may not be put unnecessarily in danger, that they would be equipped and be capable of being directed, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is for every country to balance as to what it can afford.  I would like if the Minister could get for me&mdash;I did not like to bother him privately during this debate for it, but it is one of the things which could be obtained easily&mdash; the comparative figures as to the relative costs of defence in this country and other countries, whether large or small. I think it would be found&mdash;that is my view, anyhow&mdash;that the cost of defence here is relatively much lighter than it is either in the larger or the smaller countries.  Switzerland is one outstanding example&mdash;a small nation that has been able to preserve its independence through a long period.  It has maintained that by continuing a policy of neutrality.  That policy was guaranteed by some of the larger Powers, but the people of Switzerland had to pay heavily for it.  They had to have universal service and relatively very heavy expenditure on their defence forces, but would you think that there is any person in Switzerland at the present day, or that there was anybody during the last war or before it, who would regret that expenditure, seeing that it guaranteed one of the means by which they were able to maintain their independence? Switzerland would be regarded, as the result of continuous freedom from attack&mdash;though possibly other characteristics would account for it, also&mdash;as one of the richest countries in the world, a very rich country from the point of view of the wealth of the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>I am trying to argue the case that, in this matter of defence, we ought not be cheeseparing.  I agree with the Minister that it is the duty of the Government <Col N="916" /> to see that every £ is well spent.  If there is any extravagance of any kind&mdash;for instance, money spent unnecessarily on telegrams or communications, as somebody said to-day, or money spent on transport unnecessarily &mdash;then by all means go into that and stop it.  But in stopping recruiting and in endangering our being able to expand in times of crisis, a big fundamental mistake is being made; and I urge very strongly on the Minister and his colleagues to reconsider this particular matter.  It is very easy to appeal, as is being done, in a spirit of braggadocio in one case and sneers in other, to people who do not think these matters out and who are living quite careless of the issues that are involved.</P>
    <P>After that point regarding manpower in our regular Army, I would say by all means expand the Volunteer forces or the Local Defence Forces, by all means try to do that; but the Minister will find he cannot do either without the expenditure of money.  To handle this, as has been indicated already in this debate, it is necessary to to have your reserves as well.  I agree with Deputy Aiken that it is a terrible mistake not to call up the reserves for a refresher course.  I think it was found last year that the officers who had not been called up for a number of years lost a good deal of the value of the refresher course, as they had gone rusty.  If people can go rusty in a year or two, we run the risk of allowing that to occur by not bringing them up this year.  That is apart from any question of contract with the men themselves.  That aspect of it should be borne in mind, as to the extent to which there is a contract with the individuals in the reserve, who make personal arrangements ahead of time regarding the month for which they are likely to be called up and who suffer inconvenience and probably a monetary loss as well.  The question of contract should be considered. It is on the Army and the reserve we have to depend in a time of crisis to train the new volunteers likely to come in.</P>
    <P>With regard to weapons, it has already been pointed out that there is a nice balance to be carefully considered. <Col N="917" /> There is no doubt that, if we had enough Lee Enfield rifles in the last war, even if we could substitute automatic weapons, we would be in a better position than that in which we found ourselves when we were begging from Britain and America to get rifles to put into the hands of the L.D.F. Surely we should not allow a position like that to arise again?  Even though we may have to dispose of these weapons at a loss, if we get better ones, it is very much better that we should have that second-class equipment rather than no equipment.</P>
    <P>If we have second-class equipment, it is part of our general protective scheme, part of the insurance we will have to pay to preserve our independence. I say that, if there is a doubt in things like that, do not leave people unarmed and unequipped, with the idea that there may be a more perfect weapon developed which would render obsolete the weapon you are thinking of using.  I strongly urge the Minister to see that the best available weapons are put in the hands of our men, so that there may be at least an effective personal weapon for each individual who is likely to go into service in time of crisis.  We ought to do that, otherwise we will not be in a position to defend ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if there is to be war it will be a total war.  There is not the slightest doubt that that is the sort of war we shall have to face. In that case one of the big problems will be the possible evacuation of the civilian population.  It may be that evacuation would be regarded as so impossible or ineffective that it might be better to let the population stay where it is and hold its ground.  There was a period during the emergency when one of the most baffling problems was that of evacuation&mdash;getting it done quickly and thoroughly.  It is a horrible problem to take people from a large centre of population and put them into the country and look after them.  With the development of modern methods of warfare it is a problem which will have to be considered.  The main point is, can you get a method of protection by which people can be left where they <Col N="918" /> are, in their own homes?  That would be the best way, but could we have a method of protection for them?  If there is not such a method of protection, is it not likely that the best thing would be to evacuate people from these large centres of population and have them dispersed throughout the country?  That is a matter which would come under the question of general defence.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to buildings, and there was a suggestion that the Army ought to dispose of its barracks and buildings.  That would be a terrible mistake.  During the emergency one of our principal difficulties was to get adequate housing for the troops.  The existing buildings were designed originally for certain purposes. They may not be perfect and may not be the type of buildings that we would have if we were to build them afresh, but they were designed for certain purposes and it would not be desirable to hand them over for a purpose for which they were not designed and that they might fulfil very inadequately, and leave our troops without necessary accommodation.  The Army ought to be very slow in parting with any of its property.  It should only do so when the Minister, the Headquarters Staff and the Government have satisfied themselves that they were not going to serve any useful Army purpose in the future.</P>
    <P>Volunteer and local halls were mentioned for the F.C.A.  I am all in favour of that.  The only trouble with us was that materials were difficult to get and there was such a housing shortage that it was a question of what should come first.  Housing for ordinary individuals&mdash;people getting married&mdash;constituted a very difficult problem, particularly with the shortage of materials, and one could not embark on anything like a large-scale building of halls in local areas in which volunteers could be trained.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to guard duty.  The Minister should consider whether there is such necessity for doing guard duty, and the effect of that duty on his forces.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion reference was made to finance control.  I support the appeals made to the Minister <Col N="919" /> on that point.  I thought we had effected an arrangement with the Department of Finance that when estimates had been reached a detailed reexamination before orders were placed would not be carried out.  Surely the officers in the Department of Defence ought to be trusted not to incur unnecessary expense if something happened in the meantime which did not justify it?  I urge the Minister strongly to see that the Finance Department will not dictate the equipment necessary for defence purposes&mdash;that that should be decided by the Minister and his Department and the Government and, when a Government decision has been taken and money voted for a definite purpose, it ought not to be in the power of any officer in any other Department to cut that down.  That should be done only by the Government that has taken the decision and approved the estimate.</P>
    <P>It may appear to be a good thing purely from the Finance point of view, but that point of view can be met adequately by the care which the Minister and his officers are supposed to exercise with regard to expenditure. They cannot expend anything that has not been agreed upon by the Government after full consideration between the two Departments.  The Government having agreed on certain money being made available for equipment and other purposes, the Department ought to be free to place the orders. Very often what appears to be a saving does not in the long run prove to be one; very often a suitable occasion is lost and I believe if you were, over a period, to take the losses that accrue through not making orders at the proper time and put them against the savings that appear to be made, you find the balance is not, as it might appear to be, on the Finance side.</P>
    <P>The responsibility ought clearly to be placed upon the Minister and the Department of Defence to see that if anything arises which might suggest that they should not go ahead with certain expenditure, they will use their own discretion.  In that way it will not be necessary to have that doubly checked by the Department of Finance, with all the delays that accrue through <Col N="920" /> doing so and all the dissatisfaction and heartburnings that might arise from it. Dissatisfaction naturally arises on the part of officers who are trying to make the most of the money given them and to use it to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The Construction Corps was set up for a very special purpose.  It was put on to the Army, not because it was felt that the Army would ordinarily be the very best body to handle it, but because there were certain rules of discipline involved and it was largely a question of discipline.  There were certain rules of discipline that could be enforced by the corps being associated with the Army that could not be applied otherwise and it was felt that it would be better to have these young men associated in that way with the Army.  It was a question very often of building up their bodily strength and putting them in a position to use their bodies in different forms of employment afterwards.  If that corps is to be removed from the Army, I suggest that there should be a reconsideration of the problem that arises in connection with young people of that kind because, having no employment immediately available, they may deteriorate.  If they are brought under the discipline of a corps of that kind and taught to do certain work and are given reasonably good conditions, they will in my opinion get a proper beginning in life.  I think that it is worthwhile that that should be examined.  I think, however, that there will be a fairly general agreement in the House that we ought to have a defence force which will enable the nation to defend itself to the utmost in time of crisis. Half measures are the worst of all and we should not put ourselves in the position that if and when a crisis comes and we are called upon to defend ourselves to the utmost we are not able to answer that call.  The question of defending ourselves to the utmost brings up the thorny and complex problem of compulsory military training. I think that in a time of real crisis the nation, if it were to defend itself to the utmost, would be compelled to take steps in that particular direction and to introduce a measure of that particular kind.  Fortunately during the late emergency we were able <Col N="921" /> to get on without that, but it was in many cases unfair to put the burden upon those who volunteered.</P>
    <P>The question now is whether in a time of real crisis in which the nation would be called to defend itself to the utmost it would not be necessary for us, as it is necessary for other nations, to have compulsory military service. If that is envisaged the best way in which to reach that objective is to have training in advance.  If you do not do that it means that you will throw away valuable lives.  Consequently that is a question which must be examined very, very carefully and a matter which must be discussed and considered.  I know that compulsory military service has many objections and I know that it means a certain hardship on the individuals and upon families, but if we are serious about defending ourselves to the utmost in a time of real crisis then I think sooner or later we shall have to face up to that situation. I am attempting to deal with this matter as realistically as I can.  I am anxious that the people should consider this matter and think it out for themselves and that they will not adopt the policy of hiding their heads in the sand and ignoring the realities of a situation which may gravely concern this country should there be another major cataclysm.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question as to the best method of defence, I think most people would admit that if a nation can maintain its neutrality that is all the better.  On the other hand, people may feel that the issue involved is one which immediately concerns them and that they ought to play their part in dealing with that issue.  The question then arises as to what is the best way in which to do that.  Obviously that is a matter which ought to engage the attention of the Government.  I would urge that in the actual position of world affairs as it seems to me now&mdash; I do not think I am an alarmist, but we have lived through one crisis during which I think no imputation could be made upon us that we lost our heads just as I do not think it likely that we shall loose our heads in any crisis that may arise in the future&mdash;it would be a very bad policy on the part of the Government to ignore that which other <Col N="922" /> nations think is threatening.  It would be very foolish on our part to adopt that policy.</P>
    <P>Anybody who studies world affairs must realise with a great degree of certainty that there is even now a situation which can very easily develop into war.  To use an old phrase, it is not wise to wait until the drums beat to sharpen one's tusks.  We must prepare. We must have a long-distance preparation, if you like, so that if there is a war in which our interests are affected and our principles are threatened the nation will find itself in a position in which it can defend itself to its utmost.  It may find itself on one side or the other, or it may be neutral.  In any case the foundation of all defence is that you will set out to defend yourself to the utmost of your power.</P>
    <P>Most of the people on the opposite side of the House have suggested that the speeches made here have been of a Party character.  I have tried not to introduce any partisan element.  I do not think the speeches have been of a Party character.  Talking about cutting down expenses must make for popularity.  Cutting down expenses is something that is immediate. Maintaining our defences is something that is more or less in the offing.  Remember, that the people who will blame you most if you do not make adequate preparation are just those people who now complain most bitterly about the cost of that preparation.  If an emergency arises and you are not prepared those are the people who will blame you and say that you were blind when everybody else knew that this was threatening, but you did not see it and you did not make preparation.  You run the same risks of government and you must face up to the same unpopularity as you would if you were making provision, for instance, for supplies.  If you are preparing for an emergency and you make provision for supplies and the emergency does not arise you are compelled then to dispose of those supplies at a reduced price and you are blamed because you made a provision which proved unnecessary.  It is, however, much better to be blamed for making a provision that ultimately <Col N="923" /> proved to be unnecessary than to be blamed for not making provision for something which ordinary people were able to foresee.  I would urge that if there is a possibility of mistake in this matter it would be better that the mistake should be made in making the provision rather than in neglecting to make the provision.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that we ask the Minister to take this Estimate back to his colleagues and reconsider it.  It is in that spirit that we ask the Minister to put the question to himself as to whether the present, with the world situation such as it is, is an opportune time in which to cut down our Defence Forces, in which to stop recruiting and not to call up the reserve.  My view is &mdash;and I think it is the view of most people in this State&mdash;that the situation is such that that is not a wise course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has lasted for a considerable time and I shall find it difficult physically to deal with many of the points raised in the course of the debate.  I feel bound to say that I found the debate in an overall sense helpful in the main.  On a question such as this in times such as these it is natural that there should be and will always be a wide divergence of opinion.  I would imagine that, no matter what line a Minister takes in dealing with the Defence Forces in uncertain times, in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> way Deputies on all sides of the House will hold either that the Minister is not making sufficient provision or that he is making too much provision and spending too much money before he was sure that there was a necessity for that expenditure.  Leaving the money out of it, the actual alteration made in the Army as between the proposals which the Book of Estimates suggests to the Dáil and the proposals which I am submitting to the Dáil is scarcely worth the expenditure of five or six hours' time wasted in debate.  There is a difference of 764 troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking for 764 fewer men in uniform over the 12 months of this year than Deputy Traynor was looking for. <Col N="924" /> With that reduction in our armed strength of 764 men no adult in this country, irrespective of Party, or his own personal feelings or his own personal fears, can hold for one second that that difference or 764 men above that strength is going to make the difference between security and slavery.  That is too absurd to expect anyone to accept. That is the difference in manpower. The difference in money is very considerable. I suggest to the Deputies opposite and to all the Deputies in the House that if a nation is to prepare to face aggression we must build up the health and the strength and the very life of that nation.  Similarly, in a country facing modern war we must regard the civilian walking down the street outside the barracks as just as much a potential defender of the country at war as the man in uniform. There is, in modern life, a responsibility on any Minister for Defence to see that such a balance is held and that adequate and sensible precautions are taken outside the barracks to meet a war situation as well as inside the barracks.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition made very many speeches during the last war advising the people of the dangers round the corner and of what should be done to meet those dangers.  His colleagues in Government did likewise. I would venture to say, without carrying out a count, that if those speeches were examined it would be found that he devoted far more time, far more words and far more speeches in advising the people with regard to the growth of crops in order to obtain the maximum amount of productivity inside the country than he devoted to the recruitment of men into uniform.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore, no matter where we may sit in this House, the fact that the best part of 100,000 of the manhood of this country have left it and that there is not an unlimited pool of men to be drawn on either by the factory, the field, or the Army.  We should remember that there is only a limited pool of men there and that it has nearly run dry.  We should remember, too, that this is spring-time and that if the war that some people fear does break out we will have even greater difficulties with regard to supplies than <Col N="925" /> we had during the last war, because the relative might on sea and in the air of the nations nearest to us may not be as strong as they were in 1939 or 1940.  However, I have been advised, and other members of the Government have been advised, by responsible Deputies opposite who participated in this debate to learn from experience. I think the ex-Minister for Supplies would agree that there was a bigger danger to our people during the recent war of our supply lines being interrupted or completely obstructed than there was of military invasion.  The Leader of the Opposition referred a good many times to the stoppage of recruiting.  I do not know whether he got that out of the newspapers or where exactly he got the information that recruiting was stopped.  Recruiting has not been stopped but a very expensive recruiting campaign has been drawn to a close.  The best part of £20,000 was spent on recruiting publicity, flamboyant posters of one kind or another, and it was not showing anything like a return commensurate with the money expended on it.</P>

      <P>A certain number of recruits, be they few or many, are dribbling into barracks every week.  A colleague of the Leader of the Opposition knows that if you do not keep a certain amount of recruiting continuously, with an Army attested on a short-term attestation basis, very rapidly we might find ourselves far below danger level and in danger of having no Army at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The big recruiting campaign was stopped but we are accepting recruits.  It was stopped because&mdash;whether it was on account of the season or on account of the diversion of the General Election&mdash;there was not the normal inflow of recruits that we should be entitled to expect for such a vast expenditure.  In addition to that, minds had not been made up with regard to what exactly our strength target would be for the year.  It seemed to me to be unwise to be spending big money on a recruiting campaign <Col N="926" /> when we had not made up our own minds as to what our target was to be or how many men we expected to get.</P>
      <P>There have been some references to conditions inside barracks, common to the people inside and the people outside, with regard to the overholding of married quarters in barracks.  Deputy Byrne, in particular, seemed to think that it was a fairly outrageous thing that the Army authorities should take any steps or threaten to take any steps to get possession of houses built and maintained for the wives of serving members of the Army.  I think, looking at it from a humanitarian point of view&mdash;and I would say that the outstanding humanitarian in this House is Deputy Byrne&mdash;that it does not matter very much whether civilian Black or soldier Brown is left homeless.  There is only the one house.  It is occupied by a civilian.  If we put the civilian out we let the soldier in.  If we keep the civilian there we keep the soldier out.  There is a complete breakdown on the part of the outside authorities to keep abreast of the demands of the poorer members of the civilian population for houses.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate lowly-paid married soldier or N.C.O. should not, however, be made pay the penalty for all that negligence.  Still, it would appear all right that the city manager or the corporation or other outside bodies should be free to evict people because regulations of one kind or another are broken while the Army must be expected to placidly put up with the completely chaotic condition inside barracks where soldiers cannot occupy soldiers' houses and where these unfortunate men, putting up with all the rigours of discipline and the annoyances of barrack life, have got to live very many miles away from their wives and their children, with very short leave periods and are only in a position to see their wives or their families very occasionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I asked the Taoiseach if it was with his <Col N="927" /> approval or consent that a member of the Government recently attended a commemoration ceremony at which, according to a newspaper report, an appeal was made for support for an illegal organisation, and if he would state what was the Government policy in this matter.  I submit, Sir, that I did not get an answer to that question. The Taoiseach raised an entirely different matter&mdash;the attendance of Ministers at ordinary functions.  I am not concerned with that at all.  I know quite well that a Minister can go to an ordinary function.  What I am concerned with, and what I think every member of the House should be concerned with, is the fact that any member of the Government should attend functions at which appeals are made for support for an illegal organisation. The Taoiseach's attitude was most extraordinary and it would certainly be taken as an indication, so far as the Government is concerned, unless the Minister is repudiated by the Government, as an encouragement to those people who are seeking to bring young persons into this illegal organisation. I was told that the Minister was going to these functions for 25 years, but he is not a Minister for 25 years.  We know that for a long time he occupied a very prominent position in that organisation, but he has been out of it now for ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not since the civil war.  I was in it when there was any fighting to be done but not when there was murdering going on.  I want to assure the Taoiseach, whether he believes me or not, that I do not raise this matter in any Party spirit.  I raise this matter purely on the ground of public interest.  I think it should be the concern of every member of the House that this organisation should not be allowed again to raise its head. I am quite serious about that.  We had a very tough time, as everyone knows, in recent years in dealing with this organisation.  I must say that during the war years we got full co-operation from all Parties in this House and it <Col N="928" /> was not in any Party spirit that I raised the matter.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach and of the House to the fact that there have been three public appeals for recruits for this organisation since the new Government came into office.  There was a meeting in Cork at which an appeal was made, another in Tralee, and there was this one in Glasnevin.  I submit to the House that it is a very dangerous situation if we encourage the growth of that organisation.  I do not want to bring out any of the past actions of members of the Government but I think we are entitled to ask that when Ministers take office they should accept the full responsibilities which their acceptance of office implies.  I must say that I was amazed when the Taoiseach said that the attendance of this Minister at that function was more conducive to public peace and order than my action in raising this matter.  It puzzles me to know how that that could be.  It appears to me that if that is the attitude of the Government and of the Taoiseach, it is going to be very hard to keep order in this country.  I must say that I do not envy the job of my successor, the Minister for Justice, if that is going to be the position.</P>
      <P>This organisation, as everybody knows, caused no end of trouble.  When we assumed office we released all these political prisoners.  We did the best we could to conciliate them.  Our gesture was taken as a sign of weakness and the result was that after we released these people, there was a big influx of young persons into this organisation in 1932.  We were finally forced to take firm and strong action to keep them down.  It is deplorable if there is going to be a recurrence of these illegal activities.  It is in that spirit that I raised this matter and not in any other spirit.  I have no intention of trying to score points against anybody but it is certainly a disturbing thing to see that a member of the Government can attend such a function and more disturbing still to see that the Taoiseach should meet us in the manner he did.  He met us in a truculent manner, a bad-tempered manner, and I am surprised at his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> We have been asked for help in public speeches made by members of the Government.  I can certainly tell the Government that, as far as this particular matter of the preservation of peace is concerned, they can rely on the co-operation of this Party; but I would ask them, for goodness' sake, not to allow a recurrence of what took place during the time that we had to deal with this organisation while the war was on.  I do not think there has been much of that trouble since.  I would say to the Minister for Justice that he is going to have a very difficult job indeed, if an organisation which had such relations with the Guards in the past is going to be allowed to raise its head again, and I do not know how the police are going to be expected to deal with it.  I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that the Government is not going to allow this thing to continue.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. All I want to say is what I said earlier, that we should endeavour, as far as we can in this House, to forget a lot of these past differences and this ill-feeling. I do think that the Deputy who has just spoken has done neither himself nor his Party any good by raising this matter in the way he raised it here.  For many years these Easter commemorations have been held and it is spiteful, malicious and mean for a Deputy, like the ex-Minister for Justice, to raise a matter here this evening in the same language he used in this House on a number of occasions when he was defending actions in this House which horrified the people of the country.</P>

      <P>May I say, if there is anybody in this House doubtful about the spirit which actuated the ex-Minister for Justice, that I know <Col N="930" /> exactly the motives which prompted his raising the question this evening? We had to face in the Government a terrible duty during that period.  The anxiety of the ex-Minister for Justice and myself is that young people may not be led again by any misunderstanding into such an organisation; that they will be told and know from the start what they are doing and what it will involve for them ultimately. We have had a very sad and terrible experience, an experience which we hope will not have to be met by future Governments.</P>
      <P>The aspect of this question which disturbs the ex-Minister for Justice and which disturbs me equally is that a statement urging recruitment for this organisation should be made without any repudiation by the Minister who was present.  I know the difficulty that there is in doing so.  But surely in this House at any rate there ought to be some indication that it was not with the will of the Minister who was present an appeal of that sort was made.  Surely that is reasonable in order to save the young people who might be brought into this organisation, to save any future Government, whatever it may be, or the present Government, as might happen, from the terrible experience that we had to face as a Government during that period. I hope it will be approached here in that spirit and not in any Party spirit.</P>
      <P>I should not wish any body of men a worse experience than our experience in dealing with that particular matter during the emergency period.  I would live all my life and everything that happened during it over again without any qualms rather than have to face that particular experience.  It is in the hope that any future Government may be saved a similar experience and that the young people who might be brought into that organisation will be saved such an experience that we are raising this matter.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Boland intimated his intention to raise the matter on the Adjournment I must say that I was profoundly disgusted.  It appeared to me that sufficient public damage had been done by the mere fact of his having put down this <Col N="931" /> question without having the type of the discussion we had here to-night. Since it came into my office, I have asked myself what was the purpose of the question.  Since this afternoon I have asked myself what was the purpose of having this discussion on the Adjournment to-night.  Deputy Boland said, with all apparent signs of sincerity that he was not raising it in a Party spirit.  Let us accept that assurance from Deputy Boland and let him consider has he in fact not done very great damage by the type of discussion we had to-night and the ill-feeling that may be caused throughout the country.  We have been the Government for just over two months, and I can assert with confidence that during that period there has been a time of peace in this country which has not existed since the establishment of this State.</P>

      <P>Again I assert my confidence that as a result of this Government's coming together here in these last few months we will see the <Col N="932" /> end of the gun in politics in this country.  Deputy Boland, and I think the Leader of the Opposition also, referred to the attendance of a Minister at this meeting.  I think the House and the country will take confidence from the presence of the Minister for External Affairs at this meeting.  As a responsible Minister of this Government he would not have attended any meeting or continued his attendance at any meeting which would have in any way jeopardised the security of this State or the maintenance of peace and order.  I have the utmost confidence in the fact that because he was there we have nothing to fear and that is why I said to-day to Deputy Boland, in reply to one of his supplementary questions, that far more damage was done by his question than could possibly have been done by the attendance of the Minister at this meeting, whatever it was.  I would have stated here to-night my view, which I formed since this afternoon, that this question was put down and was raised again on the adjournment in a mischievous spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
