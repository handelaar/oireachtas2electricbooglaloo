      <P>It is proposed to take the business in the following order, Nos. 3 and 2 on the Order Paper.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was referring to the position that might obtain if we were not able to continue to send the supplies that the Minister for Agriculture thinks we will send. According to Article 8, if supplies are not up to expectation, this agreement must then be reviewed.  I take it when they say &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo;, they mean the prices that have been fixed for our beef. It was Deputy Fagan who stated that if it were not for the scarcity of shipping we could increase the numbers of cattle sent to the Continent and there get 5/- or 6/- per lb. for our beef.  If shipping improves, however, and the production of our beef does not come up to the expectations of the Minister for Agriculture, I wonder what price the Irish farmer is going to get for the beef he produces.  Is there any guarantee that prices which have now been fixed will obtain if we, for instance, are not able to send 450,000 cattle, as we sent last year?  If there is a further reduction in our cattle exports, is any minimum figure fixed before this question of prices is further reviewed?  We have not been told these things and it is a question, I think, that should agitate the minds of the representatives of the people of this country, particularly those representing the agricultural community.  It is a very important matter and one that seems to have been overlooked by the Taoiseach when he was opening the debate.  From the agricultural point of view it is very important, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> The differential between Irish-breds and English-breds has been removed. After the agreement of 1938, because of the differential, there was a great increase in the exports of cattle from the Twenty-Six Counties to the Six Counties.  In 1939 we exported 21,975, but in 1942 we exported 67,907 cattle. Whether these went through legitimate channels or not I do not know, but I take it that they did because I took these figures from trade statistics.  I wonder how many cattle were smuggled across the Border because of the differential.  Now that the differential has been removed, will there be a great danger of further smuggling?  It would be very hard to distinguish the difference between a bullock bred in Cavan or Monaghan and one bred in Antrim or Armagh.  Cattle bred in Northern Ireland are still entitled to the same price as the English farmers get, showing that there is a differential, even in this country, between the Twenty-Six Counties and the Six Counties, that the northern farmer is in a better position than the farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Agriculture went over to negotiate an agreement he stated that he was going over for the purpose of placing the price of Irish cattle on a level with English cattle.  He has failed to do that. According to the London edition of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> for 17th June, 1948, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You have been buying from us for God knows how long, and we are old-fashioned people who would like you to get the first share.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We should also be able to double our beef exports within two years. I ought to add that this is not all virtue on our part, because the continental market might last not more than five or ten years.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is upon the expanding capacity of the British stomach that we depend and the bigger it grows the better we shall like it!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> In addition to making that statement, the Minister has made several others &mdash;that he wanted the price of Irish beef to be on a par with the price of English beef.  He has failed miserably in that object.  We are still behind to the extent of that 5/-.</P>
    <P>In this agreement, that one should imagine should be placed before this House in such a way that we would all know its implications, we find that, although we are giving foodstuffs to Britain at a lesser rate, according to Deputy Fagan, than we could get on the Continent, we have not been told in terms of meals and fertilisers what Britain is giving to us in return.  If we are to have that great expansion that the Minister for Agriculture desires and that we all desire, there must be something given in return.  It has been claimed by the opponents of tillage in this country that our fertile lands have deteriorated as a result of wheat growing.  If they have deteriorated, it was in a good cause, to ensure that the people would not die of starvation.  If we are going to change our farming economy and produce cheap beef for the British, it is up to the British to make some provision to help us to produce that beef.  The only way they can do it is to help us to restore the fertility of the soil by giving us additional fertilisers.  We have no fertilisers.  The lands of Ireland cannot continue to produce unless they are nourished and that can be done only by applying artificial manures.  I have been nothing in this agreement to indicate that Britain is giving us any additional quantity of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in regard to bacon.  We have been told that we can produce bacon at 225/- per cwt. and send it to England, that we will have an export trade in bacon.  I must only regard as a fool any man who says that, without telling me how it is going to be done and where he is going to get the feeding stuffs.  If bacon is to be produced on the agricultural produce of this country then I can tell the Minister for Agriculture that that object of his will also be a failure because, at the price he states he can obtain for potatoes and the price that he told us Messrs. Guinness can give <Col N="2310" /> for barley, any man who is able to get 50/- per barrel for his barley and £11 or £12 a ton for potatoes, will not produce bacon for export.  It is very ridiculous to state that we will produce bacon on these products, having regard to the prices that obtain for them and the prices that obtain for bacon.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister for Agriculture as the representative of the agricultural community in this Government. The people of the country know him.  We know how he is regarded in the country as a result of many of the statements he has made during the past four or five months.  We know how ridiculous he has been.  The farmers of Ireland are beginning to see how ridiculous he is but I wonder do the people sitting on the benches opposite, mainly professional gentlemen, know how he is regarded and I wonder how they regard him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard.  If this country wants to make progress and if we are to have the development in agriculture that we desire then I would say to this coalition Government, find somebody who knows something about agriculture and put him into that position.  Do not have a man there who is going to ruin the whole economy of agriculture.  That is what will happen if the pronouncements of the Minister for Agriculture are carried out by the coalition Government.  That is staring us in the face.  We know the outlook of the farmers.  There is no security, no stability.  They do not know from day to day what statement may be made or what decision may be arrived at by this Department.  We need a responsible man in that position.  If there is a responsible man in that position the agricultural community are prepared to do as they have done for the last eight or ten years, that is, to produce.  The people on the opposite benches have not short memories.  They know how the agricultural community, when the appeal was made to them at the outbreak of war, went out and stood in the first line trenches.  They know when we were challenged in 1933 and in 1934, when it was a question of standing by our rights regarding the annuities, how they stood.  These people are prepared to do the same in regard to agricultural production as they did in those years but they require direction.  I submit that the gentleman who now occupies the position as Minister for Agriculture cannot give them direction.  Until a change is made in that position, I have no hope for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say, as I said last night, that the agricultural community desire agreements of this type in normal times but at a time like this, when there are abnormal conditions all over the world, when it is a question of finding the best market and the highest price, it is not opportune for the representatives of this country to make a long-term agreement for four years, not knowing what might happen regarding the economy of agriculture, not merely here but all over the world.  We are now confined to a <Col N="2312" /> price, confined to an agreement, stipulating the numbers to be exported, and unless we conform to the stipulations in the agreement, there is a possibility that the whole matter may come under review at an even worse time than the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with the agreement from the point of view to which the majority of speakers have addressed themselves but rather to try to deal with it from what I might call the obverse side, which I think is of equal importance to the positive features which we have been already discussing.  It is very interesting to listen to farmers discussing agricultural matters but the most peculiar thing I notice about such discussions is that the farmers do not seem to be able to agree even amongst themselves as to the technique of their own industry.  I am very reluctant to intrude in a discussion of that kind because frankly I am ignorant about the main elements of that industry but it would be a great help to those, who more or less have to present the consumer's point of view, if we could get some agreement from farmers themselves, if not on the politics of the industry, at least on its technique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as farmers suffer from this disability, it seems that the Fianna Fáil Party have a similar difficulty in regard to the agreement.  Since they have taken over the duties of opposition, it is very noticeable that on quite a number of important issues there seems to be a very wide divergence of viewpoint amongst leading spokesmen of the Party.  On different occasions the comment has been made from these benches that a different approach seems to be made by Front Bench speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party to the various problems that have come up for discussion.  The same picture has been presented in the present debate.  On this side of the House we may have certain difficulties associated with the grouping together of separate organisations.  Fianna Fáil does not suffer from that difficulty.  It is a single monolithic Party, and the only difficulty from which it suffers is that it does not yet seem to have made up its mind as to the policy to pursue <Col N="2313" /> on this matter.  We had a very fairminded speech made by Deputy de Valera.  The whole implication of that speech was that while the present agreement may not have given us, from the point of view of the different groups in this House, all that might be desired by each group, we had got to consider the agreement from the standpoint of the conditions under which it was arrived at and of the responsibility to be carried by those who participated in the negotiations. Finally, he wound up with the note that if there is nothing in the agreement that should be objected to, then the natural course is to agree to the agreement.  That seems to be somewhat different from the line pursued not only by some of the back-benchers, but even by some of the leading spokesmen of the Party.  It would be particularly interesting to hear Deputy MacEntee on the agreement, in view of the opinions which have already been expressed by various members of the Party.</P>
    <P>On an issue such as an agreement between two countries, there seems of necessity to be a wide ground on which different viewpoints can be raised because embodied in that agreement are points of view not merely of immediate concern to the country as a whole but directly affecting the economy of different sections of the industry, affecting the interests of the producer as against those of the consumer, and, therefore, there is room for wide, and if you like, honest divergences of opinion so far as the agreement as a whole is concerned, but it seems to me that one of the main aspects has been overlooked.  That is that while it is quite correct that at the present time we are going to sell food in a market which is a sellers' market, we are not the only sellers in that market and that our total contribution to the total food requirements of the United Kingdom does not represent a very high percentage of the total.  It would not be an insuperable difficulty for the other parties to this agreement to find alternatives if we set down conditions which they looked upon as unacceptable. That particular position of the sellers' market may quite rapidly <Col N="2314" /> change and from that point of view the question as to whether the agreement should be a long-term one or a short-term one should be looked upon in the light of the position obtaining at present.</P>
    <P>From reports in the papers it is quite clear already that after the harvest this year quite a number of European countries that were widely devastated by war will have a fairly large agricultural surplus available to put on the market.  The particular goods in which they have a surplus are not at the moment the type of agricultural goods in which we are directly interested but if there could be such a rapid recovery in countries that were overrun, not by one army, but by a score of armies, so that these countries will be in the position that it is expected that towards the end of the year they will be able to export any agricultural surplus whatever, then it seems to me that the farmers who are studying this agreement should bear that particular fact in mind and realise that the sellers' market is not one that is going to continue indefinitely. Deputy Walsh referred to the question of the superabundance of food at certain periods and the shortage of food at others.  We may have a surplus of agricultural products in the present year but at the same time, so far as over world food production is concerned, we have statements made by authoritative people like Sir John Orr that there is a growing insufficiency of foods so far as the world is concerned.</P>
    <P>What strikes me as peculiar about Deputy Walsh's statement when he spoke of the years before the war when the 1938 agreement was signed, was that he spoke of a glut of food and of the fact that our national representatives had to enter into discussions on that agreement during a period when there was more food than was actually required.  I do not know that at any period in the world's history&mdash;and I have never yet known it even in our own country&mdash;that there was a surplus of food.  There is no surplus of food to-day and when we speak of exporting 400,000, 500,000 or 600,000 head of cattle to England or when we speak of exporting eggs, in the allegorical terms used <Col N="2315" /> by the Minister for Agriculture of drowning the British people in eggs, we should realise that every head of cattle and every egg exported could just as well be eaten in this country were it not for the fact that there are many people in this country who have not got the money to buy these cattle and eggs.  We have only got a surplus in this country for export because we have a very large number of our own people who are not able to buy sufficient food.  It is that particular problem I believe the Government has got to consider.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed in this House&mdash;we have it as a continuing situation in the country&mdash;the problem of the price of meat.  I do not want at this time to enter into a controversy as to whether or not the butchers are able to sell meat at the present price, but there is one definite fact and that is, that for the mass of working-class families meat is only known as a food three or four times a week and then in very small and limited quantities. That surplus we have of 500,000 cattle would disappear overnight if all our working-class families, both in towns and cities and in the rural areas, were able to obtain all the meat which they require and to which they are entitled from the point of view of bodily needs. The same is true as regards eggs.  We are told that children should be given eggs very frequently to build up their bodies.  It would be interesting to ascertain how many children in this country, which is a food-exporting country, and which hopes to drown the English people in eggs, do not see an egg from one week's end to another.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult problem to approach, but if the farmers have got produce available for the market and we, through our stupidity or lack of ability to manage our own affairs, leave our people in the position that they cannot buy our own produce, naturally we cannot say to the farmers that they have got no right to send the produce to the English market, where there are buyers waiting for it. It does seem to be a fantastic situation that while we are going out of our way <Col N="2316" /> to embroil ourselves in this legislative Assembly in arguments as to the price we should get for cattle, and whether we should have a long-term agreement or a short-term agreement and what type of cattle we should export, we are doing practically nothing to help sections of our own people who are not getting sufficient food.  That problem is something bigger than the agreement between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I have risen to speak on this matter, not to deal with the agreement itself, but to try to point out the kind of grave situation which may possibly develop if we do not have regard to the fact that the very success of the agreement, so far as it makes it possible to build up and extend our exports either to British or continental markets, will have certain definite effects on our own domestic position.  The very extent to which we succeed in improving the price of our cattle for export must inevitably have reactions on the price of meat sold in our retail shops.  To the extent to which we succeed in improving the price of goods exported, the price of goods will be affected on the home market, and all this will create a problem because of the quantity involved and the supplies available.  But if we do happen to reach a stage when we are exporting bacon, butter, fat sheep, lambs and other agricultural produce, we will also have to envisage the possibility of our success in reaching certain quantities for export of these particular products having a reaction on the price of these products in the Irish market.  It seems to me to be a very logical outcome and one which we will have to consider.  It is not one we can put off indefinitely.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we have not in this country a situation of equilibrium between wages and prices.  We have got at the moment, as a result of a period of very difficult adjustments, some of which have not been completed yet, a certain temporary stability between wages and prices.  That stability can only be maintained to the extent to which the fluctuations either in wages and prices are controlled and related one to the other.  We have already had a very small increase in <Col N="2317" /> the cost-of-living index which has not been sufficient yet to upset the temporary stability.  It has, however, been sufficient to awaken in the minds of a very large number of wage and salary earners a fear that they may have again to face the difficulty of a growing gap between prices and their incomes.  If we allow that situation to develop then we shall have a situation in which the very success achieved in external trade will give rise to severe economic strains inside the country and bring about a particular type of situation to which both the Ministers and members of the Opposition have addressed themselves, namely, the danger of widespread industrial conflict, of stoppages in production and the general uncertainly which may arise.  Let us be quite clear so far as the farmers are concerned.  Both consumers and workers wish to see the farming community get a fair, reasonable and equitable return for their labour.  Farmers, however, should realise that there is no point in their obtaining what may be fair and reasonable prices on paper, if these prices are outside the range of what the ordinary consumer can pay for agricultural products.</P>
    <P>In posing that problem it has to be admitted that it is not very easy to find an answer.  One of the things that strikes me about this particular agreement is, as was pointed out by the Taoiseach in his opening remarks, that we have had a change in the methods of trade during the world war.  As against the pre-war practice of buying and selling either by individuals or by commercial groups, we have now developed to the point of bulk purchases by Governments.  That in itself means not merely a system of improved organisation and simplification of buying or selling, but also a strengthening of the position of every buyer or seller.  In this particular instance we are dealing with the British Ministry of Food.  The fact that they are buying in bulk the major proportion of the products which we have available for export strengthens their position as a buyer, and, whether we like it or not, one of the effects of the agreement is that, by a roundabout process of bulk <Col N="2318" /> buying, the British Ministry of Food are competing as a buyer in bulk with our own consumers who are forced to buy as individuals.  In that process, the individual is going not merely to be pushed to the wall, but he will find prices forced up on him.</P>
    <P>Between our individual consumers and the British Ministry of Food we have another organisation&mdash;our own Government.  If we as a Government take the responsibility of entering into an agreement for the export of foodstuffs at certain prices and the export prices react on the prices in the retail shops here of many or most of the articles of food, it seems to me that the Government must accept the responsibility of studying the result of that situation and seeing if there is a remedy for it.  I agree that bulk buying calls for very widespread and detailed organisation.  But, once we have created the problem, we cannot very well say that, because the solution is difficult and will call for widespread exertion and careful thinking, we are not going to concern ourselves with that solution.  By our activities in one direction, so far as external affairs are concerned, we are creating the possibility of this problem developing internally.  If bulk buying is good business for the British Ministry of Food, it seems to me that our Government should examine that process to see if it is good business from the point of view of the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>I have already admitted my ignorance of agricultural matters, therefore I do not propose to discuss the question of prices or the possibility of the suggestion which I am going to make. It seems to me, however, that it is worthy of examination whether it is possible for this Government to buy products from our agricultural producers for export at a fair, economic and equitable price.  Then, because of their control of that bulk buying and, therefore, the position in which they will be as a bulk seller so far as the other party to the agreement is concerned, as we have got an equitable price for the producer, they should also be able to protect the price to the consumer.  It may be argued that that <Col N="2319" /> will have to be done by subsidies or by adjusting our external prices to a higher level than is already provided for.  I am not clear as to what may be involved in the matter, but I think it is necessary to warn all Parties in this House that if we allow a further rise in prices and in the cost of living to occur as a result of this type of agreement we will be playing with fire and creating very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>For a period of nine years we have had a situation in which the ordinary family depending on a weekly wage or salary have been going through a most difficult and perilous time.  They have a right to expect, three years after the end of hostilities, that some relief will be forthcoming.  They happen to be the one large section of the community which has been placed in that very difficult position and for whom no relief has been found.  The farming community&mdash;I was very glad that they were in a position to make the admission&mdash; have admitted that their position has been improved during the war years as against pre-war.  I would be the last to object to that.</P>
    <P>Their share of the national income has been largely increased.  There is, undoubtedly, among wide sections of farmers what one might call relative prosperity as compared with pre-war conditions.  Possibly, that prosperity has not extended down to every section of the farming community.  Certainly, it has not extended to the group so beloved of the Minister for Agriculture &mdash;the agricultural labourers.  There has, at least, been some positive improvement in the position of large sections of farmers as compared with pre-war conditions.  So far as the business community is concerned, there has been, in the case of some at any rate, a radical improvement in their financial position.  At least, there has not been such a worsening of their position that they have had to forego the ordinary luxuries, whether large or small, even though they had naturally to forego some essentials.  The only section of the community to which that happened was the wage-earner, the man working on a fixed salary or a fixed income. That section of the community has not <Col N="2320" /> been in the position of the business man or the farmer either to safeguard or to improve his position during those years.</P>
    <P>The farmers and the agricultural community are a very important section. Within that section we have some 140,000 men and women&mdash;agricultural labourers&mdash;who, because of their economic position and of having to depend on wages, do not in this particular problem stand on the side of the farmers.  They stand on the side of the group that has to depend on a weekly wage.  If we, three years after hostilities have ceased, permit a situation to develop because of our anxiety&mdash;an anxiety that is fully justified&mdash;to improve and give stability and security to the farmers and allow another situation to develop in which again we have the critical position that arose during the war in regard to a continuous rise in prices and of a growing gap between prices and wages and salaries and fixed incomes, then in that situation we are going to find that the domestic internal price that we are paying for this agreement is going to be a very bitter one.</P>
    <P>We have, as a national community, entered into an agreement of this kind on behalf of the farming community in so far as their trade and economy are concerned.  If, as a result of the success we make of it, we create a domestic problem, then the Government have the responsibility of facing up to that.  I would like to make it quite clear that one of the failures that I associate with the inter-Party Government so far, one which it has got to face up to, is that we have not yet found ways and means of tackling the question of prices and of the cost of living.  A question was addressed the other day to the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggesting that an effort be made to try and reduce prices by administrative act. He did not seem very inclined to consider the idea as a good one.  I am not concerned whether the idea is good or not, but it seems to me that somebody has got to say that whether prices are to be broken by the prayers of the Minister for Finance or by the threats <Col N="2321" /> of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by direct administrative act, at any rate they have got to be broken and started on the downward path.  I do not know of any example either here or in other countries where prices have started to fall merely because a group of well-wishers or good intentioned gentlemen engaged in trade or industry have decided to sell their goods cheaper.  I have not known them to fall either because the Minister for Finance or the Government has prayed for the good intentions of those gentlemen.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now on a matter that is rather wide of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am finished on that point.  I mentioned it because, as I have said, the effects of the agreement are not limited to external trade.  I have thought it well that someone here should give voice to the very deep concern that is present in the minds of large numbers of consumers at the moment and of the possible effect which this agreement will have so far as they are concerned.  In the agreement provision is made for the supply of certain quantities of coal here.  I wonder has anything been done in relation to the price charged to us for that coal as well as the differential&mdash;it is almost a penal differential&mdash;imposed so far as the price of coal to us is concerned as against the price on the British domestic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement provides, to a limited extent, for the carrying on of a carcase meat trade.  It would be of inestimable value to us if a greater proportion of our cattle trade was in the form of carcase meat, and especially at the present time, not merely because of the additional employment which it would give to our own people, but because of the fact that the hides and offals available as by-products would be left in the country.  I take it that the British Government realises that what is good for them is good for us, and that so far as this particular problem is concerned we have to be content with much less than what we could rightfully and usefully use for our own <Col N="2322" /> economy.  I think it is important that we should always bear in mind, not merely in the present situation, but as part of our general agricultural economy and external trade that every beast that is shipped out of this country as dead meat is of far greater value to us than the one that goes out on its four legs.  That is something that we should always keep in mind. Other countries have developed their agricultural by-products to a very great extent.  They are of tremendous importance to us, and what is of the utmost importance to us at the moment is to build up an ancillary industry to agriculture so as to provide employment at a period when there is a lack of employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made in the agreement to the canned meat trade. Disappointment has already been expressed in regard to the price.  Anybody with knowledge of how the price is made up must realise that the figure of 15/6 per dozen lb. tins in existing conditions is not in any way a remunerative price.  It is going to prove to be a difficult price if supplies of cattle are not readily available at an economic price.  It does seem to me that, in so far as the Minister for Agriculture has succeeded in obtaining a contract for the quantities set down in the agreement, it would be most regrettable if, for any reason, we fail to carry out the contract in respect of the specified quantities.  That situation could arise either because of a difficulty in obtaining supplies of the proper type of cattle for canning or because&mdash;and this would be even more regrettable&mdash;there was any lack of organisation within the trade itself.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture is already aware of the problem.  I trust that he will give his attention to this matter so as to ensure that this very valuable industry which we have developed in recent years will be sustained, and that it will not be allowed to get into difficulties either because of the position in regard to cattle supplies in the country or of inter-competition within the trade itself.  As I have already said, any failure in this matter would be more regrettable still if it were due to the <Col N="2323" /> lack of ordinary commonsense and organisation, so far as the canning trade itself is concerned.</P>
    <P>One particular point in the agreement that struck me as peculiar was that in the discussion on this agreement reference has been made to the 1938 agreement and in particular to those sections of the 1938 agreement which gave rise to difficulty in regard to whatever policy of protected tariff we might desire to pursue.  I do not think it is unfair to say&mdash;and I do not want to compare the two agreements&mdash;that certain clauses of the 1938 agreement gave rise to considerable anxiety among all sections of the people who are interested in the development of Irish industry, whether they be in the ranks of Fianna Fáil or of any other Party.  Any improvement that has been secured in the present agreement, any case in that difficult position, is to be welcomed.  I readily admit that the clause in the existing agreement is far from satisfactory.  It is felt that it does not remove the difficulties which were created by the 1938 agreement, and its effectiveness is dependent to a large extent on the agreement of the British Government.  However, in the introductory paragraph to that section reference is made to the desirability of maintaining the equilibrium of the balance of payments.  It then goes on to say that for that purpose a certain list will be made out and examined by the British Government in relation to the imposition of restrictions.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether those terms set down in that section are to be regarded as the only conditions under which we can formulate this list.  It seems to me as it is that, under existing conditions, in order to maintain a balance in our external trade, we have also got another important feature, namely, the right to take such measures as we deem fit and proper to foster, as a purely domestic matter, such industries as we think are essential to our national economy. That was, of course, at the base of the difficulties that arose in negotiating the 1938 agreement.  If we have not got that position clearly established&mdash;that <Col N="2324" /> we are a self-contained national State having control of the order of our own business&mdash;then we are going to have difficulties in the future.  The base of this amendment&mdash;if you like to call it that&mdash;of the 1938 agreement in regard to the imposition of tariffs, mainly on the temporary question, is that the maintenance of the equilibrium in the balance of payments is mutual both to the British Government and to our own Government.  That might possibly involve side-stepping the bigger issue and later when we require to impress the point that we have a right to take our own measures to protect and foster our own native industry, we may find we have committed ourselves to a position which would be very difficult to rectify.</P>
    <P>I have made a brief reference to the canned meat trade.  There is one important question I should like the Taoiseach to comment upon in his reply.  Are we debarred in any conceivable way from exporting canned meat to any other market outside the United Kingdom?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy now that we actually sold a large quantity of canned meat within the last few months to Czechoslovakia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's statement.  It is very important that that misconception should be got rid of because I have heard it expressed by those in the service of those associated with the canned meat trade.  It would be of great importance to us not merely to develop the export of canned meat to markets outside the British market over and above the amount contracted for by the British Ministry of Food, but particularly if we can find those markets in the hard currency area both from the point of view of getting hard <Col N="2325" /> currency and of developing our canned meat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer, also, to the relationship of both the 1938 agreement and this agreement to our internal industrial position.  I accept the statements that have been made by various Ministers in regard to the Government's attitude to the fostering of Irish industry by the utilisation of a proper control in the form of protective tariffs and quantitative restrictions. It is very important to realise that even the most hard-bitten protectors can make mistakes at times.  We have got to remember that the 1938 agreement was made by Deputy Lemass.  Nobody, I think, could accuse Deputy Lemass of being anything but one who believes in utilising these various measures to protect Irish industry.  Last year we had a position arising in the boot and shoe industry, the hosiery industry, and a number of others where, because of vast imports of goods from abroad that were manufactured in these industries, something more than a critical situation developed.  It was such as to almost imperil the continuation of these industries.  Those import licences were also granted while Deputy Lemass was in power.  I do not for a moment want to suggest that when those things happened under Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, they involved a complete and radical change of policy. However, in the case of the large imports that took place last year, especially in the boot and shoe trade, as far as I understand it, they arose through what might be regarded as a very simple mistake.  The mistake was, however, very costly and involved disemployment at one period of over one-third of our boot and shoe operatives. That is why, when speaking of this agreement and the easement of the position we have secured in relation to the 1938 agreement and the policy statements made by spokesmen of the Government in relation to their attitude towards the protection of Irish industries, it is well that they should be aware that, if there is not an air of suspicion, at least there is an air of <Col N="2326" /> watchfulness among many people directly engaged in many of the industries which still require the careful and protective hand of a national Government. If genuine mistakes are made they might quite definitely be interpreted not as mistakes of administration but of incorrect policy.  Therefore, it should be borne in on the Government and those who are concerned not merely with the maintenance of the present political position but equally so with the present industrial and economic position in relation to these industries, that they have a duty to speak out and to indicate this viewpoint. That is why I have done so.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate last night the Minister for Agriculture spoke of the benefits secured for the farmers under this agreement.  He said he had no doubt that such benefits as had been received for the farming community would be passed on to what he regarded as that very important and worthy section of the community, namely, the agricultural labourer.  I do not suggest that the Minister for Agriculture has not got a genuine sympathy for and interest in the agricultural labourer.  I believe he has, and I can understand the difficulties with which he is faced.  I am well aware that in recent months he has asked certain questions of farmers and that he has not received satisfactory replies.  Let me say that farmers are employers and, while there are individual farmers of high intent and worthy outlook who take a humane view in regard to their labourers, we do not know in the whole history of the Labour movement of any section of employers that have voluntarily put their hands in their pockets and increased the wages of their employees and improved their conditions of employment.  I should like to believe that it is otherwise.  That is why I say that when we have secured for the farming community improvements in regard to our economy we have to do more than hope that the benefits will be passed on to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There is already a very wide gap in the standard of life between the ordinary <Col N="2327" /> agricultural labourer and a wide section of the farmers.  Many farmers, I know, do not care much about the standard of life of an agricultural labourer.  There are others who live much above that standard.  I hope to see that gap closed.  I hope that the farmers will have the good sense to listen to the advice given to them by the Minister for Agriculture.  I doubt it very much.  Possibly later in the debate somebody else will refer to some of the statements made by the Minister elsewhere.  Again, I want to say that if we create a situation by virtue of an agreement of this character which gives rise to a critical position in regard to prices in our domestic markets, then we have a responsibility with which we must deal.  Similarly, if we secure a position which provides for the farming community reasonable and fair returns we have also got a responsibility.  I am not prepared to evade my responsibilities in that respect and I am not prepared to allow anyone else to evade his responsibilities of seeing, either by voluntary action or by compulsion, that some of those benefits are passed on to the downtrodden mass of men and women who constitute the agricultural community in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In many respects I suppose we all agree with what Deputy Larkin has said.  He wound up, however, with the position of the farmers and their workers.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that two-thirds of the farming community of this country are composed of small farmers under £20 and £25 valuations.  I want to assure him that the lot of these small farmers is not one bit better than that of the agricultural workers with full employment.  I would also like to point out to him that there are many people handling live stock in this country who may have some land but who, in my opinion, could never be classed as farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You might be surprised if you investigated the matter.  The whole problem is bristling with difficulties <Col N="2328" /> and dangers.  It needs to be handled very, very carefully.  Anything that may tend to regiment agriculture will irretrievably damage it.  That is my personal opinion for what it is worth.  The problem of farming needs circumspect handling at all times.  The position of the agricultural workers is quite different from that of the industrial workers in the cities and towns. In spite of anything that may be done, it always will remain as it is now.  In my opinion there is no way of solving the problem.  You cannot treat agricultural workers on the same basis as industrial workers.  The only way in which that might be done would be by wiping out three-quarters of the homesteads in the country and turning them into 500 or 1,000-acre ranches.  There is not other way of doing it.  If you so convert agriculture then it would be possible to carry out the policy of the present Minister by fully mechanising the ranches and putting the workers on the same footing as the industrial workers in the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>Anybody who seeks to do it in any other way will merely damage agriculture. The less tinkering there is with agriculture, the less talk there is about it and the less incentive the better.  The less the Minister talks about his sympathy for the agricultural workers the better.  He is merely inciting the agricultural worker to leave the land.  If you consult the farmers at the present time you will find many of them who might be considered prosperous.  If you discuss their position with them they will tell you that they are put to the pin of their collar to find the wages for their agricultural workers from the products of their land.  Were it not for the prices they have been getting for their cattle during the last eight or nine months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they tillage farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the tillage farmers I am speaking about now.  Were it not for the prices they have been getting for their live stock over the last eight or nine months very few agricultural workers would be in employment to-day because of the very critical harvests. The farmers only barely got out because the prices of live stock took a <Col N="2329" /> turn for the better and they went up considerably in the last nine or ten months.  I want to warn the Taoiseach that the outlook for agriculture in the future under present agricultural policy is not too rosy, looking at it from the point of employment on the land and the keeping of the people on the land. I am sure this Government wishes to keep the people on the land and to increase the numbers on the land. Under this agreement I think there is great danger of the numbers decreasing. There is a possibility that the trend will be in the wrong direction from every point of view.  Getting a better price for cattle is not going to bring great prosperity to agriculture. That is merely a temporary thing.  We are getting a good price at the present time because of famine conditions all over the world.  That is the only reason why we are getting these prices. Coming down to fundamentals, it is tillage done on the small farms which will bring the greatest prosperity and keep agriculture prosperous.  Tillage will do more for agriculture than will temporary increased prices, because of famine conditions on the other side. Agriculture has not a four-year life cycle.  It is a continuous and continuing occupation.  If we get better prices for our live stock temporarily it is a good thing to a certain extent, because the farming community need every increase they can get.</P>
      <P>There is one point in this agreement that I would like the Taoiseach to explain.  The Minister for Agriculture failed to explain it yesterday.  In the annex, paragraph (7) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake to arrange to pay prices for fat cattle imported from Ireland equivalent to those paid for store cattle bred in Ireland after a minimum of two months' fattening in the United Kingdom, subject to appropriate adjustments in respect of marketing costs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all right as far as it goes. According to my interpretation, it means that the 1d. per lb. differential that operated from November last has gone.  In paragraph (8), however, it is stated that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" />&ldquo;Provided that if increased numbers of fact and store cattle do not become available in the proportion set out in paragraph (2) in due course, then the provisions of paragraph (7) will be subject to review by both Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that assuming that we do not increase the proportions as set out in paragraph (2), the British Government retains the right of putting on a price differential again?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would like me to answer now.  The Minister for Agriculture did deal&mdash;I thought rather exhaustively &mdash; with paragraph (7) and (8) last night. Perhaps the Deputy was not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture did not explain it, perhaps I will not be able to explain it either. The Deputy is quite right as regards paragraph (7).  That means that the differential is gone.  Paragraph (8) means that, if we do not export quite in accordance with what is set out there, in due course&mdash;that very indefinite phrase&mdash;this matter will be subject to review by both countries.  The British have not unilateral right to do anything about it.  It must be done in consultation with this country and in the light of the existing circumstances.  I think the Deputy need not trouble himself about it.  If he has any genuine fears they are groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from an area interested in stall-fed cattle, I may say that that gives great employment and is a most important section of our cattle industry.  In Wexford the farmers are very interested in stall-fed cattle.  They must continue, in order to maintain the fertility of their tillage land, to have stall-fed cattle.  We would naturally be perturbed if there was anything in this agreement to prevent more than 25 per cent. of our fat cattle, if they are available, finding a market over there.  We know what happened in the past.  We can throw our minds back 20 or 25 years, and also during the economic war.  We know <Col N="2331" /> the British outlook as regards stall-fed cattle from this country.  They are opposed to them tooth and nail.  The British farmers will always be opposed to stall-fed cattle from this country. They are prepared to influence their Government to prevent this country from developing the stall-fed cattle trade with England.  I am sure the Taoiseach is well aware of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the right in this agreement to increase that differential. Taking the agreement from the agricultural point of view, I do not believe it will put one extra person into employment here.  I hope it will bring the prosperity everyone wishes to agriculture but, if there is too much stress made on a cattle policy only, nothing can be so damaging for the whole economy of the country.  If the minds of the people are to be kept on and export market alone, and if nothing else is to matter, that is a most damaging thing.</P>
      <P>I have no faith or confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, and the agricultural community have no confidence in him.  In his recent pronouncements he has not given us any assurance.  The agricultural community do not feel assured by his statements and they are not safe in the hands of such a Minister. The economy of the agricultural industry will not be safe in his hands if he carries out the policy he enunciated here.  I see nothing of value in the agreement.  I would like the Taoiseach to say if he has any guarantee of additional artificial manure, a most important thing from the farmers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much interested in foundry coke.  We know the Taoiseach tried to get it, and probably other members of the delegation tried their best of get <Col N="2332" /> it, from Great Britain.  The largest foundries in this country are in Wexford. There are over 1,000 men at varies times of the year depending for a livelihood on the foundries there.  This agreement which the Government considers the be-all and end-all of their efforts has failed to get any foundry coke from Great Britain. The Tánaiste was on this delegation and I would like to ask him certain questions about foundry coke.  I would like to know what influence he and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were able to bring on certain opposite numbers in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was not a member of the Government, was loud in his boasting that if he were in the position he would be able to get all the raw materials required here for industry. Foundry coke is a most essential raw material and I am not satisfied that the British Government are not deliberately trying to break our machinery manufacturing industries by withholding essential supplies.  The previous Government knew that in Great Britain and all over the world there was a great scarcity of foundry coke, but the amount we need is only 100 tons a week, or 5,000 tons a year, yet we failed to get a guarantee from Great Britain in that connection.  The Taoiseach gave a guarantee to Britain that they would get everything we have, that they would get a preference in respect of all our commodities, but in a small matter like foundry coke, that we sorely need, we failed to wring a guarantee from them.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of swashbuckling on the part of members of our delegation. There was a great Press compaign before they went over.  If there is one thing more than another that the Government were badly served with, it was the publicity campaign carried on before the delegation went over and even while they were there. The interviews and Press conferences did them an amount of damage.  It is all right to have a softening-up process if it is done correctly.  It was an effort all the time to belittle their predecessors in office and that is why it failed.  That is what the publicity manager of that campaign had in mind <Col N="2333" /> all the way.  Their aim was to drag the previous Government and the efforts they had made to make agreements in the mud as far as they could. That is why the present campaign failed.  It was a bad campaign from the Government's point of view and from the country's point of view.  Take the English papers of that time and read them and see the near contempt they had for that campaign and of the publicity that our Ministers gave themselves on that occasion.  It was damaging to their mission in England. It damaged the country's prestige and it certainly weakened the effort to wring the best possible out of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>What do we see in that agreement? Very little.  One thing that all sides of the House must agree upon, however, is that it takes all our best efforts, and it always will, to wring ordinary justice out of our big neighbour.  We can praise them, tell them that they are such fine fellows and that we love them, but when we come down to brass tacks and try to get what we want from them, it is a very different thing; they are very hard nuts to crack and always have been.  They are not soft; there is no sentiment in them; there is no slush in them; we can tell them we love them; we can put our arms around them as the Minister for Agriculture did, but when it comes to getting foundry coke, manure or anything else from them, they will get the best end of the bargain if they can.  They look on us as ordinary minors and they have had the same policy for hundreds of years.  It is only because we have some strength that we got any justice at all out of our big neighbour.</P>
    <P>The present Government, who went over to make that agreement, knew quite well that on this side of the House there was a large section of the representatives of the Irish people who would stand behind them in any fight they put up against Great Britain for the rights of the Irish people.  It was different position in 1938, when the them Government had a hostile Opposition who were not agreed on the foreign policy of the Government.  The Minister for External Affairs a few days ago made an appeal here for <Col N="2334" /> agreement on external policy.  There is no necessity to make an appeal on that.  As long as the Government have an external policy that serves the best. interests of the country, they will always find the people on this side of the House fully behind them.  That was not so, however, in this country for a great number of years.  It was not so during the economic war.</P>

      <P>Little or none.  If no agreement had been made we would be in the same position as we are at the moment.  It has not increased the price of cattle.  Cattle have gone down by 12/- or 15/- a cwt. since it was made. I do not say that the agreement was responsible for them going down.  The agreement is a puny affair.  The agreement is very small compared to the big Press campaign that was carried on by the Government before it was made. It is a case of &ldquo;the mountains are in labour and a mouse is brought forth.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Allen, I was reminded of the babbling brook.  I could not follow whether he was in favour of this agreement or condemned it; whether he thought it was an agreement that should have been entered into or an agreement that should not have been entered into. He seemed to be motivated by some bitterness for the Ministers who entered into the agreement and for the Taoiseach who signed it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that that is not a correct approach to an agreement of this kind.  I look upon this agreement as what it is, a trade agreement between Ireland and Great Britain.  While there are a few objectionable features in it, the principal one for me&mdash;and I suppose we cannot get over it constitutionally&mdash;&mdash;is that it is an agreement between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and this State.  It is an unfortunate position&mdash;but that is as it is&mdash;that Great Britain and Northern Ireland have entered into an agreement with this State.  For the purposes of this agreement, the Six Countries are a part of Great Britain.  That, I understand, presents one difficulty to our printers here who print books, particularly <Col N="2337" /> school books.  Books printed for schools in the Twenty-Six Counties cannot enter the Six Counties except under licence from the British Board of Trade.  I think that that really arises under the 1938 agreement and I am quite sure that the Taoiseach and the Ministers adverted to that and endeavoured to rectify it.  Printing houses in this State feel, however, that they have been pretty badly hit under the provisions of the 1938 agreement and I think that their feelings are that the new agreement does not ameliorate or improve their position. However, the Taoiseach may be able to refer to that aspect of the matter in concluding.</P>
      <P>I was delighted with the speech of Deputy Larkin this morning.  He brought what might be described as a breath of fresh air, a breath of sanity, into this debate.  When we enter into a trade agreement with another country, it does not matter what Government are in power, we can take it that that Government will do the best they can for the country and, whether the agreement is negotiated by a Fianna Fáil Government, a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, or an inter-Party Government, we can take it that the very best that can be done for the country will be done.  I accept the approach to this agreement that was mentioned here last night and approved by Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>There are some minor points in the agreement that I could criticise but, taking it by and large, it is a good agreement and it will improve conditions for the agricultural community. To that extent, it is welcome.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Larkin in drawing attention to this aspect of the agreement: The agreement will increase prices of commodities here in Dublin. In the constituency that I represent there are tens of thousands of consumers, all of whom may have to pay more for the food they buy because of the success of this agreement in so far as it relates to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to support the viewpoint put forward by Deputy Larkin that the Government ought to consider the <Col N="2338" /> establishment of a national marketing board to market agricultural produce, getting the best price they can on the British market and guaranteeing over the period of this agreement an economic price to the farmers.  It would then be possible to make available for our consumers, our workers and our families those vital foods such as beef, butter, bacon and eggs at a price within their capacity to pay. There is no doubt about it that that is a corollary to this agreement.  That question must be approached and tackled by the Government.  In so far as my own constituents are concerned, I want to say that they are entitled to receive an adequate quantity of those vital foods, that they are entitled to receive the best quality of those foods, that they are entitled to receive them at a price that they are in a position to pay.</P>
    <P>So, I would ask the Taoiseach, in consultation with the Government, to consider this practical problem, because it is a practical problem.  It is a difficulty.  It must be faced and it arises directly, not only out of this agreement, but out of any other international trade agreement that may be entered into by this Government.  I intervened in the debate only to express that point of view.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, this agreement has been received very favourably by the country and by the House.  I understood from Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition, last night that there would be no division on this agreement, that the House would accept it unanimously.  That being the case, it would have been better, in the national interest, and from the point of view of all of us, if the debate could have been conducted without the very bitter personal criticism, directed against particular Ministers, that we had here.  Subject to that, I want to say, in a general way, that I approve of the agreement and that, with the great majority of the people of the country, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene in the debate because I am disgusted at the bitterness displayed in Deputy Allen's <Col N="2339" /> speech.  In international matters we should be able to rise above Party differences in this House.  Bitterness has crept out in some of the speeches from the Opposition, not in all of them, and not in the speeches of the responsible leaders of the Opposition who adopted a very different tone in this debate.  Certain Deputies have exhibited a degree of bitterness which, I think, is a measure of their political disappointment at the success of this agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government has not made political capital out of advance which this agreement represents over the 1938 agreement.  It happens to be an advance on it, but I am sure the Taoiseach would be the first to say that the 1938 agreement was negotiated in circumstances different from those of to-day.  We on this side of the House did not agree with the circumstances which existed in 1938.  They were not of our doing and we did not believe that many of those differences should ever have arisen.  Nevertheless there has been no effort to make political capital out of that.  The Taoiseach and the other Ministers who have spoken put forward fairly and logically the advantages which the 1948 agreement has conferred on the people of this country, and it is on that basis, and from that point of view alone, that the country will ultimately judge this agreement.  I am glad to say that in the vast majority of cases Deputies are judging it on the basis of the positive results which will accrue to the people of Ireland.  The agricultural community have got what they have never had before, namely, continuity and a long-term policy which will aid their exports.  It is a very positive benefit to them.  Certain Deputies on the other side have said that in the changed and difficult times in which we live a long-term policy may not be of advantage.  I personally do not hold that view because I know, and business people of all types know&mdash;and, after all, the agricultural community are business people in a specialised way&mdash;that continuity and certainty in the future is what all human effort needs to bring forth its best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2340" /> I believe that under this agreement we are entering into a great era of agricultural progress in this country.  I am very glad that our Ministers went across to the other side and had the courage and manliness to go there and negotiate what, on the face of it, seems to be a very successful agreement. Deputy Cowan spoke about the question of books.  I think the Taoiseach dealt with that in his opening remarks.  Apparently one of the difficulties about the export of manufactured goods generally to Great Britain is that Great Britain has entered into certain agreements with hard currency areas, notably the United States of America, and for every manufactured article of a certain type which they buy from this country they have to buy a similar quantity from the United States and pay for them in precious dollars.  That apparently is the difficulty which confronts us in connection with the export of certain manufactured articles.  Mind you, I think it is a very comforting thought to realise that, because it does show that behind certain restrictions on the export of our manufactured articles to the English market, which none of us like to see, lay not any desire to restrict the export of these articles, but the fact that the bitter necessities of the moment demanded that Great Britain could not import these articles when she would have to import a similar quantity from the dollar areas.  That does show that it is not a question of any prejudice against our exports but is a question of dollars which, we hope, in time will pass away. When that passes away the situation will be very different and our Government will be alive to taking advantage of the changed circumstances as soon as they do arrive.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I wish to speak only briefly on this question but I was interested in the statements of Deputy Larkin and Deputy Cowan in connection with the food supplies of our cities.  I think all Deputies must be interested in supplying agricultural produce to our cities at prices which will remunerate the farmer and which will yet enable the inhabitants of the cities to buy as large a quantity of such produce as <Col N="2341" /> they need at a reasonable price.  That is the aim of this Government and it must be the aim of any good Government. I think the Government will watch that situation carefully to see that our home markets are safeguarded for agricultural produce.  When I say &ldquo;safeguarded&rdquo; I mean that the price will be kept within the capacity of the pockets of consumers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I welcome the agreement. I think it has great possibilities and far more than possibilities.  As a result of the agreement a very prosperous period lies ahead for the agricultural exports of this country.  The agreement is enormously to our advantage and it will help to enrich the population of the country considerably. That is what we all want to see, our people more prosperous and thereby enabled to live fuller and better lives. All that is inherent in the agreement and I am glad that the House in the main and all the responsible leaders of the Opposition recognise that, while I deplore the fact that some of the more irresponsible members introduced a note of bitterness into the debate which was merely in my opinion a measure of their political disappointment at the success of the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the speeches made by those who can speak with authority for the farmers, the Government have apparently struck a very good bargain, but I join with one or two other Deputies in drawing attention to the effect which this agreement is likely to have on consumers in Dublin and on consumers in other cities and towns of the country. Deputy Fagan said last night that the possibility was that a day-old calf would henceforward be worth £10.  If that is the position I should like to know what price meat is likely to go to in the towns and cities and to what extent, as a result of inflated prices, meat will be removed altogether from the tables of working-class people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to see that our own people will get a fair share of the food produced in the country, that they will not be debarred from getting a fair share of it because they may not have <Col N="2342" /> the money to compete with those who come into the market and can give high prices for our food.  In certain quarters in Dublin to-day meat is only seen once a week&mdash;at the Sunday dinner.  I was hopeful that the Government would bring down the cost of living to such an extent that our people would share in all the good food which is going and that they would have sufficient money to buy it at a reasonable price.  Deputy Fagan stated last night that it is possible to get £10 for a day-old calf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been that price for several months past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember during the period of the slaughtering of the calves when calves were sold for 10/-each. Please God, these days will never come again.  As a Dublin citizen I earnestly hope that those engaged in the production of food will get a decent living out of the land and good prices for whatever they produce.  There are some of us in this House who represent Dublin City and others who represent Waterford, Cork and other industrial centres.  If industrial wages are to remain as they are and if industrial workers are not to demand higher wages in order to meet the increase in the cost of living, turmoil will be created in the industrial centres.  Who will blame the workers for demanding more wages in order to meet the increase in the cost of living, if the price of meat goes up any higher as a result of this agreement?  I hope the Government will look at the matter from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that agriculture is the main industry in this country and that if it does not prosper nobody will prosper. At the same time I want an assurance from the Government that they will protect the workers in order to see that this new inflation will not deprive them of the necessary foods which they have to buy with their wages.  It will be most unfair if our banks are filled with paper money or securities and if good food is exchanged for that paper money or securities instead of getting the raw materials necessary to keep our industries going.  I earnestly hope <Col N="2343" /> that the Government will see that the banks are not filled with paper money and that in exchange for our beef and other agricultural products we shall get materials, especially for the building industry.  There is a scarcity of building materials in this city at the moment.  I suggest that for our food exports we should get building materials in order to give our people good houses, and not take paper money.  We could go ahead with very big housing schemes for those in need of houses if, in exchange for our food, we could get from Great Britain and Northern Ireland the necessary building materials.  I do not want to see our banks overloaded with paper money.  There is more money in the country at present than some people know what to do with.  What we want is material at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan also said last night that if there were more boats available to take cattle to the Continent, more cattle would be sent and the prices would be higher.  Two years ago I told the previous Minister for Agriculture that there was unfair competition in our markets, that continental buyers, subsidised by their Governments, were competing in our markets against our regular customers across the water and our local butchers.  One does not like to revive the trouble which we heard so much about during the last couple of weeks.  If, however, Dublin butchers, as they say, cannot keep open to sell meat to our own people at the prices fixed, I should like to know what is going to be done to give our own people meat at a reasonable price. Have the Government thought of sub-sidising the Dublin butchers if they have to go into this market and compete with continental buyers with plenty of money?  Up to a few months ago these continental buyers were buying cattle outside the market.</P>
    <P>I want to know what the Government are going to do for our Dublin consumers.  I suggest that they should meet the Dublin butchers and, if necessary, representatives of the consumers and make arrangements for a fair price to be charged to the Dublin consumers, so that meat will not be taken off their <Col N="2344" /> tables completely because of the money which is coming in from Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Continent. The Government should look after our own people first and then give effect to the agreement.  There is no use in encouraging continental buyers in order to keep up the prices.  I would only give these continental buyers the surplus after we have provided for our own people and for our regular and best customers.  We should not allow them to come in now, as a sort of flash in the pan, to buy up our foodstuffs, or eventually we will see our country denuded of cattle.  It would be deplorable if, as the result of the desire of any class to get big money for what they produce for a year or two, our country were denuded of live stock.</P>
    <P>We gathered from Deputy de Valera last night that, after criticisms of this agreement have been made by the various Parties, there will be no division taken on it.  I earnestly hope, therefore, that the Government will consider what is going to be done for our own consumers in the towns and cities who will have to pay high prices and whose moderate wages will not be able to compete with the prices paid by continental buyers for the live stock that we produce.  I hope that the appeals which have been made by other Dublin representatives and myself will be listened to and that something will be done to see that our own people will get a fair share at a reasonable price of the food produced in their own country.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that our representatives made the best bargain possible.  I was pleased that Deputy de Valera expressed himself as he did last night.  I have listened very carefully to the Minister for Agriculture telling us about what he has done for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate the remarks that have been made about the agricultural workers, but I suggest that, if we are to have peace in the agricultural industry, the Government should introduce legislation so that the agricultural workers will get the week's holidays which the Minister for Agriculture has been advocating, rather than leave the question of their holidays to the good-will <Col N="2345" /> of the farming community.  I have some knowledge of the efforts that had to be made to get a week's holidays for industrial workers and of the industrial strike which was necessary to achieve that success.  I do not want to see that strife taking place in the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appealed yesterday to give a decent deal to the agricualturl workers and said that the benefits of the agreement should be extended to them.  I hope that, instead of making appeals in that way, legislation will be introduced to confer on them the benefit of a week's holiday.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputies on both sides of the House talk about the prosperity that we are going to enter on.  I feel inclined to ask myself, what is prosperity, and what are the things that are necessary for its realisation? I suggest to every Deputy that prosperity must be defined in terms of goods.  Money is no test whatever of a nation's wealth.  It is a symbol of an individual's position, whether that position be one of poverty or wealth. As far as the national wealth is concerned, I look upon it as a myth.  The true test of prosperity is the availability of goods for consumption.  I suggest to Government Deputies who talk about prosperity that if we are to have prosperity, we should have it in the terms in which I have defined it. If we have that, then our people can be fed from what the country produces. I think it was Deputy Larkin who asked this morning how much meat the people who produce goods and food for the nation are able to have for themselves.  How many of them can enjoy meat for their dinner every day?  How many of their families are able to have an egg for their breakfast in the morning?  How many industrial workers, out of the wages they are getting, can afford to pay 4d. for an egg?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any Deputy going to suggest that an agricultural worker, out of his wage of 55/- or 60/- a week, can have <Col N="2346" /> an egg in the morning for himself or the members of his family, or that he can avail of the ration of six ounces of butter in the week?  As long as our people are deprived of the needs of life, of food, shelter and clothing, let us not talk about prosperity in the terms in which it has been spoken of here, or in terms of the money that we get for the produce which we export to other countries.  I know that exports are necessary, but I am afraid that we are not discussing this agreement between the two countries in the right way.  We have people who are rearing families for the nation and they are not able to provide them with milk, butter or eggs and other necessaries. Until these needs are served and until we are able to supply our people with goods and the necessaries of life, we cannot claim to have a decent conception of what prosperity is.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the people on the other side have the big stick, and that there was no agreement on Clause I of the 1938 agreement.  I am not going to blame anybody for what was done in 1938.  We were struggling at that time for our national existence, but I would say to the Government that the interpretation that we put on Clause I of the 1938 agreement, we should maintain, and not yield to the interpretation put on it by any outside country.  If there is anything that we need in this country it is protection for our industrial development and, of course, for our agriculture as well.  I congratulate the Ministers on going to meet the Ministers of another country in an effort to try and work out an agreement between the two countries. I think they are to be congratulated on the result of the agreement.  I do not agree for a moment that it is all that we would desire, but I am satisfied that it is the best that we could get. I hope that the benefits of the agreement, so far as the agricultural workers are concerned, are not going to be lost to them by mere appeals to the agricultural community.  Something more than that is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>From the study that I have been able to make of the agreement, <Col N="2347" /> I confess that the document itself disappoints me.  I had hoped that, as regards many items and types of materials that are mentioned in it, the Taoiseach or some of his Ministers would have given the House a more satisfactory explanation than so far has been offered to it.  I thought that when the Taoiseach was speaking yesterday he would deal very fully with this document, but instead he moved away to criticise the agreement of 1938.  I am sure that more than two-thirds of his speech was taken up with criticism of that agreement.  I do not want to deal with the 1938 agreement now, but I think everyone in the country must admit that it brought about a complete revolution overnight unknown to our people. Under it we got back out ports, one of the greatest achievements that could be attributed to any Government in this country.  I think the Taoiseach was lacking in a very essential duty when he did not give the Dáil and the country some idea of the great benefits he claims have been bestowed on the people through the agreement that is now before us.</P>
      <P>Someone complained to-day about bitterness being introduced from this side of the House.  If there was any bitterness introduced on this agreement it was by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, following the speech delivered by Deputy Lemass, a speech which, in my opinion, was a very valuable contribution to this whole question.  We had then a speech from the Minister of Agriculture. God knows, every time I hear him lately I am reminded of Handy Andy, because he seems to be trying to improve on his making a joke of the whole agricultural policy day by day and trying to create a fresh laugh every time he gets up in this House, in the Seanad or outside the place altogether.  We expected, and we do expect, and we are entitled to get from the Ministers a clear idea of where the country stands in connection with this particular document.  We have not got that.</P>

Those are the farmers I have heard talk.  As a matter of fact I do not think I have seen one representative from the Party that claims to be representing the farmers of this country in this House during the whole debate.  Nor have I heard a speech from any Deputy on the Government side of the House dealing with this very important agreement from the time it started yesterday until this hour.  I wonder why.  I wonder if it is because they are just tame lambs sitting behind the Government who have not perhaps made the effort they might have made to bring about a much better agreement.

      <P>I heard Deputy A. Byrne a moment ago referring to a statement made by a certain Deputy to the effect that calves are going to fetch £10.  I can tell Deputy A.

      <P>I can also say that you can buy a calf as easily for 10/- as you can for £10 or £11.  There are certain calves that you can buy for less than that.  However, we were certainly very disappointed with the Minister for Agriculture yesterday.  I suppose it was not the Taoiseach's job to deal <Col N="2349" /> with agriculture as a whole, but when the Taoiseach had not told us anything in connection with fertilisers it was one of the biggest disappointments we have had when the Minister for Agriculture got up and sat down again without mentioning that one iota of an effort had been made to secure extra fertilisers for this country.  One of the things in which I have been very interested, and I think it has not been referred to at all, is potash.  The land of this country is starved at the present time&mdash;perhaps very starved for superphosphates, but much more starved for potash.  Those are things about which we should like to have heard something from the Minister for Agriculture.  Instead of that, his contribution to the debate was the most hopeless contribution he has made to any debate and, God knows, many of them were not very helpful.  He told us that he thought the price of potatoes at the moment was £10 18s. 0d., I think, per ton.  I should like to have from the Minister a clarification of that.  It is not, of course, the price that was agreed to according to something he told us some time ago.  We have in this country what are known as potato exporters.  Is the £10 15s. 0d.&mdash;or whatever the price he mentioned&mdash;the price that is being given to the exporters?</P>

      <P>Wait a moment.  I will take information from the Minister, but not from any Deputy who knows perhaps less than I do about it.  Is the £10 15s. the price that is going to be paid to the potato exporters in this country?  If it is, what price are the potato exporters going to pay to the potato producers?  That is the point I want to get at.  If they are going to get £10 15s.  I cannot see the potato producers of this country getting any more than about £8 10s.  It is something in which I am very interested because for quite a long time I have been trying to bring about an organisation within the potato producers to fight for better terms from the exporters. I come from a part of the country where the export of potatoes is a very big item.  I want to know to from the <Col N="2350" /> Minister who exactly are going to get this figure which he mentioned yesterday. I hope we shall hear it from the Taoiseach when he is concluding.  I think it is the potato exporters, and if it is, God knows what sort of a price they will be prepared to give to the producer.  The Minister for Agriculture, of course, gave us a great assurance of the market that we have got. Does every man in this House and outside this House not clearly understand at this particular time that if the Government never made an effort to negotiate with Britain that Britain requires every iota we can export from this country and are prepared to pay the highest price?  What is all the shouting about?</P>

      <P>If this agreement had never been made it would have made no difference in the wide world to the price of our agricultural products in the British market.  What we are particularly anxious about is our position in regard to fertilisers and other items. The previous Government went to Britain last autumn to negotiate an agreement.  Those negotiations have been more or less continued ever since right down to the signing of this agreement the other day.  I think that is a correct statement of the position.  In the agreement concluded last autumn it is provided in paragraph 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Government have undertaken to maintain existing supplies of coal and to provide a substantial additional quantity of coal of reasonable quality in the calendar year 1948.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to know what change has there been between the discussions at that time and the agreement just completed.  Have we got from the British any guarantee that we are going to get as good quality coal now as they were prepared to give us at that time?  Then I come to machinery and equipment.  It is provided in the agreement last year that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will receive improved supplies of agricultural machinery and the British Government will endeavour to improve supplies and deliveries of certain other classes of machinery and equipment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How far have we progressed in that direction?  With regard to the question of dollar scarcity, we are making every effort we can to conserve our drawings on dollars.  Quite recently we had big headlines in the papers as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance's statement that he had imported into this country drainage machinery from Ohio.  Did we make any serious effort to get this machinery from Britain?  Could we not have saved dollars by getting this machinery from Britain and save dollars for food?  We have here, too, a guarantee in the 1947 agreement that we would get increased supplies of certain machinery.  I have seen no sign of any increase in that direction in the document that is before us now. We were to receive increased supplies of certain textile raw materials under the 1947 agreement, and we were told that we might expect improved supplies of steel and componets for the manufacture of agricultural machinery. It was stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The possibility of making available other supplies to enable our productive capacity to be fully utilised is to be examined in detail.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> I wonder if that was gone into in detail when the present agreement was being drawn up.  Have we made any effort to find out what extra supplies the British are prepared to make available? I do not see any indication of that nature in the document before us now. Neither did I hear anything said about that matter by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Under the 1947 agreement it was provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the supplies of approximately 25,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia which has been allocated to this country under the programme of the International Emergency Food Council, the British Government have agreed to the supply of 15,000 tons of superphosphate in 1947-48 and to consider urgently the possibility of supplying basic slag as well as of increasing the quantity of superphosphate above 15,000 tons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been asked by a number of farmers what has been done about artificial manures.  Are we going to get any extra supplies?  Juding by the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture we will not require such large quantities of artificial manure.  In the short term he has been in office the farmers of the country have been sweeping up their managers and lofts to get hayseed to put into the ground. The Minister has successfully killed our tillage policy.</P>

      <P>That is some indication of how the ground was prepared for the present Government, because this is practically identical to what they have achieved. An increased price will be paid for beef shipped in dressed carcase and for canned meat.  The Minister for Agriculture has not so much to shout about there, nor has he got much extra.  These things were already arranged and agreed upon. The extent of the increase was still under discussion at that time and it was hoped that an early announcement would be made on the subject.  The Minister's announcement was merely covering ground already paved for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards sheep and lambs, increased prices were offered for fat sheep and lambs and for sheep and lamb carcases, but, as there was not an exportable surplus, the discussions were concluded and nothing further could be done. The same position exists to-day.  On the subject of eggs, the Minister for Agriculture talked loudly regarding the <Col N="2355" /> agreement made with Britain by his predecessor for any eggs that we might be in a position to send there.  There is no need for me to go into that.  We fixed a price for potatoes in accordance with their different grades.  I doubt if the prices are anything better to-day, or are even as good.  For group I we were to receive 307/6, for group II 280/-, for group III 255/-, and for group IV 235/-.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture can boast of an increase on those prices; his price is much less.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to give us an idea of in what way, if any, he has improved on the discussions that took place last October between the Irish and British Governments regarding the prices of different commodities that all the people behind the Government are shouting about to-day.  I do not think half of them realise that the ground work was prepared and the road paved towards making a much better agreement than what we have got.  There are a number of commodities that the Minister for Agriculture and other members of the delegation forgot.</P>

      <P>There was one thing that Deputies have not touched upon, and that is bringing a third grade into our cattle exports.  We had grades A and B before and now we have grade C.  That is going to be disastrous. When you are driven into the position in a market of having to make an extra grade and only one person can decide as between grades A, B and C, that person can put out grade A and make up the number out of grades B and C.  I suggest that the number of first-class cattle that will leave this country will be cut down because, to a large extent, we have cut out the continental buyer.  Every time you take a buyer out of the market you reduce the competition and you reduce the price.  You also reduce the grade. I think there cannot be too much boasting about this agreement.  I suppose it is one we cannot very well oppose.</P>

      <P>If we did oppose it, probably we would be doing the best day's work we ever did for Ministers opposite.  It might give them an opportunity of going back again and making a better one.  However, as they were raw on the job and it was their first effort, if they will only take a little heed of the useful and helpful criticism that they have got in connection with this agreement it will be a guide to them in the future, and it may also tend in future towards killing some of the stupid statements made prior to going to England.  It may help to stop Press conferences which tried to show they were all jolly good lads before they started negotiating.  When people go to negotiate with another Government, instead of meeting the Press and blowing their foghorns before they start to work, they should keep everything quiet until they have the job done and then if there are bouquets to be thrown there are plenty of individuals over there quite prepared to throw them.</P>

      <P>This debate has been marked with one very strange characteristic. No suggestion has been made that the framers of this agreement had been influenced by plans, the legacy of their predecessors.  Possibly with the sole exception of the last speaker's unsupported innuendoes, no reference has been made to the assistance which this Government received as a result of the efforts of its predecessors.  The debate has been characterised, too, by one very important feature.  It is the first time since this Dáil assembled on February 18th last, that the Opposition have indulged in constructive criticism.  After his castigation by the Taoiseach on the debate on the Fisheries Department, Deputy Lemass made some effort to indulge in something constructively critical but, unfortunately, his effort faded out.  Possibly now, on the eve of the Recess, the Fianna Fáil Party are making a belated effort to go to <Col N="2357" /> their constituents with some sense of dignity, because in this debate they have, on the whole, conducted themselves with credit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass certainly contributed largely to the discussions which followed after he had spoken yesterday afternoon.  In his varied suggestions regarding the agreement he made a speech at the end of which nobody knew whether he supported the agreement or whether he did not.  Later in the discussion the Leader of the Opposition made his position quite clear, and it was not quite the same as that expressed by Deputy Lemass.  While Deputy Lemass was rather in favour of having no agreement, Deputy de Valera distinctly said that he thought the agreement better than having no agreement.  Therefore, it was refreshing to hear from the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a difference of opinion, even on a small matter.  There were two or three matters on which they did not quite agree, but I understand that they will be dealt with later.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera's speech was one with which I personally am almost in complete agreement.  I think that he took up the proper attitude, that his statement was statesmanlike, impartial and delivered with his eyes on the vindication of our national honour and prestige.  There was nothing in it to which anyone could have taken exception beyond a few minor points which did not matter.  On the whole, while I think that his delivering of that speech does him credit, he did not say anything more than the Taoiseach had already said.  The Taoiseach called this an agreement which is a better agreement than that which already existed, but it was not the agreement he would have liked to put before the House.  In effect, that was exactly the statement of Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was warned by Deputy de Valera of the dangers of contact with their prototypes in the British Government.  I wonder whether that was fair criticism, because surely no one had greater experience of the British politicians than Deputy de Valera.  He said they were completely devoid of sentiment and that a <Col N="2358" /> hard bargain had always been made. I do not know whether he meant his remarks to be a reflection on the work which had been done by the Irish delegation or not, but possibly he was just announcing for the benefit of those who may not know the difficulties that face an Irish delegation who go to London to complete an agreement between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>There was constructive criticism from the Opposition, with the exception possibly of Deputy Allen.  I thought that his references were entirely unnecessary and that they lowered the dignity of this discussion. I think that this discussion earns a place on a certain plane of dignity and if cheap remarks are to continue to spoil the proceedings of this Assembly, then the sooner the people get rid of those who degrade it the better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin made a most contructive contribution to this discussion and he started off by stating&mdash;and correctly &mdash;that the basis of our economic power is the development of agriculture and must be the basis on which any agreement is founded.  He confessed that he did not know anything about the farmers except what he had observed, and, among other things, he said that he found it difficult to know what the farmers thought because the farmers could not agree themselves as to how agriculture should be developed.  I think that he is perfectly right in that. We have not yet got a cohesive plan from the farmers in this House as to how agriculture can be developed. That is not unusual, however; it is rather good.  The main thing is to judge by results, and that is the acid test as to the success of the development of agriculture.  There is no doubt that it has improved in latter years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen indicated in his remarks that the agreement signed in London meant only that cattle would become the main export trade and also the main agricultural product of our country.  That is not true.  There was no mention in the agreement in any shape or form, no clause or phrase, to suggest that the delegation to London had in mind only the sale of cattle.  The article says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;increased quantities of cattle, eggs <Col N="2359" /> and potatoes and to resume as soon as possible the traditional imports from Ireland of bacon, butter, fat sheep and lambs and other agricultural products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the wording of that, I think it is unfortunate that Deputy Allen should try to convey to anyone that it was the intention of the delegation to bolster up the sale of cattle to the exclusion of other agricultural produce. Deputy Larkin, although he did not deal with that as Deputy Allen spoke after him, made one remark which seemed to me very significant, and it arose quite casually.  He said that every beast that goes out of this country as dead meat is of more value to us than one which goes out on its four legs. That was a very interesting statement after the delegation had been blamed for not drawing up agreements or trying to draw up agreements with other countries.  One of the countries mentioned was Palestine.  It is only reasonable to suppose that, if beasts are exported from this country to far distant countries under conditions which exist in the ordinary cattle transport ships, those beasts will have deteriorated in quality by the time they reach their destination.  Deputy Larkin's statement made me at least think that there was that danger, that the further you go away from your base the more difficult it will be to transport cattle so that during the process of transportation they will not lose condition or become even sick or infected because I am perfectly certain that cattle, like human beings, would be more susceptible to disease under conditions in which they would be overcrowded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also said that if our social conditions were such that all our people were able to buy meat there would be no necessity to export our surplus.  He said that we have a surplus now because our own people are not able to buy our own products.  I am sure that Deputy Larkin did not mean to let that statement stand there. Possibly he did not think elaboration would be necessary.  I think it is quite clear that, supposing our people were able to buy our own products, it would still be necessary for us to encourage <Col N="2360" /> the development of agricultural produce and cattle to such a degree as would enable us to export those commodities in order to increase our credit and to enable us to buy materials from other countries.  In so far as the agreement is a better one than what existed in 1938 and any other agreement which has been made, I certainly give it my support.  I am expressing a personal point of view.  I hope it is the precursor, as I believe it is of better agreements in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this agreement has been trumpeted in the Press which supports the Governments reminds me very forcibly of the manner in which the same organs put over the Partition agreement of 1924. All the resources of a blatant propaganda machine have been used to create the impression that this agreement represents, a signal triumph for the representatives of this country.  I fail to see where the triumph is.  The best that can be said of this agreement is that it represents a sore disappointment to the Government, that it falls far short of the hopes which they expressed when first they landed in London.  But those who look at the agreement calmly and objectively will find much in it to justify the opinion that it is a bad agreement, for certain provisions in it are bad in principle and, therefore, bad even from the point of view of expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that certain provisions of the agreement are bad in principle.  Take, for instance, paragraph (5) of Part A of the annex.  In Part A of the annex there are set out the conditions which for four years will govern our export trade in cattle.  If those provisions related only to our trade with Great Britain and proposed to define the numbers of cattle, the various grades and types of cattle which we should send to Great Britain and the price which we should be paid for them, these are conditions which would normally be found in any commercial contract and would be unquestionable. But this agreement does much more than that.  It goes far beyond that. Part of the annex proposes not only to regulate our cattle trade with Great Britain but to regulate and limit our <Col N="2361" /> trade in cattle with the whole world. My objection to this part of the annex is that paragraph (5) definitely revives the principles of the laws which British Governments formerly passed in restraint of Irish trade.  It revives the principle of the woollen laws, the shipping laws&mdash;all the enactments by which British Governments in the past strove to curb and strangle, and succeeded in curbing and strangling all our efforts to develop our trade with the Continent.</P>
    <P>We have, as has been pointed out, an opportunity to develop that trade now, an unique opportunity, one which we have never had in all our history. We have the Continent crying out for food.  We have the representatives of the Continent prepared, as the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach admitted, to pay much more for our cattle than the British will pay.  But, under this agreement, we forego our right to take advantage of that opportunity. Such an agreement has been hailed by the other side as if it represented a triumph for Irish policy.</P>
    <P>It is not without reason that in the first article of that agreement the wish of the British Government to revive its traditional policy is expressed plainly and clearly on the face of the document and, in so far as Article 5 represents, to my mind, the significant part of the annex to the agreement, it represents&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash; a triumph for the traditional policy of the British Government in this country in relation to the trade of this country.</P>
    <P>Under this agreement, let us be clear about it, we link our economy more closely than ever before with that of Great Britain.  It is true that there must be close association between the two countries.  Our geographical position, perhaps, determines that, but it had been the endeavour of the Government which existed in this country from 1932, at any rate, to try to make our people more and more independent of our trade with Great Britain, if we possibly could, because we realised that, unless we were in a position to make the country as economically independent as possible, it was going to be very difficult for us to maintain our <Col N="2362" /> political independence.  That very largely was the basis of the policy which we pursued.  That was very largely responsible for the attempts which we were making to make ourselves self-sufficient in every possible degree.  That was largely responsible for the fact that, even though it did impose some hardships and disabilities on our own people, we determined to grow our own food, to make our own clothes, to produce our own fuel, to the utmost extent permitted out of the resources which God Almighty had given us.  But this agreement turns back on that&mdash;make no mistake about it&mdash;in one significant important factor, by limiting our right to trade with the Continent, which, as I have said, links our economy more closely than ever before with that of Great Britain.  In doing that, too, we link our currency more firmly than ever before with sterling.  We have in this House representatives of at least two Parties and we have Deputy Davin whom we often heard vocal on the question of the link with sterling.  We have other Deputies who made it a plank&mdash;</P>

      <P>This link that has been so often spoken about is not a link that depends fundamentally on an Act of this Parliament.  An Act of Parliament merely declares and defines the position as it in reality exists but the fundamental link with sterling is based on the volume of our trade with Great Britain and the more we restrict our trade with Great Britain, the more closely.  we link our currency with sterling.  We shall never be able to enjoy any great freedom of action in regard to that link until we make our trade more international and more cosmopolitan, but paragraph 5 of Part A of this annex forbids us virtually to do more than a limited trade with Great Britain and says that for the next four years, when the markets of Europe are open to us, we shall not export more than 10 per cent. of our total exports <Col N="2363" /> of live cattle to countries other than Great Britain.  It actually goes further and says that, of the permissible exports of live cattle to other countries, a certain proportion of them shall be of inferior quality when, as everybody knows, it would be good business for the sake of our reputation and in order to build up a good will, to send the best possible live stock we could to continental countries.</P>

      <P>Ask the Minister who said that we could have got hard currency in return, currency which would have made us, if we had it in sufficient quantity, independent of an agreement of this sort and would have given us freedom of trade.  It would enable us to buy in the most advantageous market the goods which we are not promised under this agreement.  It would enable us to buy Egyptian cotton, fertilisers and agricultural machinery.  That is what we would have got, in some instances at any rate, for the cattle which we would have exported to the Continent.  We would have got, on the admission of members of the Government, hard currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we going to get under this agreement?  So far as I can see, we are getting nothing that is any advance upon what was provided in the provisional agreement of last year.  The difference between the two agreements is that there was no stipulation similar to that in paragraph 5, Part A, of the annex in the November agreement. There was no attempt to limit our trade with the Continent by formal agreement last year because we would not have stood for it and we would not have accepted it.  We would not have had the hardihood to come to the House and ask the Dáil to undertake to restrain the development of Irish trade with the Continent for four years, as is being done under this agreement.  What have we got in return for these concessions which we have given to the British and in return for accepting this condition they have imposed on us?  Last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce was <Col N="2364" /> asked by Deputy de Valera had he any assurance that the British would supply us with the capital equipment which we required.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had to admit &mdash;and I admire him for being candid in the matter&mdash;that he had his doubts about it.  We have not got the right of free entry which we contend we were entitled to under the 1938 agreement. We have got an undertaking that, up to a certain proportion, certain goods would be allowed into Great Britain.</P>

      <P>We are getting that in exchange for our undertaking to refrain from exporting to the Continent. What are the sort of goods we are going to get licences to export? Licences are going to be freely given, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for seaweed meal.  I am not going to decry that as a commodity. I understand that it is very useful as a cattle food and for other reasons.  Therefore, we are going to be allowed to export it, because the British want it, just in the same way as they are going to take our cattle, because they are crying out for meat. I do not think that is a very important industry.  It is, of course, important for those who are endeavouring to give employment and utilise the natural resources which ought to be developed and encouraged.  Licences are to be given freely by the British for peppermint cordials.  They are going to be good enough to buy waste paper from us, provided that the prices are cut. These are some of the things we are going to be allowed to export to Great Britain in exchange for the undertaking we have given to them that we will refrain from taking the fullest advantage of our opportunity to develop our cattle trade and other trade with the Continent.  Then, <Col N="2365" /> according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they are going to give us generous quotas for rat paste and bullrush powder puffs.  I suppose Deputy Davin would scarcely approve of that, because it may create a scarcity of bullrush powder puffs in this country.</P>

      <P>I agree that they are going to allow us to export Gaeltacht products up to 14/- per yard in value.  They are going to give licences for them.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, they will permit us to export, between manufactured goods, semi-manufactured goods and industrial raw materials, goods to the total value of between £500,000 and £1,000,000.  As I have said, in exchange we have accepted that the British have a right to try to restrict our opportunities to develop our trade with the Continent. The word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in Article 1 of the agreement is well chosen, because this agreement does represent in a very large measure the traditional policy of the British Government towards this country, and because those negotiating on behalf of our people are prepared to accept that in principle, as they undeniably have done in the paragraph to which I have referred.  The British are going to give us licences freely for seaweed meal, peppermint cordials, waste paper and generous quotas for rat paste and bullrush powder puffs.  This agreement is going to have repercussions upon our own people.  It is going to make meat very much dearer than it has been hitherto.

      <P>Deputy Byrne pointed out that in the majority of houses in Dublin meat only appears on the table once a week, for the Sunday meal.  I am not saying that we should not try to get the highest possible price we can for anything which we export from this country.  I do say, however, that, if we are so generous, as the Minister for <Col N="2366" /> Agriculture indicated in his preliminary conversations with the Press in London and before he had met the people with whom he was going to negotiate, as to give cheap meat to the British at the expense of this community, we ought in justice to see that we provide meat for our own people at a price at which they can purchase and enjoy it.  According to Deputy Byrne, who claims to be in very close contact with the workers of Dublin, these workers see meat only one day in seven.  They are not able to buy it, as it is becoming much too expensive for their purses.  If they are not going to forego it altogether in future, the consequence will be that wages will have to go up, in the illusory hope that an increase of wages will take place <i>in vacuum</i> and that other goods will not go up in consequence, and they will be able to buy the meat which they are not now in a position to do.</P>
      <P>If we are going to give cheap meat to Great Britain, the Government ought at least to consider what they can do to provide the people of this country with cheap beef.  There must be some way out of this.  We were able to provide them with cheap beef during 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937. The workers of Dublin never lived so well as they did then.  I do not say that we should start an economic war-with Great Britain or refuse to give them our cattle in order that the workers in Dublin would get cheap beef.  I do not say that we should give our cattle to them at an unduly cheap price in order that the workers in Dublin should get cheap meat.  But, as we have made the pint and cigarettes cheaper, we ought at least to take steps to make meat cheaper.  It should not be outside the capacity of the Government, which has been able to give away £6,000,000 in order to cheapen beer and tobacco, to try to find some money to subsidise the meat which the poor of Dublin should be permitted to consume the same as the rest of us.  I say that that obligation falls on them much more definitely and much more immediately because of the obligation which they have accepted in this agreement to feed Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Taoiseach, when <Col N="2367" /> replying to this debate, should at least give us some assurance that this question of the meat supply for the workers of our towns and cities is receiving the attention of the Government. Up to this they appear to have done nothing.  In fact, the various elements in the Government appear to be in conflict with each other.  The Minister for Agriculture blames the butcher, because he does not give enough for the cattle.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that the butchers are paying too much.  But whether the butchers are paying too much, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggests, or too little, as the Minister for Agriculture suggests, the fact remains that the mass of the people in Dublin are not able to buy any meat at all.  Since we are going to be generous to the people across the water, the Government here ought at least to accept the responsibility of ensuring that our people here are treated no worse by them than they are prepared to treat our neighbours. I have nothing more to say on the agreement, except what I have already said, that I think, so far as paragraph (5)  of A of the annex is concerned, it is a bad agreement, because it revives the vicious policy of attempting to limit and restrict the natural trade of the Irish people with the Continent of Europe.</P>

      <P>I have listened attentively to almost all the speeches made in this debate.  I listened to speeches from the Opposition side, and in particular to Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass, and, having done so, I am convinced that neither this nor any similar agreement would be before the House to-day if the Fianna Fáil Party had been returned to power in February last.  Deputy Lemass yesterday made a lengthy speech.  I will admit that, generally speaking, it was a sensible and critical speech, but he wound it up by suggesting to those who agree with him that this agreement should not be accepted.  I listened to his Leader, Deputy de Valera, last night, and although he criticised certain aspects of the agreement, he suggested that it should not <Col N="2368" /> be rejected.  I have now heard Deputy MacEntee emphasise the fact that the agreement is a bad one.  I daresay that, even though he thinks so, he will not have the pluck to challenge a division on it and vote against it.  He is a very wise man, because not only do the majority of the people of the country support the Government in this agreement, but a considerable section of the Deputy's supporters are willing to do likewise.  Of course, the Deputy is entitled to say that this is a bad agreement, but still he will not have the courage to vote against it.</P>

It is a good agreement because it is a longterm agreement, and any such agreement is acceptable to the majority of the members of this House.  It is a good agreement because it provides stability for our industrialists and our agriculturists over a longer period of time than any previous agreement.  The 1938 agreement was limited to a period of three years.  This agreement is for a period of four years, so that any good agreement made on behalf of the people of this country for such a period, and particularly in the troubled conditions in the world to-day, must provide stability for a longer period than probably any other international agreement of the kind that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why the backbenchers in the Fianna Fáil Party cannot see anything good in this agreement. Deputy de Valera frankly admitted that the levelling up in the prices of live stock was an improvement. I heard Deputy Killilea within the last hour, criticise that section of the agreement very unfairly and very severely.  To my amazement he asserted that there had been a reduction of £5 per head in the price of fat cattle since last November, when his colleagues in then Government were in consultation with the British Government.  If there has been such <Col N="2369" /> a reduction in the prices of fat cattle since November last, what in the name of goodness is the cause of the row between the Dublin butchers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the members of this Government? I, with some of my colleagues, listened quite recently in a committee room to a representative deputation of the Dublin butchers.  They had their accountant with them.  He, of course, is familiar with the affairs of the Dublin butchers, and he asserted that in two recent months the Dublin butchers had paid an average price of 110/2 per cwt. for fat cattle in the Dublin market.  Deputy Aiken has come into the House.  He knows something about the price of fat cattle and of store cattle.  Will he stand up and tell Deputy Killilea that the price of fat cattle was as high as 110/2 12 months ago?  Certainly not.  If that was their price then, would not the Dublin butchers be equally justified in keeping up the row that they have been kicking up in the last few weeks with the Minister for Industry and Commerce? I am sure the Taoiseach will be able to correct the wrong impression which Deputy Killilea endeavoured to create when criticising the prices in this agreement so far as they apply to live stock.</P>
    <P>I think that my friend, Deputy T. Walsh, was very foolish when he tried to assert&mdash;I do not think he would be able to prove it&mdash;that this agreement is going to encourage smuggling across the Border.  The conditions that existed prior to the making of this agreement definitely created an inducement and a temptation to smugglers to come down here and buy cattle in the Dublin market and take them across the Border.  Deputy Aiken knows some of them.  I do not say they are friends of his, but he knows perfectly well that the agent of one very prominent exporter in the Six Counties came to the Dublin market every Wednesday and bought cattle here as advanced stores, and from Amiens Street station they were taken in special trains across the Border.  He kept them for not more than six days in the Six Counties, and then sent them out through one of the Northern ports with the fat British <Col N="2370" /> subsidy on their backs, getting that subsidy, so far as I know, under false pretences.  I assert from my limited knowledge that this agreement is going to cut that kind of activity, notwithstanding what Deputy Walsh has said. The adoption of that policy, as Deputy Aiken and Deputy Lemass and, in particular, Deputy Smith know perfectly well, was the cause of diverting across the Border tens of thousands of live stock which otherwise would have been carried through the Port of Dublin. That policy deprived hundreds of dockers at the Port of Dublin of valuable employment over a very long period.  If anybody has any doubt about that, I refer him to the number of deputations, representing dockers and port workers in Dublin who brought that matter forcibly under the notice of Deputy Lemass on several occasions when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have reason to believe, from my limited knowledge of what went on, that this agreement is going to cut out that kind of illegal activity altogether.</P>

      <P>The section of this agreement dealing with the price and quantity of eggs to be exported in the future will prove to be an invaluable <Col N="2371" /> asset to the small farmers and their wives and workers in this country.  I agree with the Minister for Agriculture in giving whatever credit is due to his predecessor in this respect.  May I say, however, that his predecessor would not have been able to establish the very efficient organisation that is now in existence for the purpose of operating this section of the agreement were it not for the valuable assistance that was given to the Department by that body which is now known as Egg Exports? I know a couple of people associated with this organisation and there is no doubt about it that they have given considerable assistance to Deputy Smith when he was in office. I am hopeful that, as a result of the operation and extension of the agreement already existing in this matter, there will be a considerable increase in the quantity of eggs exported in the years to come, thereby conferring an everlasting benefit upon those who are associated with the production of eggs and poultry.  I notice myself, from access to figures which I can get elsewhere, that even in the last few months there has been a considerable increase in the quantity of eggs and poultry exported from this country. That is due, in the main, to this particular section of the agreement.  I would also say that, compared to 30 or 40 years ago, the quality of eggs exported from this country is undoubtedly a credit to the Department of Agriculture and to the people associated with the organisation to which I have already referred.  The whole system of the organisation of egg exports is a credit to the country. I hope that the Taoiseach will pay particular attention to the suggestion of Deputy Larkin that that system of bulk buying and selling should be copied so far as it can be copied in respect of other articles that are to be exported under the terms of this agreement. The producer is bound to get more in the long run by way of a profitable price when there is an efficient central purchasing and selling organisation in existence.  I understand that the cost of running the organisation known as Egg Exports is very small, and it is certainly very small compared to the <Col N="2372" /> way in which this industry is being worked up to the advantage of everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>If we are to increase our agricultural production and if we are to increase our live stock and agricultural exports from this country, we must have&mdash;and I am only going to refer to it very briefly&mdash;a more efficient internal transport machine.  It is fortunate that we have an inquiry in progress by experts in connection with suggestions for the improvement of our existing transport machine.  I know of cases that occurred within the past few years&mdash;and it is a tragedy&mdash;where there were big catches of fish in Valentia, Tralee and other ports and, because of shortage of transport or because of long delays in our own internal transport system, the fish had to be iced in the City of Dublin and delivered eventually to a destination in Great Britain at considerable loss to the people who caught them.  If we are going to help in that direction&mdash;and I am sure that everybody does&mdash;to increase the export of fish and other commodities, we must have an efficient transport system to get the commodities concerned from the source of production to their destination inside a reasonable period. I am sure that the Taoiseach&mdash;as well as Deputy Aiken and Deputy Killilea&mdash; knows well that delays in the transshipment of live stock due to a bad internal system of transport here and, perhaps, partly due to a bad system on the other side, have been the cause of the degrading of our live stock at British fairs, to the disadvantage of the producer and the exporter in the long run.  Deputy Aiken is quite right in asserting that since this agreement was signed, so far as the export of live stock is concerned, there has been a considerable tightening up in the grading of our cattle for export to Great Britain.  I have heard that from very prominent exporters and live-stock producers in this country whom I meet on many occasions during the week.  I should like the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Agriculture to look into that matter and see if there is any unfairness in the tightening-up system that has been brought into operation since this agreement was signed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Something should be done in connection with the export of our live stock from this country.  A considerable period elapses between the time when our fat cattle and advanced stores are sold at the Midland fairs in this country and the time they arrive at their destinations in Great Britain&mdash;Norwich or York or some of the markets in Great Britain, where our fat cattle and advanced stores have been sold over a long period of years.  The time taken in getting the cattle from the farm to the fair and from the fair, where they are sold, to the point of destination in Great Britain is having, and has had over a period of years, a very serious effect on the prices paid for these cattle in Norwich, York and elsewhere. I should like to see something done to speed up the period of time in which the cattle will be brought to their destination from the point where they are purchased in this country.  I should like to draw the attention of the Taoiseach&mdash;and I hope he will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;to the fact that I think the period of ten hours' detention at the port is unnecessarily long. It should, if possible, be cut down in the interests of the producer and the exporter of our cattle.  In the long run it should mean a better price for those concerned.  There is one thing asserted in this agreement and that is that our relations with the British Government in general should give cause for further consideration.  It has been represented to me by industrialists who carry on highly-efficient industries in my constituency that they have to pay from £1 to 25/- per ton <Col N="2374" /> extra on coal from Great Britain. That has a very bad effect on their production costs.  If highly-efficient industrial concerns in this country are anxious and willing to find a market for their surplus goods in Great Britain or elsewhere, they should be in a position to compete with their competitors in a foreign market on an equal footing.  Some further consideration ought to be given to the cost of coal for our industrialists.  It does seem rather excessive to expect them to pay an extra £1 or 25/- per ton for coal, leaving out of the calculation altogether the increased cost of transport.  The cost of transport is not an important factor in industry in Great Britain, because the coal is actually mined there.  Is consideration of that matter precluded from further negotiation by the terms of this agreement during the period of the agreement?</P>
      <P>Other important matters in regard to our balance of trade and our deficit in international trade have been fairly well disposed of by the Minister for Finance last night.  Deputy Allen is a severe critic of this whole agreement. He says there is nothing good about it; I have taken down his exact words. He says this agreement is the be-all and end-all of this Government so long as they have any future in this House. That is a silly suggestion to make. This Government is going to last longer than Deputy Allen realises. Deputy Allen is small fry compared with the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition prior to the election suggested that if a Government of this kind came into existence as a result of the election doom and disaster would follow.  The sun is shining as brightly to-day as it did this time twelve months.  The people of the country are far better off than they were this time twelve months despite all that has been said by Deputy Tommy Walshe, Deputy Killilea and Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement is not the be-all and the end-all of this Government.  I doubt if there is any man except the present Taoiseach in this House or in this country who could lead a Government of the kind that he is leading to-day and who could take to London <Col N="2375" /> with him five colleagues as good as the men he took with him, competent to stand up to and face the trained and able diplomats and experts that they have over there, and bring home with him an agreement of this kind.  I assert again that it is my opinion that if the Fianna Fáil Government had returned to office on the 18th February by any unhappy fluke we would not now be discussing an agreement of this kind, or any other agreement.  It is a good agreement.  I hope that, by the will of God and by the will of the people, the present Taoiseach will remain in office until the time comes when he will negotiate that agreement for which we all wait so anxiously and which will wipe out the unnatural boundary that separates us from our people in the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the Government, I think I may say, have no reason to be displeased with the debate which is just now about to conclude.  We have had some criticism of the agreement.  We have had some comments on details of its provisions. But, when all the pin pricking has been done, when all the pointing has been made, and when all the probing has been effected, the Opposition are going to vote for this agreement, which Deputy MacEntee said is a bad agreement, which Deputy Lemass said is a poor agreement, and which Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition, declared unambiguously was a proper agreement for which this House should vote.</P>
      <P>This agreement has been endorsed by the industrialists.  It has been received with satisfaction by the farmers.  It has been received by the public generally as an effective contribution to the well-being of the country. Everything that has been said during the course of this debate by Opposition speakers merely underlines the value of this agreement and emphasises its importance to our agricultural and manufacturing economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my remarks yesterday, when opening the case for the agreement&mdash;if I may be permitted to put it that way&mdash;I endeavoured to show <Col N="2376" /> the House that it was neither my intention nor the object of my colleagues to exaggerate the benefits of the agreement or to overstate what we thought were the advances that were made under it.  At the same time it is proper that the advantages and benefits resulting from the agreement should not be underestimated or understated.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, in his speech last night, adopted a reasonable and proper tone.  He set the headline on which a debate of this kind should proceed. I am sorry his example has not been followed by some of those who subsequently took part in the debate.  I had hoped, and express the hope again here to-day, that the attitude which Deputy de Valera adopted last night and the headline he set will be followed by speakers who in the period of the adjournment of this Dáil may discuss this agreement.  I hope that Deputy de Valera's headline will be followed by them and that the misrepresentation and lies which have been disseminated in reference to my colleagues and myself, and the misrepresentations and false interpretations put upon this agreement will not be further disseminated for the purpose of misleading the people as to the effect of this agreement.  Deputy de Valera very properly said that the agreement should be judged, not in reference to its context with the 1938 agreement, or by what the 1938 agreement did do or did not do, but on its own merits.  I am prepared to accept that very proper test put by the Leader of the Opposition. All I and my colleagues ask from Deputies and from the people of the country in regard to this agreement is that the agreement be judged on its merits and on its results; and, judged by that test, we are prepared to receive a very satisfactory verdict from this House and from the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in his speech, when he opened the case for the Opposition, expressed his personal view that we would be better off without any trade agreement with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition took a different view, a different personal view, from that taken by Deputy Lemass.  I suppose both points of view <Col N="2377" /> can be legitimately held and reasons can be stated for them, but, unfortunately, so far as we are concerned, and I think so far as any Government that had to undertake the task we had to undertake shortly after assuming office, would be concerned, it was not a question of whether there would or would not be an agreement; it was not a question, as Deputy Lemass said, of whether we could have negotiated a temporary agreement or whether we should have opened up negotiations and then come home from the atmosphere of Great Britain and absorbed some of the atmosphere of our native land; it was really a question of facing realities, and we faced them.  We had to face a situation in which some Government had to make an agreement with Great Britain. During the first ten years of this State the Government found no necessity for any trade agreement with Great Britain.  Our agricultural produce had free entry into the British market, without tariffs, restrictions or quotas. Our industrial products had free entry into the British market, without tariffs, or practically without them.  But, in 1938, at the conclusion of the economic war, existing conditions forced the then Government to make a trade agreement with Great Britain, and any Government such as we were when we came into office last February would have had to take note of the situation confronting them and the facts which existed at the time.</P>
    <P>The 1938 agreement had to some extent run its course and the conditions of world trade had so altered that something had to be done to put into some sort of order our trade relations with Great Britain.  An agreement had to be made, would have had to be made, if this country's vital interests were to be safeguarded.  It was not, therefore, a question of any choice whether there should or could not have been an agreement.  There had to be an agreement, in my view.  We faced the realities and we believe we have got an agreement which is beneficial to our farmers and industrialists, and which has been endorsed by our farmers and industrialists and the public generally.  We make no exaggerated claims for it.  We had a tough <Col N="2378" /> fight to get what we got.  One Deputy &mdash;I do not know whether it was Deputy Allen in the bitter speech he made&mdash; said this agreement represented for us a disappointment of our hopes.  It represents nothing of the sort.  We were extremely glad to get this agreement and its provisions, with all their limitations&mdash;with what is in the agreement and with what is not in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The conditions that we had to face were those that I outlined yesterday&mdash; world conditions.  In addition, we had to face the circumstances and the conditions created by the 1938 agreement. It is very easy for Deputy Lemass now to express his personal view that we would be better off without an agreement. He had to make the agreement in 1938 and when he was recommending it warmly to the House, recommending its provisions in such terms that one of the Deputies said it seemed to him, according to the speech of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, as if all those clauses in the agreement which are now regarded as so objectionable, even by Deputy Lemass, had been imposed upon the British and not imposed upon the Irish by the British negotiators.  That was the way Deputy Lemass recommended the 1938 agreement to this House.  At all events, whether it was good or bad, it was an agreement that had to be made at that time.</P>
    <P>It was suggested, in the course of the 1938 agreement discussions, that the trade agreement of 1938 had no relationship with the other two agreements negotiated at that time, one about the ports and the other about setting up financial disputes between the two Governments.  It was endeavoured to put the trade agreement into an entirely separtate category.  I have no desire to enter into any controversy about that, but I must say that the 1938 agreement had this relationship to the conditions existing in 1938: the negotiators who then went to Britain had their hands tied and their bargaining power lessened by the events of the six years that preceded 1938, and that trade agreement which, according to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was a trade agreement of the same type as would have been entered into by any other <Col N="2379" /> country, was less beneficial to this country by virtue of the circumstances in which it came into existence, by virtue of the fact that we were exhausted as a country by the six years of the economic war and our bargaining hands were tied by the economic conditions it produced.</P>
    <P>We are still suffering from the results of the conditions in which the negotiators of the 1938 agreement negotiated that agreement.  That was one of the things which tied our hands when negotiating the present agreement. Deputy Lemass can now say airily that he would have liked and would, in fact, have thrown aside altogether the 1938 agreement.  He said he would have liked to abrogate completely the agreement.  There was nothing to stop the last Government from giving the requisite notice and doing so.  The 1938 agreement could at any time have been denounced or abrogated, or whatever is the technical term by giving six months' notice. There was nothing on any document that we were able to discover to indicate what Deputy Lemass said yesterday he favoured&mdash;the complete abrogation of the 1938 agreement.  On the basis of any indications we could get from documents, the view of the last Government was to the effect that it was not in our interests, in the particular circumstances, to denounce the 1938 agreement.  We had to face that situation.  I and my colleagues would have liked to scrap the entire 1938 agreement.</P>
    <P>I gave an indication yesterday of that agreement, and the balance of the agreement, so far as what the British undertook to give this country and so far as what we undertook to give to Great Britain, was very heavily weighted against this country.  I do not blame the last Government for it, because of the conditions in which they negotiated it, conditions arising at the end of the economic war.  There are only two articles in that long agreement in which the British undertook to do anything.  In Article 1 they undertook, in accordance with what Deputy Lemass said yesterday, that certain produce of ours, agricultural and industrial, should enjoy entry free <Col N="2380" /> of customs duty into the United Kingdom.  But that agreement, which on its face appeared to give free entry of our goods to the British market, did not, in fact, do so.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through every one of the other articles in this agreement, but if Deputies will look at it they will see that almost every one of the articles comprises an undertaking by the Government of Eire&mdash;&ldquo;The Government of Eire undertake...&rdquo; That goes on right down to the end of Article V which, as the Minister for Finance stated yesterday, was the article that caused the greatest trouble to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last Government.  The provisions of it impelled him to state the desire he stated yesterday, that he would wish to denounce the entire agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 5 gave free entry into this country to a vast variety of goods from Great Britain&mdash;free of quantitative restrictions and free of customs duties. We were faced with a particular situation when we argued before the British Government negotiators&mdash; clever, able and experienced negotiators&mdash;that no Irish Parliament would have approved, as the Oireachtas did approve, of the 1938 agreement, had it been known that Article 1 had the interpretation which the British Government were placing upon it.  We argued that, but I was faced with this argument, having very carefully stated that I was not there as a lawyer and was not going to agrue as a lawyer; that the wording of clause 1 of Article 1 which was the vital article from our point of view, and I want Deputies to remember that&mdash;it was the vital article because it gave us free entry for our produce into the British market, or we thought it did; all the other article were in favour of Great Britain, were giving something to Great Britain&mdash; was different from that in Article 5.</P>
    <P>When Great Britain was getting the very substantial benefits of the free list comprised in Article 5, what did the draftsman say?  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Eire undertake that the goods... which are not now liable to customs duty or quantitative regulation shall continue <Col N="2381" /> to enjoy entry into Eire, free of customs duty and quantitative regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was put to me why, if the interpretation for which we were arguing was the correct one and the interpretation intended by agreement, did we allow in Article 1 the phrase to be merely: &ldquo;shall enjoy entry free of customs duty&rdquo;, when, in Article 5, where it was intended to be made absolutely clear on the part of the British Government, where the British were getting free entry for larger quantities of their own produce without customs duty or quantitative regulation, those words &ldquo;or quantitative regulation&rdquo; were specifically stated. It was very difficult to answer that. We, or whoever were responsible at the time for Article 1 ought to have been astute in wathing the difference between the wordings of Article 1 and Article 5.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said he objected to this agreement and the actual phrase he used was that his main objection to it was that the 1938 agreement is a bad basis on which to build a new agreement. I think it is a very bad basis, and neither I nor my colleagues wanted to have it as a basis.  We would have liked to scrap the whole of the 1938 agreement from the very beginning to the very end, but we were tied to it. We were tied to its provisions and had to take what we could out of it and try to eat into it as best we could.  The first thing we did was to try to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, so far as our interpretation of Article 1 was concerned. Had we had a new agreement, instead of this graft, as I called it yesterday, on the old agreement, we would have abandoned our right to interpret Article 1 as we wished.  It may be that, if our interests require it, we may have to submit Article 1 to an international tribunal for its interpretation. The British were perfectly prepared to give us any formula which would give us a wide range of our manufactured goods for free entry into the British market but had we agreed to any such formula, or the abandonment of Article 1, we would have had to cut down our rights.</P>
    <P>There was another reason, and <Col N="2382" /> perhaps the principal reason, why we could not scrap the entire of this 1938 agreement.  The general trend of international relations, so far as trade matters are concerned at the present moment, is towards freedom of trade. It is in the general direction of getting the nations to abandon the practice of giving preferential treatment, one to the other, at the expense of other nations.  In particular, the nations which form the British Commonwealth of Nations have been in the habit of giving preferential treatment to each other for many years past.  That is a very valuable right.  The right of preferential treatment in the matter of trade with Great Britain and the other nations of the Commonwealth is one which we enjoy, so long as we are associated with that league of nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We have enjoyed that since 1922, and we are still enjoying it by virtue of our free association with that league of nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It is a valuable right from the point of view of our people.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday to the provisions of the Geneva agreement, the provisions of the general agreement on trade and tariffs and to the Havana charter.  These international documents provide for a position in which parties to these agreements will not be entitled to increase existing preferences or create new preferences.  We wanted to be in a position to assert our right to existing preferences under our relationship with the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and if we can say that these preferences existed by virtue of the 1938 document, we were in a position to have those preferences continued and to get the benefit of them for our people.  If we scrapped the 1938 agreement we might have been deprived of that argument.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to state any further reasons why we adopted the device of having an agreement supplemental to, a graft upon or a modification of the 1938 agreement. In effect, it is a new agreement, and, as Deputy de Valera suggested, I am prepared to have the provisions of this agreement tested on their merits, as if in fact it were a new <Col N="2383" /> agreement.  We would, of course, had we negotiated for a new agreement, have had to put in these articles of the 1938 agreement which we have allowed to remain in.  Deputy Lemass, in the course of a long speech, never gave one single concrete example of any article of the 1938 agreement that we ought to have got rid of and did not get rid of.  He never suggested that the provisions of this 1938 agreement, which contemplated the examination by our Prices Commission of our tariffs on British goods coming into the country, or the machinery provided for our tariff system should be scrapped&mdash;we never made that suggestion nor did any other Deputy in this House in the course of the entire discussion.  I listened carefully to it in order to see whether any such suggestion would be made.  A single suggestion was not made by any deputy that we failed in any way in our duty by leaving in, as we have left, some of the 1938 clauses.  I think that is a tribute to the fact that we have negotiated a good agreement.  Deputy Lemass himself, when he was recommending the 1938 agreement to the Dáil, justified all those provisions as good provisions, necessary provisions and provisions that would be found in any international agreement.  I did not like them and I still do not like them. We did not like to have our tariff system examined even by our own Prices Commission, but Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, not merely agreed with the inclusion of that type of machinery in the 1938 agreement, but justified it very eloquently and very cogently in the speech which he delivered in 1938 when recommending that agreement to this House.</P>
    <P>The position is this therefore: we have not been criticised in one single particular for any clause of the 1938 agreement which we have left in.  We have not been criticised for the extension we have got of the free list. There could not, of course, be any criticism of this because it is a distinct advance.  We have not been criticised for the clause referring to Article 2, our balance of payments, the provision in reference to our powers to deal with <Col N="2384" /> the disequilibrium in our balance of payments.  May I say in parenthesis, in answer to Deputy Larkin who put a question to me this morning regarding Article 2, that Article 2 in no way fetters, hinders, hampers, clogs or affects in any way our right to put on tariffs, quotas, quantitative restrictions or any other tariff device we wish. We are fully empowered to use our protective machinery, our tariff &ldquo;gear&rdquo; if you wish to call it that. Deputy Lemass, who is regarded as the apotheosis in this country of Irish industry, supported what is comprised in Article 5, and Article 10 of the agreement which was agreed to by him when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Article 2, which refers to our balance of payments, gives us additional power to deal with articles in the free list for the purpose of rectifying our disorderly balance of payments.  It in no way affects our rights in other directions.  It gives us something additional and takes nothing from us.  Regarding the question about which Deputy Larkin wished to be assured, we have the fullest rights save in respect of the goods in Article 5 and certain classes of goods in Article 10 where the rate of duty is frozen in one of the schedules.  With regard to every other article which comes into this country we have the fullest freedom. We have increased the scope of our powers with reference to the goods on the free list, to the extent of 40 per cent. of the value of our 1938 trade in those goods.  In practice and in fact that means that the free list is practically gone.  We can do that without consulting the British Government or even without giving notice to the British Government.  Deputy Lemass said that we had only put it in writing what he had already done before.</P>
    <P>When I tried to use the document signed by the President of the British Board of Trade as a result of some negotiations with the British Government in which I thought there was agreement by the British authorities to restrict this free list and to allow the Irish Government increased powers to impose restrictions on goods coming in under Article 5 of the 1938 agreement, I was faced with the position that I was met by Sir Stafford Cripps, who is a <Col N="2385" /> very eminent lawyer, with the unanswerable argument that there was in fact no agreement at all.  I could not answer that.  There was an agreement to consider a restriction of the British rights regarding the free list under the agreement of 1938, but there had been absolutely no agreement as to the percentage. It was put to me, &ldquo;when one of the vital terms was not agreed upon, how can that be an agreement?&rdquo; and that is unanswerable.  It had been agreed in principle in the discussions which had taken place between Irish and British officials prior to our taking office that the free list which had hitherto been allowed to the British under Article 5 should be restricted to a certain percentage of the value of the trade.  That principle was accepted, but the highest percentage that we were informed had been even discussed by the British was 25 per cent.  We succeeded in extracting from the British a percentage of 40.  We got that in this agreement and we have contractual rights for it.  We have also got, under the balance of payments provisions in Article 2 which Deputy Larkin referred to, additional powers which, inferentially, impliably or consequentially may be used to assist our own industries. We have got rid of the objectionable provisions in the 1938 agreement which provided for the power of the British Government to order the priority in which the Prices Commission would consider and examine into tariffs or the variety of British goods coming into this country that would be scheduled on consultation between the two Governments. That is what was in the agreement signed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am overstating the case when I say that this agreement represents a considerable advance.  We should have liked to have got more.  We did, in fact, fight for more.  I argued for quite a long time on the lines along which Deputy de Valera said we should have argued.  We wanted capital goods in return for our agricultural produce, in return for giving them, as the Leader of the Opposition put it, the vital food which they require for their production.  Deputy de Valera was quite right when he said that one <Col N="2386" /> of the things we should have bargained for was to get our capital requirements and raw materials at some sort of reasonable price.  As I think Deputy Davin said a few minutes ago, and as I think Deputy Aiken sneeringly said yesterday, we should have asked for coal at a cheaper price.  We did all these things.  I think I have had fair experience of negotiating with the British Government.  The Minister for Finance and myself have more experience than any other two persons in this House of negotiating with the British Government and I think that the Minister for Finance is the only person in this House who has as much experience as I have of negotiating with the British Government and we know the way it has to be done. We conducted our negotiation in the way experience has taught us that such negotiations should be conducted, and we got results.  We could not get results, however, where no results could be procured such as in regard to coal.  We are charged more per ton than the domestic consumers of Britain are charged.  I raised this point.  I pointed out how much this meant to the electricity consumers, the consumers of gas and the domestic consumers of coal in this country generally and I was met with an absolutely unanswerable case.  We are on the foreign market at our own choice.  The foreign market prices happen at the moment to be against us.  These prices were formerly in our favour.  Coal was cheaper on the foreign market before and we got it cheaper in the old days, because we were on the foreign market, than the British consumer.  Now we are still on the foreign market and it so happens that conditions have altered, and the price to-day on the foreign market is dearer than the price in the home market.  I was asked: &ldquo;How can you have it both ways?  Get off the foreign market, if you like.&rdquo;  We did not want to get off the foreign market because it is believed that the price of those commodities in the foreign market in the future will fall and that we will again get the benefit of the decrease in price later on.  At all events, I had no answer to that.  I want Deputies to understand that that point was not overlooked.  I had no answer to the <Col N="2387" /> arguments and my hands and the hands of my colleagues were tied by the fact that we did not want to get off the foreign market.</P>
    <P>As regards capital equipment and goods, we tried to get these vital supplies from the British, either as a contractual right or as a business proposition or as an act of grace.  We tried every trick in the bag.  We tried argument; we tried blandishments; we tried everything that human ingenuity could devise.  Deputy Allen talked about foundry coke.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told the House yesterday that they would have given us the foundry coke if they had it and that they did the next best thing: they offered to put us in possession of all the results of their scientific investigation into substitutes.  These considerations applied to every other single matter that we asked for.  If they had it, they would have given it to us and when they have it I believe they will give it to us.  We could not ask them for things they have not got.  We asked for steel and they had not got enough steel for themselves.  It was the same with every other type of capital equipment.  That was the situation we were up against.</P>
    <P>I think it is only just and right to say on behalf of the British negotiators and the British Government generally that they approached our problems with goodwill, with a desire to meet us in so far as they could and to the extent to which their own conditions permitted them.  There is no doubt that the British nation at the present time is in a very serious economic and financial position.  There is no use in Deputy Allen saying, as he said here to-day, that he is not satisfied that the British are not deliberately trying to ruin our manufacturing industries by withholding essential supplies.  That is the kind of thing that does damage to our people. We have to approach negotiations in international matters on the basis that we have grown up as a nation.  We should not be suffering from an inferiority complex.  We are as good as ever the British were and our negotiators who went over there to <Col N="2388" /> negotiate on behalf of the Irish people were as good a crowd, even though it included myself, as ever faced a British delegation across a conference table.  That sort of thing and the suggestion of Deputy Lemass yesterday, that British Ministers were guilty of some dishonest conduct or some mean motives in their dealings with us, is the kind of thing that does us harm.  I do think it is right for us to say here and to acknowledge that while we fought and fought hard over the conference table in connection with every item of this agreement&mdash;we fought it the same way as I would fight a case in court with a doughty opponent&mdash;they were trying to do their best for their clients; I was trying to do the best for mine.</P>
    <P>Every agreement, whether it is made between individuals or between nations, ultimately represents a series of compromises.  This agreement represents a series of compromises and we both got something out of it and, both getting something out of it, leaves no hard feelings behind on either side. The very fact that we have been able to negotiate an agreement which left us in a position of being friends with our neighbour opposite, and of not having given anything away, or having felt we were suffering from any inferiority complex, augurs well for this country's future.  I believe that, as time goes on, because of the conditions that we created over there in negotiating this agreement and the atmosphere of goodwill that emerged in the course of the negotiations, we can go and our representatives, our Ministers or officials can go from time to time to Great Britain and, as supplies of essential commodities become available I believe they will give us at least our fair share and probably more than our fair share.</P>
    <P>That, I think, answers the suggestion of those Deputies who said that we ought to have bargained our food supplies for essential and vital machinery. We tried it.  They had not got this machinery or those supplies but I do believe that, in consequence of the atmosphere that we created, in consequence of this agreement, and in consequence of hard business considerations&mdash;because <Col N="2389" /> the British are hard business people&mdash;good business people; they know we are a good customer of theirs and know we have something to sell them that will pay them to keep us on their hands&mdash;from sheer business considerations and reasons, we will get from them, as and when they can give it to us, our fair share of our essential requirements.</P>
    <P>We have, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce told you, eaten into Article 1 of the agreement and we have obtained, as a result of their investigation and examination of the list of goods that we wish to export to them, agreement upon that list&mdash;a good list.  Deputy MacEntee a few moments ago came in here and sneered at it and selected a few little items such as seaweed meal.  Again I think the sort of speech that Deputy MacEntee has made does not help either himself, his Party or his country.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee's leader stated here last night that, whatever this agreement was&mdash;he took the high line and the proper line&mdash;that it was an international agreement, which ought to be considered on its merits and in a calm atmosphere.  He put the question whether he himself would have subscribed his name to it, and he came to the conclusion that, in the circumstances, he would have voted for this agreement.  Up gets Deputy MacEntee and says in that way of his, his truculent and sneering fashion, that this is a bad agreement and the reason why he said it is a bad agreement, if you please, is that we have, according to him, in paragraph (5) of part A of the annex, surrendered ourselves to the kind of laws that the British were in the habit of passing against us in the 18th century and subsequently, the type of law passed by the British to strangle our trade.  If that is so, it is the duty of Deputy MacEntee to repudiate his leader and to call a division in the House.  If I have put my name on behalf of the Government of this country and on behalf of the people to an agreement which strangles our <Col N="2390" /> trade, which is the type of penal, fiscal legislation that was passed by the British Parliament in the 18th century, to destroy Irish trade, then I ought to be cleared out of office and Deputy MacEntee, instead of sneeringly referring to this as a bad agreement, ought to have the courage of his convictions and do something about it even if it meant the repudiation of his own leader.</P>
      <P>Of course, we have done nothing of the sort.  We have agreed to limit our sales of fat cattle to continental countries. Let me say again that we used the fact that there were continental buyers in this country at our cattle markets, eagerly demanding our fat cattle and anxious to pay a higher price than they were worth for them, as a bargaining factor in our negotiations with Great Britain.  We used it to get rid of this differential about which, of course, Deputy MacEntee has forgotten. We used it to get rid of that and to secure some of the benefits we have obtained.  We gave up nothing when we surrendered our right to sell a certain portion of our fat cattle to the Continent.  Under this agreement we reserve the right to sell 50,000 fat cattle each year to continental countries and by contractual right 10 per cent. of our total exports of fat and store cattle can still be sold to the Continent.</P>
      <P>Europe is hungry at the moment, and continental nations have their buyers over here.  How long is that going to last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has not this country been taught as a result of the economic war, and everything that has happened since, that whether we like it or not, we are economically tied to Great Britain?  It is all very fine for Deputy MacEntee to give expression to his utter nonsense about making our trade more international and more cosmopolitan.  He said here to-day that we had surrendered our rights to open up further markets on the Continent.  Deputy MacEntee had 16 years within which to make our trade more international and more cosmopolitan.  We did not make it any less cosmopolitan or international than we found it, but we did this: we preserved our right to sell portion of our fat cattle&mdash;an amount that <Col N="2391" /> in my opinion and in the opinion of the Minister for Agriculture, whose opinion is valuable, is quite adequate&mdash;in continental markets and to get commodities we want from these countries in return.  We think it is still good business to make a long-term agreement with our best customer, but we do not want to be cosmopolitan and carry on business with continental countries if that business is to cease after a short time.</P>
    <P>We hope sincerely that Europe will not be hungry for long.  We hope that Europe will soon rehabilitate itself and that the restoration of normal agricultural output in Europe will be quickly achieved.  Will Continental Europe be then looking for our store cattle?  Are those countries looking for them now? Is it not fat cattle they are looking for? What would we do with our store cattle, when we become cosmopolitan? Drag them around the world with us, with Deputy MacEntee in front blowing his trumpet and begging somebody to take them from us?  We adopted the long view.  We thought it good business to enter into a long-term agreement to market the bulk of our cattle in Britain, rather than take advantage of the hungry people in Europe and sell them on the continental market for temporarily higher prices. We made that a bargaining counter with Britain and we think we have done a piece of good business for the country as a result.  But Deputy MacEntee thinks we should be cosmopolitan !</P>
    <P>May I in that connection refer to a matter raised by Deputy Larkin, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Dr. Brennan&mdash;the impact of the price of cattle on our cost of living and on the ability of the poorer sections of our people to purchase necessary foodstuffs? The Government is fully aware of the gravity of that problem and they think that the only solution for it is increased production by the farmer. It may be, though I do not think it would be, necessary to subsidise meat in the way Deputy Larkin suggested tentatively and constructively, but this is a problem that will have to be met and if it is not solved, it will not certainly <Col N="2392" /> be for want of trying.  We have undertaken to grapple with the cost of living.  We feel that the country cannot progress materially or economically unless that problem is dealt with and we cannot have a position where prices are following wages in a never-ending spiral.  That is bad for the country economically and detrimental to its prosperity.  We shall require the co-operation of every section of the community to deal with that problem. Particularly shall we require the co-operation of the workers and I think we shall get that co-operation.  I can assure Deputy Larkin that the problem is ever present to our minds.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee wants us to encourage cosmopolitanism in order that we may get higher prices for our fat cattle on the markets of the world, but the higher the prices and the more continental buyers we have, the less chance there will for our own people to get meat at a reasonable price.  I assert with confidence that the price of meat rose more steeply during the period of office of the last Government than it has done since we came into office.  Anybody who has had to try to buy meat in the last few years knows what that has meant to him in hard cash.  It is not in the last few months, since this Government came into office, that the price of meat has been such as to prevent not merely the working people in whom Deputy Larkin was interested, not merely the middle classes, but even people who were until comparatively recently quite comfortably off, from buying meat.  They have not been able to pay the price, not to-day, or yesterday or since this Government came into office but in the last 12 or 18 months. That is a serious problem amongst the many other problems we have to tackle. Some of them we have solved already; many of them are still under consideration and, with the co-operation of other sections of the community, we hope to solve them before we submit our record for the verdict of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee wants us to become internationally-minded.  The first time that any trade agreement was made with a foreign country other than Britain, was made since we became the Government.  The Minister for External <Col N="2393" /> Affairs negotiated it and he is in the process of negotiating several more at present.  I wonder does that satisfy the international mind of Deputy MacEntee?  If he wished to be so cosmopolitan and wanted to make our trade more international, why did not the last Government negotiate and conclude agreements with other countries as we have done?  We have already concluded one with France; we are negotiating one with the Netherlands and with other continental countries.  I can give the details of the agreement with France if necessary but I think time does not permit me to go into all these details.</P>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient to show that, so far as it is necessary for this country to be internationally minded&mdash; and I am firmly convinced that it is necessary to be internationally minded &mdash;we have given a lead in a way in which it was never given before in the history of this country.  Both in trade matters and in matters concerning our foreign policy and external affairs as a whole, we have made advances, given a lead and given the country an international status without precedent in its records.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea suggested that prices for cattle had fallen and I think that Deputy Davin asked me to reassure the House on that point.  Deputy Davin said that he was quite convinced from his own knowledge that the statement was wrong.  It is wrong.  The price of fresh meat and the schedule of prices of fat cattle fluctuate in regard to certain published schedules of prices.  If this differential of 5/-which we found in existence when we came into office had not been removed, as it has been removed by the agreement and as it would not have been removed had we not come into office, the prices for fat cattle from June to October would have been as follows: Grade A, for June, 1/5½ a lb.; grade B, 1/2¼ a lb.  Under the agreement we objected to the grading of cattle as &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  They are now graded as specials, grade A and grade B.  We do not like the grade B for technical reasons but that is the grading at the moment.  Grade A special is 1/7 a lb., as against 1/5½ for grade A.  Our <Col N="2394" /> existing grade A is 1/6½ a lb. and grade B is 1/2¼ a lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Minister for Agriculture that precisely the same arrangements as to grading exist now as existed before.  At all events, I can say that if our cattle exporters or dealers have any case to make, if they are in any way hindered or hampered, as Deputy Davin told us this afternoon they were, the Minister for Agriculture will meet them sympathetically, consider their case, and try to meet their requirements.  I can speak for him in his presence and for all the Government.  We have adopted as one of our principles in the conduct of Government in this country that, so long as we are here, we will be fully appreciative of the fact that we do not know everything and we want the people who do know about their own business to inform us so that we may know their requirements and take action accordingly.</P>
      <P>The position as regards fertilisers is that we did not get fertilisers from Great Britain because they had not got any to give us.  We have, however, made arrangements which will, in the course of a short time, ensure that there will be a sufficient quantity of fertilisers in this country, such a quantity as will lead to a position where it will not be want of fertilisers which will be the trouble, but the difficulty will be to get the farmers to use them.</P>

      <P>I could give details, but I want to avoid as much as possible going into great detail.  Deputy de Valera was also worried about this question of fat cattle and thought that perhaps it would be better if we had <Col N="2395" /> more fat cattle to export, rather than store cattle.  That was the way he put it.  He said that the 25 per cent. was, perhaps, too low.  The Minister for Agriculture dealt with that fully in his speech yesterday.  In reality that clause in the agreement is of very little import at all.  If we are in a position to export more than 25 per cent. of fat cattle, I have no doubt that, by an arrangement with Great Britain, they will be able to accept more.  I am instructed that 25 per cent. was the traditional number of fat cattle which we sent from this country to Great Britain; that the proportion between fat and store cattle exported to Great Britain was 25 to 75 per cent. and that that is the reason for that being there. In my opening remarks yesterday I gave the numbers of fat cattle exported from this country to Great Britain in certain years.  May I repeat one or two of them and add two or three others in order that Deputies who are anxious to learn the facts may have them and so that their significance may be understood?  In 1930, we exported 294,193 fat cattle and 429,359 store cattle.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will perhaps bear with me for a moment. In 1939 the figures were, 133,907 fat cattle and 565,850 store cattle.  The Deputy is a mathematician and I hope he will not ask me to make out the percentage for him, because it is very considerably less than 25 per cent.  In 1947 we exported 51,915 fat cattle and 336,492 store cattle.  It is hardly worth while working out that percentage.  It does, however, show that the case that we ought to have more fat cattle for export is rather illusory when, in fact, we were not exporting because we had not the fat cattle to do so.  There is no use in saying that we ought to have more than 25 per cent. confined to fat cattle when, in fact, we were not exporting anything like 25 per cent. for many years past.  In the year 1945, we <Col N="2396" /> only exported 14,000 and in 1946 11,000 fat cattle.  What is the use of saying we ought to have more than 25 per cent. when in 1946 we only exported 11,000 and in 1945 14,000 fat cattle?  Last year, even after Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture went over in an aeroplane to Great Britain and extracted something out of them, all they got us to export was 51,000.</P>

      <P>Last year 51,000 fat cattle were exported.  If Deputy Lemass wants to know about the price, I may say we believe that because we have got rid of the differential which the last Government could not get rid of there will be more fat cattle available for export and the target is intended to be reached as soon as possible.  But wait until you have up to 25 per cent., until you get to the pre-war export of fat cattle and then talk about whether it is sufficient.  One of the principles which I learned as a young student for the purposes of my profession and which I have kept for all purposes ever since is: &ldquo;Never jump before you come to the stile.&rdquo; When we have reached the point when we will be exporting fat and store cattle to an aggregate amount equivalent to what we were exporting before the war, then we will see if it is necessary to go to the British and say: &ldquo;The 75 and 25 per cent. arrangement is not good enough for us&mdash;change it.&rdquo; When we get to that point, either myself or the Minister for Agriculture, or whoever may be in our positions at that time, will have very little difficulty in changing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke yesterday in rather sneering terms about my remarks on the balance of payments. The Minister for Finance yesterday afternoon dealt pretty fully with the reasons which impelled me to state earlier yesterday that our balance of trade position was such as to cause us very grave anxiety.  I do not propose to go over the ground which the Minister for Finance covered yesterday.  He <Col N="2397" /> gave a very full explanation of our position and very detailed figures to justify the conclusion at which this Government had arrived at in reference to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I want to make only a few supplementary remarks in reference to our balance of payments position, our dollar position and, in particular, to the remarks made by Deputy Aiken on our dollar position, remarks which I would have taken no notice of were it not for the fact that it would be improper to leave them on the records of this House unanswered.  Deputy Lemass said yesterday, in reference to our balance of payments position, that there was a net addition to our external balance in the year 1946.  The actual fact was that in the year 1946 there was a further increase of about £10,000,000 in Irish owned sterling, bringing the total sterling assets to about £410,000,000.  That was the position in 1946.  In 1947 the situation had altered very radically and very much to our detriment, because in the year 1947 expenditure by this country on imports rose to an unprecedented level.  It rose to a level of 24 per cent. higher in volume terms than in 1938.  That was the position as regards our imports, that they had risen by 24 per cent. over 1938 in volume terms, but at the same time our exports fell in volume by 30 per cent. below 1938.  The result was, of course, what one would expect, because despite the fact that last year was a record from the point of view of tourist expenditure and receipts from tourists in this country, there was an over-all deficit of perhaps as much as £30,000,000 involving an equivalent decrease in our sterling holdings.  While all that was going on, so far as we were concerned, British export prices rose higher, thereby reducing the real value of our income from our sterling assets.</P>
    <P>In 1947 our trade deficit averaged £8,500,000 a month.  For the beginning of this year it averaged £9,500,000 a month so that, disastrous as the position appeared to be last year, what we faced when we came into Government was the danger that it was going to be worse this year unless we took measures to stop it.  We did try to take measures to stop it for the <Col N="2398" /> reasons stated.  I think the Minister for Finance pointed out last night that there is some indication now that our adverse trade balance for this year&mdash; which looked so bleak and black when we came into office&mdash;may not be as bad as we expected it to be.  We hope that will be so, and certainly any steps that we can take to effect that purpose will be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass then spoke about the desirability of liquidating part of our sterling assets for capital goods and machinery.  I think that if he will take the trouble to read the speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce since we came into office he will find that he favours some such course if it can be done.  If the Deputy will analyse the imports which have come into this country in recent years he will discover that they consisted of capital goods only to a relatively small extent; for the most part they consisted of consumer and luxury goods, a large part of which should never have been allowed in.  Yesterday, there was a reference to the importation of £1,000,000 worth of Dutch chocolate.  We had these imports at a time when our balance of payments was in such an alarming state of disequilibrium. They were allowed to come into this country, and they were consumer goods, not capital goods or raw materials.  That is so much for Deputy Lemass's rather slighting reference to our concern on the question of the balance of payment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave the necessary details to the House in reference to our dollar position.  I would just like to add to what he said two considerations which might, possibly, damp down the slightly optimistic tone in which he did address the House last night on our dollar position.  Certainly, it is rather funny for me to be accusing the Minister for Finance of optimism in relation to dollars, but it has to be added, I think, that while dollars may eventually become available so as to finance our dollar requirements our undertaking with the British is that until the amount of our European Recovery Programme requirements has been definitely ascertained and assured, we shall keep our draw on the dollar pool at the level of the first half of <Col N="2399" /> 1948.  In other words, we cannot anticipate what we are going to get under the Marshall Plan, even by way of loan only until we have actually got it in the bag.  In the meantime, we have to keep a very tight hold on the expenditure of dollars from the dollar pool.  Secondly, dollars will become less.  Whatever we do get under the Marshall Plan and European Recovery Programme, dollars will become less in the second and later years, the plan necessitating a readjustment of our dollar purchases to meet that situation when it arises.  I think the Minister for Finance pointed out last night that a reduction in European dollar imports is fundamental to the whole plan, and the reduction must be effected with the view to assuring convertibility during the four-year period 1948-1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither a Minister for Finance nor an ex-Minister for Finance, and I do not keep those figures in my head.  If the Deputy wishes, I can get the figures for him.  I have not got them now.  Deputy Aiken made a speech yesterday in the course of which he made three observations with which I feel it my duty to deal.  In the course of his speech he said that &ldquo;we have undertaken not to make any net draw on the sterling area pool.  Have the British undertaken in their case not to make any net draw?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance did not deal, or did not deal fully with this rhetorical question last night.  I think attention should be directed to the fact that it is the policy of the British as announced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to conserve the pool dollar reserves at £500,000,000 and to achieve that purpose they have imposed, as I think the Minister for Finance did point out last night, on their own people an austerity programme severely limiting their purchases of foodstuffs, tobacco, petrol and other commodities which they require, even limiting their essential purchases of raw materials.  It is their stated policy that they will find their <Col N="2400" /> hard currency requirements from three sources: (1) their own dollar earnings, (2) their share of whatever they will get under the European Recovery Programme, and (3) such other credits as they may be able to acquire.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer also stated that if the terms of trade keep moving against them so that their increased exports do not suffice to pay for their imports, he may have to restrict still further their purchases of food, and even of raw materials.</P>
    <P>That is so much for the first point made by Deputy Aiken.  He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I saw that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his speech made last September pointed out that of the dollars spent at that time out of the Washington agreement, £1,500,000,000 worth of dollars was spent on capital development that had been completed in England.  The British expenditure had reduced the dollar assets of the sterling area by something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000,000 worth of dollars, and during the years that that was done we had been adding to our sterling assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is quite incorrect.  If the British spent that sum of £1,500,000,000 worth of dollars that was part of the Anglo-American loan and that Anglo-American loan was an entirely British concern with repayment obligations resting on them alone.  It had nothing to do with us.  That enormous sum did not come out of the dollar assets of the sterling area.  But what the British did, and did generously, was to put some of the dollars which they had acquired primarily for themselves into the pool.  It is at that generous act on the part of the British the Deputy is now sneering.  Deputy Aiken also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole sterling area arrangement, started before the war, was based on the assumption that Britain would take reasonable care of the assets upon which she was basing her credits.  During the war a number of people gave her credits on that assumption.  Since the war, they have been not only dispersing a number of dollar and hard currency <Col N="2401" /> credits but they have also got rid of or gone through a couple of thousand million pounds worth of dollars.  I think if we are to bind ourselves not to make any net draw on the sterling area pool there should have been an equal binding on the British not to make any net draw.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That suggestion appears to imply that the British did not take reasonable care of the sterling assets or assets of the pool.  The only critical comment of this nature that I have seen came from the United States.  It was that Britain had permitted some Anglo-American Loan Dollars to get into the hands of some of Britain's creditors&mdash; in other words, that she had used some American dollars not for her own rehabilitation but to pay off her debts. The Deputy also said that this speech was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in September last.  Before sterling ceased to be convertible, Deputy Aiken was Minister for Finance.  He is now posing before the Dáil and the people as a financial expert. Why, before sterling ceased to be convertible, did Deputy Aiken as Minister for Finance not convert some of these much-despised sterling assets of ours if he thought then as he thinks now or get dollars somewhere when it was possible to get them?  Why did he leave that problem to be dealt with by somebody else and neglect to get dollars when sterling was convertiable?</P>

      <P>That speech, as he said himself, was made in September.  Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, was in London last October.  He was brought over there to discuss sterling and dollars. The primary purpose of that dual flight which took place last October or November was to discuss our dollar position with the British.</P>

      <P>It was a purpose, and I am content with that.  Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, went over to discuss&mdash;as part of the discussion that took place at that time&mdash;our dollar position and our dollar requirements. Did Deputy Aiken, or Deputy Lemass with his glibness and his financial knowledge, challenge the British Chancellor of the Exchequer with overspending out of the pool?  If the Chancellor was overspending, why did Deputy Aiken agree&mdash;in the words of the document which was issued when the agreement was reached last year in October or November&mdash;to &ldquo;effect substantial reductions&rdquo; in dollar expenditure and to &ldquo;conserve the dollar resources of the sterling area&rdquo;?  Did Deputy Aiken, then Minister for Finance, ask of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, representing the British Treasury, the question which he asked here yesterday?  Did he get an undertaking that the British would not make any net draw on the pool and was there then, as Deputy Aiken said yesterday, any effort to secure from Britain an equally binding agreement not to make a net draw?</P>

At all events, the answers to the statements by the Deputy are on the record.  I have occupied far more <Col N="2403" /> time in replying than I had intended. I have not been able to deal with all the points which have arisen during the course of this discussion.  I recommend this agreement to the House and to the people.  In doing so, I do not recommend it as an agreement which represents, as Deputy Allen slightingly said, &ldquo;the highlight of the achievements of this Government during their four years.&rdquo;  That is a paraphrase of what he said.  I recommend it as an achievement which will bring some lasting benefit to our farmers, to our industrialists and to our people as a whole.  I recommend it as something achieved by us in difficult circumstances and in a few weeks after we had become the Government of this country for the first time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 38, but in Chapter I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>38.  (1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts, where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the widow of a man remarries, and</P>
      <P>(b)  a child of such man is during any period&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  detained in a reformatory or industrial school, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  in pursuance of an order of a court, in the custody of some person other than such widow, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  deserted or abandoned by such widow, or</P>
      <P>(iv)  resident in an institution or boarded out by a public assistance authority,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>payment may be made in accordance with the Acts during that period of an orphan's (contributory) pension in respect of such child, but such pension shall be at the same rate as the rate of the child's (contributory) allowance that would be payable if <Col N="2404" /> such widow had not remarried and such child were living with her.</P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts, where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the widow of a man remarries, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a child of such man is at the time of the marriage&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  detained in a reformatory or industrial school, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in pursuance of an order of the court, in the custody of some person other than such widow, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  deserted or abandoned by such widow, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  resident in an institution or boarded out by a public assistance authority, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such widow subsequently resumes custody of the child,</P>
    <P>payment of any child's (contributory) allowance that may be appropriate may be made in accordance with the Acts in respect of the child as from the time when custody of the child is resumed.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1947.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain the purpose of this amendment.  A case came to notice, and it may be one of many, in which, because of the structure of the main Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, what appeared to us to be a case of hardship occurred.  The case was one of a widow who had three children attending an institution where they were accommodated and educated. In accordance with the provisions of the Act an orphan's allowance was payable to the institution in respect of the detention and education of the children there.  The widow subsequently remarried and, on remarriage, the Act provides that the orphans' allowances will cease to be payable to the institution in respect of the children.  Because the children's allowances were not payable to the widow at the date of her remarriage&mdash;the children being in an institution and the orphans' allowances being paid to the institution, the widow was deprived of the orphans' allowances <Col N="2405" /> and could not qualify for the children's allowances.  It was felt that that was a hardship which the widow might have circumvented if she had known the provisions of the Act because she could have arranged to have had the children discharged from the institution a week before her remarriage and would thus have got behind the provisions of the Act.  It is felt that in a case of that kind we ought either to allow the children to remain in the institution, the State paying the allowances to the institution, or allow the widow to draw children's allowances under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act in respect of the children if she resumes the custody of the children. This amendment is designed to meet a situation of that kind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 38, but in Chapter II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>38.  In paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of Section 13 of the Principal Act the words &ldquo;or the five contribution years&rdquo; shall be inserted after the words &ldquo;the three contribution years&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or five years (as the case may be)&rdquo; shall be inserted at the end of the paragraph after the words &ldquo;three years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which has its roots in an amendment which was moved on the Committee Stage yesterday by Deputy Mrs. Crowley.  The Deputy sought to have the basis of contributions related to the payments during the five years preceding the attainment of 70 years of age or the five years preceding death.  It was not clear to me that there was any advantage to the applicant by substituting five years for three years as the average would operate over the five years; and, conceivably, whilst in some instances it might be beneficial, in other instances, it might be injurious to the applicant.  What I have done in this amendment, however, is to give an applicant for a pension the benefit of having the contributions calculated either on the basis of those paid during <Col N="2406" /> the last three years or, if it is more advantageous, on the basis of the contributions paid during the last five years.</P>

      <P>It is on the amend ment in relation to the five years' extension. I raised the matter with the Minister yesterday to cover a particular case, or cases, I had in mind.  I was thinking of people who retire from various employments with <i>ex gratic</i> grants or pensions.  Could the Minister see his way to provide that people of that type, when they come to die, would have provision made for their widows entitling them to at least a contributory pension?  I know that as the Act stands at present they are entitled to contribute during the time they are in receipt of a pension, but in a number of cases they do not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to deal very briefly with the point raised by Deputy Burke, even though it is somewhat extraneous?  Deputy Burke is anxious to deal with the situation where a person is employed by a local authority, or by some other body, and then retires either because of reaching the age limit or because of some infirmity of mind or body, and goes out on pension of some kind or other and continues to be unemployed between <Col N="2407" /> that date and the date of his death. At present there is provision in the main Acts whereby a person who goes out of employment in such circumstances&mdash;that is because he is unable to continue in employment due to some physical disability or old age&mdash; may cover himself for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes and national health insurance purposes as a voluntary contributor.  When such persons cease to be insurable under the Acts they are notified by the National Health Insurance Society of their right to continue as voluntary contributors and thus retain cover in the event of death for their widows and dependent children.  I think it is unfortunately true, however, that many persons do not take notice of the advice given to them by the National Health Insurance Society in that respect. If they do not I am afraid there is just nothing that can be done about it in the matter of continuing their coverage for contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  My advice would be&mdash;particularly to persons of that age &mdash;that when they cease to be employed, due to some physical or other disability, they should still retain their right to voluntary insurance so as to maintain coverage for their wives and children under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and thus qualify for a contributory pension. That is the best way of overcoming the difficulty referred to by Deputy Burke, and if contributors take that advice they will get a very inexpensive coverage for a privilege which at ordinary commercial rates could not be bought except for a very substantial sum, probably running into hundreds of pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so?  I did not think there was any adjournment of that length.  Certainly the Adjournment that took place when we first came into office was considerably shorter.  I am not, however, going to find fault with the Government for proposing that delay because I think that the Government, considering the manner of its composition, will require that length of time to adjust the differences that must exist between the various elements of the Government if we are at all to believe their professions when they were before the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago when a question was asked with regard to the Government's programme, reference was made to the &ldquo;ten points&rdquo;.  I have these points <Col N="2409" /> here in front of me as they were published in the newspaper.  All I can see in the majority of them is just pious aspirations.  The Government say that they are going to seek to implement increased agricultural and industrial production.  I do not think there is anybody in this country who would not agree on that as an objective and as a purpose.  When I see something like that it reminds me of Poor Richard saying about being &ldquo;healthy, wealthy and wise&rdquo;.  We all undoubtedly agree that that is an aim, the achievement of which would merit an effort, but even Poor Richard suggested a method by which it was going to be done.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to demand from the Government that they should show us precisely how they intend to implement this particular objective of increased production.  It is by that that we are going to judge them, by the methods that they are going to adopt to bring about this increase in agricultural and industrial production.  We hope that the period of the Recess will give them time to settle down to that problem.  They are no longer in the position in which they could claim to have been for some time past, just getting to know their Departments.  They have behind them a body of welltrained civil servants, men who have been engaged in trying to get the facts of a situation on which decisions have to be made.  For a number of years past we were trying to look ahead to the position that would arise when the war terminated and to have, as far as possible, plans ready for meeting the situations that would arise.  All that material is ready for the Government. A number of White Papers, as Deputies know, have already been published. The Government have all the information on which decisions have to be taken.  We are entitled to expect that when the Dáil reassembles after the Recess we will have something more than mere objectives in front of us, that we will have a reasonably detailed plan as to what exactly the Government propose to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to production, both agricultural and industrial, there is the question of deciding what is the type of production we are going to have, what is the policy that will be <Col N="2410" /> pursued in the main.  Are we to proceed, for instance, in agriculture on the old beef policy and, if we do, how will it fit in with the ideal of trying to maintain as high a rural population as possible and how far will it fit in with what has been accepted generally as the best type for us to follow&mdash;the general idea of mixed farming?  What steps will be taken in view of the fact that high prices are almost certain to prevail for meat?  How are we going to see that that does not result in a relative depression of our dairying industry, and what steps do the Government intend to take so that what is the fundamental part, and what must remain the fundamental part, of our agricultural industry is properly preserved?</P>
    <P>Most of the problems with which the Government will have to deal, as was pointed out already by a speaker in the course of debates here, will be the question of a very nice balance and a sure judgment as to what particular line should be pursued.  During our whole period as a political Party, Fianna Fáil has held&mdash;and we hold by it as strongly to-day as at any time previously&mdash;that the main aim of our agriculture, its first aim, should be to supply the home market with the food for our own people and to try to supply that at such prices as will make it possible for the community to purchase it.  That can only be done by efficient production.  We want, then, to see whether the present Government agree with that view and what steps they propose to take so that that aim will be properly achieved.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, to have exports to purchase the necessary imports. What particular commodities are we to rely on for that purpose?  If we are to have exports of an agricultural type it is desirable to get for them the highest possible price, but in achieving that highest possible price we may very well have the situation indicated by the Taoiseach, when he was speaking this morning, that if you rely, for instance, on beef exports and if you get the highest price that is obtainable for those exports, you may create a situation here in which you will have very severe hardships imposed on a <Col N="2411" /> very large section of the community through inability to pay the ruling high prices.</P>
    <P>What steps do the Government propose to take in order to achieve, if possible, the two aims, to get the highest price that is desirable from the point of view of the export&mdash;getting for it the highest return we can get in goods&mdash; and at the same time to see that our own people, in times when very high prices can be got for that produce abroad, will not suffer?  On the other hand, we should like to know the steps that will be taken to deal with the dairying situation.  These are things about which we would expect, when the Government come back after the Recess, they will have something more to tell us than merely to indicate an aim.</P>
    <P>I repeat that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we believe we ought to use the resources of our land to the utmost extent to feed our own people.  That is a good policy under all circumstances and particularly a good policy to meet times of crisis.  I wonder whether the present Government will have a similar view. If they have, all we will want is an answer to some of the questions I have already put, and to learn to what extent the attitude which was so frequently expressed by the present Minister for Agriculture when he was in opposition is going to be maintained by the Government.  The Minister for Agriculture said last night that there was no position he coveted so much as that of being Minister for Agriculture. I think it is not an unfair inference to draw, that he wanted that position in order to put into practice some of the ideas he has expressed so frequently in public.  Is that really going to be Government policy?  I think the people are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial production, our view was that it was essential for the well-being of this country that we should develop our manufacturing industries to the utmost extent possible. We were quite satisfied that that could not be done without protection. We were a relatively <Col N="2412" /> undeveloped country, so far as manufacturing processes and production were concerned, and it was obvious to us that we could not stand up against the competition of well-organised, powerful industrialised nations such as the United States or Britain, or such as Germany might have been in the past; that it was absolutely necessary, if we were not to become simply a grazing ranch that we should develop our manufacturing industries.  We wanted to develop them from the point of view of giving employment here, from the point of view of safeguarding ourselves in times of emergency, so that the things that were vital for the well-being of our people would, so far as possible, be produced here and would not have to be imported, under conditions of war, from abroad.</P>
    <P>To what extent does the present Government adhere to that view?  Do they, in fact, hold by that view, and, if they do, what are the steps which they will propose to take and what is the amount of protection they will give? We on our side believe that the amount of protection should be sufficient to induce those who are prepared to enter into industry to go into it, to put their capital into it, and to devote their energies to the development of it, but the situation should be carefully watched so that the privileged position they get, by reason of that protection, will not be abused.  I take it that the present Government will, in the main, have the same view, but we are anxious to have more detail.</P>
    <P>One of our objections, for instance, to the agreement which has just been approved is that we wanted to get in as early as possible the equipment which would enable us to go ahead with that programme and that we are not getting it.  It is quite obvious to me, and, I am sure, to every other Deputy, that, if we are to maintain our population here, we will have to proceed rapidly with the development of our manufacturing industries.  A commission has been set up, I understand, to examine the facts in relation to emigration. There is, in my opinion, very little need to set up a commission to examine that matter.  The facts are fairly well known.  What is required is some method by which this drain of our <Col N="2413" /> people can be stopped.  The only solution we saw for it was first, to see that as many economic homesteads as possible were established upon the land, to divide up the land into reasonably-sized farms to the extent economically justifiable.  Accordingly we want to know what is to be the policy of the Government with regard to land division. We understand that there are 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres of land yet to to be divided, and, as a means of establishing and keeping a rural population, it is obvious that the programme of land division is one which ought to be pursued with all rapidity.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions been dissatisfied with the progress being made by our Government in that regard.  Difficulties were put up by the Department concerned, and particularly the fact that we had a congested area in the West which was crying out for readjustment and that that was a slow process.  It is a programme which ought to be carried out now and which ought to take priority over any other, but at the same time it is obvious that, if we want to preserve the rural population and to get into a sound position as quickly as we can, we ought to try to go ahead with our land division programme and establish as many homesteads upon the land as is economically possible.  There the question of the size of farms and so on will arise, but it is foolish to think, as I have pointed out previously from the other side of the House and at public meetings, that that, of itself, will stop emigration.  It cannot do it.  The moment you reach any stable situation on the land, a situation in which the land is divided as much as it ought to be, there is bound to be migration or emigration from the farms.</P>
    <P>If there are five people in a small farmer's home, only two on the average can remain on the land.  Three will have to go off the land and will have to seek employment in the towns or in the countryside, or emigrate.  How far can we provide employment for them in the countryside?  The difficulty confronting the farming community at present, and particularly in regard to the dairying industry is the difficulty of getting labour.  Those engaged in the industry <Col N="2414" /> say that they are not able to pay labour the amount required to keep them in that industry, instead of going on to others or leaving the country and it is obvious that, if we are to preserve the dairying industry, provision must be made to deal with that problem.  Will the Government, when they come back, have for us some programme, some line of action which they propose to take, to achieve some of these results and help to stop emigration?</P>
    <P>The next matter is the matter of housing, and, so far as I can see, there is no difference of opinion as between those on this side of the House and the other with regard to that particular aim.  One of the things the previous Government did some time ago was to set up an organisation to deal with constructional work and to see that the building of houses for the people got priority as a prime necessity.  Those who are now in the Government accused us of not making rapid progress and we shall be entitled to ask, when they come back, what precisely is the progress they have been able to make which would not have been made had the line of policy which we adopted been pursued.  The priorities given were such as to guarantee the building of houses as a first requirement&mdash;anything else was relatively trifling.  There was a consideration, an important consideration, namely, the building of factories which would give employment and produce.  It is a nice balance as between building houses for the people and the necessity of providing work for them.  The two things ought to go together.</P>
    <P>If my recollection is correct, there was a fair priority, a necessary priority, given to the building of houses and next was the priority in respect of building which would give employment and produce the goods required by the community.  We will naturally expect to get from the Government, after the Recess, an indication of what they propose to do, or are doing, about this matter of the building of houses.  I think they are likely to say that we still have not got all the necessary skilled labour, equipment and materials, the grounds on which they have excused themselves <Col N="2415" /> for lack of progress so far.  The same conditions obtained in the previous Government.  If they have got into office on the ground that they have cures for these diseases, we are entitled to know what the cures are and exactly the extent to which they are being applied.</P>
    <P>The next point is the &ldquo;reduction in the cost of living.&rdquo;  Everyone would like to see that, but it is not an easy thing to do.  You have demands on one hand from labour for higher wages and demands on the other hand for higher prices for produce, both that produced at home and that coming in from outside.  We had that difficulty and recognised it as a difficulty.  We are entitled to ask the Government, when they come back, having had 15 weeks to adjust their problems and fix their differences, what precisely are the steps they propose to take regarding these particular matters. We will be entitled to criticise them and to question whether the steps they propose are likely to achieve the results they say they have in view.</P>
    <P>Again, they talk of &ldquo;Taxation of all unreasonable profit making.&rdquo;  That was also the aim with us, but it is one thing to have that desire and another to get effective means to secure it.  We will not be content, on this side of the House, with pious aspirations.  We will expect from the Government a definite programme to secure the results.  We can admit that they have these aims in view.  Every member of the community would agree with them, except some few individuals who might want to make excessive profits.  Therefore, they will get from us and from the community as a whole, support in any measure that will effect those results. That is true for practically every item in the list.</P>
    <P>We now come to the &ldquo;Introduction of a comprehensive Social Security plan to provide insurance.&rdquo;  We have yet to see the complete plan.  Everyone knows that a Department was set up and a Minister put in charge, purposely to investigate that problem in a way in which only a Minister could investigate it.  A great deal of the preliminary work was done by us before the present Government <Col N="2416" /> came into office.  The road was clear and all that is necessary now are the decisions.  These decisions will not be easy to make.  I do not pretend that the Government has an easy task. My complaint with the former Opposition was that they were talking about all these things as if they could be done by the wave of a wand.  We know they cannot, we know that every solution proposed has certain shortcomings and that it will be a question of trying to decide, as wisely as we can, the best course to take to get the maximum benefit for the country as a whole.  However, we are entitled to get decisions from the Government in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>There is here &ldquo;The removal of recent taxes on liquor, etc.&rdquo;  That is a thing that has been done.  We admit that, as a point in the programme, it has been done.  We do not agree with a number of things which the Government have done in that or in other matters, but at any rate we have no doubt as to the Government's attitude on it.</P>
    <P>We have as the next one of the ten points &ldquo;Immediate steps for the treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis.&rdquo; We, the previous Government, wanted that also.  The steps we were going to take do not differ materially, so far as I can judge since I came home, from those that have been taken.  If I am wrong, I would be glad to know it. Steps were being taken by the Minister responsible in our Government to try to deal with that matter.  There were difficulties in providing sanatoria owing to the shortage of building and other materials.  In the question of using other existing institutions, you had to balance between changing about for example persons who were mentally deficient.  Was it right that this should be done?</P>
    <P>We have next &ldquo;the establishment of a council of education.&rdquo;  That has been done, I believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know the constitution of it.  I would like to see it defended, as being a better system than the one which actually operated.  The Minister for Education <Col N="2417" /> always had a number of bodies with which he could consult, and did consult. The only thing that had to be done was to bring representatives of these particular bodies together, perhaps adding some outside people, to discuss educational matters in general. These matters have been discussed by every Minister for Education with all the bodies concerned.  He had advisory bodies and representative bodies of teachers and headmasters with whom he could confer regarding the details of his programme and the general policy he was pursuing.  He could if he wanted to have brought all the bodies together for discussion at the same time if it would have helped.</P>
      <P>Next we have &ldquo;immediate steps to launch a national drainage plan.&rdquo;  The national drainage plan had been agreed upon by the former Government, and an Act had been passed. The preliminary work of investigating various rivers and catchment areas was taking place and priority had been determined by the fact that we would like, from the engineering point of view, to begin with drainage of a particular type that would not present very great engineering difficulties. The necessary investigations had been made regarding the flow of water, and so on, in the particular area where it had been decided work was to commence. There was a difficulty about certain machinery and there were difficulties about engineering staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking now with reference to what we would expect from the Government when they come back.  We have heard a good deal of what they are doing in the Estimates, and so on. I am anxious to get from the Government, when they come back, a programme which will indicate the steps they propose to take in such a way that it can be constructively criticised. I think that there is a reason on this particular occasion that that should be done even if it is departing from a precedent. We should be presented with a programme when the Dáil reassembles, because nobody honestly can know at the present time what steps are likely to be taken by this Government or what compromises they are likely to make, one section <Col N="2418" /> with another in order to arrive at agreement.</P>
    <P>As the final, the tenth point, we have the &ldquo;modification of the means test, etc.&rdquo;  From the Bill that has just gone through we have some idea of what the Government has in mind in that regard, but it is only part of a wider plan which we ourselves had in mind for social services and social security and which it was intended to examine and as soon as possible to implement. The main consideration on that question all the time was that while we would like to have very substantial social services and a high degree of social security, we are limited by the fact that our community must produce very much more than it is producing at the present time to justify or maintain such a standard.</P>
    <P>There again comes the question of how we are going to get this increased production.  We could get increased agricultural production for our towns if we were to turn the whole countryside into ranches by mechanisation and very large farms, but that I take it is not the national objective.  In order to get the highest possible degree of production from our people we must strive to have the most efficient methods we can find to produce food, to eliminate waste and to see that the time which is spent at labour is spent in the most effective way.  We are up against this problem that naturally, as human beings, we all like to have a reasonably easy time; none of us want to work to the point of exhaustion; we want as many holidays as possible and as short hours of labour as possible, but everybody realises that if you carry that through too quickly before other things are made right you come to the point where you lower production.  There is a point at which you do not lower production. If you labour too many hours a day, in the long run you do not get as much done as you would with reasonable hours of labour, but the question of what are reasonable hours has got to be fixed.  We must combine the desire to give to every individual in the community as reasonable amount of leisure as possible with the desire to enjoy social services which we must earn by production.  There is no <Col N="2419" /> other way.  There is no other pool from which we can draw and you cannot have it both ways.  If you cease production or produce little you cannot enjoy social services.  There is no limitation to the desire of any Government in this country, I take it, to provide social services, but there is a limitation to the amount that is available from production.</P>
    <P>We want, therefore, to get from the Government their compromises in these situations.  We, in opposition, believe that we have just as important a part to play in these questions by means of proper criticism as the Government. We are deprived of the ability to decide as we think right, but we have an obligation to criticise and to criticise constructively.  For instance, there was, apparently, a complaint regarding our criticism of the agreement. As I conceive it, the members on the Government side made the best case they could for it.  That is natural. They have to defend.  Our duty, on the other hand, is to examine where the agreement leads, what harm it might do and to present the people as a whole with the other side of the case.</P>
    <P>There should be no dissatisfaction or resentment on the part of the Government if we perform that function properly. In international matters it is important that that should be done. In every case of an international agreement it is important that the objections should be carefully put before our people.  We in the Opposition will always endeavour to the utmost of our ability to see that the other side of the picture is clearly seen before a decision is arrived at in this House.</P>
    <P>There are before the nation a number of very important problems which await solution.  I have mentioned some of them.  From the broad national viewpoint there are two problems outstanding before we can claim to have achieved the things for which our people suffered in the last generation, to say nothing about what was suffered in the generations past.  Before we consider these problems, however, we ought at least know where we stand at the present moment.  I think that is only right.  Deputy Cowan <Col N="2420" /> asked two questions here the other day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the same reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not found any fault with the Deputy for asking those questions.  Two questions were asked here and surely we should be able to decide what the answers to these two questions are.  I think that the answer to them is so obvious that there should be no hesitation about answering them.  It will mean a great deal for us in the country if we can agree about the present position.  If you are going to any objective whatever and want to plan your path you want to know the two ends of the road, where you are going and from what point you started.  The outstanding political problem at the present moment, as, I think, everybody will admit, is the reunification of our country, to bring about the ending of Partition.  That brings us at once to our relationships with the States of the British Commonwealth. What are our relationships with the States of the British Commonwealth?  What is our present status in this part of the country?  I say without any hesitation whatsoever that we are here a Republic.  I deny that anybody here can give one substantial reason to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I answered the other question about three years ago.  That question is: Are we or are we not a member of the British Commonwealth.  Three years ago I said that that was a difficult question to answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the question giving the position as it was at the time.  I will develop the explanation and make it as clear as I can. Three years ago this was a difficult question to answer and I gave the reasons.  The point was this, what is the essential characteristic of that group of nations the British Commonwealth? <Col N="2421" /> How do they define themselves? The only definition that I knew of was the one which appeared in the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926.  Speaking of what it called Great Britain and the Dominions, that report said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Their position and mutual relations may be readily defined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And here was the definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had repudiated any such thing as allegiance and, if that were to be the test, I said, we were <i>not</i> a member of the States of the British Commonwealth. But, this peculiar thing had happened, that, although that repudiation was on record and that action of ours was on record, and although our new Constitution was enacted, nevertheless on the day on which that Constitution came into force, the British Government issued a statement to the effect that our position as a State of the British Commonwealth remained unaltered.</P>
      <P>My position was this: If the definition I have read stands and it is held that allegiance is the bond, we are not a member.  If it is not so held, if since 1926, in the 22 years, a further development has taken place and that now in fact the attitude of Britain and the Dominions was the Commonwealth relationship was one of those relationships that it was just as well not to define, I said, that if allegiance was gone it did not really matter, whether we were in or out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Do what?  I am not making any point but this.  I am looking to see that we do know where we stand now and that as to this question of &ldquo;development&rdquo; which was referred to by the Taoiseach, that we might realise what it is and how it has come about.  I said, three or four years ago, for the reason that they had issued that statement, that if there is no allegiance, and if there is no question of being within the British Empire, which was also involved, we could be regarded as being in the Commonwealth. If there is allegiance and there is inclusion in the British Empire, then we are outside.  I left it to them to decide which of these two it was going to be.  They have decided, as is clear from recent transactions, that it is better to regard us as associated but outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the British are concerned, we might look at their position and, if we are associated with the States of the British Commonwealth externally, as it is now accepted, it is no harm for a moment to consider it from their point of view.  There were in that association States of quite different origins and character and with quite different historical developments. There were some of the States in which the great majority of the people unquestioningly accepted allegiance, accepted inclusion in the British Empire, and the rest.  There was no difficulty with these.  We were not a State of that sort.  We had not grown up in the particular way that other States had grown up.  We could not, <Col N="2423" /> nationally, accept their position, even though, otherwise, association with them would not be objectionable.  But, we are not alone in our position. South Africa, in my view, has been and will be in a similar position. Britain has lost Burma and I believe that Burma could have been associated either in the way we are associated or even associated internally if allegiance were not the test and inclusion in the British Empire.  I may be wrong in that.  I believe India's position would be the same.  These nations, like ourselves, might not object to association simply, on the terms of free association without allegiance.  That free association might not have been objected to but it will be objected to, necessarily will be objected to, by these countries as long as by demanding allegiance it is made to conflict with their national ideals.  That was our position.</P>
    <P>Our position then, was this, that while we were not objecting to free association with the States of the British Commonwealth, we were objecting to inclusion in the British Empire and to the obligations of allegiance. If these were not in question, it did not matter whether we were regarded as in or out.  If I had been asked the question that was put to the other side of the House the other day as to when this happened and when we left the Commonwealth, I would have answered, not that it was a matter of gradual growth but that it happened the day that we formally repudiated allegiance, that is, if allegiance was held as essential.</P>

      <P>I would say, roughly, when the Constitution was enacted. That was really about the time in which it was most definitely clear what our position was.

It had gone before the people and, as far as the Irish nation was concerned, its decision in the matter had been made abundantly clear.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can ask parrot questions as long as he likes.  I am arguing to sensible men, I hope.  I say then, if we are looking ahead either to the solution of Partition or to any question of our external relations, the point from which we start at this moment is&mdash;that we are an independent republic&mdash;or as stated in the Constitution, a sovereign independent democratic State, which, in this instance, is a republic, and that we are associated with the States of the British Commonwealth in the peculiar form in which we are associated, that is as an external associate.</P>
      <P>Now comes the question of the use of the King of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the rest, for the signing of credentials of our envoys.

    <P>We met the situation this way.  We brought in an Act which enabled us to use the same organ as the States of the British Commonwealth were using for the accrediting of their representatives. What is the position in that regard to-day?  When we left office, the position was that we had an Act which enabled us to do that.  It is very important for anybody who wants to understand our whole position, to realise that our Constitution has in it no constitutional fictions.  There are fictions in certain constitutions where the president or the king, as the case may be, is regarded as the fount of authority or is regarded as having vested in him all executive authority, and he exercises this authority through ministers. That is not the position with us.  Ours is the complete reverse of that.  With <Col N="2425" /> us, executive authority resides in the Government, with those who are elected or appointed here as a result of the Dáil's selection and approval.  It is in the Government so appointed that executive authority lies.  It is by their authority, acting directly or by their appointed agents, that executive acts are done.  Whoever acts, acts on their authority.  Any body or any organ that acts, is an instrument of theirs.</P>
    <P>Whoever acts with executive authority&mdash;it may be the President, exercising that power if he be given that function in addition to the functions which are given him under the Constitution&mdash;must act deriving his right from the authority of the Government. The External Relations Act is purely permissive.  It allows the Government to use the King, who is the King for Canada, Australia and so on, to sign letters of credence.  But his authority comes from the Government. He does no more than to sign of course. The letters of credence are always drawn up by the Government or the Minister for External Affairs.  He signs them.  Anything that is derived from that signature is derived from the authority of the Government here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act is not obligatory. I said it was permissive.  What I am coming at is that at the present moment the Government in my opinion can authorise anybody to act in their name.  They can authorise the Ceann Comhairle, for example, to sign the credentials.  I am not a lawyer and I am quite ready, if that opinion is disputed to consider the argument but it is not an opinion hastily arrived at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will be patient, he can ask questions at a later stage.  I say that the Government can delegate or can arrange with the Ceann Comhairle to sign these credentials if the other States are prepared to accept that.  There should be no reason why they should not but sometimes you do not get other States readily to accept changes.  The point is that it is not obligatory to get a king's signature and <Col N="2426" /> that the Government can appoint anybody.</P>
      <P>Curiously enough, the only person for whose appointment in this way legislation would seem to be necessary, is the President and the reason for that is that the Constitution lays down the powers and functions given to the President and says that he can be given further powers and functions by law.  In exercising such functions, he must exercise them on the advice of the Government.  It would appear to me that it would be an evasion of the Constitution if the President were appointed by the Government for this purpose without legislation.  But I think you could appoint the Ceann Comhairle, the Chief Justice or practically anybody else.  The Minister for External Affairs or the Taoiseach could act, having been appointed by the Government for the purpose, if the other Government is prepared to accept that.  If, however, you want to appoint the President it would be necessary, in my opinion, to bring in a Bill for the purpose.</P>
      <P>I have referred to this situation at length on account of the harm and confusion that has been already created and which need not have been, in my opinion.  It seems to me, on account of the confusion and the play which has been made for political purposes with it here, that it might have been well to bring in a Bill, put it to the Dáil, and say: &ldquo;All right, we will transfer this function to the President&rdquo;. You would not want, in my opinion, a Bill for anybody else, but if the President is to have this additional function given to him, in my opinion it would be more in accord with the Constitution that a Bill should be brought in here authorising the President to sign these letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present Administration want to do that they will not find any opposition over here.  I should have liked to have had in the past, in reference to a number of things I had to do, an Opposition that would deal with me in that spirit.  I think the good that might be done by the Act has been counterbalanced by the mischief of the propaganda that has been carried on in regard to it.  Can we now stand here <Col N="2427" /> on this, that we are a republic, and if anybody says that we are not, then I am quite prepared to do anything myself&mdash;and I am sure that I speak for every member of the Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My view is one I believe that will stand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have acted. There are very few things which I said I would do that I did not try to do. Let those who deny that the position is as I have stated act and I will support them and I believe everybody else in this House will support them.  I should also like to be sure that there was agreement as to the other end of the road.  Suppose there is.  Then we have this problem of Partition.  It is going to be a very difficult problem with these two ends defined.  But, if those two ends of the road represent the views of the majority of the representatives of the Irish people and if they represent the views of the majority of the Irish people, then I think that majority rule should hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the people in the Six Counties and the concessions we should make here and the concessions we should make there.  Those who are talking of concessions to them and so on have no higher regard for them individually than I have, or, if you are to use the word love, in reference to this community, one to the other, none has it in a higher degree than I have.  I want to say that they <Col N="2430" /> will get the equality to which they are entitled.  They ought not, however, to be looking for privilege.  We should say: &ldquo;We want you to come in; any right of Irish citizenship to which you are entitled you will get to the full.&rdquo;  But democracy in any country is impossible unless you have majority rule and we will have to have that if we are going to be a democracy here.</P>
    <P>It is said that there must be no coercion of &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo;.  There is, over a great part of Ulster, coercion of the people who want to be with us. We are entitled to say that that coercion must cease and our aim ought to be to expose that situation as the first step.  There is coercion of our people there and that coercion ought to end.  Let us pass from that problem. What I am aiming at is to try to know where is the beginning and where is the end of the road, and at least to indicate the first steps forward.</P>
    <P>Let us now come to another problem, the question of the restoration of the national language.  Can we find out where we stand there?  How many in this House really desire that the language should be restored?  How many believe that it is one of the national objectives, just the same as the establishment of our independence was?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we hypocrites?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want to know where we stand on that.  I take it that we are not hypocrites.  Unless there are people who definitely say that they are opposed to it, I take it that the restoration of the language is also a national objective.  A good deal of the foundations have been laid and we should try to secure the ultimate goal. Unfortunately, these two problems are not ones that can be easily solved by any Government.  The restoration of the language depends more upon the attitude of the people outside than upon the attitude of public representatives here.  Public representatives can do a tremendous lot in giving a lead, in helping the people, in explaining to them the importance of this matter as a national objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, again, it is not one of <Col N="2431" /> those things which a Government can do by a wave of the wand.  There are people who talk about this as if the Government by using compulsion of one kind or another, could succeed in that. There are vital steps that have to be taken in trying to create the possibility to succeed. Some foolish people think that you can bring about the speaking of the language once more by some act of the Government.  I say that compulsion is just completely stupid.  It cannot be done in that way.  There is one way of restoring the language, and that is to get the people to have the will to see that it lives where it exists and where it can be revived.  In that matter we have to depend largely upon our schools.  Anybody who examines the problem will have to admit that the schools are the principal means by which the language can be restored if it is going to be restored at all.</P>
    <P>What policy then is to be used in the schools in order to make effective the purpose that is behind it?  You hear a lot about talking Irish to children. Any person who has paid any attention to the way in which languages are learned knows that the important years for learning a language as the vernacular, so that it will be used naturally and not as a foreign-acquired language, are the years between three and eight. If we are serious about learning the language so that it will be spoken as a natural language we must in our programme try and see to it that the children at those ages are given the opportunity of speaking the language. That was the basis of the original programme as it was put forward and that is a sound basis.</P>
    <P>But, again, you have to depend on the teachers.  If they do not know the language themselves they cannot teach it properly.  If a person has not a fair knowledge of the language himself he certainly cannot teach it as a vernacular. Therefore, we are dependent on the ability of our teachers to teach it.  We must, as part of our general programme for the achievement of that end, see to it that we have competent teachers, and that they get the training <Col N="2432" /> which will enable them to be competent in the teaching of Irish.</P>
    <P>These are some of the principal points to which I wished to draw attention.  They deal with the principal national problems which we in this House have got to face.  We have a very serious responsibility on us in this generation with regard to these two problems, and very much so particularly with regard to the problem of Irish because if we do not in this generation take the steps that will enable the language to be revived, then it cannot be done in a subsequent generation. Therefore, there is on every one of us here a very solemn responsibility, if we believe that it is in the national interest that the language should be revived, to try and play our part to the utmost to get it revived.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with these two outstanding problems.  The next is the problem of emigration.  It played a very big part in the election speeches. A commission is being set up to examine it.  In my opinion, the main factors are already well known.  The fact is that when a number of people go off the land, as they will from our small farms, they have to try to get employment in any way they can in their own neighbourhood or in the towns or else they have to emigrate. We have got to find employment for those people.  There is the problem of finding new employment for about 20,000 individuals each year.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the House to take that figure as being absolutely accurate, but let us say that that would be about the figure.  We had, by building up industries, arrived at the stage in which in our industries we were finding employment in the factories and in the towns for about half that number&mdash; about 10,000 a year.  We had got only half way, so that the remaining 10,000 represents a serious drain.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking of the war situation which was purely abnormal and had to be dealt with as a special phenomenon.  As far as a long-term problem is concerned, we have got to find, by building up further industries, employment for something like an additional 10,000 in the year, assuming that my first figure is right.  How are <Col N="2433" /> we going to do it?  I hope that the only method which we could see of doing it will be continued&mdash;that is by continuing to build industries which will give employment to the greater number of these young people who are looking for employment for the first time.  Can we do it?  The first thing, obviously, is to look over the list of imports, to pick out the ones that are likely to give the most employment and that are the most suitable.  Obviously, those which are most suitable are those for which we have the raw materials ourselves.  Any industry that is founded upon the products that come from our own soil is obviously the industry that will have the firmest foundation if it can be established.  We ought, therefore, try as far as possible to develop all the industries that are ancillary to the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not going to put me off with a question like that.  That is all very well for elections, but let us in this Assembly try and do some constructive work and see how far we can agree on it.  As I was saying, the position is, how far can we develop our industries so as to give that necessary new employment which is required to end emigration?  If you can do that, then you do not want any other type of examination of the problem. No examination will give you a solution, in my opinion, unless you can do that.  It is the only solution that is available to us.  We all believe that this nation would be a stronger nation if we could retain the natural increase of our people.  The population which we could maintain here could be considerably bigger than it is at present. I think we are all agreed on that. In my opinion, the only way in which we can maintain the natural increase is by building up our manufacturing industries. That, necessarily, implies a certain degree of protection.  That is a warning for all those who are dealing with external affairs&mdash;not to commit themselves, in the case of this small nation, into entering into some arrangement for universal free trade. We are not at present in a position in which we can completely accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2434" /> It is all right for the U.S.A. to want this but when the United States was building itself up it did not stand for free trade.  It built itself up quite differently.  Great Britain was for free trade when Great Britain was at the top.  Every nation that is a great industrial-producing nation and at the top will want free trade.  Free trade takes with it&mdash;if it is to be what its advocates hold&mdash;free movement of capital and free movement of persons. It means that nationality, so to speak, is wiped out.  There can be no national boundaries of any importance; we must forget national divisions before we can stand firmly for that policy.  We in this country who are only just beginning to develop our industries cannot commit ourselves at all to this completely free trade policy.  As an ideal and something to be worked for&mdash;in so far as nations can retain their individuality as nations and work it&mdash;well and good. I think every proposal in that regard should be examined carefully.  The test is whether it is going to prevent us from that development of our resources and industries which is absolutely essential if we are to maintain our population in this country and survive as a nation.  Let that be the test.  From an ideal point of view I think that the less restrictions there are the better.</P>
    <P>I agree with regard to external affairs also that it is desirable, if we can, to be associated&mdash;I have no hesitation myself in saying this&mdash;with the States in the British Commonwealth in this way provided that there is no ambiguity in the minds of the people who are dealing with it.  I think that a wider association is also desirable.  I always believed in the Briand idea of a United States of Europe.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for External Affairs I remember that I examined the questionnaires that were sent out to the various Governments in regard to it at the time.  I have some idea of the complexity and the extreme difficulty of the problems involved.  Every nation will have precisely in its own regard some such difficulty and some such caveat as I have mentioned just now.  It is extremely difficult but what is the alternative?  The alternative is such that despite all the damage and <Col N="2435" /> disaster that its adoption would cause to a variety of nations, it would be ultimately less than the damage that would be caused if we were to have another war.  The nations of Europe have to balance very carefully these two dangers&mdash;the danger of destruction of their own particular individual life as a nation and the danger on the other side of a war if they do not compromise their nationality.  I agree with the Minister for External Affairs on the question of sovereignty. Only the powerful States can, in any sense, regard themselves as completely sovereign and, you deprive yourself of the means of doing as you please the moment you sign any international agreement.  As in the case of every other agreement, so in the trade agreement just approved, for example, we have now deprived ourselves of certain liberties of action which we would otherwise have.  However, we do that with our eyes open.</P>
    <P>It was one of the considerations we had to decide here.  If it was bad for us we will rue it and if it was good for us we will have the advantages of it. In the same way, if we enter into international agreements of one kind or another, to that extent we deprive ourselves for the duration of the agreement of the freedom of action we would otherwise have.  I take it that as an intelligent people you do that for a purpose and you think that the end you have in view justifies the steps you have taken and the restrictions you have imposed upon yourself.</P>
    <P>We must then, if we are to deal with this question of emigration, pursue with all the energy in our power the building up of our industries.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will, I am sure, admit that a great deal of examination had been done by the former Government.  I was aware that a number of plans had come into the Department.  Questionnaires were sent out to various firms who were willing to expand and so forth, and their plans came in.  Therefore, the moment we can get the raw materials and the equipment we ought to be able to make rapid progress.  As the former Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2436" /> pointed out, if we avail of it and if we can get the materials we are in a fairly good position to start off.  We are in a very much better position than we were in before the experience of a number of years was gained.  I think everybody who is reasonable will admit that.  We ought to go ahead with all possible speed in the development of these industries.  It is the only cure that I can see for the problem of emigration.  If there should be other cures, I shall be delighted to know of them.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have kept the House so long that I think it would be quite unfair to talk about all the problems that have, naturally, occupied my mind for a long period of time.  I only put it to the Government that during these 15 weeks in which they will be free from the questioning here and the necessity to attend here they will devote themselves to adjusting the differences which must exist.  Looking at the opposite side, one cannot but be aware of these tremendous differences in outlook.  They have to adjust these. They ought to come to the Dáil with a programme dealing with these particular problems in which it is fair to ask them for a programme.</P>
    <P>I admit that in some cases it might not be fair to do so but you can take a number of steps.  It is not always possible to say: &ldquo;This will lead to that and that will inevitably lead to something else and finally we will come to the end of the journey,&rdquo; but I would urge you to make a start on something which you know must of necessity help you to reach the end.  I, for one, would be quite satisfied if the Government would give us indications of what they propose to do in that regard.  When I was sitting on the other side of the House I made several resolutions.  One was that if ever I got to this side of the House there were subjects on which I would speak and about which I could not speak while I was on the Government side of the House.  If I had spoken about them from the Government side of the House I would be accused of having an axe to grind. That cannot be said now.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera has discoursed at length on our relations with the British Commonwealth of Nations and has sought to define what our international status is as a nation. In the course of his discourse he built up various &ldquo;Aunt Sallies&rdquo; and beguiled himself subsequently in the recreational task of knocking them down.  I do not want to follow Deputy de Valera by entering into a discussion on our international status or on our relationship with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Whatever they are to-day I suppose they were the same six months ago; and I think a discussion at this stage on the matters raised by Deputy de Valera would be an unprofitable one from every standpoint. But there are certain things that emerged from what Deputy de Valera has said which call for some comment.  One is that, although we have had a Constitution now for 11 years, apparently our constitutional position is still cloudy and it is still necessary to explain to our own people and to the world what exactly our international status is.  If there is any cloudiness about it, any ambiguity <Col N="2438" /> about it, or anything wanting clarification about it the responsibility rests upon those who did not clearly define the status of the country in an international sense in the Constitution when it was first being enacted and who did not take steps to amend the Constitution by ordinary legislation, as could have been done within three years of the enactment of the Constitution by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>All right&mdash;let us take that.  If we want, as Deputy de Valera wants this evening, to make it known to the world that this portion of Ireland is an independent republic, was it not a simple matter to have put one word more into the Constitution&mdash; which, Heavens knows, is wordy enough?  Should it not have been possible to put the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; into the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not necessary? We shall come to that, too.  Here, 11 years after the Constitution was enacted by the people, 11 years during every one of which we have had the same dissertation by Deputy de Valera, when he was Taoiseach, as to our international status, we are still trying to explain to our own people what kind of country we are, what international status we have and what our relationship is with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The Constitution is so muddy and so cloudy as to the whole position that even to-day we are finding it difficult to get our own people properly to apprehend the position.  If Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, wanted to make it clear to the world that he desired this country to be known internationally as the &ldquo;The Irish Republic&rdquo; the way to do it was to put into the Constitution the simple declaration that this portion of Ireland &ldquo;is a sovereign, independent, democratic republic&rdquo;.  Why was the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; eliminated?</P>

To feed the people?  To raise the wages of the workers?  To improve their conditions of life?  To make life better and happier for them?  Not at all.  We were called here by telegram, by the Fianna Fáil Government, to pass the External Relations Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent two days then trying to persuade the Government of the day not to do any such thing but to leave things as they were.  I am sure that Deputy de Valera will recall the point of view I advanced then on that particular Act and even before the Act was introduced&mdash;namely that the British have no right to expect us automatically to appoint their king as the king of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to that in time.  In the past we knew of a constitutional position in which when the old British monarch died the next automatically took his place.  But here we had the position that a king had virtually gone on strike, that he had  and there was no responsibility on us to do anything about either the departed king or the new king.  All we had to do was to sit tight.  The king had gone and we need assign no <Col N="2440" /> duties to the new king.  What happened? That would not please Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil was lonely for a king then.  And the result is we got the king imported into our legislation by the External Relations Act.  I voted against the External Relations Act.  Every member of the Labour Party voted against the External Relations Act.  I think as little of that Act now as I did then.  I think of it now what I thought of it then&mdash;namely that it is a dishonest subterfuge by which we use the king&mdash;permissively, if you like&mdash;and build up a code of precedents by using the king to accredit our representatives to a foreign country.  We have got a President in the Phoenix Park.  We have a Minister for External Affairs.  They are by-passed and we use the British king to accredit our representatives to foreign countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy de Valera know of any country in the world which uses a foreign monarch to accredit its representatives to another country?  Does the United States of America do that?  Does the French Republic do that?  Does any republic in the world deliberately take up a king of any other country to accredit its representatives to a foreign power?  It does not.  This was one of the unique constitutional somersaults of Deputy de Valera in which he succeeded in the independent Irish Republic in finding a king to accredit our representatives to a foreign power.  I said then, and I say it again now, that this was a subterfuge.  I think the External Relations Act is a fraud on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to go and I think our national honesty would rank all the higher if it were to go.  Deputy de Valera raised the question also of Partition.  So far as Deputy de Valera is concerned, he is lecturing to the converted in this House so far as Partition is concerned.  Every single Party in this House stands for the abolition of Partition.  Every single Party wants to make its contribution to the solution of the Partition problem by ending Partition and reintegrating the Six Counties with their natural motherland.  So far as the Government is concerned, it stands unequivocally for taking any and every possible step that can be taken to bring Partition to an end and restore the historical unity of this country. Nobody can allege that this Government is in any way negligent on the question of advocating the ending of Partition.  The Ministers of this Government have already discussed that with the British Ministers.  It has been made clear to Britain, and Britain is in no doubts as to the viewpoint of this Government, that we regard the ending of Partition as a problem of first-class national importance. Every effort which this Government can make to find a solution to that problem and to bring Partition to an end will be eagerly availed of by this Government in its effort to end the partition of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera raised some other matters, mainly economic matters.  I take it from the way in which he approached the problem and from the interrogatory character of his speech that the Deputy does not want detailed answers to these questions to-day, but hopes that, by the time the Dáil reassembles in the autumn, he will be able to get a more comprehensive statement in respect of Government <Col N="2442" /> policy over the range of subjects covered by him in his speech to-day. Deputy de Valera said this Government promised it would endeavour to increase agricultural output and agricultural employment.  That is the policy of this Government and every step that can be taken towards that end will be taken.  One very substantial step has already been taken as evidenced by the negotiation of the recent agreement with Great Britain. Under that agreement, certain guaranteed prices are made available for live stock and live-stock products.  These prices are better than anything we have got in the past.  The provision of live stock and live-stock products for a better market in Britain ought to provide greater employment for our people.  I hope that it will do more.  I hope that it will provide a better standard of remuneration not merely for the farmers in the country but also for that most necessary adjunct of efficient farming, the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that in this connection alone substantial additional employment will be provided but, in any case, the Deputy may take it as the policy of the Government that Irish land will be utilised to the fullest extent for whatever purpose that land is suitable, to yield not merely wealth to the nation in the form of agricultural and dairy produce, but to yield at the same time employment for the maximum number of persons and especially for those in the rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera raised the question of the Government's policy in relation to the home market.  I think everybody realises, and especially those who have given any thought to the subject in this country, that the home market in the long run is the best market so far as the Irish producer is concerned. Number one, it is not subject to all the wintry economic blasts which blow across the foreign market.  In the home market we can regulate the quantity of goods which we consume, the price at which these goods can be sold, and the labour content of the article which is produced.  If we were to rely entirely on an external market, we <Col N="2443" /> would have to rely on a market over which we have no control so far as price fixation is concerned, a market in which we cannot regulate the quantity of goods which we can sell.  The home market, therefore, has obvious advantages over the external market and so far as this Government is concerned its object will be to supply as far as possible the home market with the goods produced by our own people, and not merely to provide the market for our own people, but to supply goods for our own people at prices within their capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>Exports are, of course, necessary.  It is only with exports we can pay for imports and so long as we have to import considerable quantities of goods not produced here, and some of which can never be produced here, the export market is inevitably a part of our national set-up.  That export market is being watched carefully and vigilantly, as is indicated by the recent trade agreement.  The Deputy can feel assured that, so far as the home market is concerned, we will encourage our producers to produce goods to satisfy that market in full.  On the other hand, in order to finance our imports we shall endeavour to step up home production in the field of agriculture and industry so that, with the export of surpluses from these fields of activities, we may be able to finance the purchase of other goods which we cannot produce here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked what is the Government's policy in respect of the development of industry.  We have reached the stage in this country when there is now no free trade political Party.  Every Party accepts an obligation to protect and foster Irish industries. The way in which that should be done, the degree to which it should be done, the safeguards which have to be provided for the consumer and for the worker, are matters for consideration, matters upon which there might be shades of disagreement, but the basic fact still remains that every Party in this country is anxious to develop Irish industries, to encourage their promotion, to produce here the goods which are now imported, to <Col N="2444" /> foster these industries by reasonable protection in the form of duties and quantitative restrictions, and to ensure that these goods are produced by the best type of machinery in the best type of factory, paying the best classes of wages and safeguarding the consumer all the time against the possibility of being exploited by irresponsible and unresponsive monopolies.</P>
    <P>In that field of national endeavour no decent industrialist need doubt the honesty and the genuineness of this Government in desiring to protect his industry, protect it not merely for his own enrichment, not merely that he may get rich quick, not so that he can amass enormous wealth, but these industries will be protected as part of a national consciousness that there is on us an obligation not merely to produce wealth for the nation, to be diffused in wider and growing measure, but to provide employment for our people as well.  If the industrialist is an honest and a good industrialist, who wants to serve the nation by producing wealth and securing a reasonable return on his invested capital, he need never doubt the genuineness and the willingness of this Government to protect him.  The Government will take every step to protect existing industries, and promote the establishment of new industries, and I hope when the time comes for it to render an account of its stewardship, the inter-Party Government will be able to point to numbers of new industries which have been established and are flourishing here because of the assistance which those who established the industries have received.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera raised a question about the Government's policy in respect of land division.  I think there should be no doubt as to what the Government's policy is in that respect. Nobody wants to see large ranchers employing a small man and a big dog, staying our agricultural economy. There is the general viewpoint amongst all Parties that our national objective ought to be to divide the large and badly used ranches among those anxious to obtain land, to settle as many people as we can economically <Col N="2445" /> on the land and in conditions that will give them a fair chance.  That is the policy of this Government and the very fact that its implementation is in the hands of Deputy Blowick, the Minister for Lands, who is acutely conscious of what over-crowding agriculturally means in the West, is the best assurance the nation can have that that policy will be pushed forward with earnestness and vigour.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked what progress was being made in housing.  I think he will realise that this Government came into office in February and it was then only a few weeks away from facing the Dáil with a new set of Estimates to finance this year's Governmental activities, Estimates prepared by our predecessors.  While the expenditure for us was prepared the wherewithal to finance the activities was nowhere obvious to us.  We had to set about revising the Estimates, avoiding wasteful expenditure and raising sufficient funds to finance the national activities during the ensuing 12 months.  Between that, the Budget and the passage of the Estimates, I think it will be generally conceded that this Government has had very little time to devote to a detailed examination of many matters which deserve early and earnest consideration.  That is particularly so when it is remembered that the House for many weeks sat for four days a week from early morning until late at night.</P>
    <P>The Government has not had all the time it would have wished to have for the purpose of examining matters in detail, but, on the subject of housing, may I say that it is the Government's earnest desire that every conceivable method of building houses should be employed, so as to get our people out of the city and town slums, and out of the rural slums as well, to give them decent homes at rents within their ability to pay, homes which will be a credit to the nation, and to give them not merely a home but all that a home means?  That task is under the control of the Minister for Local Government and that fact is, in itself, an assurance that no punctilio will be allowed to stand in the way of providing the people, with the utmost expedition, <Col N="2446" /> with the houses of which they are so sadly in need to-day.</P>
    <P>The question of the drainage plan and the Government's intentions in relation thereto were also raised by Deputy de Valera.  Already we have got under way one of the main schemes which was to be a part of the national drainage plan.  The Deputy will recollect that, when the Bill was going through the House, it was mentioned that it would take seven years to get the machinery ready for implementing the scheme and that 28 years would elapse before the scheme of national drainage was completed.  We are endeavouring to take short cuts to the objective of completing the national drainage plan, and, for that purpose, every possible step is being taken to speed up the implementation of drainage schemes in various parts of the country.  We are not without very substantial hope that the periods of seven years to get the machinery ready and 28 years to complete the job will be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude towards the cost of living has also been raised, and that matter, to some extent, has been discussed to-day in connection with the trade agreement.  This Government has definitely said that its aim is to bring down the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the world will say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is doing it.  It has brought down the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures do not show that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding certain wage increases which have taken place, especially over the past six months, we have been able to hold the cost of living approximately at the point at which it was this time last year.  That is the cost of living.  It is not our index and is not a cooked index figure.  It is the last Government's index figure.  We are living in circumstances in which the cost of living is often something different from the cost-of-living index figure and we have held the cost of living to the figure at which it was 12 months ago.  We have, <Col N="2447" /> however, done more.  The new index figure which Fianna Fáil created eliminated cigarettes from calculations in respect of an increase in the cost of living.  We have brought down the price of cigarettes and tobaccos.  We get no credit for that in the Fianna Fáil index figure.  We get no credit for such reduction as has taken place in the taxation on beer in the index figure.</P>
      <P>These are items which enter into the lives of many ordinary mortals in this country.  The very fact that these taxes have been brought down has meant for the people a reduction in the cost of living.  They are paying less for these commodities to-day than they were paying after the Fianna Fáil Supplementary Budget, and, to the extent that they are paying less, we have brought down the cost of living in these schemes.</P>
      <P>On the whole, we have held the index figure at a point not higher than it was 12 months ago.  That is not a bad beginning and I hope it is only a beginning.  I hope that, during the Adjournment of the Dáil, the Government will be able to concentrate its endeavours on enforcing, if necessary, reductions in the cost of living, because, as was said to-day by Deputy Larkin during the discussion on the trade agreement, the prices of certain commodities ought to be broken, and I hope the Government will give a lead in the breaking of these prices, so as to bring them down to a point within the competence of the people to pay. Deputy de Valera, having regard to the record of his own Government in respect of the cost of living and the associated problem of wages, is certainly not the best person to express any concern as to the Government's attitude towards the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply asked for the Government's plans to implement its ten-point programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with the Deputy is that the Government is implementing its ten-point programme with distressing speed, so far as he is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We promised to reduce certain taxes imposed in the Fianna Fáil Budget, and we did it the second day this Dáil met.  We promised to modify the means test, and we have done it.  We did not in the ten-point programme promise to increase old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, but we have done it.  So far as promoting increased employment in industry and agriculculture is concerned, we have done that, too, by the recent trade agreement with Britain which gets better prices for our agricultural produce, on the one hand, and enables us to penetrate the British market with industrial goods which we could not have done under the Fianna Fáil trade agreement of 1938, on the other.  All this is evidence that this is a live, an alert Government, a Government which not only makes promises, but intends to keep them.  Whether it is a melancholy achievement, so far as Deputy de Valera and Fianna Fáil are concerned, I hope that, before the Government comes to render an account of its stewardship to the people, not only will all the ten points have been realised, but the Government will have started on a new programme, exceeding even in its accomplishment and achievements the ten points on which the inter-Party Government agreed as the target when this Government was established.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said the Opposition were under an obligation to criticise legislation, and to show the country what the other point of view was.  Nobody will deny to Deputy de Valera or Fianna Fáil that obligation to criticise any and every measure brought into the House, and, so far as the Government is concerned, they will get all the facilities they desire, for the purpose of criticising legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a new feeling with regard to the status of this House here and in the country.  In the old days, when a Minister brought in a Bill, everybody in that Minister's Party was silent, except the Minister.  That is not the position now.  Here we have a number of groups constituting this inter-Party Government and not a single restriction <Col N="2449" /> is placed on any member in the matter of his participation in debate or the views he expresses, with the result that the Dáil, for the first time perhaps in 25 years, is to-day a consultative and deliberative Assembly, something it has not been for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil now there is a new right of expression, a new enthusiasm to express views, and, so far as the Government is concerned, every facility will be afforded to Fianna Fáil to express any views they care to express on any legislation which may be introduced. We are, however, I think, entitled to impose one condition, that the criticism ought not to be purely destructive, that it ought not to be of a sabotaging type and ought not to be the kind we got when we were negotiating the trade agreement with the British Government in London. When we ought to have had the charity of Fianna Fáil's silence we did not get it.  They were concerned with playing mischievous politics, instead of giving the negotiators a chance of negotiating the best bargain they could with the British Government.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of criticism that will do this nation any good, or send up the political stock of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Fianna Fáil is welcome to fulfil its full functions in this House in showing to the people whatever defects there may be in legislation introduced by this Government, but that ought not to rule out the possibility of its criticism being constructive and, when good legislation is forthcoming, it ought not to be capriciously criticised and condemned, and, when this Government is doing good things for the nation, it is not unreasonable to expect that it will get some cooperation from the Opposition.</P>

In the City of Dublin, and particularly in the part of Dublin&mdash;Dublin North-East&mdash;that I represent, thousands of houses are required.  There are thousands of <Col N="2450" /> families living in slum conditions, in over-crowded tenements.  Many families are separated&mdash;the husband living in one place and the wife compelled to live in another.  While that problem remains to be tackled, I oppose any long adjournment such as is proposed here this evening.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate, I advocated to the Taoiseach that this Government should introduce legislation to enable the Minister for Local Government to solve the housing problem within a reasonable time.  I am satisfied that that Minister has the best will in the world, but I am equally satisfied that, under present legislation, he has neither the power nor the authority to solve the housing problem, and I suggested to the Taoiseach that that power and authority should be given to the Minister for Local Government by statute of this House.  The introduction of that legislation is a matter of the greatest urgency and, therefore, I oppose an adjournment for 15 weeks.  There is no doubt about it, since we did start to work, since the general election, this House has worked pretty hard, and I have consideration for the members of the staff of the House and for the Deputies and for myself.  We do require a reasonable break, but a period of 15 weeks, when there is such a grave and pressing problem to be solved&mdash;a problem that cannot be solved, cannot even be tackled properly, without the authority of new legislation&mdash;this period is too long.</P>
      <P>There is a further consideration.  The world is in a very serious state at the moment and, though I repeat what I have said on one of the Estimates, that in my view there is no danger of war, nevertheless there are all the factors that could result in war and, that being so, the Adjournment should be as short as possible, so that in the event of any dangerous situation arising, the Government might have the benefit and assistance of this House in dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that, whether this recess is long or short, I put it to the Government that it is the desire, the command and the demand of this <Col N="2451" /> House and of this country, that whatever steps can be taken by the Government and by the Minister for External Affairs to maintain the peace of this world should be taken.  Everyone will agree that it is the unanimous desire of the Irish people that the Government should do everything possible to avoid the horrors of a third world war in our time.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition, in his contribution this afternoon, dealt with this very important matter of our constitutional position.  I am one of those who cannot accept the contention of Deputy de Valera that we are an independent republic.  I should like to be able to accept that contention.  I should like to be able to stand forth in this House or in this country, or in any other country in the world, and say that I was a citizen of the Irish Republic.  I acknowledge freely the steps that have been taken by the Fianna Fáil Government, under the direction of the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, to advance our constitutional position towards the objective of an independent republic.  I am satisfied that, in law, we have not achieved that position; and what I have been endeavouring to do, in questions I have put to the Taoiseach, is to have a clear understanding of what our present constitutional position is, so that whatever obstacles remain to the achievement of our ideal of a republic may be removed by this House, by unanimous determination.  I feel that when there is any doubt as to our position, it is much better that it should be approached in that way.  I admit that Deputy de Valera is speaking absolutely honestly and saying what he believes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain that remark.  Everybody in this country, and every member of the Irish race, recognises and acknowledges that Deputy de Valera is an individual of outstanding personality.  There can be no doubt about that, whether one agrees or disagrees with him.  The trouble with people who are of outstanding personality is that they generally get the advice that suits them. That is an extraordinary fact, but let any person go right back over history and he will find that those outstanding national figures always got the advice they wanted to get.</P>

      <P>I would not want to say that but that is the fact.  That is one of the great disadvantages of being great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we were discussing an agreement, the agreement of 1938, and that agreement was entered into subsequent to the adopting of our Constitution. I think that the Constitution was 1937 and the agreement was entered into with Britain in 1938.  The first or second page of the printed copy of that agreement shows where our Ministers, Deputy de Valera and, I think, Deputy Aiken, Deputy Boland and Deputy MacEntee, entered into an agreement with the British Government to amend the Treaty in respect of two of its provisions.  In other words, even after the passing of our Constitution it was acknowledged by our Government that the Treaty of 1921 between this country and Great Britain still had operative effect.  That is an aspect that is overlooked and that is why I say that in my view we have not yet achieved the ideal of an independent republic.  Our relationships with England are still governed by the <Col N="2453" /> articles of the Treaty of 1921, except where it has been amended by agreement.</P>
    <P>In so far as I have been able to follow up this constitutional matter, our courts have held that the Free State Constitution had its validity in the British Free State Constitution Act.  That was generally accepted by our courts.  Our law flowed from the Free State Constitution Act and it was within the power granted by that Free State Constitution that our new Constitution was passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there was a revolution at that point.  In British law there was no right of the people to enact anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where Deputy de Valera and I disagree and that is probably the fount of our disagreement. I think that we are agreed right up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a quiet revolution when the people of this country enacted the Constitution because there was no power for that under the British-imposed Constitution. Reference to the people was made deliberately for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Deputy de Valera believes that and I accept that he intended that, but the trouble is, I feel, that he did not achieve what he intended to achieve or what he set out to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was.  All we can do, however, in this House is to express our views honestly across the floor of the House to one another.  If the Taoiseach had been able to give me the same answer to my question as Deputy de Valera would have given if he were still Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it would undoubtedly mean that a very big proportion of this country and certainly two successive Governments had taken a viewpoint which in history and in the constitutional position would be of importance, <Col N="2454" /> but there is no doubt whatsoever that the present Taoiseach, and apparently the present Government, take a different view from what Deputy de Valera and his Government took two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You are now in the happy position that you can deal with it.  You can be sure of support on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that probably less than half the people believe that Deputy de Valera is right &mdash;and I am trying to see the point in its proper perspective&mdash;and more than half the people believe that Deputy de Valera is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case, I would suggest&mdash;and I am sure that Deputy de Valera would agree with me &mdash;that this matter should not be the plaything even of discussions in this House.  No amount of argument can convince me that we have achieved this ideal and consequently we are not going to solve the problem even by a vote in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I will put it briefly.  We have a Supreme Court in this country.  That Supreme Court is vested with certain powers regarding our Constitution.  I would like this matter to be referred to our Supreme Court to decide as the Supreme Court of this country what is our constitutional position.  Would Deputy de Valera accept that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know how it was established, but the great difficulty we are in is that the President of the United States does not accept this Constitution of ours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say that that is true or that it would happen if the Dáil passes an Act entitling the President or if the Government entitled the Ceann Comhairle for example to sign the letter of credence.  I would like to see it tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in status our highest representative abroad is the representative to His Holiness the Pope, but he was accredited to His Holiness by the king.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The king's name was put in in accordance with the External Relationships Act.  It need not have been.  The ambassador was accredited to His Holiness with the authority of the Government and that was the fundamental thing.  We used the king's signature at that time solely as a mark of our association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's argument, but while that position remains, while the present representative of this country has to be accredited to His Holiness the Pope by the English King, the Vatican cannot possibly believe that we are an independent republic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many representatives have come to this country who were accredited to the king.  We had a representative from the Argentine the other day.  I have not seen the authority he carried with him or to whom it was accredited, but I take it that we will see it in this House in time, certainly after the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we felt it necessary to accept the machinery of the British King.  It did, in my view, show clearly that the Fianna Fáil Government was alive to the fact that, even under the 1937 Constitution, we <Col N="2456" /> were somewhat less than an independent republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was a matter of external policy.  We chose to do that as a matter of policy for the time being, a matter of policy that could be changed any time it was suitable to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste did not express any point of view.  He took care not to express a point of view.  He simply attacked me for not doing what he says he wanted, which is not expressing a point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not.  What he did was, he attacked me about some previous position, why I said this or that, why the Fianna Fáil attitude was this or that.  He did not express any opinion as to the constitutional position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely because there was confusion created unnecessarily, I had come to the conclusion, as Minister for External Affairs, and head of the Government, that it was probable that although there was an advantage in the policy, the disadvantages now outweighed the advantages and that it should go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel is that the adoption of any status, whatever it is, should be a positive act of the people and the Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without any <Col N="2457" /> doubt whatsoever, because the words that are in the Constitution of being free, sovereign and independent, could relate to types of Government other than a republic.  When I was speaking on the Department of External Affairs, I used the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; of the British Commonwealth.  I have discovered since that, constitutionally, that word &ldquo;member&rdquo; was wrong, because even within the British conception of the Commonwealth they used the phrase &ldquo;association.&rdquo;  I admit that in the 1926 definition the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is used in that definition.  I forget the exact terms of the definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Autonomous communities, all free and independent, associated with one another&mdash;I do not know what the phrase is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy likes, I will read the whole paragraph for him. They are &ldquo;autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Deputy because the important phrase in that sentence is, &ldquo;in no way subordinate one to another&rdquo;.  So that, even in the 1926 conception&mdash;and it was a constitutional theory and a constitutional law&mdash;it was considered a substantial advance that you could have a community of free and independent nations forming one commonwealth such as the British Commonwealth of Nations was.  However, I believe that in accordance with the law of our own courts, the Treaty of 1921, except in so far as it has been amended by positive <Col N="2458" /> agreement of the two countries, is still in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but, nevertheless, unfortunately, our courts, I believe, would hold that.  Now, that being the position, I would like to see the steps taken that would cut the painter entirely and, in so far as it may be necessary, in so far as I have any voice in the present Government&mdash; unfortunately, I do not think I have very much&mdash;or in so far as I have any say with the present Government, I certainly would press them to end this entirely unsatisfactory position, to cut the painter and declare positively that we are a sovereign independent republic. I am glad to know that in the carrying out of that declaration&mdash;I do not think there is any doubt&mdash;we would have the support of every member on the opposite benches and that that constitutional advance would be taken unanimously by this House and, being taken unanimously by this House, there is no one in any part of the world who would doubt our position then.</P>

      <P>I would be glad if Deputy de Valera would enlighten me a little on this question of the republic which has been raised here by Deputy de Valera and referred to by the Tánaiste and raised again by Deputy Cowan.  I take it that it will be agreed by every Deputy that, had the 1937 Constitution declared that this portion of Ireland was a republic, there would not be any doubt at all about it now, in 1948.  I think that much at any rate is quite clear.</P>

      <P>I want to remind them further, that when that particular Article of the Constitution was being discussed in this House, Deputy MacDermot put down an amendment in which he asked that, instead of having in that article that Éire is a sovereign, independent, democratic State, the Constitution should declare that Éire is a sovereign, independent, democratic republic.  He did not claim that he wanted to see it a republic, but he moved that amendment and he said he was moving it for the purpose of finding out why the then Taoiseach was against it and the then Taoiseach gave his explanation.  I am quite prepared to accept that it was a perfectly honest, sincere explanation. He gave an explanation as to why he did not want to call it a republic and as to why he did not want a republic declared at that particular time, why this question of a republic should be left entirely outside the Constitution and should be decided at a later stage. I wonder does Deputy de Valera remember that?</P>

      <P>I have the Dáil Official Debates here for 1937, Volume 67-68, columns 971-2 973-4.  An amendment was moved by Deputy MacDermot to delete the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo;.  Deputy MacDermot said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have put down this amendment for the purpose of eliciting the reasons which induced the Government to abstain from using this occasion to declare a republic.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> I should like Deputies to listen to the reasons which Deputy de Valera then gave why the Government of the day, a Fianna Fáil Republican Government, were abstaining from using that occasion to declare a republic.  The reasons of President de Valera as he then was&mdash;he was not Taoiseach until after the last Constitution was passed &mdash;were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The thing to be aimed at in this Constitution, in my opinion, as there is an acute difference of opinion of such a character that it would mean that we would not get acceptance of this Constitution by a large section of the people, was to leave this matter to be decided as a separate and independent question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any ambiguity about that.  I do not think there is any confusion in that sentence.  The aim of Deputy de Valera as President, when he was talking to that amendment, was to leave this question of the republic to be decided as a separate and independent question at a later date.  He went on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether you take one view or the other view, you will have against this Constitution a number of people who, otherwise, would not be against it. In the same spirit as we tried to meet Deputies on the opposite side, where it is at all possible, I think we ought to leave this matter also outside it.  It can be decided outside the Constitution and put as a separate and independent question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again is there any ambiguity in that sentence?  The view of Deputy de Valera then, and I take it also as the view of Deputy Aiken, was that the question of a republic was to be left entirely outside the Constitution and was to be put to the people, in Deputy de Valera's words, &ldquo;as a separate and independent question.&rdquo; The reason he was doing that was, as he said, that if he did not so do, there would be a certain amount of disagreement and he would not get people behind the Constitution that he wanted to get behind it&mdash;a perfectly fair case and a case put at that time in clear and unambiguous language.</P>
    <P>I want now to ask Deputy de Valera <Col N="2461" /> when was this question put to the people as a separate and independent question, because a few years ago when Deputy Dillon, as he then was, asked the Taoiseach a question regarding our constitutional status, with the assistance of dictionaries, Deputy de Valera defined the position and he defined it as having its roots in this Constitution.  Now he was either not honest with the people when he gave that reply to Deputy MacDermot or he was not being honest when he gave the reply to Deputy Dillon.  He was quite clear in his reply to Deputy MacDermot that it was going to be left as a separate and independent question but in reply to Deputy Dillon he said that it had its roots in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I think if Deputies will appreciate what were the views of Deputy de Valera when that specific question was put to him at that time, they will see that there is a great deal to be said for the views expressed by Deputy Cowan, that there is still confusion and that as long as that confusion continues we, as a nation, are going to suffer in prestige and dignity. I do not like the position as it is.  I said that before in this House.  I do do not like, if I am asked by a person from America or any other country whether or not we are a republic, to have to reply that I do not know. That is the position to-day.</P>
    <P>I think that this Government is particularly fortunate in having as its leader and as Minister for External Affairs, people who by their professional training, are capable of looking into this question, two eminent senior counsel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than a question of law.  There is a question of the constitutional development which takes place in every country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely going to say that I am very glad that we have, and that I think this Government is particularly fortunate in having, two eminent senior counsel to look into the question, after all the confusion which has been created.  It has been created by Deputy de Valera, <Col N="2462" /> Deputy Aiken and other Deputies on the far side.  I think that confusion should be ended as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I want to make this further statement. I think the important thing, as far as we are concerned in 1948, is to aim at the unification of this country. I am not sure that it is terribly important what you call the country, whether you call it &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; or whether we are a republic or not.  If we are a republic, well and good, but let us know when we became a republic, how we are a republic.  Let us assume that we are a sovereign, democratic republic, but it was not fair to put anyone in the position of saying to them in 1937: &ldquo;There is the document on which you are going to vote. I am telling you that I am leaving the question of whether we are a republic or not outside all that document to be decided as a separate and independent question and to be put as a separate and independent question&rdquo;, because that is what the people were told then. That is what Deputy de Valera told them.  I merely referred to this matter because Deputy de Valera was not prepared to accept my word that I was reading history when I said to him that he was not in 1937 putting this question of the republic to the people.  These are his own words.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for External Affairs intends to intervene in this debate.  I should like to express the hope that he will and I should like to hear some firm declaration as to what is the intention of the Government regarding this whole matter.  As I say, it does not help us nationally or internationally, so far as prestige or dignity is concerned, to be left in the position we are now in and in which we have been since Deputy de Valera had recourse to dictionaries some years ago.  I do not think anyone on this side of the House will take the slightest exception to what Deputy de Valera said regarding the national objectives that he outlined. I think we are all agreed that every Party in this State will do its utmost to secure the abolition of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that every Party in this State will support a Government which is <Col N="2463" /> doing its utmost to revive the Irish language.  I was particularly glad to hear the words of Deputy de Valera to-day in relation to the language movement. I want to say to him that he expressed my views exactly and the views that a number of the Deputies of these benches expressed on the Estimate for the Department of Education, that no matter how much force and compulsion you try, unless you can educate the people and inculcate in them a love of the language and a desire to learn it from patriotic, national or other motives, or at any rate put into them a desire to learn it, compulsion is no good and you might as well drop it.  That is perhaps put a little more crudely than the Deputy put it, but I think it summarises the views expressed by Deputy de Valera, and I should like to record my agreement with them.</P>
    <P>I understood from Deputy Lemass to-day that this debate was to centre round the ten-point programme.  We have gone rather away from that in going into the constitutional question. I want to make this claim for the Government: that each of the ten points of the programme read out to-day by Deputy de Valera has received the attention of this Government in less than six months of office. Many of them have received attention to such an extent that they are well on the way to fulfilment already in less than six months.  A certain amount of jeering has been indulged in because this Government removed the taxes on beer, tobacco and cinema seats imposed in the Supplementary Budget.  That was one of the promises made by this Government to the people and was one of the points in the ten-point programme.  In doing that the Government did, in fact, effect a real reduction in the cost of living, because they reduced the taxes which people had to bear by £6,000,000 or £6,500,000, as Deputy Davern admitted, for the first time for a Fianna Fáil Deputy, when speaking on the Social Welfare Bill.  Every person in this State, rich and poor alike, had to bear the taxes which were imposed by the Supplementary Budget, because the <Col N="2464" /> average person, at any rate, either smokes or takes a drink.  The cost of living has been reduced by the removal of these taxes.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has dealt with other matters which were raised by Deputy de Valera.  I just want to finish on a note which should appeal to Deputy MacEntee, if he were in the House. Deputy MacEntee is fond of perusing election addresses and newspaper files. In relation to the question of emigration, Deputy de Valera said that there is very little need for a commission, that what was needed was a method of stopping the drain of emigration.  I should like to call Deputy de Valera's attention to Fianna Fáil plans for stopping emigration as disclosed by one of the active cumainn in the constituency represented by Deputy MacEntee.  According to the <i>Irish Press</i> of 29th October, 1945,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a very successful inter-cumainn debate was held under the auspices of the Fintan Lalor Cumann of Fianna Fáil in the Rossa Hall, Rathmines, when the motion, &lsquo;That conscription is the only cure for emigration&rsquo; was passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to add that the secretary of that meeting was the person who stood as a candidate with Deputy MacEntee in the recent election?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">

      <P>I was very glad to hear the discussion as to our constitutional status.  It is gratifying to know that such a question as this can be fairly and freely discussed.  We are now adjourning for quite a considerable period.  I do not think it is much longer than the normal adjournment, but we are adjourning somewhat later than usual.  At a time like this it is important that Deputies should try to emphasise to a Government what they think are the most important matters that should be attended to.  I want to say quite candidly that, in common with many people all over the country and many public bodies, I am highly disappointed with the progress of building.  The stoppage of emigration is one of the ten points in the Government's programme.  I want to say that the shortage of houses is contributing very largely to emigration.  Therefore, <Col N="2465" /> I would ask the Government as well as the Minister for Local Government to see that some definite effort is made to show people at any rate that there is a hope of houses being built.  It is a sort of insult to the people, it certainly depresses them a good deal, that the Minister for Local Government should be continuously on the run from one county to another, from one board of health to another, and from one city or town to another holding meetings and examining this whole question of building and yet nothing being done.</P>

      <P>I think that from the moral and other points of view, the Government, who have a reasonably good majority, and have had quite a long time to consider and think over matters, should put their heads together and get these things done. When the previous Government started to build houses they had to face very great difficulties, but they got over them.  I see no reason why this Government should not be able to get over the present difficulties and commence the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that the cost of living is going down.  That is not the case.  The cost of living is going up and depression is increasing.  The circulation of money has rapidly decreased and unemployment is rapidly on the increase.  These are some of the matters which this Government should look into and try to find a remedy. They talk about employment being provided.  Quite a number of people are unemployed.  Some little work is being done on the roads.  I see men cutting weeds and doing other trifling jobs to pass the time.  Why is it that they cannot get proper work?  Most of these men tell me that they would be much better off if they are working at something which would give good results.  In a great many cases the <Col N="2466" /> main roads and the by-roads are in want of repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate except for this, that I feel some Deputy should protest against the way in which the House has been lured by the leader of the Opposition Party into a morass of blatherskite.  He skimmed lightly over the ten points in the programme of the inter-Party Government, and then he plunged joyfully into the morass that surrounds our constitutional position.  I think that the Deputies who followed the leader of the Opposition into that morass were more foolish than himself.  What difference does it make to anybody whether this country is a republic or not?  If we were to declare this country to be a republic to-morrow, and if we were <Col N="2467" /> to satisfy Deputy Cowan that it is a republic, is that going to stop emigration, is it going to increase output in the agricultural industry, is it going to provide work for our unemployed workers, or will houses spring up all over the country to supply the needs of the working classes?  These are some questions which I would like to put to the House.</P>

I have taken part in every demonstration that was held in commemoration of '98 in my own county and in the adjoining counties, and I think the Deputy should withdraw that, because there is not a Deputy in this House who has more respect for the people who suffered for this country in the past than I have. But I do not believe in humbug and in lawyers' humbug.  We have got too many professional politicians here, too many legal gentlemen who like to twist round knotty constitutional points and to develop them to such an extent that they torture not only themselves but everybody else by getting tied up in the knots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The things that we have to concentrate on are, to a large extent, summed up in the ten points of the inter-Party Government's programme. I support that programme without reservation or qualification. We want to expand production in agriculture. This nation cannot live, whether it be a republic or a dominion or anything else, unless we get increased production in agriculture.  I am not satisfied that enough is being done in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan protested against the long Adjournment.  As a Deputy, I do not think I have ever failed to attend the sittings of the House, and I am not protesting against the Adjournment because, while we may have done a lot of useful work in the Dáil in the last six months, I believe that a new <Col N="2468" /> Government coming in with new Ministers ought to get a chance to grapple effectively with the problems that face the different Departments of State.  I think that a three months' recess will give our Ministers the opportunity of doing very valuable work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that legislation is urgently needed.  I do not accept the child-like faith that some people have in legislation as a solution for every possible problem.  I think that one of the mistakes made by the previous Government was that they put too much confidence in legislation and not enough in tackling in a real way the problems that confronted them.  We all know that the attempt that was made to iron out completely our transport problem by legislation failed ignominiously.</P>
    <P>During the next three months something will have to be done, and done in a vigorous way, to assist agriculture to face the difficulties that confront it. There is a kind of foolish idea being spread around that agriculture has nothing before it but prosperity, prosperity that can be had just for the taking.  There is a kind of view being circulated that the farmer is the one lucky man in a depressed community. The plain fact of the matter is that every farmer in the country is just struggling to live, even the best-off farmers, while there are large sections of the farming community who are not able to extend their industry because they have not the necessary capital or credit resources to enable them to do so.  As far as I know, there has been no proposal to do anything about that, but I am sure that when our Ministers get down to it during the recess they will see how necessary it is to provide increased credit for agriculture and to make it available to the farmers who really require it&mdash;not the well-to-do farmers that the Minister for Agriculture spoke about who have bank deposits or who are in the position to bring in two good securities to a bank to enable them to get whatever credit they require.  The people who want credit are those who find it difficult to get it either from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the banks.  That credit must be placed immediately at <Col N="2469" /> their disposal because the poorest land in the country is owned by farmers who have not the necessary credit to enable them to improve that land.  If we are to expand agriculture in the way that is necessary for this country we must assist those people so that they will be able to get increased supplies of fertilisers for the land and will be in a position to reclaim their waste land.  In that way we can expand the area of land which can be used productively in the best national interest.</P>
    <P>What is true of agriculture is also true of industry.  There must be a real drive to get existing industries expanded and new industries established, wherever possible.  I hold that it is wrong to denounce every man, who happens to be a manufacturer, as an industrial racketeer.  That attitude is foolish.  There are manufacturers and manufacturers just as there are farmers and farmers.  I hold that any man who is going all out to put his capital and brains into the manufacture of goods to be used by our people or to be exported is the most valuable asset that we have in the country, and that he must be given whole-hearted support.</P>
    <P>We have still the drain of emigration. There is one thing that depresses me in connection with that more than anything else and it is the breaking up of homes in the country.  We have the position in which the bread-winner of a family has to go across to the other side to earn his living.  He has to leave his wife and family at home in this country.  I think that is a deplorable state of affairs, a thing that should not be allowed to happen. Neither should we have the position in which young men of outstanding ability, whether they be educated or be manual workers, would be driven out of the country to build up other nations when it is so urgent to build up our own.</P>
    <P>I said that there is a tendency to exaggerate the prosperity of the agricultural industry and, following on that, a tendency to exaggerate the prosperity of the farmers.  At the moment there is a kind of ramp being encouraged in this country to impose additional burdens on the farmers by compulsory means.  We have a demand for compulsory <Col N="2470" /> holidays and a demand for the shortening of the working week, demands which will add to the farmer's burden, disrupt his business and slow down production.  We ought to face up to the fact that if we want to extend the agricultural industry we ought to do it not by compulsion but by cooperation and by encouragement to those who are engaged in the industry. Let the Government do what the Minister for Agriculture has suggested and keep outside the farmer's fence as far as possible.  The farmer will then deliver the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to this debate and I must confess that I am no wiser now than I was before as to what the Constitution really is and as to where we stand.  I disagree with Deputy Cogan when he says it does not matter what this country is known as or what our status is.  I still think that the word republic has a connotation in this country which is of importance and associated with that word and name have been tremendous sacrifices by large numbers of people.  I believe that this Government should not lose any time in proclaiming to the world that we are a republic in fact and in law.  So far as our powers at present extend we should endeavour to establish that.  I do not think that anybody in this House and very few in this country will disagree with that statement.  We can never have any kind of reasonably good relations with <Col N="2471" /> Britain until such time as there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever regarding the sovereignty of the Irish nation. Enough, I think, has been said about that particular matter.  I want to refer to some other matters.</P>
      <P>When this Government was formed it was stated quite clearly that the various Parties came together on the understanding that there would be no restriction of criticism by any Deputy in any part of the House.  That is a right which I regard as a very dear one and it is one which I intend to exercise to the very limits, as far as I think it is desirable.  I want to exercise it now in respect of some statements that were made in the Seanad some days ago by the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Cogan has touched upon the matter to which I intended to refer when he raised the question of the weekly half-holiday for the farm labourers.  This is a matter which I regard as being of fundamental importance.  It is not a matter, I think, which any Minister should treat in a jocose fashion, because anybody who is in touch with the agricultural labourers of this country knows full well that there is nothing dearer to their hearts than the idea of getting some few hours off during the week during which they can carry out the normal duties that are required by every householder and every father of a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has suggested that if the agricultural labourer is to be allowed holidays or a half-holiday it is going to have ill-effects upon Irish agriculture.  That, I believe, is a most reactionary view and a most reactionary statement.  If Deputy Cogan or the present Minister for Agriculture considers that any improvements in Irish agriculture are going to be made upon that basis then such considerations are entirely false, because the agricultural worker in this country has had a sad history of bad treatment and low wages.  I think that any Government&mdash;no matter what Government may be in power&mdash;with any sense of decency would lose no time in introducing legislation to ensure that this worst-treated worker of all would get the fundamental <Col N="2472" /> right of four hours off for 54 hours worked and annual holidays which every other class of worker has. The Minister for Agriculture on a number of occasions has said that he believes these rights should be accorded to the agricultural worker but he does not, apparently, accept the view that legislation should be introduced against, as he stated himself, the will of the majority of the Irish people.  That was the reference he made to this question during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I do not for a moment consider that the farmers of this country who wish to refuse this right to their worker represent the majority of the Irish people.  I think there is a great ignorance amongst the majority of the Irish people as to the manner in which farm labourers have been denied this fundamental right.  Statements were made by the Minister in the Seanad to which I have referred in another place which, I think, are contemptible.  The history of this fight for the half-day and the week's holidays for farm labourers goes back a greater distance than the lifetime of either myself or the Minister for Agriculture.  I think that enough has been said on this matter; enough verbiage by the Minister and by everybody else has shrouded this question.  It is time for action and it is time that this was placed on the statute book of the country. I want to make it quite clear that my attitude towards the present Government will depend upon the amount of progress that we make in connection with this matter.  Deputy Cogan, in referring to this matter, as I said before, prognosticated ill-effects of an appalling nature if this measure were introduced.  If Irish farmers are not sufficiently efficient to provide their workers with a half-day in the week then they do not deserve the services of the workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the very vexed question of tomatoes.  There is at the present time a glut of tomatoes in this country.  Nobody will admit more readily than I that in past years the supply of tomatoes was exploited by unscrupulous people and that they <Col N="2473" /> were undoubtedly put outside the reach of the ordinary working-class people in the cities and towns.  The only people who could buy tomatoes were those who could afford to go into a high-class restaurant and pay 1/-apiece for them.  Now, we are going to the other extreme.  In my constituency they go in largely for growing tomatoes and the bulk of the tomatoes in the City of Dublin come from my constituency.  The present situation represents a veritable death-blow to the growers.  I am speaking now of the small men, most of whom do the work themselves and their families in this industry and do not employ any labour.</P>
    <P>The present situation is disastrous for them.  There is a glut of Dutch tomatoes in the City of Dublin.  The price of Irish tomatoes is falling day by day.  I understand that the Irish growers are forbidden to export and they are trapped in the position of having to sell their tomatoes at a dead loss.  In no circumstances would I advocate that any price other than a reasonable price should be paid for tomatoes to either Irish or foreign growers.  I do say, however, that the present wholesale price in the markets will spell the death-knell of this industry if it continues.  It is attributable in no small degree to the import of Dutch tomatoes.  Despite what the Minister for Agriculture told the House, Dutch tomatoes are subsidised by the Dutch Government and the Dutch growers have a guaranteed price which enables them to carry on their business successfully.  From the economic point of view they could not export tomatoes to this country and sell them at 1/- per lb. if they were not subsidised.  Some steps will have to be taken during the recess to remedy the position.  First of all, profiteering must be cut out.  I entirely agree with that, but at the same time steps must be taken to ensure that the home industry will not be strangled and a decent price must be paid which will enable the producer and his family to live.</P>
    <P>That can best be done by controlling the industry in a proper way.  I do not accept the theory of the Minister <Col N="2474" /> for Agriculture that the solution for this problem, as for every other problem, will be found in free competition and that by competition everything will find its own level.  That is an old capitalistic dog-eat-dog philosophy. Economically it is totally fallacious.  It is something which can do irremediable harm in this country.</P>

      <P>I shall hear Deputy Byrne for two minutes.  To-day he intimated his intention of rising on this.  It is a pity he did not get in sooner.</P>

      <P>Two minutes will be quite adequate.  I would ask the Ministers of the various Departments during the next couple of weeks to make inquiries in their Departments and find out what the lowest paid wage earners in the Departments have.  I understand that there are men employed as messengers, janitors, packers, porters and so on.  I have been told that there are several of them who are married men with three or four children.  I have been told that they earn as little as £3 10s. 0d. per week.  No Irish Government should offer a married man with a family £3 10s. 0d. per week no matter what his work is.  Such men are worthy of decent wages in order to keep their families in frugal comfort.</P>
      <P>I earnestly urge upon the Minister for Local Government the necessity for putting a little pressure on the authorities in the City of Dublin to speed up housing.  Only to-day I had visitors to the Dáil complaining that they found it impossible to get a house. There is not a room vacant in the City of Dublin.  The Minister for Defence is well aware of that.  The House and the corporation asked him to help by staying evictions, and we asked him on more than one occasion to pay discharged soldiers living in married quarters their pensions and deferred pay. I ask him now to do something to remedy the position.  I think the Army authorities should either build or buy houses for those soldiers they are anxious to dispossess.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th November, 1948.</P>
