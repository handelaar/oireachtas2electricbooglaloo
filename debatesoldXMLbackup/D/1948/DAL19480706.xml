      <P>The forest lands on the Gradwell estate extend to 665 acres and form part of the Castlepollard forest area, totalling 871 acres.  In the year 1946-47 ten men were employed during the period April to December, 1946, and eight men from January to March, 1947.  The maximum number employed during the operational season 1947-48 was seven men, and the number now <Col N="2166" /> employed is four.  The employment provided at any given time depends on the programme of work in hands.</P>
      <P>The number of men at present employed is sufficient for the season's programme at this centre.</P>

      <P>It has not been found possible to identify the area by its local name, but it is presumed that the Deputy refers to the only unplanted area beside Lough Cutra in the hands of the Forestry Division.  Before this land was acquired by the Forestry Division, the Land Commission had intimated that it was not required for division and that it was not suitable for that purpose.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that farmers in the areas of Cromane, Carragh Lake and Glencutane districts have made repeated demands to the Dairy Disposal Company Limited, for the service of a portable creamery; and, if so, whether he will ensure that these farmers are provided with the facilities asked for at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  With regard to the second part, I am informed by the Dairy Disposal Company that, following surveys of the districts referred to by the Deputy, the conclusion was reached that the quantity of milk in these districts which is not already being delivered to creameries is insufficient to justify the provision of travelling creamery facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the date of that survey it has been suggested that the other areas&mdash; Carragh Lake and Glencutane&mdash;should be formed into one central group and could he see his way to ask the Dairy Disposal Company to re-examine the position in regard to these districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, there are two separating stations, one within five and a half miles of Cromane and another within one and a half miles of Cromane and all the milk in the area is in fact being taken with the exception of about 80 cows.  If the Deputy can make any suggestion which would better suit the convenience of the people, I am sure the Dairy Disposal Company would be anxious to fall in with him, because there do appear to be serious difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not determine the allocations of maize meal to traders.  Allocations of maize to maize meal millers are at present equivalent to 40 per cent. of the quantity of maize meal mixture manufactured in the cereal year 1938-39, the actual quantities being approximately 16,000 tons per month.  The controlled maximum retail prices for maize meal are 27/8 per cwt. in the port areas and 28/8 per cwt. in the rest of the country. The maize now in stock will permit distribution to be maintained to the end of November, 1948.</P>

As at the censuses of 1926 and 1936, the definitive report will be published in volumes, one for each subject&mdash;areas, occupations, industries, ages and conjugal conditions, etc.  It is expected that the tables for the first of the subject volumes&mdash;Volume 1 (areas)&mdash;will be sent for printing in October next and may be issued some months later.

In reply to Deputy Briscoe's supplementary question, so far as I can judge from an examination of the papers in this case, the Department of Local Government do not go into these matters.  This arises because of a section in the Housing Amendment Act, 1948, and the inquiries are carried out in pursuance of powers conferred on the Dublin Corporation&mdash;powers sought, as far as I know, at the request of the corporation.</P>

As most county councils have employed them for many years it is not possible to state the procedure adopted by them in putting the system into operation originally.  Overseers are appointed by virtue of the general power vested in every local authority to employ such staff as may be necessary. Under the direction of an assistant county engineer, overseers supervise and control all other road workers in a specified area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the statement referred to is that reported in the daily papers on 22nd December, 1947.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Health Act, 1947, recognises the principle of professional secrecy.  It provides that the Minister for Health may make regulations in regard to various matters referred to in the Act subject to certain conditions and, in particular, to the condition that where the regulations require records to be kept in relation to the health of individuals such provision shall be made therein as the Minister thinks necessary or proper for ensuring that the parts of such records containing the names of such individuals shall be treated in a confidential manner and shall not be published save with the consent of such individuals.  Further, every regulation made by the Minister under the Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it the regulation shall be annulled.  Finally, it is the intention to consult the National Health Council, established under Section 98 of the Health Act, 1947, in regard to any important regulations which it is proposed to make under the Act.  In fact, the council was consulted before the principal regulations which have been made since the Act came into force were brought into operation.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, these provisions constitute reasonable safeguards in regard to professional secrecy, and I have not thought it necessary to take any action in reference to the section in question.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil adjourned on Friday last I was speaking on this Estimate and was referring to the failure of the present Administration to provide work for the unemployed in the constituency that I have the honour to represent.  I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary that the minor employment schemes that used to be carried out during the spring and summer months were not being carried out this year, and I wanted to know the reason for that.  As everybody knows, there is a great deal of unemployment in the country to-day, especially in rural Ireland, and when one remembers the fine promises that were made by the spokesmen of the present inter-Party Government during the last general election, and before it, about the way in which they would provide full employment for the people if they were elected to power, one is amazed to find that up to now very little has been done to implement those promises.  I was inclined to think that this absence of employment was more or less confined to North Kerry, the constituency that I represent, but I find that there are similar complaints in other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see on the Order Paper to-day two questions&mdash;Questions 11 and 12&mdash;dealing with the same thing.  Question 11 was asked by Deputy Roddy of Sligo. He asked the Minister for Finance if he would state when the minor relief <Col N="2182" /> scheme and the rural improvements scheme would be put into operation in County Sligo, so it can be seen that not alone in North Kerry are people complaining of lack of work but also in Sligo and other counties.  Also, Deputy Killilea asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether it is intended to proceed with the minor drainage relief schemes this year, and if so, when he will have a list of such schemes ready.  It is an extraordinary thing to find in the early part of July Deputies in this House putting down questions to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why schemes of work are not available for the people in rural Ireland. It is very hard to understand what the policy of the present Government is at all towards this question of employment.  There is a bigger number of unemployed in the country to-day than there has been for many years.</P>
    <P>If we take the unemployment figure for the 26th June, we find that the total number of persons on the registers of employment exchanges and branch offices during the week ending June 26th, were 45,269, compared with 40,483 during the corresponding period of last year.  That does not tell the whole story, because in the recent employment period Order, which was put into effect in the middle of June, certain classes of people were put outside the scope of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, and, of course, when these people find themselves ineligible for unemployment benefits they do not think it worth their while to register at employment exchanges.  The problem of unemployment is with us to-day more than ever.  It has reached alarming proportions despite the assurances that we got from members opposite about the way in which they were going to provide work for the people if they were given the responsibility of office.  The question of full employment was spoken of on every platform throughout the country, but instead of any attempt being made to provide full employment we have less employment for the people.  Added to the number of unemployed who would ordinarily be with us, we have this year those people who have been disemployed by reason <Col N="2183" /> of the closing down of the hand-won turf industry.  I understand that I am precluded from dwelling on that under this Vote, but, however, we will have the opportunity of dealing with it at another time.  Because of the Government's failure&mdash;at least I should say owing to a great extent to the Government's failure&mdash;to provide employment for the people&mdash;I am concerned for the moment with the people in rural Ireland&mdash;there is mass emigration. Emigration was never so rampant in rural Ireland as it is to-day and the peculiar thing about it is that those people who tried to condemn the previous Government for this evil of emigration, trying to make out that they were responsible for it, seem to be quite complacent about the question to-day, because they themselves are in office and what they described as &ldquo;a great national evil, a cancer on the body politic&rdquo; is now accepted as commonplace.  It is attributed now to such causes as wanderlust and a desire on the part of our people to see the world outside, but by no chance would they say that it is due to the failure or the inability of the Government to provide the necessary work for the people.  They tell us now naïvely that it is an ordinary development that would take place in any country.  Even quite recently the Minister for Agriculture told us that he had no fault to find with the phenomenon of emigration. On the contrary, he said that he would like to see parents in this country having families of 21&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One item I would like to refer to here is the field drainage scheme.  I do not know whether the present Parliamentary Secretary has any responsibility for it, but this field drainage scheme was designed for the purpose <Col N="2184" /> of providing employment for those people who lost their employment through the closing of the turf industry. I think that £4 per statute acre is an unreasonable contribution to ask of those people who are supposed to benefit from the scheme.  After all, I think £4 per acre would represent nearly half the amount that would be expended on the scheme, and I would like to draw a comparison between this scheme and the rural improvements scheme.  Under the rural improvements scheme, beneficiaries are called upon to contribute 25 per cent. and I heard Deputies in this House during the course of the debate stating that in their opinion 25 per cent. was too much to ask of those people who make applications under the rural improvements scheme.  I think there is substance in their complaint. I think that 25 per cent. is a fairly high percentage to expect the people to contribute, but if 25 per cent is regarded as excessive in the case of the rural improvements scheme, surely 50 per cent. would be very excessive in connection with the administration of this other scheme I referred to, the field drainage scheme.  In any case, we have had very little information as to how that scheme is operating, because I understand that it has been confined so far to western counties.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that over 1,000 men have lost their employment at the turf depôts at the North Wall, Alexandra Basin, and the Phoenix Park.  I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to recommend the formation of an immediate relief scheme to give opportunities to these men to go back to work again.  When I was at the North Wall a few weeks ago before the cessation of the turf scheme I met a number of the workers there.  The young single men told me that if they could get work they would prefer to stay in their own country, but that if they did not get work soon they would emigrate and not come back again. One of the foremen in charge told me that at a day's notice he could get employment for at least 200 of these men in an English district.  I implored these men not to go away for a little while anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the foreman if there was any remedy he could suggest as there was no use in blaming anybody for the fact that turf production had ceased.  He said that at the extension of the Alexandra Basin there was a glorious site for the making of cement blocks for house building at which these men could be employed as it was the simplest form of work.  He suggested that if a cement block-making industry was established the North Wall area offered both shipping and railway facilities. Cement could be brought in there without very much trouble.  He drew my attention to the fact that when we could import cement there was a jetty adjoining the turf depôt at the Alexandra Basin where cement could be unloaded and that such an industry would give continuous employment and <Col N="2186" /> provide much needed material for the big housing programme which we expect to see started soon.  I put that before the Parliamentary Secretary as an idea which I approve of.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would consider such a scheme for the employment of those who were engaged on turf work he would be doing a good day's work not alone for these men but for the building industry.  He would be providing us with materials to go ahead with the building of houses in a much speedier manner than at present.</P>
    <P>Some speakers I notice were blaming somebody for turf work being brought to an end, as if it were brought to an end by any deliberate action.  So far as Dublin City is concerned, you could hardly get some of our people to take turf for nothing.  They got such a dose of bad, wet turf during the last five, six or seven years that they have taken a dislike to it and, no matter how good it is, you could hardly get them to go back to turf again.  I remember seeing turf briquettes which had been made at Lullymore or some other place, and they were a magnificent production. They were given out to factories and in some places by the boards of assistance to the most deserving section of our people.  If you want to get turf production going again, you will have to develop that industry.</P>

      <P>I shall not deal with it any further.  There is no use in shutting our eyes to the fact that unemployment is growing rapidly in the City of Dublin.  It is the duty of the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary's Department to see that those who are disemployed because of the completion of one form of Government work will be provided with some other employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The two schemes under this Vote that affect rural Ireland are the minor relief scheme and the rural improvements scheme.  The minor <Col N="2187" /> relief scheme was brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government in the autumn of 1932 to give employment to those who were unemployed.  Several Deputies have criticised the operation of the minor relief schemes as people did not register in one area, while in another area they did register.  In fact we had quite a lot of people registering, say, in area X. and people not registering in area Z.  Some of these people could not get work in the next townland.  I hold that on account of people registering in certain places and people in other places not registering certain works were undertaken which were not as important as works that are left outstanding in other places and should have been undertaken long before.</P>
      <P>A priority list should be drawn up for the purpose of ensuring that the most useful works which require to be executed will be carried out first.  That system should be adopted even if it entailed a sort of mobile unit to transfer unemployed from one area into another&mdash;somewhat on the lines of what happened during the emergency, when turf workers were brought in lorries from one area to another.  That would, in addition, give employment to those people who bought lorries but who now have no work, because they could be engaged in transferring the workers from one area to another.  As things are at the moment, if a worker has to go a certain distance for employment he can refuse the work and still draw the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to money which was voted by the Board of Works to the county councils to provide employment for the displaced turf workers, I would point out that in our county we received a grant of £20,000.  The county council, of which I happen to be a member, were asked to subsidise that amount to the tune of £6,666.  We had, therefore, to place an extra burden of 3d. in the £ for the next year on the ratepayers of County Galway in order to get that grant.  The rate which was struck this year for County Galway is the highest ever recorded in County Galway and it is a very heavy burden on the people.  If that grant was to <Col N="2188" /> have been made available at all, it should have been made available in full.  We should not have had to ask the ratepayers of County Galway to subsidise the grant we were given in order to help the present Government out of the difficulty they created by the stoppage of the hand-won turf scheme.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme was another very useful scheme which was introduced in the early days of the war by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I understand that there is to be a change in the way these schemes are going to be carried out and that a special board is being set up to deal with them.  In County Galway these schemes have been carried out up to the present by the county surveyor, the county council officials and the workers directly involved.  I have no objection to the manner in which they are carried out provided they are carried out but I would say that the old system was very satisfactory in our county.  When the people filled up a form and lodged their money to get one of these schemes carried out they had not to wait very long until the work was done and they had a chance of earning their money back.</P>

      <P>Possibly the Deputy was not in the House the other day when I was speaking to Deputy Killilea on the matter.

Therefore, we have to do that ourselves now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say on the day in question and I have read it since.  I know that the County Manager <Col N="2189" /> in County Galway has stated that they cannot co-operate with the Board of Works now but the people were quite satisfied with the way the work was being carried out.  I believe that the county surveyor and his officials would still be prepared to carry it out but for the fact that a new board is being set up.  I would urge that that board will see to it that the work is carried out as quickly as was the case heretofore.  I have often filled up forms for people who applied for such schemes.  Some of them were very poor people living in boreens and culs-de-sac. They would lodge one quarter of the money and they would do so in the hope that they would be able to earn back not alone the amount they paid in but the other three-quarters as well.  They often have great difficulty in scraping this money together among themselves&mdash;perhaps four or five small farmers.  Two receipts were given to me for works under the rural improvements scheme.  The people concerned have asked me to find out if the works are going to be carried out and, if not, to get the money back.  One receipt, dated 26th March, 1948, is for a sum of £25, and the other is for a sum of £40.  These receipts are in respect of a road at Sruffane, Caltra, and a road at Kilglass, Ahascragh. Although this money has been collected by the people concerned for each of these roads there is still no sign of the work being executed.  These people do not get money on the side of the road.  They do not want it lodged in Dublin for a considerable time without having some chance of earning back not alone what they have paid in but the extra money as well.  I have been asked by the people concerned to raise this matter and I am doing that.  It is immaterial to me whether the work is carried out by the special board or in the old way by the county council so long as it is carried out.  Let me quote from the Official Report of the 14th April, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Beegan asked the Minister for Finance if he proposes to amend the rural improvements scheme to provide that the full estimated cost of repairing roads other than culs-de-sac will be made available from <Col N="2190" /> State funds on condition that the county council is prepared to take these roads over and maintain them as county roads after repair is carried out; and, if so, whether he will state the minimum width (if any) to be specified for such roads in order to qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan): Under the existing procedure for the rural improvements scheme, a grant can be made for the repair of any road which connects two county roads, without requiring a contribution from the adjoining landholders, provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the link is of sufficient importance as a public road; (2) the cost is not excessive in relation to its utility; (3) the work is not one which the county council would otherwise have done out of their own funds; and (4) the county council, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, undertake to maintain the road on completion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the first part of the reply to the question.  We in County Galway were very glad to hear that reply.  We decided to avail of it and, accordingly, on the motion of Mr. Beegan, we set up a special roads meeting.  We have not actually held this meeting yet, but each councillor has been requested to send in details of roads in his own particular area that can be described as link roads which join up two county roads. As a result of this roads meeting we intend to forward a list of these roads to the Board of Works so that their improvement and repair will be carried out.  Once that work is carried out I am quite sure the county council will agree to maintain them. There are some roads in our area which would never be touched under these minor employment schemes.  One of these is the Gowla road.  Possibly there was a little spent on it once since the employment schemes first came into operation in 1932.  This road connects the Mount Bellew-Ballyforan road with the Castlefrench-Ahascragh road.  There is another road in Fohenagh, Ahascragh, where the Land Commission did part of the work.  I spoke of it in the <Col N="2191" /> Department of Lands debate.  If there were a small addition to it it would be a convenient link for people going to fairs and so on.  There is another through Castlegar-Ahascragh to mention but some.  If the county council agrees to maintain these roads I hope the Board of Works will see its way to repairing them.</P>
    <P>Field drainage has been mentioned in this debate.  I understand it can only be referred to in so far as it provides employment for those who have been thrown out of work as a result of the stoppage of the hand-won turf scheme. I come from a county in which this scheme is in operation.  I have this much criticism to make of the scheme: I think the £4 per acre that the farmers are being asked to pay is excessive when one takes into consideration the rateable valuation of the farms most in need of this work.  Some of these farmers' valuations run roughly from £2 10s. to £10.  Naturally farmers on such a low valuation could never avail of this scheme.  We have not got a big number of landlords now but we have big landowners&mdash;fairly well-to-do farmers and farmer shopkeepers. These are the only people who are able to avail of this scheme in my area because they are the only people who can afford to pay for it.  I am surprised that there has not been some criticism, particularly from the Labour Deputies, of the Government subsidising a scheme to benefit the wealthier landowners in the Counties Galway and Mayo.</P>
    <P>Last week I saw a copy of the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> dated 3rd July, 1948.  In that I read the following extract from a speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;No Unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government had sent down £20,000 to the county council to provide alternative work for the turf workers; and Deputies Killilea and Kitt had stated in the Dáil that there were 3,000 people unemployed in County Galway.  His Department dealt with unemployment and he could tell them that if they knew of <Col N="2192" /> any man looking for employment he (Mr. Donnellan) would have a job for him in the morning.  It was well known that there were no unemployed but Fianna Fáil stooped to deliberate lying to blackguard the Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary bases his assumption that there are no unemployed in County Galway on the incorrect premise that he asked for a show of hands at a particular meeting of his and no hands were raised.  He adopted these schoolboy tactics with his own supporters in the square at Mount Bellew.  There was no one at that meeting except his own supporters.  Some of them were drafted in by lorry from Corofin and Turloughmore. Lorries are not permitted to take people to G.A.A. matches but <Col N="2193" /> they can be used to bring a Parliamentary Secretary's supporters to his meetings. He asked his own supporters if any of them were out of work knowing perfectly well that none of them would put his hand up.  He comes along then and he says that there is no unemployment in County Galway.  I say that there are unemployed in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Last year £116,000 was paid out between 2,000 and 3,000 turf workers in Galway.  What is the alternative this year?  A sum of £20,000 with a contribution from the county council of £6,666, and this field drainage scheme. The total availing of that so far in Galway and Mayo is 28.  This is to provide for those who were working on the bogs last year.  Some people were working on the bogs for six years before that.  Last year when tar became available some of those who had been working on the bogs in the intervening years were called back by the county council to road work.  Now these are unemployed.  A few days ago a married can came to me and told me about a river that is being done under this special scheme through his land and they could not get work on it.  Had he and his three sons been in the square in Mount Bellew they could all have put their hands up.  Being a Fianna Fáil supporter, he did not happen to be there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention a matter that was referred to by Deputy Killilea the other night&mdash;the rumours that were being spread in my constituency to the effect that any representations made by Deputy Killilea or myself would be of no use and that the Parliamentary Secretary was using his office to further his own interests.  We got an assurance the other night that that is not so.  The rumours were probably started by over-enthusiastic supporters of the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2194" /> in order to further Clann na Talmhan interests in the constituency.  Since I was elected here, I know that in every Department which I visited&mdash;and I have been in the Board of Works as well&mdash;my representations were listened to and I got replies from and satisfaction in every Department.  I hope, as Deputy Killilea said, that that condition of things will continue, that the rumours we have heard are unfounded, and that Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, will not be victimised simply because they happen to be sitting in these benches.</P>
    <P>I hope that the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, that there is no unemployment in County Galway, will not be used by him as a lever so that we will not get any of these minor relief schemes this year; I hope that he will not use that as an excuse.  I can tell him that there are plenty of unemployed, and I sincerely hope that some of the minor employment schemes will come to the constituency which the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Killilea and myself represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of humbug has been spoken in connection with these Estimates.  Indeed, Deputies opposite seem to be infected with some sort of fever arising out of turf.  I suppose one might call it &ldquo;bogitis&rdquo;. It would be well if all these turf dumps disappeared, so that those Deputies could get away from talking about turf on different Estimates.  Money was voted in order to give employment to those who were supposed to be unemployed because of the stoppage of the hand-won turf scheme.  It has been found in various areas that people cannot get any men to carry out work. In one district in my area, a fortnight after a scheme came into operation, a ganger could find only three men to work on the roads.  Notwithstanding that, we have all this talk from Fianna Fáil Deputies about great unemployment. There is no purpose served by talking about unemployment caused through the cessation of turf schemes. There is too much talk entirely about unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If work under a rural improvements scheme, a minor employment scheme or <Col N="2195" /> a field drainage scheme is to be carried out, attention should be given first of all to the work that has to be done; the question of employment should be only secondary.  This money, the taxpayers' money, has been misspent in most cases because those who are engaged to carry out the work merely idle their time away.  Money was voted by the last Government to give a certain type of employment in order that the Party in power might gather votes in the elections that would follow.  Those in charge of the works allowed the men to idle their time.  I hope that steps will be taken in the future to ensure in the carrying out of public works that a good return will be given for the money spent.  We represent the ratepayers and taxpayers and it is for us to see that our money will not be wasted for political purposes.</P>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy Moran, who represents a Mayo constituency. He said it was the duty of the Government to provide work for the people who are unemployed as a result of the stoppage of the turf scheme.  The Deputy who finished speaking just now told us that there are 3,000 people unemployed in Galway.  In connection with the drainage of the Brosna, only 120 men can be found, whereas there is work for 500.  The Brosna is not very far away from the county where 3,000 are supposed to be unemployed.  For County Mayo £18,000 was voted for an employment scheme and the county council there, of which Deputy Moran is a member, refused to accept that money.  If they were concerned with the welfare of the unemployed, surely they would accept the £18,000 which could be expended in their county. They are doing a great wrong to the unemployed, because there are roads to be improved and bogs to be drained and that could be done if they accepted the money voted to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane said that in North Kerry there was no work for the people under the minor employment schemes which are usually in operation at this time of the year.  Money was voted for North Kerry under the emergency employment schemes.  In one area the <Col N="2196" /> amount allocated was found to be entirely too much and I am very pleased to say that it was possible to transfer £690 to South Kerry.  If there was any unemployment in North Kerry Deputy Kissane would see to it that they would keep the money there and not let it go south to us.</P>
    <P>I understood that on the minor and rural employment schemes work is usually carried out in the winter and the early spring.  That is only right; if it is not so it should be so.  In an agricultural country all our people could find work on the land from spring to the end of autumn and we should not divert them to other works.  I would not be displeased if the money recently voted to give employment to those supposed to be unemployed because of the stoppage of the turf scheme were withheld until farm work would be done.  Those schemes could be carried out when the farmers would no longer require the services of labourers.  You cannot get men to work on the land when they can engage on these schemes and can idle their time perhaps a good deal.</P>
    <P>In the rural improvements scheme there are at least two weaknesses.  Let us say a scheme is to be carried out in order to provide an accommodation road.  There may be six people interested, but for some reason one or two may not sign; they may not wish the work to be carried out.  That is a great weakness and something should be done to overcome it.  As regards those who will not put up the money, it is not that they will not use the road or benefit by the scheme, but they may not be friendly with neighbours.  That has often been found.  The other weakness is this, that in many very poor districts those who require a road or drainage may not be able to put up the money.  It would be well if some provision could be made so that they could give a guarantee that they would give employment to the extent of the money they are supposed to put up, in other words, that they would do the work and when they were being paid, that so much would be retained until the amount they were supposed to subscribe would be fully met.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> In connection with minor employment schemes, we have experienced great difficulty from the fact that certain very necessary works in some electoral areas cannot be carried out because there is not a sufficient number of unemployed registered in that area.  I think that Deputy Hogan referred to this matter also.  In one electoral area where, as I say, very necessary work was awaiting attention you would have perhaps only six unemployed, whereas in an adjoining electoral area there would be a very large number of unemployed.  Yet under existing regulations these men cannot be brought to carry out this very necessary work in the neighbouring electoral area.  I think that in such cases there should be a greater attempt at co-ordination by joining certain areas so that schemes of that character could be carried out.</P>
    <P>In connection with field drainage, some Deputies seem to think that £4 per acre is too much to expect from any farmer as a contribution.  I understand that under that scheme the Government proposes to pay £12 for every £4 contributed by the farmer. Under such conditions, a farmer who gets a field drained for £4 per acre gets a very good bargain.  We have only to cast our minds back 20, 30 or 40 years ago to recall when our farmers had to drain their land, make their roads, and do all their work without getting any grants or payments of this kind.  Now it seems that they have been so spoon-fed that some of them will not even take the trouble to dig a sod out of a little stream on their own land.  They want the Government to do it.  I believe that it would be a good thing if we could get our people to realise that they must rely more on themselves and not be looking to the Government for everything.  While it is well to improve our roads, to drain our land and make country life bright and happy, and while it should be the function of the Government to give all the support possible, the people should be taught to help themselves so far as they possibly can.</P>

      <P>I am interested in trying to get alternative employment for people from County Dublin who were <Col N="2198" /> discharged from the fuel dumps in the Park and who were also sacked from Collinstown Aerodrome.  A number of these men have been with me day after day seeking employment and I am very anxious that the Parliamentary Secretary would do something for them.  In the course of the debate on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance told me that if I could get 500 unemployed men for him he would be very grateful.  I put down a question about a week after that and told him that I could get that number for him. As usual, that question was hedged and, like so many other proposals of the inter-Party Government, it is now in abeyance.  I heard Deputy Palmer stating that any scheme on which the unemployed could be set to work would be welcome.  I agree with that, but one suggestion with which I do not agree is that the way in which the work should be carried out is a secondary consideration.  We have an obligation here to the citizens of the country as a whole.  We have a duty to see that the burdens imposed on these people are lightened as much as possible and to make what representations we can to ensure that those who need work will be provided with suitable work.  Although it has been alleged that we have been trying to get jobs for our friends, so long as I am in public life any influence I can exercise, let it be in commercial life or in any other sphere, I shall exercise to see that any man in my constituency will be employed, no matter what his political views are.</P>
      <P>I desire to call attention to another problem facing certain constituents of mine.  It affects a number of people, especially men who are working in a civilian capacity in military barracks: Judging by the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence, the Vote for civilian employment is to be reduced by about £50,000.  I am given to understand that there is a certain number employed in a camp in North County Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Byrne referred to a number of men who had left the North Wall.  Some of those who were employed there are constituents of mine.  I think it is the business of the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the Government carries out some of their big pre-election promises, some of the great miracles which they promised to perform if they got into power.  They should at least do something to obviate the necessity of these people lining up, looking for permits to get out of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to intimate when he is replying if it is his intention to introduce some minor relief schemes to provide employment for people who have been discharged by Fuel Importers Limited from the Park and for those who have been discharged by the authorities controlling Aer Lingus at Collinstown.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about rural improvement schemes and, in that connection again, we have a problem in County Dublin.  I have raised this matter with the previous Parliamentary Secretary and I raise it again now.  The position is that a number of people will agree to get work done in their area under a rural improvements scheme&mdash;let it be drainage, the making of a by-road or a laneway into a house &mdash;but they then find that one or two other people will not agree to the work being done, with the result that people who are anxious to get the work carried out are held up.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to interest himself in that matter with a view to helping these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I am in order in mentioning them, but there are other schemes of drainage work which could be undertaken as minor relief schemes in County Dublin.  I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not his intention to bless County Dublin with the arterial drainage scheme <Col N="2200" /> at the moment, but I suggest that, when it is possible to put these minor relief schemes in operation, he should consider some of the rivers in the north and south county, about which I have already made representations.  If he could get work on these rivers carried out as a minor relief scheme, I should be very grateful.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which we have along the coast, that is, extensive erosion.  I understand that the Government will not accept responsibility in the matter and I realise that it does not arise on this Vote, but I wonder if it would be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to bring the matter in under a minor relief scheme.  A very small expenditure on work from Skerries to Rush and around Donabate and Malahide would prevent a good deal of the erosion which is taking place there.  There are also a number of culs-de-sac and small roads not taken over by the Dublin County Council, and while a number of minor relief schemes are carried out on main roads and administered by the Dublin County Council, I feel that, if these minor relief schemes were applied to some of these laneways, and especially to the prairie tracks made by the Land Commission from time to time, it would be more serviceable.  The widening of main and secondary roads and the taking off of corners, instead of being carried out by means of minor relief schemes and unemployment grants could be done directly through the county council road grant.  Such work would bring about improvement in the condition of many of these laneways.  The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that these people can take advantage of the rural improvement schemes, but the fact is that, in nine cases out of ten, there is always somebody who will object, with the result that the work cannot be carried out.  I admit that these schemes are very good, but I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider switching the minor relief schemes to such laneways and bad roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the field drainage scheme, but I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to confine it to his <Col N="2201" /> own county and County Mayo.  I should like to see the scheme made applicable to certain parts of my constituency. The farm improvements scheme is very good, but the field drainage scheme would, I believe, be very applicable to County Dublin. Although it is regarded as a comparatively dry county, much of the land is under water and has become very sour as a result of its not being drained properly.  May I ask if I am in order, Sir, in referring to piers on this Vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from a rural constituency, I feel it my duty to show my interest in matters arising on this Vote.  All Deputies realise that a very high percentage of the Parliamentary Secretary's duties is connected with the rural parts of the country, and it is noticeable that almost every Deputy from a rural area has made a contribution to the debate.  It is consoling and encouraging to have such a man as Parliamentary Secretary as we have to-day.  He is a man who, I presume, is thoroughly conversant with conditions in the rural areas.  He comes from an area very convenient to mine, where conditions are practically similar, where minor employment and rural employment schemes have been availed of in many instances and where much good has been derived from these schemes.  No matter what I say or how I try to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary my great desire for the carrying out of these schemes in rural areas, I know that his views are identical with mine and that my words are falling on sympathetic ears.  For that reason, I do not propose to force an open door or to spur a willing horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money expended on these schemes pays a very good dividend, and I doubt if there is any money which we vote in this House which can show a greater dividend, because money spent on rural improvement schemes or minor relief schemes tends to increase production and I should like the Parliamentary <Col N="2202" /> Secretary to bear that fact constantly in mind.  The more money we spend on this scheme the more land will be put into production, resulting in a considerable advance in our economy.</P>
    <P>Of the two schemes we have been discussing, the minor employment scheme and the rural improvement scheme, I presume in all constituencies the minor employment scheme is the more popular.  It does not present so many difficulties as the rural improvement scheme.  First of all, there is a full cost grant; secondly, there is no necessity to organise for the purpose of collecting local contributions; and, thirdly, it secures the co-operation and goodwill of the people in the district.</P>
    <P>I have said, and I emphasise, that it is a most popular scheme and in connection with it an immeasurable amount of work has been done but the scheme should be extended and enlarged and more money should be devoted to it.  If we in this House agree to a larger expenditure on this scheme I am sure we will have the co-operation and goodwill of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I know that of old.  I think, however, that his hands are tied by legislation but I am convinced that if he or the Minister for Finance want such legislation amended or repealed to enable further works to be carried out in accordance with the wishes of Deputies, all Deputies will join in amending the legislation.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme has many objectionable features.  First, it requires a certain amount of organisation and local initiative.  Remember, the job of initiation is not very pleasant because, while certain people may be sympathetic and inclined to contribute willingly, another person may be obstinate and cannot be persuaded to contribute. Secondly, there may be people who are unable to pay although they may be quite willing and anxious to provide the service.  There is a further obstacle.  There is such a thing as preference being given in the matter of employment and in the selection of a ganger.  Generally, a ganger on such a scheme is selected from the people who contribute to the scheme.  There is often some jealousy over that, which <Col N="2203" /> gives rise to unsatisfactory results and often to the abandonment of the scheme.  One man may have three sons eligible for employment on the scheme. Another man may have two sons. There again confusion arises.  From that point of view also the scheme is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>To return to the minor employment scheme, you cannot qualify for a scheme unless there is a certain number of registered unemployed in the district. I think 50 is the number. That proviso should be eliminated from the scheme because the figures in connection with unemployment for these schemes are not altogether accurate and do not present a true picture of the employment position in the area.  I rarely hear of a case where money has been returned to the special employment branch when it has been granted to a district.  I have known a few cases where money was given where there were no registered unemployed.  In particular I remember one case.  Prior to the last election, in my own district, a grant was given for a minor employment scheme while in that area there were no registered unemployed at that time.  I assume what the reasons were in that particular case.</P>

In connection with that scheme I might also mention I have been deprived of information which I thought I should get, while an opposing candidate at the election had got the information.  I did not get it.  The whole thing was political.  The man appointed as ganger happened to be secretary of the local Fianna Fáil club and the persons employed on the scheme were also members of the Fianna Fáil club.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the question of the proviso as to the number of registered unemployed in the district.  I do not think it is a real or an honest test or that it is a qualification that should be necessary for one of these grants, because very often men who are not normally labouring men, who normally do not work for hire, may be induced to register.  I know small farmers have been induced quite recently to register at the employment exchanges as unemployed men.  Strictly speaking, these men should not be employed on the schemes and should not be permitted to sign on, for the simple reason that there is sufficient work for them to do on their own land.  It is an abuse.  On the other hand, I know people who could be regarded as unemployed but who <Col N="2205" /> have sufficient pride not to sign on for the dole.</P>
      <P>I think the problem of unemployment is greatly exaggerated.  In particular areas people who would never be classified as labouring men have been canvassed by certain individuals to register at the labour exchange. These are not really labouring men and never have been.  Therefore the figures we get may be regarded as fictitious and unreliable.  In County Roscommon, for instance, while there may be a problem in particular areas, the problem is greatly exaggerated. In North Roscommon when we began to import millions of tons of coal, a large industry was closed down. Remember that was prior to the last election.  When we were sending emissaries all round the world seeking coal, when we hired 60 ships in America to bring us coal, the Arigna mines were closed down, causing unemployment to 500 or 600 men.  Who was responsible for all that?  Surely it was not the present Government?  We were not satisfied in getting in 12,000 tons a week until November, 1947, when we got a promise of 1,000,000 tons and jumped at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I link it with the problem of unemployment, which has been highly exaggerated here.  Unemployment in Roscommon is due, in the main, to the cessation of the work in the coal mines, which has been brought about by the importation of foreign coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change in the administration of the grants from the local to the central authority.  Like Deputy Palmer, I hold that we were never getting an adequate return for the money we were spending on those schemes.  A complete overhaul from the bottom up was needed, from the gangers to the workers, as they have got into a very undesirable groove for some years past, of giving the smallest return possible for the biggest amount of money.  I pay tribute to the work administered by county councils.  In my county particularly, the county <Col N="2206" /> surveyor, deputy surveyor and others did all they possibly could, working under severe difficulties and handicaps. They were overpowered with work on the turf scheme and so on and could not give the supervision necessary. The same applies now, when they are full of work, owing to the recent grants for the relief of unemployment being distributed for work on the roads. These gentlemen are fully occupied and have not got sufficient time to supervise these works, so I welcome the change from the old system.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to waste the time of the House in talking of by-roads and culs-de-sac now.  At a later date, that question will be raised on a motion sponsored by Deputy Commons and myself.</P>
    <P>I know every Deputy who has a grievance regarding conditions of unemployment and other things over which the Parliamentary Secretary has control will have the Parliamentary Secretary's sympathy.  He comes from a rural area and knows where the boot pinches the people there.  I hope that, when he gets time, he will look into these matters.  He is only four months in office and one cannot expect him or the Government to bring down the sun, moon and stars in that time.  We must have a bit of patience, especially in view of the obstruction which occurs, not alone inside the House.  The delaying programme aims at keeping us here until the 1st September, when we could be better engaged in saving hay or doing other productive work.</P>

      <P>I could not let this debate go without mentioning the way it has been conducted by the <Col N="2207" /> Deputies opposite.  This Estimate has been used by them to suggest to the people that there is now serious unemployment, of such a degree as we have not known in recent years.  Each Fianna Fáil Deputy has made his contribution along those lines.  From my own experience and my knowledge of my own constituency, I can say that that suggestion is completely without foundation.  I represent Laoighis-Offaly which, in recent years, has been the home of turf production.  I am glad to see sitting amongst the few Deputies opposite Deputy Gorry from the same constituency.  If there is any constituency that would have been affected by the cessation of turf production, it would have been that constituency. If there was any substance whatsoever in the remarks of Deputy Kissane and other propaganda spokesmen from the benches opposite, we would expect to find in Laoighis-Offaly hundreds of unemployed lining up in the towns clamouring for work.  I attend my constituency pretty regularly and have gone through the areas of Offaly from which turf has been produced in abundance in recent years and I find no evidence of any unemployment. I have taken the trouble of inquiring from official sources as to whether there is any return from either Laoighis or Offaly of unemployment and I can find no such return.  I know that down in the Brosna, in the heart of the turf area, a great national scheme has been commenced which requires 500, possibly 1,000, men, who cannot be got.  The entire number obtained to date is 126, from this home of turf production in Offaly.  What is the sense in Deputy Kissane and others talking sheer nonsense and suggesting there is unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from the Parliamentary Secretary, and it will be stated here and has been stated on a number of occasions, that 500 men are required there and only 126 have been obtained.  I do not know what information Deputy Kissane has about unemployment in North Kerry, but if he has any I am sure he will be willing <Col N="2208" /> to give it to the House, instead of making general statements about appalling unemployment.  The figures for unemployment are not available yet, but I am certain that we will find no difference in them as between this year and last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not talk nonsense.  The test of such a suggestion is to find where men are willing to work.  If unemployment is causing hardship, any man so unemployed would be very anxious to obtain employment of a lucrative nature.  The fact is that, right down through the turf areas, farmers are clamouring for labour and cannot find workmen to work the land for them.  There is the Brosna scheme which is in danger of being held up because labour cannot be found.  In the face of such facts the Deputies opposite must be very hard pressed for a bit of propaganda when they suggest and try to create in their own minds the belief, that the figures in regard to unemployment have reached astronomical proportions. There is no foundation whatever for that suggestion.  I regret very much that this debate has been used for such a purpose by the Deputies opposite.  Of course, it is only part of the very unnational campaign which they have been conducting since February last.  They now find themselves in a political wildernesss and are going around prepared to hit at anything, much like a boxer suffering from the effects of a very bad blow.</P>

      <P>I think that if I were to reply to all the suggestions <Col N="2209" /> made in that regard on the Estimate I would have to repeat it 15 times, but in deference to the Chair I will leave it. I also listened to certain remarks made by Deputy Kissane when he was dealing with the rural improvements scheme.  His suggestion was that a contribution of 25 per cent. to the cost from the people intended to benefit under the scheme would place too much of a burden on them, and that it should be changed.  It may not be popular and perhaps not good, politically, to say that the sooner we in this country get back to that spirit of self-help and of self-reliance mentioned by Deputy Palmer the better it will be for the people.  In the past, there was too much of a tendency, in connection with all these schemes, to dole out work and charity to the people.  By that policy we have taken away from them that spirit of self-reliance which, in the past, made the Irish farmer respected throughout Europe.  The contribution asked for under this scheme is a necessary one.  Where a scheme is carried out, it confers a benefit on the particular area selected.  Why, therefore, should any Deputy suggest that the entire cost of it should fall on taxpayers living perhaps hundreds of miles away from that area?  I wonder would Deputy Kissane like to suggest to the people in a particular area in his constituency that, by way of contribution, they should pay for work done in an area that was 40 or 50 miles away from them?</P>

      <P>I also heard, I think, Deputy Kitt, and perhaps other Deputies, refer to contributions expected from county councils in respect of grants made to them in connection with the provision of alternative <Col N="2210" /> employment, following the cessation of hand-won turf production. Again, the suggestion was made that these grants should not be dependent on a contribution from the county councils.  Under the county council hand-won turf schemes, the money to pay the labour employed on them came from the county councils.  As regards taxation, it does not seem to matter a lot whether it is raised from the rates or is part of the national revenue, or whether the entire contribution is going to fall as a national charge or is to come in part from the rates; but where a benefit is being conferred on a particular county, where there is to be alleviation of possible unemployment, it seems to me only fair and reasonable that the people there should, in some way, contribute to the cost of such alleviation, and not the people in Dublin or in other cities or in other counties, because the latter derive no benefit whatever from the alleviation that is given in a particular county.  It seems to me, therefore, that in the case of these schemes a contribution is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter, the field drainage scheme, which is covered by the Estimate.  I certainly commend the Parliamentary Secretary on this scheme, and I think it is an excellent one.  It is one of the best schemes of this type that has been put forward in the country for a number of years.  I would like to impress upon him the necessity for extending it to other counties affected by drainage.  If I describe Laoighis-Offaly as the home of turf production, I think I can also describe it as the home of water.  There are no two counties more affected by drainage and flooding, or with more idle land due to the lack of drainage, than these two.  I hope this scheme will be extended so as to alleviate the problem of flooding and field drainage in Laoighis-Offaly as soon as possible.  I think that the charge made in connection with it is not unreasonable.  I know that in Offaly, and in parts of Laoighis, there are many farmers who would be willing to pay far more than is being asked if they had the assurance that their idle land, due to flooding, was going to be restored to a condition of <Col N="2211" /> fertility.  That, however, is a matter on which I certainly would accept the views of the Parliamentary Secretary. I do want to impress on him the necessity of extending this scheme to other counties, and particularly to Laoighis-Offaly.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say on the Estimate except to join with the other Deputies who referred to one of the defects in the special employment schemes, namely, the fact that labour cannot be moved from one electoral area to another.  I think that is a defect and I certainly would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that where work which is urgent and necessary in one area is found to exist, the fact that there are not the necessary number of registered unemployed there should not prevent an employment scheme from being commenced in that area.</P>

      <P>The importance of the Board of Works as a branch of a Government Department has for the past 16 years been brought nearer to the every-day life of the people in rural Ireland than it was at any previous time.  It was not easy to educate the people to that point of view, that the Board of Works was a body that would take their grievances and hardships into consideration.  Certainly, as it was formed and manned at one time, it is easy to understand why they should hold a very black view of it.  One of the first schemes introduced here by the late Deputy Hugo Flinn, go ndéanaidh Dia trocaire air, was the minor relief scheme.  I am sure that he had a very difficult task in impressing upon the Department of Finance the necessity for making sufficient money available. From my knowledge and from what I have heard of that particular Department&mdash;I suppose it is as well they are in certain cases so strait-laced&mdash;I believe there was nothing short of moans and gasps when they heard of a scheme like that being put into operation.  As time went on, and when the bog development scheme, the rural improvements scheme and the farms improvements scheme were put into operation, I can very well understand the feelings of the officials in <Col N="2212" /> that Department.  But, nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretaries who occupied the post during the term of office of Fianna Fáil insisted, for the greater part, that their policy and intentions should be given effect to.  I hope and believe that the present occupant of the chair is also well intentioned, but he has his obstacles to contend with.  I am saying this by way of advice and encouragement to him, not to be discouraged at first, but to keep on insisting and to get the money which is very badly needed for two things.  One is to get very much-needed facilities for the farming community of the country, and the other is to relieve the unemployment problem that existed, that still exists, and that will exist, unless some very big steps forward are taken.  One thing which I dislike in this Vote&mdash;I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me that it is the Estimate of his predecessor&mdash; is that as far as unemployment is concerned, it is not a much larger Vote. It is, of course, the Estimate of his predecessor, but things have changed considerably since that Estimate was prepared. I would not be allowed, of course, to dwell at any length on the abandonment of the hand-won turf scheme, but I do think that I am quite relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's position has been made an impossible and intolerable one at the present time because of the policy of retrenchment enshrined in the recent Budget.  Not merely is there more unemployment&mdash;and I want this to sink into the people who represent labour and the people who claim to be interested in the small farmer&mdash;but there is a big reduction in the weekly income of the rural workers, the manual labourers of the West of Ireland as a result of the abandonment of that scheme. <Col N="2213" /> Other schemes have been spoken of as a means of finding alternative employment. I know a family in the West of Ireland where two young men brought in an average for seven months of the year of £11 a week.  Even if they are fortunate enough to get employment on these schemes to-day, what amount will they bring in per week? They will bring in just half that amount.  It might be all right to say that they are lucky enough to find employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not giving any heed to interruptions and I am going ahead with my speech, but I might give a few broadsides before I am finished. It is just like a death in the family. The day of the death, the day of the corpse house, the night of the wake and the day of the funeral, the loss is only felt as a sentimental one, but it is when all the friends are gone away and the people have to undertake the duties that the one who has departed was helping them to undertake, that the material loss is added to the sentimental loss and it is then that the grief is somewhat deeper.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about lowering taxation and the necessity for lowering taxation.  I do not stand for the lowering of taxation if it means increasing unemployment.  In the case of those people who have had their incomes reduced, when the suit of clothes that they have and were capable of buying and paying for cash down on the counter as a result of the much-abused Fianna Fáil scheme is becoming a bit threadbare, will they find that the draper is agreeable to give them a similar suit of clothes for half the price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2214" /> By three weeks' labour last year they were capable of earning £16 10s. 0d. which would dress them from head to heel with a suit of clothes, underwear, stockings, boots and shoes, but it would take six weeks of their time this year. That is something which people should try to understand, because that is the position to-day.  It is all right for well-to-do farmers to say: &ldquo;We are glad that this thing has come about, because we now can get a man for 7/- a day for the few weeks we want him, while we had to pay him 15/- a day last year for the same type of work.&rdquo;  That is the position the Parliamentary Secretary is presented with and that is the problem he has to solve.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about inflation. The cardinal virtues of the inter-Party Government seem to be retrenchment, economy, hard work, and deflation. From whom is the hard work going to come?  The people who have always worked hard in this country are the small farmers and those who are termed&mdash;it is not a proper or appropriate term&mdash;the unskilled labourers. They are the people who are the first to be hit under the cardinal virtues expounded and being operated here by the inter-Party Government.  If there was to be retrenchment and economy the Government could have gone somewhat higher up the ladder and not start, as they have done, at the lower rung.  I want to tell the expert financiers and all the other people who talk so glibly about inflation that my experience is that the small farmers and the workers were always pretty comfortable and pretty well to do in periods of inflation.  When we had periods of deflation, they were the sections of the community that were the first to meet the adverse wind.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I wish to say, however, that the £20,000 allocated to the Galway County Council, plus the £6,000 put up by the county council to supplement that, is very inadequate compensation for the £116,000 per year paid to employees of the county council under the turf scheme for the past six years.  Rural improvement schemes and minor relief schemes have been held up for a considerable length of time in County Galway.  That is not the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary or of his predecessor. I can place the blame, if on anyone, on the Galway county manager. I understand that he intimated to the Department of Local Government and also to the Office of Public Works that he required all his engineering staff for county council work and that, consequently, he would not permit them to undertake the supervision of rural improvements or minor relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I got a hint of that, I took it up at a meeting of the Galway County Council.  I should like to pay tribute to the engineering staff of that county council for the manner in which they carried out these schemes on which they did exceptionally fine work.  When I took the matter up with the county manager he said that, with all they had to attend to, the engineering staff could not devote their time to these schemes.  As I have stated previously, something else occurred in the meantime.  It was notified to the county council and to the county manager that the county council would no longer be responsible for the production or the supervision of the production of hand-won turf. When that came to my notice, I wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor protesting at any change being made.  I pointed out that, as the engineering staff were being relieved of the supervision of the hand-won turf production, they could very easily supervise the rural improvements and the minor relief schemes as heretofore. I am sure my letter is on the files of the Department.  I got a reply from the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Grady, that the matter was being considered between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government and a subsequent one to say that they could not see their way to agree to my suggestion.  As a consequence I understand that the Office of Public Works are organising their own staff.  I have no fault to find with that.  I am pleased to know that they are opening an office in Galway.  In that way, I believe the staff can be very beneficially employed in many ways and that they can get a better knowledge of schemes than they otherwise would have if they were confined to their office in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin.  There are many obstacles which they can iron out because of the fact that they have an office there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in County Galway are not inclined to be over-anxious to get a big scoop of everything that is going.  We like and we intend to put up reasonable proposals to the Board of Works regarding roads of public utility.  We <Col N="2217" /> are putting up these proposals as a result of a statement which was made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I admit that it was a qualified statement. The scheme was there already. It was there always if we had only gone to the trouble of availing of it. The Parliamentary Secretary knows our difficulty in that respect quite well. Heretofore we put up motions to have certain roads of public utility put into repair and maintained by the county council.  The county council was quite willing to put up the money.  In recent times, however, we have met with a very definite objection from the county manager and the county surveyor to the effect that unless the road carries a 25-foot width between the fences it cannot be scheduled a county road. The Act of 1925 states&mdash;and it was pointed out to me in a reply here by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that money can be expended by a local authority on a road 11 feet wide.  I want to know when the new regulation was introduced in the Department of Local Government whereby they now insist that unless a road is 25 feet wide they will not sanction its being scheduled as a county road.  We know the formalities that have to be gone through in order to have a road scheduled a county road.</P>
    <P>When we held a meeting recently to decide on a special meeting for the submission of works of the kind I have mentioned, the county manager stated that he would get in touch with the Minister for Local Government to see if any solution to the problem could be found.  A number of the members of the county council held that if a road was 18 feet wide, or even 15 feet wide in some cases, and if it was benefiting a large section of the public, we should be permitted to expend the money, and that, in addition, it should be scheduled as a county road for maintenance later. I was sent a copy of a letter which was sent by the county manager to the Minister for Local Government.  I presume I was sent it because I proposed the calling of the special meeting. No doubt a copy was also sent to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to know, when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, if any <Col N="2218" /> decision has been reached on that matter yet.  It is very important, as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The matter of field drainage was mentioned by a number of Deputies.  I always believe in giving credit where credit is due and in commending a scheme to the people if I believe it is a good scheme.  The best way to commend a scheme is by setting example. I myself am availing of that scheme. I believe it is a very useful scheme.  An are which I should like to see revived in this country is the art of field drainage. That art, in the main, has been lost in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and everybody who is in a position to avail of it.  I have only two faults to find with it&mdash;not in so far as it applies to myself, because the more elaborate it is the better I like it&mdash;but because I believe it is somewhat too elaborate.  I know very well it follows the system outlined in the Department of Agriculture.  I think, however, that the French type drains, nine yards apart, are a good deal too near.  If they were double that distance from each other, in two or three years they would be just as beneficial to the land as they would be if they were nine yards apart.</P>
      <P>There are two other things I wish to mention in regard to the scheme.  First of all, I consider that £4 per acre is quite reasonable, because I know that it takes perhaps eight times £4 or ten times £4 to carry out the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a number of people&mdash;as was mentioned by Deputy Kitt and by other speakers, too &mdash;who, because they have to put down that money, do not feel that they are able to do it.  There should be a proviso in this scheme similar to that in the rural improvements scheme that they will put down the money.  If they are honest people they will get somebody to go guarantor for them.  They <Col N="2219" /> should, anyhow, be given preference on the work just the same as unemployed people.  Those of them who are not able to put up the money should be given equal preference with unemployed people.  The people who are able to put up the money would not spend time on work of that kind because they have too much to do otherwise. If they were given that opportunity it would be reasonable enough.</P>
      <P>I understand that the scheme is intended to give employment to those who are displaced on the bogs.  I should prefer that it would not be enforced in that rigid way.  In fact, I think a resolution was sent from our county council in regard to a number of these schemes&mdash;both in regard to this one and in regard to the maintenance of rivers and so on&mdash;whereby the Department of Local Government and the Board of Works were requested not to adhere rigidly to the engagement of people who are unemployed as a result of the abandonment of the hand-won turf scheme.  However, if there is no other way out then by all means adhere to it rigidly.  At the moment it is not being adhered to rigidly and because of that some cause for complaint can be found.  People other than those who were employed on bogs in 1947 are being employed.  I have no fault to find with that to a certain extent but it does seem unfair that two members of the same family should be in employment under this scheme while another family, equally deserving of employment, are ignored.  If a member from every family got work there would be no fault to find with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the unemployment register.  It was said that the register was wrong in principle.  I advise the Parliamentary Secretary to adhere to the unemployment register. If he does not do that he will make endless difficulty for himself and create for himself a problem to which he will find no easy solution.  Reference was made to the fact that people are too proud to register as unemployed. If they are too proud to register I hold that, when they are out of employment or sick, they should get no benefit.  I can see nothing wrong in <Col N="2220" /> having to register.  I think it is a good thing that the people have that facility. If a man has to register as unemployed that is no reason why he should feel compelled to bow his head in shame. If the work is not available for him then there is an obligation on the State to make provision for him in the same way as the State provides for those who are ill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nauseating, after four months of government, to listen to the politics preached here.  An important scheme like this should get more attention from the Deputies. A greater effort should be made, especially by the Deputies who represent the rural areas, to bring this scheme to fruition.  To-day we had a political diatribe from Deputy Kissane. I would have expected better than that from Deputy Kissane.  He told us about the promises that were made; he told us about the unemployment problem we were allegedly supposed to solve with the touch of a magic wand and, by its solution, stem the tide of emigration from the rural areas overnight.  Is it not preposterous that valuable time should be wasted like that?  The present Government has done much in its short time in office.  A definite undertaking was given that if we were elected the taxpayers' money would be handled in a more careful and judicious fashion. We have reduced taxation by £6,000,000.  No one except perhaps an inmate of some lunatic asylum, would promise from a public platform to solve immediately the unemployment problem and stem the tide of emigration. But that is the type of debate to which we have to listen here while important economic problems with a direct bearing on the life of our people are ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the rural improvement scheme is a magnificent scheme.  If this scheme came about because of the initiative of the Fianna Fáil Administration, then all credit to them for their work.  This scheme has been one of the most beneficial in improving the amenities of the rural population. That improvement has in turn brought about an increase in productivity.  A greater expedition and a more intensive <Col N="2221" /> effort are perhaps called for. More could be done than is being done at present.  Some of us receive too many of these blue cards.  Possibly the number of applicants is disproportionate to the amount of money available. Possibly the Office of Public Works is not sufficiently well staffed to cope with all the applications.  I am sure that if all the staffs of all the Government Departments were turned over on this work, all the applications would still not be covered.  The scheme to which this blue card relates that I hold now was recognised over a year ago.  There is another scheme in which I am interested myself.  We are still waiting.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite these schemes.  We certainly can congratulate ourselves on the improvements that have been made in the roads and boreens throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in the Seanad on a former occasion and the Minister invited me then to drop into the Board of Works and point out the snags. If a number of persons gather together they can jointly send in their forms, pay their proportion, and in time the scheme will operate.  But, take the case of one unfortunate man who has a long, twisty boreen which forms the only approach to his tillage.  He has no tractor, no modern machinery of any description.  That unfortunate man, with his young family, is stuck in there a quarter of a mile.  He has to bring his wheat and oats a long distance to have them threshed.  That individual does not come under this scheme.  He may come under another scheme initiated by the Department of Agriculture.  The rural improvements scheme, where it applies to two or more people, is worked in this way: they pay their contribution of 25 per cent. and after that the work is done by the county council.  Where only one man is concerned, he sends the form to the Department and it is he who must do the work.  He may not have a family to help him and he is not, perhaps, in an economic position to employ labour.  He has to leave his garden or his meadow and concentrate on the other job.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2222" /> will see his way to take that particular snag out of this excellent scheme and make it a more attractive one for the whole rural community.  Look at the advantages.  You can increase production and by doing so you reduce the cost of production, and in that way you help to reduce the cost of living.  You will change the whole outlook of rural life and make it much more attractive. When I drive out from my own place in the afternoon I can see the lovely avenues and roads which have been constructed under this scheme.  It makes all the difference between a life of hardship and a pleasant existence.</P>
    <P>I understood one Deputy to say this scheme has been dropped.  That feeling is abroad.  Within the past month I was asked several times if the rural improvements scheme has been dropped since the inter-Party Government got into power.  I said I did not think it was and that I believed the Government were trying to check up on the number of applicants.  I understand that 22,000 have already made application. I think this matter ought to get publicity here because that will put at ease the minds of many people in the rural areas who are anxious to take advantage of this excellent scheme.  I do not believe it has been dropped; it may have been slowed up owing to the elections and the considerable number of applicants.</P>
    <P>There is then this matter of giving grants, not so much for essential reproductive works as to relieve unemployment. I know that you must have a certain number of unemployed in an area before a scheme can be undertaken.  I know areas where you could do partial drainage work&mdash;incidentally a work of great help to lowlying land, into which run mountain streams&mdash;but the incidence of unemployment in such areas does not warrant the doing of such work.  Consequently, the farmers in the valleys into which pour the mountain streams are precluded from a scheme because the incidence of unemployment in the area would not warrant it.  Employment may be given in an area where, perhaps, there is not such urgency and purely for the sake of keeping men at some work, whereas in areas not far removed you will find very essential <Col N="2223" /> work on land running through one, two or more parishes, and yet, because of this qualification, it cannot be undertaken.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the points that occur to me.  Some of these schemes brought about a new outlook, a cheerful atmosphere and changed rural amenities.  I hope my words may intensify the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary and all others concerned and that there will be a greater and more united effort to encourage and expedite these schemes and, if possible, to reduce the cost.  The contribution is a bit high.  Some of these people have poor land, low valuations and boggy soil from which they get a meagre existence.  When they are asked to contribute £5 or £6 out of a small income, it is very hard on them.  If there could be a reduction for such classes of people it would encourage them.  By encouraging them and expediting those schemes you will help to stem in some measure the tide of emigration, you will make country life more tolerable, the land more productive and you will be doing valuable work for the whole community.</P>

      <P>I feel the time has arrived when someone should make a protest about the attendance of Deputies here.  Deputies are elected to the Dáil to do a particular work.  This is a deliberative Assembly.  We are here to hear criticisms and constructive suggestions.  What is said in the House ought to have some effect on the decisions that are subsequently taken.  In this particular debate to-day the attendance has varied around the quorum of 20 members.  That is wrong and there ought to be a much better attendance of Deputies.  We are sent here to deliberate and hear the views expressed by one another and it is our duty to arrive at a proper decision. Can we do that when only 20 out of a total membership of 147 attend to hear the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not one Minister in the House at the moment and there is not one Front Bench member of the Opposition Party here at the moment, either.  I make this protest deliberately because this parliamentary institution <Col N="2224" /> will fall into disrepute if the members of the Dáil do not treat it with respect.  Early this evening I drew attention to the fact that there was no quorum in the House.  Not so very long ago I again counted the members and there was no quorum.  I realise that about this time, between five and six o'clock, Deputies go to their tea.

I agree with the compliments that have been paid to the Parliamentary Secretary and I wish him well in the task he has to perform.  The matter to which I wish to direct attention has also been the subject of correspondence between me and the Parliamentary Secretary and a question was asked in reference to it by Deputy Childers.  I refer to the Breensfort river near Athlone. A fortnight ago I was asked by the local people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that because I should be sorry to slip up on that point.  I went down there and I was accompanied by a number of local people who are very badly affected by the conditions.  They are all anxious that the scheme should be carried out. Unfortunately, there is one nigger in the woodpile&mdash;an old lady over 80 years of age, the owner of a mill.  This lady will not consent to joining in the scheme and she has held up the whole work.  The result is that there are some thousands of acres under water. Her reason for not joining in the scheme is that it will affect the millrace. There is a mill there; I saw it, but there is no roof on the mill and there is no machinery in it.  The mill has not worked for 60 years.  In fact, not in the recollection of the oldest man to whom I spoke, has that mill been used as a mill.  Nevertheless, hundreds of farmers and thousands of acres are being affected because that lady says she will not consent to the scheme.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to let me know what difficulties are in the way of this work being carried out. The Parliamentary Secretary says he cannot do it because she will not join him.  What I want the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to indicate to me what is the statutory difficulty that is in his way.  I shall not advocate legislation, as I am not entitled to do so on this Vote, but if he indicates to me the statutory difficulty that is in his way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You cannot acquire the mill.  She must have statutory protection, and if the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2226" /> will be so good as to indicate to me what it is I shall certainly have the matter looked up to see if it will be possible to have a Bill introduced, even a Private Member's Bill, that will give to that very big area near Athlone the drainage which the people there badly need.</P>
      <P>A question was asked in this House recently with regard to the workers disemployed here in Dublin, workers who had been engaged on the turf schemes, and the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that there were difficulties in the way of provision of employment by him.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate in his reply whether he has been able to overcome, or can overcome within a reasonable period, these difficulties, or whether he can provide employment for those people in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>This debate has proceeded on the lines&mdash;so far as Deputy Childers was concerned it went that way anyhow&mdash; of a debate on the provision of employment in a general way.  I take it that is not correct.  I take it that these criticisms that Deputy Childers made about the Clann na Poblachta Party and Clann na Talmhan Party were not, in fact, in order in this debate.  Consequently I cannot take this opportunity to reply to criticism that was as unfounded as it was unfair.  However, I shall get an opportunity of dealing with it on another occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheridan" hpid="Mr. M. Sheridan Mr. M. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few aspects of this Vote which I should like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The first point has reference to small drainage schemes.  I think it must be evident to the engineers of the Board of Works or the Office of Public Works that these small drainage schemes cannot be carried out during the winter. It has always been a puzzle to me why these schemes are not carried out to a greater extent during the summer months.  Surely, it must be evident to engineers that there is a need for these schemes.  Surely it must be within the competence of the engineers of the Board of Works to devise a scheme for having these small drainage schemes carried out during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> It can be advanced that it will be difficult to get the necessary labour.  I do not agree with that.  In the rural areas there will always be sufficient labour to carry out these works, and the advantages, particularly in the case of these small drainage schemes, would be great.  I can be told that the big thing is to get the major drainage scheme carried out first.  I agree that is very important, but, until the major drainage scheme comes into operation and until it is possible to see the advantages which may accrue, as they are bound to accrue, from that scheme, it is very desirable that these small schemes should be carried out to a greater extent and, if possible, during the summer months.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rural improvements scheme, a contribution of 25 per cent. is expected from those who will benefit by such a scheme.  I should like to add my voice to those of other Deputies who have spoken on this matter and to say that I think that contribution too high.  Most of the small farmers are not in a position financially to make that 25 per cent. contribution, and I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works could see their way to reduce it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about unemployment and said there was no unemployment in his constituency.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I pass through a small town in my constituency every week and I see there some hundreds of men lining up on that day to register at the Garda barracks. Surely, if there was no unemployment, there would be no necessity for these men to register as unemployed.</P>

I think that the ideas of <Col N="2228" /> Deputy O'Higgins are a little fallacious in that regard, because there is unemployment in certain areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last Deputy who spoke with regard to small drainage schemes.  These should be started in the summer, and not the winter months, and many of these schemes which would give a fair amount of employment should be tackled immediately.  There is no need to wait for the big drainage scheme. I am satisfied that this debate has been of a very low calibre, in which a very poor spirit has been displayed. The Opposition did not play their cards well at all.  There was too much of the cringing and crawling spirit and it is no wonder that the people are always looking for State assistance. There is never any effort made to raise these debates above that level or to get the people to fend for themselves. I always regarded this nation as a brave little country in which every man would try to get on as best he could, but, judging by what Deputies, and chiefly those Deputies from western counties, said, everybody is depending on the State for a living.  If that is the position, it is not worth bothering about the country at all.</P>
      <P>With regard to unemployment, I am satisfied that there is very little unemployment in my county and I say to Deputies from the West that, if they have plenty of men in the West, they should send them to Royal Meath where they will get good work at good wages.  They used to come in the past and I hope they will come in the future, because there is plenty of work for them there and the farmers will pay them a living wage.  There is not so great a problem of unemployment as would seem to exist from the speeches of some Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear about the abandonment of the turf scheme.  Why would we not abandon it?  There was no use in robbing the State.  What return were we getting?  Look at what is up in the Park&mdash;a heap of junk.  Do Deputies want more of that?  I do not.  There are plenty of bogs in the country, and if people want to work on them, let them work on them.  There is plenty of room for private enterprise, and if <Col N="2229" /> there are any men unemployed, it is their own fault.  They can walk in on a bog, cut their turf, spread it and dry it, and sell it.  There is a market for it and let them avail of it.  There is no use in their always depending on the State.  There is no group of men who cannot go into a bog in Meath, Westmeath or Kildare and earn good money.  The market is there for the turf, and in the area I come from there is not a farmer who will not buy ten or 15 horseloads of turf from any of these people.  It is a good job for all of us that the State did close down on the turf scheme so that people might fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is much good work which the Parliamentary Secretary could do in connection with the draining of these bogs.  Many of the bogs were not drained properly and they should be attended to at an early date.  Such work will give a great deal of employment, and if there is such a thing as unemployment in these counties, the drainage of these bogs would be of immense benefit.  It is my belief that there will always be unemployed, even at the best of times.  There are two types of unemployed&mdash;those who do not want to work and those who do.  There is a vast number of men who are work-shy and who do not want to work at manual labour.  They want to get into some State job, because it is always easier than working for a farmer. There are many farmers looking for men and unable to get them, while in the locality are idle hefty men who will not work for them.  There is plenty of agricultural work in the country&mdash; plenty of work on rural schemes of all types, if the people will work on them, but if there is any sort of State scheme being undertaken you have hundreds and hundreds of men pedalling eight and ten miles to get a job on it, while if a farmer asks them to go out and clean a drain on his land, they will not do it.  It is time Fianna Fáil came to realise their responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would arise on this Vote, because men are registering for unemployment benefit who are employed.  Rural improvements schemes are of immense benefit, and there are some schemes I should like to see concentrated on more than others, for instance, in connection with Land Commission roads.  A number of these roads in my county were in a fairly good state of repair eight or ten years ago, when the Land Commission finished their work, but the county council refuses to take them over because they are not now in good repair and a rural improvement scheme should be carried out in relation to these roads so that the county council could take them over.  So far as my county is concerned, the county council is willing to take them over the moment they are put into a state of repair, but no council could be expected to take them over in their present condition.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission say their job is finished.  We should concentrate on putting these roads in proper condition under a rural improvement scheme.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of that. There are some lanes where such a scheme could be carried out but the 25 per cent. contribution is too high and many of the farmers who live along these lanes are not in a position to pay the contribution.  Where such lanes are in bad condition a rural improvement scheme should be carried out at State expense.  There are not many but there are some.  The Parliamentary Secretary has his hands full.  If there will be a busy man in this House it will be he.  There will be endless schemes and endless trouble in working out the schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset it would be proper for me to pay a tribute to the Office of Public Works, particularly that section which, in recent years, has done such excellent work and has supervised such excellent work all over the country.  Speaking for my own constituency, I am satisfied that the work that has been done under the auspices of the special branch dealing with unemployment, under this particular Vote, has been excellent.  I shall not discuss the merits of the small criticisms that have been flung across the House about wasteful expenditure. In any scheme there may be some misfit and things may go a little wrong, When one is dealing with registered unemployed, it must be borne in mind that one man on the register may not be able to give as good a return as another.  A fair percentage of those that are called out from the unemployment register to carry out minor employment schemes, particularly in inclement weather from autumn to spring, are not able to give a full return as compared with able-bodied young men who may be on the same gang.  Consequently, we cannot expect the same return for the same amount of money as if the Parliamentary Secretary or his officials or the ganger had the option to select, say, ten able-bodied men as against ten men in middle life or older men or men who, for one reason or another, were not competent to give a return.  We would be devoting our time much more satisfactorily if we tried to examine the schemes that have been put forward in recent years and that have been supervised so well by the Board of Works from the point of view of seeing how we could improve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm improvements scheme has relieved a great deal of unemployment all over the country at periods of the year when work was slack and it has enabled necessary work to be carried out on farms that could not have been carried out by the farmer.  I dislike very much, and as a farmer I recent it, to hear people saying that the Fianna Fáil Government doled out money and lowered the dignity of the farmer. Will anyone tell me where farmers with slight working capital could find <Col N="2232" /> the money nowadays, as contrasted with 30 to 40 years ago, when wages were a different problem, to employ labour at £3 a week for the purpose of carrying out certain necessary drainage work on the land if the State did not come in through the farms improvements scheme and the rural improvements scheme to subsidise the work?  Certainly the income from the particular farms could not carry it.</P>
    <P>Take a small farm of 30 to 40 acres. There may be two or three able-bodied sons.  The farmer may be an able-bodied man.  The womenfolk are doing their part, milking and looking after the fowl.  The total income of that farm would not be sufficient to allow £30 or £40 to be set aside for necessary work.  The State was perfectly justified in coming in to finance the farm improvements scheme, and anyone who wants to be honest and to speak the truth must admit that all over the country these schemes have been very beneficial and have transformed the countryside.</P>
    <P>We are either hypocrites when we deplore the flight from the land or we are sincere, and if we are sincere we will be glad that some of the amenities enjoyed by people in the town should be brought to the rural community. There are many self-contained units in the rural countryside, away from towns, and the farmers concerned are as perfectly entitled to get money to improve the conditions around the farmstead to make it more tolerable during the winter period when there is a great deal of slush and mud about as are the people in the towns to get drainage and sewerage schemes and cement walks.  I do not grudge the townspeople their amenities, because they have their difficulties too and we are glad to see the towns and cities brightened up, but there should be more give and take and people who are not in a position to criticise rural Ireland might remain silent on the matter or else spend some time in judging the situation fairly.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the farm improvement scheme was advertised again last week.  Time has been lost in recent months because the scheme was not advertised last February or March, <Col N="2233" /> for this reason, that this year during the month of June, for instance, there were permanent workers on farms who could have been usefully employed if work had been certified and sanctioned. They were entitled to get any benefits that would have accrued.</P>
    <P>There is just one criticism I have to offer.  I do think the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to put it to the Government that the time stipulated for the receipt of applications, which is to end on the 19th July, should be extended because there are several farmers who do not get either weekly or daily papers and who will not have seen the advertisement, and who, therefore, will be caught out and will not be able to benefit until after March, 1949.</P>
    <P>On the question of the rural improvements scheme, I join with many Deputies in suggesting that in many cases the 25 per cent. contribution is too high and is a deterrent to having certain useful works carried out.  There should be more elasticity in the scheme. More discretion should be left to the Board of Works.  In connection with, say, bog road schemes, where a number of people join together, I know they can increase the grant, but in general 25 per cent. is too heavy on the number of people.  I know of cases where the amount of work to be done and provided for in the Estimate is costing too much and is too heavy on the few people there.  I have heard that it would be a good thing if a county council, when striking an estimate for the year, arranged that a certain amount of money definitely be collected to subsidise these particular rural schemes; so that, if there were 5 or 10 per cent. from the county council and 15 per cent. from the local people benefiting, in that way you could make several schemes attractive and they would go through.</P>
    <P>The Brosna scheme is a big one and I am delighted that it has started this year in my constituency, in Offaly. Some of the speakers here are speaking in an unreasonable way when they expect even idle bog workers to travel 30 or 40 miles away from their homes and try to get suitable lodgings near a scheme.  They have to provide for <Col N="2234" /> their families at home.  The wages would not enable them to live away from home, provide for their families and have a reasonable amount for pocket money.  It would be necessary to provide hostels or lodgings in the area, in order to get a sufficient number of men.  After the harvest, a certain number of men employed with farmers will be available for a temporary period.  On a big scheme like that, we would like to see greater progress. I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary getting his 500 men, just as in recent years we have had to bring in hundreds of men to Leix-Offaly, which has been referred to by my colleague Deputy O'Higgins as being the home of the turf industry.</P>
    <P>He made one mistake in referring to unemployment there.  He said there was no unemployment there.  I do not agree with him in that, as there definitely are men unemployed in various parts of our constituency, because of the discontinuance of the turf scheme. There has been a certain amount of mishandling of the whole turf situation. I am more concerned with the family turf cutters, the people who get a very important part of their income from the bogs.  I would put it to the city people, that all their assertions about the type of turf delivered here are not well-founded.  I would like the turf industry to be continued as a rural employment.</P>

      <P>Take the Croghan Rhode district of Offaly.  There are idle men living on holdings of four or five acres, but for the last seven or eight years they have been working on the bogs.  These men would not leave the district and could not leave, as they are <Col N="2235" /> married men with families, to go over to Ferbane side to work on the present scheme, under the existing conditions there.  The conditions of employment will have to be brightened before you get men to migrate 20 or 30 miles.  As has been suggested by Bord na Móna, if you can provide week-end transport, to bring idle men from one district to another, getting a group of men together on a Monday morning and getting them back the following week-end, that might be feasible.  I definitely disagree with Deputy O'Higgins, as he emphasised this question too much.  I am glad to say that we have not a very big unemployment problem to deal with in the constituency.  In the bog case, there were as many men from the West of Ireland who got work in the constituency, particularly in Offaly, as native men were employed.  At the present time in Clonsast I suppose it is a 50-50 basis or more to outside men who are working there, and they were all quite welcome to work there as Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Splendid work has been done under the minor improvements scheme in the last 10 years.  In the area I am familiar with, some of these valuable works are falling back into disrepair.  I suggest that, when inspectors are in a district looking up recent applications, it might be no harm for them to look at a nearby scheme and see its present condition and see if it should be earmarked as a suitable scheme for the future.  If a minor scheme were put through some years ago and the work is falling into disrepair, it should be tackled.  I would be perfectly happy to urge upon the people that they should give some local contribution towards that.  We must keep our bog drains and roads in good condition.  Once a bog drain goes into disrepair, it gets into very bad condition in a couple of years, so it needs regular attention.  The bog roads should be kept in good condition also.  I hope that the schemes that have been sent in in recent years will be started. There will be many more suggestions from time to time to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to his officers, as to ways and means of improving these valuable schemes&mdash;the <Col N="2236" /> rural improvements scheme, the farm improvements scheme, the farm buildings scheme when it comes in, and the minor schemes such as we have.</P>

Ghlac Conntae Luimnighe leis an Scéim Feabhsúcháin Tuaithe ó thosach, agus bhí na daoine ar theastaigh uathu tairbhe a bhaint as, sasta an deontas áitiúil a dhíol go fial.  Is beag duine a bhí doicheallach an deóntas a dhíol nuair a thuig siad gurbh é a leas féin teacht isteach sa Scéim comh maith le na gcomharsan.  Dá bhrígh sin, ba mhaith liom go mór go ndéanfaí iarracht ládir chun deire a chur leis an moill a bhaineann le scrúdú na n-iarrataisí agus tosnú ar an obair.</P>
    <P>Dá bhféadfhad an Rúnaí Parlaiminte é sin a dhéanamh, bheadh cuid mhór déanta aige.  Nuair a thosaigh an scéim ar dtús, ní raibh na daoine ró-thoilteanach páirt a bheith acu leis, mar nár thuigeadar chomh maith is bhí sé, ach nuair a fuair na daoine amach chomh luachmhar is bhí an scéim tháinig na hiarrataisí isteach ina mílte; tá na mílte iarrataisí ann agus beidh na mílte iarrataisí eile ann.  Tá súil agam ná fuil aon chuid le baint den scéim seo mar a rinneadh le scéimeanna eile, go dtí go mbeidh gach aon bóithrín agus gach aon phasáiste ar fúd na tíre curtha i gcóir agus i gceart, go mór mhór áiteacha ina bhfuil bóithríní fada le taistil le dul isteach sna tithe.  Go dtí sin caithfear leannacht den scéim seo. Tá súil agam go mbeid airgead le fáil tríd an meastachán seo gach uile bhliain go dtí go mbeidh na bóithríní seo deisighthe agus go mbeidh bóthar ceart ag gach aon fheirmeoir agus go mbeidh na tairbhí céanna acu atá ag muintir na mbailte agus ag na daoine sin atá ina gcónaí taobh leis an mbóthar mór.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focal a rá mar gheall ar na Mion-Scéimeanna Siltin, agus táim ar aon aigne leis an Teachta Mícheál O Síoradáin as Contae an Chábháin sa mhéid a dúirt se mar gheall ar na Mion-Scéimeanna sin.  Tá fhios agam go bhfhuil deacrachtaí ag baint le cuid aca.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> Má bhíonn abha bheag ann ag rith isteach in abhainn mhóir a bhfuil beartaithe ag Bord na nOibreacha Poiblí obair siltin a chur ar siúl ann, ní féidir an abha bheag a dhéanamh faoin scéim seo.  Tá cuid mhór mion-scéimeanna siltin ar cheart tabhairt fúthú sa tsamhradh mar nach féidir iad a dhéanamh sa ngeimhreadh.  Ní ceart iarraidh ar aon fhear oibre dul isteach i nabhainn chun obair siltin a dhéanamh i lár an gheimhridh.  Ba cheart go ndéanfaí sa tsamhradh é.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go n-eireoidh go maith leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte san obair atá idir lámba aige.  Tá a lán déanta cheana féin, tá mhór-chuid oibre deanta ag Bord na nOibreacha Poiblí do mhuintir na tuaithe le cúig bliana déag anuas agus a lán tairbhe fachta as.  Má leanann an Rúnaí Parlaiminte ar an mbóthar atá leagtha amach dó cheana, ní bheidh sé ag dul amú.  Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé ar an mbóthar sin, agus go n-eireoidh nios fearr leis&mdash; más féidir san&mdash;ná leo siúd a tháinig roimhe sa phost sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to say to the House that I very much appreciate the suggestions that have been thrown out by many Deputies here and that I am very grateful to every Deputy who contributed to the debate, because in the office where I am at the moment it is always well that we, the staff and myself, should have suggestions and know what the people in rural Ireland and the people representing rural constituencies think.  As far as I am concerned, as has been stated by many Deputies, it is not very necessary to impress the great necessity for all these schemes on me, because for the few months I have been there the breath of rural Ireland has not left my lungs and no matter what length of time I may be there I assure you that it never will.  In dealing with these schemes I must congratulate one Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, that is Deputy Dan O'Rourke.  When Deputy Dan O'Rourke said: &ldquo;Why blame the Parliamentary Secretary for this Estimate; it is not his, it is our own,&rdquo; Deputy Dan O'Rourke replied to all criticism to this Estimate.  It is not my Estimate.  His advice to me was: &ldquo;It may be necessary for the Parliamentary <Col N="2239" /> Secretary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.&rdquo;  It may be, and it may not, but my own answer to unemployment is that the unemployment situation will be kept under observation during the winter months and if it is found necessary to extend the schemes and to provide more work money will be found for such.  That is the answer to it.  It certainly is regrettable&mdash;I regret it to a certain extent&mdash;that Deputies found it necessary, for political purposes, to use the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that such a thing should have been done.  We always had unemployed in the country and I am afraid we always will, but I can assure Deputies that, as far as we in this Government are concerned, there will be less unemployed each succeeding year.  I hope we shall live to see the day when there will be none. That is the policy of this Government. One can understand that Deputies who have not long been members of the House should mix up the Vote for the Office of Public Works and the Vote for the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Votes 9 and 10, which relate to drainage, public buildings, etc., come under the Office of the Board of Works, while Vote 11 is for the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Vote 11, the Special Employment Schemes Office is responsible for minor employment schemes in the country&mdash;schemes to relieve unemployment. There is no use in a Deputy belonging to any Party saying that those schemes should be carried out here, there or in any other place. They will be carried out where there are registered unemployed.  Neither is there any use in a Deputy saying that <Col N="2240" /> such schemes are more necessary than others.  We take up the schemes which are considered most necessary by our engineers in the areas where there are registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to Deputies that money is expended on those schemes in order to give work to the registered unemployed in a particular area.  Why then do Deputies say that there are unemployed but that they do not register? If they do not, it is their own funeral. It is only when people register that we can know that there are unemployed in an area.  If they fail to register we cannot recognise them as such, and we can not give any works in their area to relieve unemployed there.  Deputy Kissane realises that there are Deputies who know that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what I have said is a reply to nearly every Deputy who spoke on this Estimate.  If the unemployed do not register then they are not unemployed as far as we are concerned. Some people say they are too proud to do it.  If they are we cannot help that. These are the regulations.  I found them there when I went into the Employment Schemes Office.  The director and staff there must live up to those regulations which were made by the previous Government.  They were not made by us.  While on that subject, I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the director and staff of the Employment Schemes Office for the co-operation I have got from them since I went there as well as for the manner in which, both now and always, in my opinion, they have been willing to work for the unemployed as far as the minor employment schemes are concerned.  If a Deputy in any area wants to help, the one thing he must do is to get the people there to register as being unemployed.  I appeal to Deputies, if they have unemployed in their area, to do that, whether it be in Laoighis-Offaly or elsewhere.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Boland from that constituency say that, on coming up here during the week, he saw people lined up outside the labour exchanges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Sheridan who made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but the <Col N="2241" /> statement was made that the Deputy saw people lined up outside the labour exchanges.  In that area we have a scheme in operation for the past six weeks.  On the day we started we wanted 500 workers but up to date we have got only 100.  We have sought, in the labour exchanges within 40 miles of the area, to get men to work on that scheme.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we have the bog development scheme, to which several references were made during the debate. That is a scheme that is carried out with a full-cost grant in an area from which an application comes to us.  If our engineer goes into the area and certifies that, by a road being made into the bog there, it will mean more turf production, or that, by the repair of a road, turf which for many years had to be left in the bog during the winter months, can now be taken out, and that more people can go into the bog and increase turf production, we give a full-cost grant for that bog development scheme.  We do that simply because the making of the new road or the repair of a road is going to lead to greater turf production in that bog.  It sometimes happens, of course, that one of these roads also leads to a village or gives accommodation to people in the village.  If, however, a road is provided it is due to this, that at the end of the village there is a bog on it.  The road is not made simply to lead to the village, but rather for the development of the bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the rural improvements scheme where the State contributes 75 per cent. of the cost.  The people in the area are asked to make a contribution of 25 per cent.  I think it was Deputy Ó Briain who said he was convinced that of all the schemes ever brought forward this one will live in the memory as being due to Deputy Smith when he was Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that he was responsible for it. In view of that, was it not very remarkable to find several Fianna Fáil Deputies saying, in the course of this debate, that the 25 per cent. contribution was too much.  It may be too much or it may not, but that is what is laid down in the regulations that we must carry out.  In fact, there is more <Col N="2242" /> in it than the regulations.  In some cases where we find that the road is a public utility we can give a higher contribution than 75 per cent.  We have given from 80 to 85 per cent. in cases where it has been proved that a road is a public utility.  In other cases we can give a full cost grant.  I shall refer to these later.  These are the cases in which Deputy Corry is very interested.</P>
    <P>Then we have the farm improvements scheme.  Deputies are aware that under it we pay 50 per cent. of the cost of labour.  In addition, we have the much discussed new field drainage scheme under which people are asked for £4 per acre of a contribution.  I would like to deal with these schemes and to defend them because they can be defended.  What I want to point out to the House is that, while we allocate the money for them from our Vote, they are dealt with by the Department of Agriculture.  If any Deputy wants to raise any question about them he is quite welcome to do so, and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, in his own capable way, will answer him.</P>
    <P>However, I must deal for one moment with the field drainage scheme. Judging from the debate on this Estimate, the Fianna Fáil Party has developed into a real splinter Party. You find Deputy Smith condemning the field drainage scheme and saying that it was ridiculous to expect people to pay £4 per acre.  You find Deputy Beegan of the same Party saying that it is a great scheme.  I congratulate him because he has been a shining example of having taken advantage of that scheme.  They tell you that £4 per acre is too much to expect.  In some cases it costs us £20 per acre and even £30 and £40 per acre to leave a man with an acre of land as dry as it is possible to make it.  Conacre may cost small farmers £10 per acre.  For £4 we leave them an acre of land so dry that they can till and sow and reap and mow it.  Then we had Deputy Kitt, representing the same constituency as Deputy Beegan, saying that this scheme is only for landlords.  It is a wonder he did not consult Deputy Beegan and find out if Deputy Beegan is one of the landlord class or not.  Of course he did not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> I regret that politics should enter into the discussion on this matter.  In my opinion, some of these Deputies have not the interest of the schemes at heart, but only how they can score political points.  Statements have been made to score political points.  Some of the Fianna Fáil Party condemned the scheme and some of the supporters of the inter-Party Government condemned it.  Some of the Fiann Fáil Party blessed it and some of the supporters of the inter-Party Government blessed it.  It is a fact that in some places we are establishing our own offices to do our work.  We are doing so because we have got to do so.  I think it was Deputy Killilea who raised the point first and I think Deputy McQuillan agreed with him that the work should be left as it was in the past to the county surveyors and the county engineers in the counties who have always carried it out.  So far as I am concerned, and speaking on behalf of the Office of Public Works, I am grateful to the county engineers and their staffs throughout the country who carried out our schemes in the past. They did it as best they could.  At the moment, however, in some counties, including Deputy Killilea's county and Deputy McQuillan's county, the county managers have notified us that they can no longer continue to carry out these schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. What I meant to convey in my speech &mdash;whether or not I conveyed it to the Parliamentary Secretary I do not know &mdash;was that the selection of men for the carrying out of these rural improvements schemes need not be through the labour exchanges, but that the most suitable men should be picked for the jobs and that that should be in the hands of the county engineers while the schemes are administered by them. I have no objection to their being administered completely in the way proposed under the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Several Deputies objected, however.  Deputy Beegan admitted that he knew during the period of office of the last Administration that it was going to happen in his own County of Galway.  Deputy <Col N="2244" /> Beegan is a good member of a local authority and without doubt he knew that.  Yet Deputy Killilea and Deputy Kitt charged me with taking over the work in the County of Galway and other counties and causing extra expenditure. According to Fianna Fáil, this Government used the axe in every shape and form, are putting people out of work, and doing everything wrong. Yet I am accused of causing extra expenditure by setting up these offices. We are setting them up because the county engineers who had previously carried out the schemes have notified us that they cannot continue to do so any longer.  So far as this Government are concerned, their policy is that, if extra expenditure is needed, then it will be expended when it is efficiently expended, and where economy is necessary and can be effected without causing any hardship to the people of the country, then we will have economy.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Deputy Kitt and Deputy Killilea do they want me not to carry out any rural improvements scheme in Galway this year?  Do they want me not to carry out any minor relief scheme in Galway this year?  Do they want me not to carry out any bog development scheme in Galway this year?  I cannot do it if they are in a position to prevent me from establishing an office there and taking over the work in that county, as I have got to take it over in Roscommon, Clare and Tipperary South, because the officers there say they cannot carry out the work. Other Deputies wished me to take over other counties.  We cannot do that at the moment, because it would mean a complete reorganisation and the recruitment of a huge staff.  But, in the counties where they cannot do our work, we will take them over as quickly as possible and, when the time comes, if we can see our way to do it, we will take over the others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea made a further statement. In the Official Report for 1st July, column 2080, he is reported as stating:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We understand that a new Department is to be established for the carrying out of minor employment schemes.  I do not think that it is <Col N="2245" /> necessary or essential at this particular time.  I know that a statement was made some time ago that county surveyors were already over-burdened with the work they had on hands and that they were not in a position to handle this particular type of work.  That statement was made at a time when the peat industry was in full swing and before the county councils had handed over to Bord na Móna.  Now the position has changed completely.  So far as the Galway County Council is concerned, we are in the position that we have a number of young engineers who are employed in a temporary capacity and who are all under six months' notice, which is due to expire, I think, on the 1st July, and that is to-day.  Unless some further work is made available by the county council for them their employment will cease to exist.  The county surveyor is not over-burdened with work at this particular time, and the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to discuss with the county council engineering staffs and the county managers the question of whether or not they would be in a position to handle any of the extra schemes that would be coming down from the Department.  In that way, we would have no duplication of staffs and money would not be wasted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You are wasting it now, you know. This morning I got into touch with Mr. Lee, the Galway County Surveyor, and asked him about these engineers that he was going to lay off, thinking that there may have been something in what an irresponsible Deputy said. What what his reply?  &ldquo;No such thing. Actually,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am looking for more engineers because I require them to carry out the surveying of the roads in Galway.&rdquo;  That applies to Galway and to every county under the jurisdiction of Dáil Éireann, no matter what Deputies may try to point out.  I suppose it is necessary to use propaganda at any cost.  It was also stated by Deputy Killilea&mdash;I am sure the House will excuse me if I defend myself&mdash;that I took a file down to Galway and used it on a public platform.  Deputy Kissane said that when that statement was <Col N="2246" /> made I did not reply to it and I did not deny it.  I do not like to interrupt. I did not do any such thing.  If I made any reference to anything down in Galway it was to Fianna Fáil policy, because no man knew the technique of Fianna Fáil policy better than I did. I was a member of that organisation until I found out how rotten it was.</P>

      <P>What I wanted to point out in Galway and what I want to point out in Dáil Éireann is that it was their policy to promise people that they were going to do things for them without any intention of ever carrying them out.  When I was only three months in Dáil Éireann Deputy Killilea said to me: &ldquo;You are an awfully foolish man to be running down to the Custom House or over to the Board of Works about roads and drainage. Do what I have done.  It has kept me in Dáil Éireann for 18 years.  Do not do anything for them but keep promising them.  They will always keep after you.  If you do anything for them they will turn away from you.&rdquo; That may be the policy of Fianna Fáil but that is not the policy of the present Administration.</P>

      <P>Another thing for which I am held up is the fact that 400 people were unemployed on account of the closing down of hand-won turf in the Dublin City area.  Deputy Byrne, Deputy Cowan, Deputy P.J. Burke and several other Deputies referred to the matter.  Of course, that hare was raised some three weeks ago by Deputy Lemass in the Dáil.  He put a question down asking me if I was aware that those people were going to lose their work in the Phoenix Park and other places owing to the closing down of the hand-won turf schemes and if I was going to provide alternative work for them on certain schemes.  I can assure the House, if it is necessary for me so to do, that no man in this House has as much sympathy for unemployed men as I have.  I realise what it is.  I wanted to leave it over for a week to see what I could do.  I went straight to the Employment Schemes Office to see what could be done to find work for the 400 men in question.  When I went there what did I find&mdash;a regulation of the previous administration which prevented me from getting work or trying to get work for those unemployed men. That is the reason why Deputy Lemass did not pursue the matter any further. I can quite understand Deputy Peadar Cowan saying that the reply given would not do.  He is a new Deputy and he does not know the difference. Deputy Byrne and Deputy Burke did not understand the difference either. Deputy Lemass, however, did understand it and that is the reason why he did not pursue it.  For the purpose of having it on the Official Records of the House let me quote the regulation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only workers who, in the opinion of the surveyor, are fully capable and suitable for the work in hands are to be employed, and for this purpose the surveyor is to have a free selection of labour from men in receipt of unemployment assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in this city there are roughly 7,000 men receiving unemployment assistance.  According to the regulation not until the unemployment insurance benefit of those other 400 men has been used up can I get them employed.  Still I am held up because I do not find work for those 400 men. <Col N="2248" /> Why?  On account of the regulation of the previous Government.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I know of one special scheme in my own area which would have accommodated at least 25 people, <Col N="2249" /> and which was a most necessary work.  I went on three occasions to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the matter and I was very pleased when I found that it was sanctioned.&rdquo;&mdash;(Dáil debates, column 572, 14th June, 1944.)</P>
    <P>I was then a member of the Opposition. I approached the Parliamentary Secretary on three different occasions. That scheme was sanctioned.  The office was not then used for political purposes. The office is not to-day used for political purposes and, so long as I and the present Government remain in office, it will not be used for political purposes.  All I ask is that Deputies will send their schemes up to us.  Some of them may be turned down, as Deputy McQuillan stated. The reason why they will be turned down is because they will not conform with the rules and regulations governing the scheme.</P>

      <P>We cannot change them for you at the moment.  It is not true that the office is used for political purposes.  Deputy Beirne raised the point that sometimes Deputies are aware of schemes before other representative in their constituency know about them.  When I was in opposition I had that idea too.  I have now discovered that, if there is any leakage, that leakage does not come from the Office of Public Works.  I am sure Deputy Killilea will agree that when I was in opposition I got as many schemes through as he did; perhaps I got more schemes through than he did. Therefore it can hardly be said that the office was used for political purposes. If the schemes sent in to us conform with the regulations the money will be sanctioned for them.</P>

      <P>I have done more in the past four months than Fianna Fáil did in the previous 16 years.  Deputy Childers referred to the fact that £200,000 of our Vote had been taken away from us and given to the county councils.  I think Deputy O'Grady made a similar reference.  That is quite true.  Our Vote is for the relief of unemployment and that money has been devoted to that purpose.  The unemployment problem will be closely watched, and if during the coming winter more money is needed for the relief of unemployment it will be found. Deputy Childers also stated that the farmers were too poor to contribute to rural improvement schemes.  Probably the farmers are too poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain areas. The regulation is that we must find at least 75 per cent.  If a case is made where a higher grant is wanted a higher grant is given.  Where the people contribute 25 per cent. of the cost preference is given to the carrying out of the work and, as a rule, the farmers earn much more than they contribute to the scheme in the long run. Deputy Childers mentioned that some schemes are held up at the moment because they have not been inspected. It is true that they are held up owing to shortage of staff.  It is, however, our intention to rectify that situation as soon as possible and to have all schemes inspected.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when speaking in this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan stated that it was detrimental to have so many different schemes.  I can assure the Deputy that if representations in regard to these schemes are addressed to the wrong section they are promptly transferred to the section to which they should have been addressed in the first instance.  The only reason why any <Col N="2252" /> scheme is ever turned down is because it does not comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan made a very honest contribution to the debate.  He said that Deputies who spoke about the dreadful step of closing down the hand-won turf scheme showed no sincerity. I am surprised at the Fianna Fáil Party's attitude in this matter.  They were in office for 16 years.  They must appreciate what responsibility is.  They must know that turf was an emergency scheme.  Turf does not really come within the admit of my Vote but several references have been made to it during the debate.  Turf was an emergency scheme.  All emergencies cease at some time and hand-won turf could no longer be continued when the emergency ceased.  Deputy Moran told us of the terrible unemployment in Mayo.  We sent down £18,000 to the Mayo County Council and they refused to accept it.  Deputy Moran said it was not enough.  I say it was not a bad start.  They would not accept it and the position, therefore, cannot be as bad in Mayo as some people would have us believe.  If the position is bad then the people there should blame Deputy Moran for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan said that some of our schemes are held up because an individual objects.  I have known of such cases, but the fact is that we have not compulsory powers; we cannot compel anybody.  In some of these schemes there are free grants.  The bog development scheme or the minor employment scheme carries a full cost grant.  In my own area, when I was in opposition here, I came across individuals who objected.  That is regrettable but, not having compulsory powers, we cannot intervene.  Very often you find that these objections are withdrawn and the scheme goes through.  I would not wish that we would get compulsory powers, because it would cause bad blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies raised the point that if we can make full cost grants for roads and bog development schemes, why not a full cost grant for rural improvements schemes.  If we give a full cost grant for bog development schemes the reason is that we have a <Col N="2253" /> guarantee that there will be increased turf production.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke mentioned sports fields and said we should do something for them in our schemes.  We would love to do it, but it is not possible.  As one interested in that type of sport, I would love to do something, but I find that there are many more necessary schemes, such as roads into villages and bogs, and we must attend to them first.  If I were asked to spend money on sports fields I could not help thinking of more necessary works, such as roads into bogs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy Rooney referred to the Ring Common drainage scheme.  That is being investigated as a rural improvements scheme and I believe we may be able to give a 75 per cent. grant in that case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley referred to marine works.  We do such works, but in all cases we get a contribution from the local council.  I am sorry to say, as a Galway man, that the council in Galway is one of those that does not assist this office very much by giving contributions. I realise the necessity for such works.  There is an old saying, and a very true one, that a stitch in time saves nine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane to-day referred to the employment schemes for this year. They are the very same as in previous years, but there is a special scheme for turf.  He also referred to the position in Kerry.  I can assure him that schemes are being prepared for Kerry and as far as we are concerned that area will not be let down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne of Roscommon mentioned that the setting up of our own offices would be very welcome and Deputy O'Higgins indicated that there was no unemployment in his area. Generally speaking, it is in the counties where the greatest turf production was that you would expect to find the most unemployment.  I come from such a county and I cannot find it.  I heard Deputies making statements about that position and I can tell you honestly that they are laughed at.  In the rural areas I cannot find what you may call a terrible lot of unemployment.  I cannot find any at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> Deputy Madden said it was reported in his constituency that the rural improvements scheme was dropped.  It does not surprise me that that was stated in Limerick, considering that in my own town two Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party and a Senator of the Fianna Fáil Party, speaking last Sunday, said that since I went into the Board of Works minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvements schemes were to be dropped.  I do not wonder, in these circumstances, at Deputy Madden's statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Madden that the rural improvements scheme is not being dropped; neither is the minor employment scheme, the bog development scheme, the farm improvements scheme or the new field drainage scheme that has been so much discussed here.  We were told that some schemes were better than others and probably they are.  If the farm improvements scheme is a better scheme it is still there, side by side with the others, and God knows the farmer is a good judge of the best scheme to take. If he takes the field drainage scheme, it is because that is the best.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy said that certain accommodation roads should be inspected every five years and kept under repair.  I am sure the House will realise that if we had to do that we would require a huge staff and even then it would be nearly impossible to carry it out.  The Deputy also said we should look after the cutting of hedges along the roadside.  I agree that such a thing is very necessary, but we have no compulsory powers.  We are not like a local authority; we cannot compel people to do this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan complained about the terrible position he was in.  He said that the man who is responsible for the regulations in the Minor Employment Schemes Office should be in a lunatic asylum.  He complains of the replies he gets that certain works cannot be done.  I think Deputy Commons also had the same complaint to make. The reason is that these works do not come under the regulations.  If Deputy <Col N="2255" /> McQuillan, Deputy Commons or any other Deputy sends communications about schemes in areas where there are not enough registered unemployed, they will get replies indicating that those schemes do not apply.</P>

      <P>Who is to blame for that?  If we do not get them on the register, we cannot do anything for them.  Deputy Kitt made reference to schemes in his area projected for a long time back for which the people had sent on the money and which were not carried out.  If the Deputy gives me particulars of these schemes, I shall look into them and see what can be done.  Deputies raised several matters throughout the debate&mdash;it has been proceeding for three days&mdash;that I may overlook now, but I can assure these Deputies that I shall read over the debates and anything which I can do in reference to the matters which they raised I shall do.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies took me to task in connection with a statement which they alleged I made&mdash;I think it was Deputy Corry introduced the matter&mdash;in reference to link roads.  I stated that for the future where a link road connected two public roads we would give a full-cost grant provided the county council or the local authority of that area maintained the road.  Deputy Killilea, Deputy Kitt and Deputy Beegan referred to this matter.  On the 14th April, Deputy Beegan put down a question addressed to me on the matter and I gave him a reply.  I am surprised that Deputy Corry did not read that reply.  I am sure he did but he pretends that he did not.  I shall quote the reply now:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the existing procedure for the rural improvements scheme, a grant can be made for the repair of any road which connects two county roads, without requiring a contribution from the adjoining landholders, provided that:</P>
      <P>(1)  the link is of sufficient importance as a public road; (2) the cost is not excessive in relation to its utility; (3) the work is not one which the county council would otherwise have done out of their own funds; and (4) the county council, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, undertake to maintain the road on completion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was my reply.  I stated that that would save some county councils money which they had to expend before.  It <Col N="2257" /> probably would but I cannot for the life of me understand how a county council such as Cork should come together and dictate to us the schemes we are to do.  The schemes must come to us from the people concerned themselves and our officers are the people to decide whether or not we are going to give a full cost grant.  Our office, with the consent of the Local Government Department, will ask the county councils to maintain these roads and keep them under contract but we are not going to have county councils deciding for us the roads we are going to do.  Let the people themselves send their schemes to us.  We shall send our engineers on to them.  The matter will come before the officials of our office and they are the people who will decide.</P>
    <P>I have been reading over Deputy Corry's speech in which he said that they have sent up something like £64,000 worth of roads with £56,000 worth more to follow.  He also said&mdash; I hope I do not misquote him&mdash;that these were roads that their council had done and that some of them were roads which they intended to do.  My reply to that is to be found in No. 3 of the answer to the question&mdash;that the work is not one which the county council would otherwise have done out of their own funds.  Deputy Corry said that these were roads they themselves intended to do and he, therefore, disqualified these roads.  I am afraid he will have to take a single ticket back to Cork for these roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I should like to clear this matter up.  The statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary as published in the papers was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sum of £12,000 to £15,000 will be saved to the ratepayers this year in making new roads.  These roads will be made by the Board of Works provided the county council guarantees their maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the statement as published in the Press, made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  How are the ratepayers to be relieved of a road that the county council would not do, according to his regulations?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, I have no doubt inadvertently, conveyed an impression which he did not intend to convey.  He said that, while the office was under the control of Deputy Smith, it was not used for political purposes and that it would not now be so used, leaving a gap in between.  In fairness to the man who held that office, the late Deputy Hugo Flinn, and perhaps to myself, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up the misunderstanding which might be possible.</P>

      <P>Before I proceed with a review of the events of the past year and an explanation of the Estimate before the House, I think it is desirable that I should mention a few important items under the head of Vital Statistics.</P>
      <P>The number of births registered in 1947 was 68,602, which was 680 more than in 1946 and 1,741 more than in 1945.  The birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population was 23.1, compared with 22.9 for 1946 and 22.4 for 1945.  The rates in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales for 1947 were 23.3, 22.0 and 20.5, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of marriages registered during 1947 was 16,300&mdash;a decrease of <Col N="2262" /> 1,225 on the number for 1946 which, however, was the highest recorded since 1878.  The 1947 rate was 5.5 per 1,000 of the population in 1946.  The rates in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England and Wales for 1947 were 7.1, 8.6 and 9.3 respectively.</P>
    <P>The highest marriage rates occur in the cities of Limerick, Cork and Dublin in that order.  Counties Dublin and Tipperary had the highest marriage rates in rural areas.  The lowest marriage rates occurred in Counties Laoighis, Mayo and Limerick.  It should be remembered, of course, that some country weddings are solemnised in the cities and are registered there.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths registered during the year was 44,135 or 2,678 more than in 1946.  The death rate was 14.9 per 1,000 of the population as against 14.0 in 1946, 14.5 in 1945 and 15.3 in 1944.  Deaths from cancer and tuberculosis were among the highest contributing factors.  Provisional figures show that the total number of deaths from cancer was 3,773 or 251 less than in the previous year.  The total number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis is provisionally estimated at 3,634, which shows an increase of 244 over 1946.</P>
    <P>During the year the number of deaths of children under one year registered was 4,597 as against 4,390 in 1946 and 4,739 in 1945.</P>
    <P>Infant mortality has averaged the regrettably high figure of 71.2 per 1,000 live births for the ten years from 1937 to 1946.  The figure for 1947 was 67.  For 1947 the rate was 53 in Northern Ireland, 41 in England and Wales and 56 in Scotland.</P>
    <P>The average rate for the four county boroughs was very much in excess of that for the country as a whole.  The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births decreased in Dublin from 117 in 1944 to 92 in 1946, in Cork from 108 to 61, in Limerick from 123 to 69 and in Waterford from 80 to 66.  These figures are still excessive, however, and effective steps must be taken to bring about a reduction.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis in infants under two years <Col N="2263" /> of age throughout the country as a whole, fell from 1,233 in 1943 to 734 last year while in Dublin County Borough the number fell from 573 in 1943 to 282 last year.  It is not possible at this stage to state, with any real assurance, the cause of this decrease, which might be due to a reduction in the virulence of the disease in the past year.  It is, however, only fair to state that in recent years there has been an intensification of measures to combat the disease, including, in Dublin, a special gastro enteritis section under the control of the corporation and the provision of special hospital facilities at St. Clare's, under the control of the Dublin Board of Assistance.</P>
    <P>During the year 1947 the number of cases of the principal infectious diseases (typhus, typhoid, diphtheria and scarlet fever) notified was 2,697, which represents a continuance of the downward trend in the incidence of these diseases&mdash;in 1943 the number of notifications was 7,269.  Better still, the number of deaths has declined from 400 in 1943 to 77 last year, of which 55 were due to diphtheria, 16 to typhoid and the remaining six to scarlet fever. For the third successive year no case of typhus occurred.</P>
    <P>The number of cases of diphtheria notified was 4,583 in 1943, 5,086 in 1944, 4,177 in 1945, 1991 in 1946, and 851 last year.  This fall must, in large measure, be due to the operation of immunisation schemes.  Facilities for free immunisation are now made available by all health authorities throughout the country and parents should realise the great life-saving gift that is there for the taking.  I regret that, after the great spurt made during the war years, there has been a falling off in the number of immunisations, but I am hopeful that the recent satisfactory settlement with the Medical Association regarding remuneration for this service will bring about a great increase in the number in the current and future years, with a consequent further decline in the incidence of the disease.</P>
    <P>A separate Department of Health was established in an attempt to provide the country with a proper standard of health services.  I would like <Col N="2264" /> at this stage to review briefly the activities of the Department throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1947, was enacted last summer.  Certain of its provisions are not acceptable to the Government and it is intended to introduce legislation at an early date to repeal or amend them.  Section 25, for instance, provides for compulsory medical inspection of children in certain circumstances. Section 26 gives health authorities power to require school managers to provide facilities for school medical inspection.  The remainder of the Act has been brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Much has already been done to provide the services authorised by the Oireachtas under the Act.  Part II of the Act which is a consolidation of the law relating to health institutions will simplify to some extent the procedure in dealing with the provision of new sanatoria and other health institutions.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of discussion on Part III of the Act, which gives health authorities wide powers to provide health services for mothers and children.  While I am satisfied that the main purpose of this Part of the Act should be implemented, I have not made up my mind as to the exact method of providing the mother and child service and am awaiting the outcome of the deliberations of the council which I have recently established to advise me on matters relating to child health.  In the meantime, arrangements have been made to continue existing services under temporary regulations made under Part III of the Act.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Act codifies the law relating to the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases and includes new provisions in relation to infestation.  Regulations have been made under this Part of the Act to replace all the previous regulations dealing with infectious disease.  The Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948, also made under this Part of the Act, provide for the payment of allowances to persons suffering from certain infectious diseases and are of prime importance in the fight to eradicate tuberculosis in <Col N="2265" /> particular.  There can be no doubt that in the case of this disease, lack of means and economic insufficiency have been a major impediment to early diagnosis and effective and lasting cure.  As is the case with most new schemes, difficulties have arisen in the administration of the regulations.  The whole position will be examined in the light of practical experience.</P>
    <P>Under Part IV of the Act, as supplemented by regulations, we shall be in a position also to tackle more satisfactorily the problem of venereal disease. No accurate information has up to the present been available on the incidence of this disease and the readiness of persons suffering from it to undergo treatment.  As an experiment, arrangements have been made whereby a medical practitioner who diagnoses a case of venereal disease will notify the chief medical officer of the county without divulging the name or address of the patient.  Thus a fairly accurate idea of the number of sufferers from this disease coming to the notice of medical practitioners will be obtained. Three months after notification the medical practitioner must indicate to the chief medical officer whether or not the patient has been adequately treated.  This will give some idea as to the willingness of persons to take treatment. This confidential system of notifications and reports will, I hope, enable us to form a better picture of the prevalence of the disease and to make arrangements for its treatment accordingly.  It is fully appreciated that there is a delicacy of public opinion and a sensitiveness on the part of patients and full recognition of these factors is being accorded in the proposed arrangements for case-finding and treatment which I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Health Act gives the Minister wide powers to arrange for the control, from the health point of view, of the manufacture, preparation, importation and distribution of food and drink intended for human consumption. Arrangements have been made to obtain detailed information on the health control of food preparations, etc., in Great Britain and elsewhere.  When the investigations have been completed, it is hoped to produce a set of regulations <Col N="2266" /> which will ensure that food intended for human consumption in the home or in public eating-places has been hygienically prepared and handled and is of good quality.</P>
    <P>So much for the Health Act itself.</P>
    <P>The passing of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, involved a fairly radical change in the system previously in operation for the making of State grants in aid of the expenditure of local authorities on health services.  The full expansion of the health services would have imposed a severe strain on the finances of health authorities if no change had been made.  The Act provides that the State will bear the increased cost incurred by a health authority in the expansion of health services over and above the expenditure on recognised health services in the financial year 1947-48 until such time as the State contribution equals the expenditure of the health authority.  Thereafter, the cost will be equally borne by central and local funds.  The method of recouping health authorities for health expenditure has also been simplified.  State grants were hitherto paid from various sources for specific health services to different categories of local authorities. From the 1st April last, a single grant will be paid which will replace all previous grants in aid of expenditure on health services.</P>
    <P>I should say a word about the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which was brought into operation on 1st January, 1947.  Among other things it simplified the procedure for the reception of patients, and provided for the reception of voluntary patients and temporary patients as well as persons of unsound mind.  The new procedure aims at encouraging patients to seek treatment in the early stages of illness and the results so far achieved are encouraging. The admissions in the year 1947 included 442 voluntary patients and 706 temporary patients.  Among the latter class are included 36 &ldquo;addicts&rdquo;. Discharges during the year included 253 voluntary patients and 279 temporary patients.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to extend indefinitely the litany of the various health measures taken in 1947-48 but I feel I should mention the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2267" /> Measures were taken to empower local authorities to provide for producing immunity from infection with enteric fever.</P>
    <P>Rat extermination measures have been under consideration for some time and at the request of my Department the Dublin health authorities have been making a detailed study of the question of control of rat infestation and of measures in operation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Refresher courses were arranged for general trained nurses and public health nurses, while a number of medical superintendent officers of health and county and assistant medical officers of health availed themselves of the facilities provided for attendance at a course of lectures on educationally sub-normal children and mental defectives which was held in London.</P>
    <P>Following a recommendation from the Hospitals Commission, approval was given to the making of a grant to the Medical Research Council of £10,000 per annum from the Hospitals Trust Fund for a period of five years from 1st January, 1948, for general research. The grant previously made was at the rate of £5,000 per annum. Approval was also given to the payment to the Hospital Library Council of a grant of £3,000 in respect of the present year to meet the needs of the council, which deals with the distribution of books to patients in hospitals and sanatoria.  The grant paid last year was £2,437.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941, the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was due for reconstitution before the 27th April of this year.  The necessary steps for the restoration of the board were put in train before the expiration of that period and the board held its first meeting on the 12th April last.</P>
    <P>I think I should at this stage explain to the House the details of the Estimate for the current year.  I should perhaps first say that I had the Estimate as originally framed carefully examined with a view to seeing whether any economies could properly be <Col N="2268" /> effected.  I found, however, that I could not ask the House to make less adequate provision than had been envisaged. In fact, it is necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to meet the estimated cost of the proposed publicity campaign to which I shall refer presently.</P>
    <P>The increases under sub-head A (Salaries, Wages and Allowances) and sub-head B (Travelling Expenses) are attributable to the additional staff which is required at headquarters to deal with the greatly extended functions to be discharged.  Sub-heads C and D do not call for comment.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under sub-head E for payment of the annual subscription to the International Office of Public Health, Paris (£254).  The functions of this office are in course of transfer to the World Health Organisation.  Members of the World Health Organisation are the States of the United Nations and such other States, including our own, as have expressed a desire to participate in international efforts to secure the highest possible standard of health.  The expenses of the organisation will be met by the member States in accordance with a scale to be fixed. It is, therefore, necessary to make provision under this sub-head towards the sum which later will be levied on this country.  In addition, provision is made for the expenses of Irish delegations to meetings of the organisation.</P>
    <P>One of the objects of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations is to raise the levels of nutrition and standards of living.  This country is a member of the organisation and the provision under the sub-head is for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the member of the staff of my Department who is nominated as a member of the Irish delegation to conferences held by the organisation.</P>
    <P>A national nutrition survey is at present in progress for the purpose of formulating plans to meet possible deficiencies in the standards of nutrition in different sections of the community and the expenses involved are met from sub-head G (3).  The survey consists of a dietary survey and a clinical survey.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> The dietary survey commenced in April, 1946, and the field work is being carried out under the supervision of a medical officer of my Department, by a team of 12 specially trained investigators. The survey in respect of Dublin City and the other county boroughs and large towns and certain districts on the western coast is complete, and work is proceeding in country areas.  Out of a total &ldquo;target&rdquo; number of 2,800 families, about 2,500 have been completely surveyed and I expect that this part of the work should be completed before the end of the year.  It is only right that I should here, publicly, express my appreciation of the very generous co-operation of the vast majority of the householders approached by the investigators.  The statistical analysis of the information obtained in respect of Dublin County Borough is practically completed and it will be possible to make the results available in the near future.</P>
    <P>The clinical survey was begun in February, 1947.  It is proposed that about 16,500 children will be examined in addition to adolescents and about 500 expectant or nursing mothers.  Considerable progress has been made and I expect that this part of the work will be completed by the end of 1948.</P>
    <P>I have already explained the purpose of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act which was passed last year.  The grants to be paid under this Act will be met from sub-head H and will be paid in respect of expenditure on all recognised health services.  They replace the percentage grants for free milk, maternity and child welfare, school medical service, tuberculosis and venereal disease and other special grants which were paid from the local taxation account for health services. The sum included in the sub-head may therefore be divided between replacements of existing subventions and increases represented by the excess of the 1948-49 expenditure over that for 1947-48.  The total expenditure on health services for the year 1947-48 is estimated to be £5,280,000.  Of this £4,450,000 was met from the rates and £830,000 from State grants.  This sum of £830,000 paid from State grants is included in the provision under the sub-head. <Col N="2270" /> The total estimated expenditure on health services for the year 1948-49 is £5,976,000.  The difference between this and the total for the year 1947-48 (£696,000) is also included in the grant. The total amount payable in respect of the year 1948-49 is therefore estimated to be £1,526,000.  As we will not know until after the end of March, 1949, when the accounts have been audited, what exactly is payable to each health authority, it is proposed to pay within the present year instalments amounting to 95 per cent. of the estimated amount due and to pay the balance after the receipt of the auditor's certificates in the following year.  The amount included in the sub-head is therefore 95 per cent. of £1,562,000 or £1,450,000.  The increase of £696,000 in this year's expenditure as compared with last year's, is accounted for by increases in salaries of local officers, by increased charges for institutional services and by the proposed expansion of the health services, particularly the tuberculosis service.</P>
    <P>In previous years, all expenditure from the Vote on mother and child services was met from a single sub-head. In the present year, it has been necessary to make a change because, as explained, all expenditure by local authorities on health services is &ldquo;lumped&rdquo; for the purposes of State grant, and the State subvention towards the expenditure of local authorities on mother and child services is included in the provision in sub-head H.  Certain voluntary agencies, for instance, district nursing associations, provide, outside local authority schemes, services to mothers and children in respect of which grants are made and provision for these grants is contained in sub-head I.</P>
    <P>The grant provided for in sub-head J is a contribution towards the expenses of the establishment and maintainance of a non-profit-making body to provide a national blood transfusion service. An advisory committee established at the end of 1946 reported that immediate steps should be taken for the establishment of a limited liability company to deal with the proposed organisation and that its replacement by a statutory body could be considered later in the light of experience gained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> It is, therefore, proposed to establish a company on a non-profit-making basis to be called the national blood transfusion association.  The association will be limited by guarantee and will not have share capital or power to distribute profits.  The functions of the association will be to organise and maintain throughout the country panels of donors, both directly and by the provision of financial and other assistance to local committees which can be satisfactorily integrated with the national service; the maintenance of a blood bank in Dublin and the provision of arrangements for the storage of serum; the carrying out of the necessary tests of donors in all areas; arrangements for the payment of donors, and the fixing of charges for whole blood and blood derivatives supplied to hospitals and local authorities. For some time at least the association will probably experience a deficit in its accounts and a grant-in-aid of about £5,500 per annum will probably be needed.  The provision made under this year's sub-head, however, includes all the expenditure incidental to the establishment of the company and should be reduced considerably next year.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under sub-head L for the payment of grants in recoupment of expenditure by health authorities under approved regulations by way of payment and maintenance and other allowances in the year ended 31st March last in respect of persons suffering from certain infectious diseases. Expenditure by local authorities in the current financial year on this service will be recouped from sub-head H (Grants to Health Authorities).</P>
    <P>The remaining sub-heads (M (1) to M (5)) represent anticipated payments of grants in respect of the balances payable to local authorities arising out of expenditure in previous years on maternity and child welfare schemes, free milk, school medical service schemes, prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and treatment of venereal disease.</P>
    <P>The last sub-head in the Estimate relates to Appropriations-in-Aid.  The major item (£312,000) comprises the <Col N="2272" /> payments formerly made from the local taxation account to local authorities in respect of health services and which are diverted to the Vote under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.  As explained in connection with sub-head H, the subvention made by way of these grants to local authorities will be replaced in the grant to be provided under that Act.</P>
    <P>This, perhaps, is the appropriate stage at which to refer to some matters connected with the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I do not propose to attempt to remove the many misconceptions which have grown up round it and will confine myself to a few observations on the problem of the deficits on the working of the voluntary hospitals, which are met from it, and on its capacity to support an extensive building programme, and then pass to a review of hospital building prospects in the near future.</P>
    <P>On the question of deficits, the present position is that 55 hospitals are participating in the sweepstake funds. In 1946 the deficit amounted to £237,624.  The amount of the deficits which the fund was called on to meet in 1939 was £156,975, so that there has been an increase of £80,649, or 51.4 per cent. between 1939 and 1946.  I understand, moreover, that the figure for 1947 is likely to be in the neighbourhood of £340,000.  While I am aware that the increased deficits, or at any rate a considerable proportion of their total, arise from causes outside the control of the various hospitals, the total figure now involved, coupled with the steadily rising trend, is a matter of the gravest concern.  Roughly speaking, it is necessary to invest a capital sum equivalent to the total amount of sweepstake moneys at present in hand, in round figures £10,000,000, to produce an annual income sufficient to pay the existing deficits (without making any allowance for further increase) and the other recurring annual charges on the Hospitals Trust Fund.  This in itself might not be a cause for anxiety if the annual accretion to the fund represented by the proceeds of the sweepstakes were maintained at a level sufficient to enable us to keep the building programme moving at a satisfactory rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2273" /> The available evidence is that it must be financed by drawing on the capital sum which, as mentioned, is barely sufficient to produce an income equivalent to the present annual charges.  The ultimate effect of this process may be that it will no longer be possible to pay annual deficits of unlimited magnitude.  The whole position is under examination in connection with the building programme, but in the meantime everybody concerned in the management of institutions whose deficits are met from sweepstake moneys should realise that the utmost economy in expenditure is imperative.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospital construction, there are before my Department at the present time, 135 proposals for new hospitals and for the adaptation, reconstruction and repair of existing hospitals.  The cost of carrying out these projects is in the region of £27,000,000.  This figure does not include any provision in respect of county homes, which, except for the infirmary sections, are not eligible for grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  It must not be assumed from the fact that I am compelled to exclude them from this review of proposals which can be financed from the Hospitals Trust Fund that I regard them as being in a satisfactory condition.  Far from it. I am satisfied that conditions in a large number of them are bad and that the whole problem of making radical improvements in existing buildings or of providing replacements must be faced. The community has a responsibility for the care of the aged and infirm which it cannot escape.</P>
    <P>I have on the majority of occasions during my visits of inspection throughout the country criticised the sub-standard conditions which, in my opinion, exist in these county homes.  Equally, however, I have paid tribute on each occasion to the extremely high standard of equipment, staffing, care and attention which exists in the county hospitals which I have seen up to the present, and it is also only just for me to give credit where credit is due.  I have pointed out how very very impressive were the hospital buildings themselves, my only criticism being that they appear to be rather too small <Col N="2274" /> for the population groups which they serve.  My hospital building programme is conditioned by two main factors, shortage of materials and shortage of skilled and unskilled labour.  This makes it inevitable that hospitals can be built only in competition with other pressing housing needs of the community.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that good housing is a prerequisite of good health and that money and effort devoted to building up a positive health service while slum conditions, overcrowding and bad housing remain is largely waste.  In these circumstances I have come to the conclusion that I would not be justified in approving of the full programme before my Department.  I have concluded, reluctantly, that what should be done is to proceed on the basis of a limited programme of hospital construction over the period of about seven years.  I have fixed at £15,000,000 the cost of the work which I will endeavour to have brought to a conclusion within that period.  Included in this figure are the works which I feel are the most essential.  The decision to proceed on these lines has not been an easy one for me to take because I have had to decide that certain works must be deferred.  My Department is in the process of notifying the promoters of the projects which will have to be deferred.  I know the notifications will result in grave disappointment which I have done my utmost to avoid but I can assure the House that I have examined the question dispassionately and without regard to political considerations or to local affiliations and that my decision has been taken purely on grounds, not of need, but of the greatest need.  A review of the programme will, however, take place as soon as there is any material change in conditions in the building industry and, in any event, in the next three years.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say a special word about Dublin.  The Dublin area already has a number of excellent and well-run hospitals, and while the need to provide more modern buildings with greater bed accommodation to replace these institutions does undoubtedly exist, I think we must agree that there is a greater need elsewhere.</P>

    <P>These total £14,550,000.  The balance must be reserved for spending on small works, unforeseen at present.  It is clear that no margin is left for any major project.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that there is a very substantial provision included for tuberculosis hospitals.  These are particularly badly needed because there is in tuberculosis the factor that each sufferer, so long as he is not receiving the proper treatment away from his family and friends, can spread the infection and I am sure every member of the House shares my anxiety that every tuberculosis sufferer in the country should, if he wishes to avail of it, be given the facilities for isolation, rest and proper treatment, which are necessary for his recovery and the protection of his family and associates.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the country can succeed in getting £15,000,000 worth of hospital construction carried out within the next seven years, we will have gone a good way towards solving the institutional side of our health problems, but the programme can be carried out only if there is general acceptance that it is the only reasonable decision and I am allowed to get on with the job and the time of the officials of my Department is not taken up in examining proposals which there is no hope of putting in hands or completing within the next few years.  I would like to join with the Minister for Local Government in appealing to our workmen&mdash;bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, painters and all the other skilled and unskilled workers at home and overseas&mdash;to give us their unstinted assistance and co-operation in <Col N="2276" /> the Government's building drive which they will have the satisfaction of knowing will provide houses for the healthy and hospital and other health services for the sick of all sections of the community, particularly the workers themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy development is the readiness of the central health administration to avail itself of the accumulated knowledge of experts in different spheres of medicine.  In the National Health Council set up by my predecessor we have the first advisory council on health matters which has been specifically provided for by Statute to give to the Minister, when so required by him, advice on matters relating to or incidental to the health of the people.  This most desirable development should be a factor of great importance in the efforts to expand and improve the health services.  The council has been established and has already given valuable advice.</P>
    <P>In addition to the National Health Council, a number of consultative councils have been established under the Health Act.</P>
    <P>In order to keep abreast of modern developments I have established a Consultative Cancer Council to examine the existing facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and for research work in relation to cancer in this country and to submit recommendations as to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the further facilities to be provided;</P>
    <P>(b)  the nature of the organisations by which such facilities should be provided; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the staffing, equipment and suggested stages of development appropriate to any organisation or organisations recommended.</P>
    <P>The council is composed of bacteriological and cancer specialists and persons familiar with the administration of public health services and held its first meeting on the 22nd April last.  I have especially requested the council to advise me, in the first instance, on any immediate steps which I might take to improve the diagnostic and treatment services in the early future, and, secondly, to submit a long-term <Col N="2277" /> plan designed to deal as fully and exhaustively as possible with all phases of the problem.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier I have also set up a Child Health Council.  The council has been given responsibility for advising on the measures which may appear to be likely to prove most effective for the improvement of the health of children generally, or of any particular class or classes of children, and, in particular, for the reduction of infant mortality.</P>
    <P>The problem of tuberculosis is one of major concern and a matter which will need the combined and sustained efforts of the whole community to alleviate the present grievous position, and I have established a special tuberculosis consultative council to advise me from time to time on matters relating to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>While the consultative bodies I have mentioned are the first statutory bodies of their kind in the health sphere, they are by no means the first bodies of experts in the medical and kindred professions which have given the benefit of their experience or knowledge to the central health administration. My predecessor in office also established a committee to examine, in relation to projected health reforms and any developments in the standard of medical education elsewhere, the present system of undergraduate and post-graduate medical education in this country.  The value of any health service depends largely on the efficiency of its personnel and the nature of the health services of the future will demand that medical education must keep in step with progress in the realms of medicine and with the needs of the community for doctors possessed of the highest standard of skill and knowledge.  I understand that this committee has already made substantial progress in its task.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general question of raising the standard of knowledge and skill of medical graduates there is also an urgent need for obtaining at least a skeleton staff with all-round medical and public health post-graduate training for the health services in advance of any general examination of the major problem of medical education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2278" /> In the circumstances it is proposed to establish a post-graduate medical school for the training of local authority medical personnel in St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  An advisory committee was established to examine and consider the existing accommodation and facilities at the hospital and to make recommendations as to the measures necessary and immediately practicable for enabling the proposed school to be established and to function satisfactorily.  I gather that this committee, also, has made considerable progress and that its report will soon be available.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of professional education I should perhaps refer to an ancillary matter, the training of nursing personnel.  I have been considering the present system and may find it desirable to bring before the House legislation governing this matter. Arising out of that, there have been discussions with representatives of the nursing profession on the question of the desirability of establishing a new national nursing board which would absorb the General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives' Board.  This proposal would facilitate the integration of the different branches of the nursing profession and the provision of the steady flow of nurses and midwives that will be needed for many years.  I have also had discussions with the General Nursing Council on a scheme for the institution of a new grade of sanatorium nurse.</P>
    <P>Training and organisation are only two aspects of the nursing problem.  I feel that too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of insisting on fair living and working conditions for all our nursing staffs.  We will need hundreds of nurses for our extended health services and if we are to get them we must offer them attractive terms.  Adequate remuneration alone is not enough.  Proper accommodation and adequate recreational facilities are also of prime importance.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this question of medical and nursing personnel I would like publicly to thank the many medical practitioners and representatives of professional organisations who have so generously put their time and experience at my disposal through their membership <Col N="2279" /> of councils and committees and in discussions.</P>
    <P>Adequate and well-trained medical and nursing staffs are not in themselves sufficient to improve health standards of the community.  The community must itself co-operate and among the matters to which I gave early attention was the initiation of a programme of education for the public generally in the fundamental principles of health and hygiene.  I felt that this most powerful weapon in a positive health campaign had been rather neglected and I, therefore, took immediate steps to remedy the position.  A publicity and intelligence section has been established in my Department and an experienced officer has been put in charge.  By availing ourselves of the potent media available&mdash;the Press, the radio and films&mdash;we will endeavour to convince the people that they can reduce the incidence of disease and illness by availing themselves of the health services at their disposal, by the adoption of a positive attitude in health matters, by compliance with the elementary principles of hygiene and by a realisation of their responsibilities towards the community in general.</P>
    <P>I propose to make use of Press advertisements, booklets, leaflets, films, exhibitions and radio talks.  In co-operation with the Minister for Education and the National Film Institute arrangements will be made for the showing of health films in schools and, in addition, it is hoped to purchase copies of health documentary films for distribution to the film renters for screening in cinemas throughout the country.  I believe that the additional expenditure involved in such publicity will be money well spent and that the nation will reap rich dividends in the way of healthier citizens.  A Supplementary Estimate to provide the necessary funds will be before the House immediately after the Health Estimate proper has been disposed of.</P>
    <P>For large sections of the community, the first link of the individual with the medical services is his local dispensary. One of my aims is that existing dispensary buildings should in the majority of cases be replaced by properly <Col N="2280" /> equipped health clinics which will, as far as practicable, be located in the most convenient centres from the point of view of the population of each district.  Where possible, existing buildings will be converted for use.  As far as I can see, the demands of this section of the health services will be heavy on money and materials, but as they are one of the corner-stones on which the health services structure will be built the effort will be well worth while.  The existing dispensary service must, of course, be dissociated from the poor law tradition.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, as an interim measure, the attention of all public assistance authorities was drawn to the unsatisfactory conditions in the many dispensaries where accommodation and amenities provided for patients fall far short of what is desirable.  Since it will not be possible to provide for the replacement in the near future of more than a proportion of the inadequate or unsuitable premises, I have urged the responsible authorities to take early steps to ensure that existing premises are kept clean and in a proper condition, that adequate seating accommodation is provided for waiting patients, that the examination room is properly equipped and that before next winter reasonable heating provision is made.  I would urge Deputies who are members of local authorities to take a special interest in this matter and to urge on their councils the necessity for seeing that the important health work done in dispensary premises has not to be performed under conditions which at present are primitive in many cases.</P>
    <P>These are only two major matters with which I propose to deal at this stage, the problem of tuberculosis and the question of future health developments; but before I pass to them, I would like to mention two other matters.</P>
    <P>No adequate measures have been taken so far on a sufficient scale to provide for the training of mentally deficient persons who are capable of being educated or for proper institutional care for other mental defectives. Magnificent work is being done by various voluntary bodies already in this field, but their efforts must be <Col N="2281" /> supplemented if the problem is to be adequately dealt with.  The entire position is under review and I hope later to introduce a Bill dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>A big contribution to any health campaign would be the ensuring of a supply of clean milk.  With this end in view my Department is in communication with the Department of Agriculture concerning the recommendations made by the Milk Tribunal that the production of highest grade milk should be fostered and that other milk should be pasteurised.</P>
    <P>With regard to tuberculosis, the death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 1,000 of population in Ireland in 1940 was 1.25, in 1946 was 1.14, and last year was 1.22.</P>
    <P>As I have just said, our rate in 1946 was 1.14.  In Denmark the figure was 0.44, in Norway 0.53, in Sweden 0.56, in England and Wales 0.63, and in Northern Ireland 0.94.  Even ignoring the lesser incidence here of the effects of the war, these figures afford us no consolation. They prove conclusively how serious, relatively and absolutely, our problem is.</P>
    <P>The number of cases treated by health authorities here was 20,622 in 1945.  The figure in 1946, at 19,565, was lower than in 1945 but was still substantially in excess of the figures in earlier years.</P>
    <P>The figure for notifications was 3,864 in 1943, but in each subsequent year showed a reduction.  The figure for 1946 was 3,380.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is provided by health authorities in 19 tuberculosis institutions. There are, in addition, four voluntary institutions which cater solely for pulmonary tuberculosis cases.  Patients, however, are also accommodated in county hospitals, county homes and district hospitals and beds are made available as conditions permit. Other voluntary hospitals also play an important part in relieving the demand for beds, particularly as regards non-pulmonary cases.</P>
    <P>The number of beds at present provided in health authority tuberculosis hospitals is 1,600 and the voluntary tuberculosis hospitals can deal with 650 patients.  This total of 2,250 beds represents <Col N="2282" /> the number provided by institutions devoted solely or mainly to the treatment of tuberculosis.  In addition, some 980 beds are made available by the remaining local authorities and voluntary hospitals.  The total is thus about 3,230 beds and represents, approximately, 1.28 beds per death.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken to increase the number of beds, as a matter of urgency.  It is intended that an initial provision of approximately 1.5 beds per death should be the first objective, to be extended to two beds per death should conditions so demand.  It is not easy in present circumstances with shortages of money, materials and labour to achieve that result.  As a first step, existing institutions are being extended or adapted.  Thus, four of the voluntary institutions will soon have provision for over 300 more patients.  The recently built Castlerea Mental Hospital has been handed over temporarily for use as a sanatorium and opened last week.  By the end of the year it should have 420 beds and full treatment facilities, including a theatre for thoracic surgery and homes to accommodate over 100 nurses and 30 domestic staff.  The new District Hospital in Mallow is in a similar position to Castlerea, but the number will be approximately 60 to 80 patients. Arrangements are in train for the taking over by Dublin Corporation of Coláiste Moibhi in the Phoenix Park. This institution will ultimately accommodate approximately 350 patients.</P>
    <P>Before I leave these three projects, I wish to express my sincere appreciation of the whole-hearted co-operation I have got so willingly from all sides of the House, from the local authorities concerned, from the Ministers for Education and Defence and from the Most Reverend Manager of Coláiste Moibhi.  That co-operation has, in many cases, involved great sacrifice.  I would like to particularise, but this statement has already been lengthy and I will have later opportunities to do so.</P>
    <P>As a result of the extensions and acquisitions to which I have referred, some 1,650 additional beds will ultimately become available.  This would give a total approaching 5,000 beds, which is not far short of 1.5 beds per <Col N="2283" /> death.  These extra beds will not all become available for some time, although it is hoped that about one-half of them, so far as it is possible to judge at the moment, will become available during the current year.</P>
    <P>We are by no means within sight of the desired position so far as beds are concerned, however, because some of the existing institutions are most unsuited to the treatment of tuberculosis and a number of them will have to be closed down as soon as an alternative can be found.  Long-term plans are, therefore, in preparation and will be pressed ahead with all speed.  These include the provision of large sanatoria on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>The main centres at which tuberculosis is diagnosed are the tuberculosis clinics, of which there are 278 throughout the country.  Many of these centres are unsuitable and, as an interim measure, the authorities concerned have been requested to improve them as a matter of emergency in so far as the re-equipping and redecorating may be effective, pending the erection of new structures.  Fluoroscopic apparatus is available in practically every county. A mass radiography unit has been in operation in Dublin since 1946 and over 12,000 persons have already been X-rayed. It is proposed to extend this service throughout the country by providing additional units, including mobile units.</P>
    <P>Two medical officers of health authorities are at present in Canada on a six months' course of study in modern methods of diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.  It has been arranged that four such officers will each year, throughout a period of five years, undertake a similar course.</P>
    <P>Nursing personnel are also catered for by the provision of a course of study in tuberculosis work, for which a diploma is awarded by the General Nursing Council to successful candidates. In addition, as I have already mentioned, arrangements to train a special category of nurses, to be described as sanatorium nurses, are under examination.</P>
    <P>A commencement has been made in the provision of a national thoracic <Col N="2284" /> surgical service.  A whole-time thoracic surgeon has been appointed and is about to take up duty.  Owing to lack of suitable theatre facilities in local authority institutions, it would have been impossible to bring the scheme into operation in Dublin for several months but for the co-operation of the Commissioner administering the affairs of the Dublin Board of Assistance, who made available first-class operating facilities at St. Kevin's Hospital, pending the provision of permanent facilities at Rialto Hospital.  Full theatre facilities are available at the new Mallow Hospital and, as I have mentioned, full facilities will shortly be available at Castlerea.</P>
    <P>A scheme of immunisation with B.C.G. under the auspices of the local authority has been instituted in Dublin. I am investigating the possibility of introducing a scheme under which the health of young persons from school leaving age will be supervised.  Such a scheme, if introduced, should reduce the incidence of the diseases, including tuberculosis, so often contracted during the dangerous years of adolescence.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the appointment of a consultative council to advise me on matters relating to the whole problem of the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and to the introduction of the maintenance allowance scheme by my predecessor, Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed that I have confined my review to the question of diagnosis and treatment and that I have made little reference to prevention.  The tuberculosis problem cannot be solved until good housing, good school and working conditions and adequate nutrition are available for all, but these are not within my province on this Estimate.  I can and will, however, supplement the national effort to bring about conditions repugnant to the spread of the disease by publicity as to the elementary precautions which every citizen can take to lessen the risk of infection in his own home, in his place of employment and in his place of relaxation and amusement. Another important object of the publicity will be to get the public to adopt a rational attitude towards the <Col N="2285" /> disease so that no longer will the infected person be ashamed of his ailment or the person who has been lucky enough to avoid the ailment feel superior.  If only people would regard tuberculosis as they regard rheumatism or cancer or any other ailment, we would have advanced considerably towards the eradication of the disease.</P>
    <P>I have not so far referred to rehabilitation. Not every person who has been cured of the disease will be fit to resume his former occupation.  For those who will not be fit for heavy labour, as a result of the disease or of infantile paralysis, some special provision must be made.  The problem is a big one and I do not propose to enlarge upon it now.  I will only say that it will be examined carefully, considerately and with expedition.</P>
    <P>As regards future developments, the position is that I have found it necessary, since I assumed office, to devote a large part of my time and energies as well as those of my Department to dealing with the prodigious number of problems which I found requiring immediate attention.  I felt that until these had been disposed of the amount of time which could be devoted to long-term plans was necessarily limited.  So far as the ordinary citizen is concerned, the provision of facilities designed to relieve immediate and pressing needs is of much more importance than plans, which, however attractive they may seem in theory, are not capable of early realisation.</P>
    <P>Any worthwhile development of our services must, of course, be within the financial capacity of the community as a whole and, moreover, cannot have any reality without the necessary diagnostic and treatment centres and adequate medical, nursing and midwifery staffs.</P>
    <P>On this question of future health services, I would like to say a word to the medical profession.  Very few people would welcome State interference in our medical set-up.  In the ultimate, however, the State has a duty to the public and it will be incumbent on the medical profession to demonstrate its readiness and willingness to co-operate in providing an adequate service with the minimum of State interference. <Col N="2286" /> With a universal spirit of goodwill, there is no adequate reason why we should not build, on the present foundations, a worthy health service within a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>I should like, in closing, to pay a particular tribute to all the members of my staff in the Department of Health. I think that it should be a source of great encouragement and considerable gratification to us all that the greatest loyalty, efficiency and hard work should be evident from the civil servants in our Departments.  That these qualities should be forthcoming to the appointed Minister of the State irrespective of whatever Government may be in office should be publicly acknowledged and to a great extent to them must go the credit for the effective carrying out and the realisation of our endeavours to provide a service which we feel that our people so richly deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, said that he was dealing principally with the treatment, and had not dealt as sufficiently as he would like with the prevention side.  I am rather disappointed that he did not deal with the prevention side, that he did not give more thought to it and more of his views on it to the House.  So far as the Health Act which was passed last year is concerned, the big idea underlying it was to try to prevent disease.  I think every doctor in practice and every administrator of health services and, indeed, every Minister for Health, should have as his first concern the prevention of disease and then, of course, if disease enters&mdash;as it will in spite of us&mdash;to treat it.  In the Act passed last year, the 1947 Health Act, principal stress was laid on prevention.  If we want to prevent disease in general occurring here, I think it must strike anybody, layman or anybody else, that we must have healthy children.  In fact we must go further.  We must have a healthy mother before the child arrives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the 1947 Act is, therefore, devoted to child welfare services.  In that Act, an obligation is laid on the local authorities to provide <Col N="2287" /> facilities both ante-natal and postnatal, for mothers, for the care of infants and for the care of school children.  But that was an enabling Act and it must be implemented by regulations.  I was very anxious when I was in charge of the Department of Health to have that Act implemented as quickly as possible in that particular respect so that mothers and children would have the benefit of advice from the medical officer and would be given every opportunity to enjoy perfect health, so far as that is possible.  I was anxious that the regulations necessary, sample regulations, should be prepared for the local authorities.  The local authorities, of course, can make their own regulations within the framework of the Act but the local authorities, so far as I know, were anxious to have sample regulations submitted to them so that they could frame their regulations, either following these sample regulations or departing from them as they thought fit.</P>
    <P>I was expecting to hear from the Minister in introducing the Estimate that some progress had been made in regard to these regulations or that some progress had been made towards providing better facilities for the health of mothers and children, for infants and for school-children.  As we all know, there are no such facilities in many areas.  There are, of course, in a city like Dublin, where you have maternity hospitals, clinics for mothers and infants.  So far as school inspection goes, it is not as thorough as it should be, because as it is worked at the moment, the medical officer of health or his staff must carry out school inspection and, with so many schools under his control and so many children attending these schools, he cannot give those children a thorough examination more than probably once every two or three years.  Indeed in some counties the intervals are longer.</P>
    <P>It has been-said that in some counties children actually go through their school course without being fortunate enough to happen on a medical examination at all.  These were the matters with which the 1947 Act was <Col N="2288" /> designed to deal.  I should like to have heard something more from the Minister in introducing the Estimate on the progress that has been made with regard to mother and child welfare.  Perhaps in his concluding speech he would give us some further information.</P>
    <P>I have said that under the present scheme, with the county medical officer of health responsible for school inspection, even where he has an assistant or two assistants according to the size of the county, it is not possible for him and his assistant to carry out that school inspection more than once every two or three years.  A disease may develop in a child with which it will be very difficult to deal after two or three years and with which it would be much easier to deal if it were discovered at an early stage, at the time it attacks the child.  It was proposed, therefore&mdash; I do not know whether the Minister is inclined to change from the idea I had when I was in the Department&mdash;that the district medical officer, who is now the dispensary medical officer, would be responsible both for prevention and cure of the people in his own area.</P>
    <P>The district medical officer would be in charge of an area of somewhat the same size as the dispensary area.  Some of those areas may be too big.  It may be necessary to take a bit off an area in order to give the medical officer an opportunity of looking after it more efficiently or, if there is a still bigger area, it may be possible to give the district medical officer an assistant, or, if you take the very big dispensary areas, such as we have in Dublin, it may be necessary to give him more than one assistant.</P>
    <P>These were things that were being investigated under a survey that was being carried out by the Department of Health in the various counties, to see what was the population and what were the general conditions of the various dispensary districts, so that it would be possible to discuss a scheme with the local authority.  The local authority had the initiation of the scheme but it would be possible to give the local authority information at the disposal of the Department of Health as a result of the survey and discuss with them a scheme for the reorganisation <Col N="2289" /> of those districts, so that the doctor in charge would be able to look after prevention as well as cure.  He has to do school inspection, to look after clinics for expectant mothers and to look after clinics for infants before school age and, of course, to look after infectious diseases, so far as they are dealt with in the dispensary area before being sent to a fever hospital or elsewhere.  It was also proposed that this district medical officer, whether he would have an assistant medical officer with him or whether his district would be small enough to be looked after by himself, would have at his disposal a general nurse and a maternity nurse.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this organisation will take time but I am interested to know whether any progress has been made. I did not expect that they would be placed in their districts with assistant medical officers under their control and general nurses and maternity nurses within the last four or five months but I am anxious to know whether some progress has been made. Undoubtedly there are certain difficulties to be got over and some of them will give a certain amount of worry to any Minister for Health.  One of the worries I had when I was there in meeting the medical association was to know what could be done for the general private practitioner.  The argument was put up by the medical association that if the provisions outlined in the White Paper issued last year were to come into operation, the private practitioner in the small town was in danger at least of losing any practice he might have in maternity and treatment of children because these people would get free treatment from the district medical officer and that he would also lose a certain amount of practice in respect of people who are now compelled to pay, but who, if the provisions of the White Paper were brought into operation, would not be bound to pay the doctor.</P>
    <P>I must say that that was a question requiring a great deal of consideration, but even a difficult problem of that kind should not prevent the scheme being brought into operation.  Even the men concerned admitted that their worries, whatever they might be, should not <Col N="2290" /> stand in the way of a better scheme of public health, but they thought it was possible to reconcile their claims with a good scheme and it possibly is.  In these towns, I believe that the present dispensary doctor will have more than the average population under his control and he will therefore be entitled to medical assistance if the scheme were brought into operation.  If that is the case, it should be possible to do something for the private practitioner by giving him some share of the extra work.  That would be one way of dealing with it.  There may be better ways &mdash;I do not know.</P>
    <P>The experience gained from school medical inspection is that children suffer from certain ailments in particular. As a matter of fact, there are surprisingly high figures to be seen in the statistics.  One is surprised to hear the very high percentage of children who suffer from bad teeth.  It goes up to practically 50 per cent.  A much lower percentage suffer from defects of the eye and a certain number suffer from tonsils and adenoids.  These are complaints which, if taken early, can very often be corrected, but, if they are not taken early, cannot be corrected and leave some permanent injury behind them.  If a child loses its permanent teeth, the matter cannot be rectified. Dentures put in afterwards are not the same.</P>
    <P>If a child suffers for some time from faulty accommodation in vision, it may be impossible to put matters right, which, if taken in time, could be put right.  It is evident, therefore, to everybody that frequent school medical inspection is a most important and very necessary matter.  I am stressing this because I have to agree with the Minister, though I do not think I agree with him fully, that there are difficulties about building large hospitals, but there is not the same difficulty about putting a scheme of that kind into operation and having children in the schools examined often.  Let us at least start off as soon as possible by keeping the coming generation as healthy as we possibly can.  That is so far as the mother and child welfare scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the same Bill, there was a Part dealing with infectious diseases and <Col N="2291" /> one of the things mentioned by the Minister in the statistics he gave was the number of deaths from diphtheria. He mentioned that the death rate from diphtheria had gone down very satisfactorily over the past four or five years, but that unfortunately the number of people immunised against diphtheria was going down, and not up, as we would like to see it.  We would like to see everybody adopting immunisation as far as possible, because I think there is little doubt that, owing to immunisation, so far as it went, the diphtheria death rate has gone down considerably.  There might have been a slight drop in any case, as there always is in the case of these diseases, but not such a significant drop as there was, but for immunisation, and it is a pity that immunisation is not being more widely adopted.</P>
    <P>I hope that everything possible will be done to see that people are impressed with its importance and will avail of it to as great an extent as possible.  Medical men generally will agree, I think, if immunisation were generally adopted against diphtheria, it could be stamped out just as effectively as smallpox was stamped out in the last century.  In that connection, I should like to know what decision the Minister has taken on vaccination against smallpox, because it was a matter of some controversy here when the Health Bill was going through.  I agree, as everybody does, that the most essential things for health are good food and good housing.  Unless we have the foundation of good hygienic houses and good food, we cannot possibly expect good health.</P>
    <P>The nutrition survey was mentioned by the Minister.  That survey was carried out in Dublin before being extended to the country and, as the Minister explained, it was carried out by officers of the Department of Health in 1946.  It was under the auspices of the Medical Research Council and was carried out according to world standards, so that we could compare our figures with those produced in other countries.  So far as I know, the survey was well and widely done.  A wider number of people were taken in in the City of Dublin than were taken in in <Col N="2292" /> most countries in a survey of the kind, so that the figures produced here should be valuable.  But these figures were taken in 1946, two years ago, and they are complete so far as nutrition in the City of Dublin is concerned and I see no reason why they should not be published.  They were available before I left the Department&mdash;I saw them&mdash; and the reason I was so interested in them was that they went a good distance towards contradicting a lot of popular beliefs about nutrition in this country; in other words, nutrition in this country is good so far as it can be found out in a scientific way.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for people to know, even though the survey was carried out under the previous Government, that we are well fed compared with other countries, and there is no reason why the figures should be kept back any longer until other figures are ready.  We know fairly well what the condition of housing is.  We see very often particulars of the numbers of people living in houses which are not fit for human habitation, and it would be no harm if we knew what the real state of nutrition amongst our people is.  The figures are particularly interesting in relation to a comparison of nutrition standards amongst the lower wage earners as compared with the higher wage and salary earners, and I press the Minister to have that survey published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, as the Minister says, he has no direct control over housing.  Everybody would like to see more housing.  Everybody would have to admit that a great deal was done in housing over the last 15 or 16 years.  A lot remains to be done.  We are waiting to see a big drive in housing again and if it were possible to get housing going on a large scale again it would be possible, probably, to see the present housing shortage solved within ten or 12 years.  Of course, in the meantime other people would be looking for houses but those who are now looking for houses could be supplied probably in ten or 12 years if we got back to the rate of house building we had in 1937 or 1938.</P>
    <P>What we want, therefore, as far as the prevention of disease is concerned, <Col N="2293" /> are the fundamentals of good houses, good food and, on the medical side, in particular, to see that we have healthy mothers and healthy children. In that way we will be at least in the position that our children when they leave school at 15 or 16 years of age and go to employment will be entering that employment as good, healthy young people.  But, no matter how good our preventive medical system may be, there is no doubt that disease will get in and then it comes to treatment. We must treat it as best we can.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that in this country we are very fortunate in having a really good system for the treatment of disease if we put the necessary equipment and facilities at the disposal of the men concerned.  Nowhere in the world does the family doctor know his people so well and do they trust him so implicitly as in this country.  In the rural areas there is the dispensary doctor who is known to everybody and who knows everybody in his district.  The dispensary doctors are very good men taking them all round.  In the small towns and cities there is the family doctor, not always the dispensary doctor in that case.  So, we have a really good foundation to build upon when we come to a system of treatment of disease.  But the doctor, as the Minister pointed out, must get a good clinic.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Health, probably, the Department was too ambitious, and the type of clinic suggested would be a very elaborate building and very costly.  It would, of course, take a great deal of time to build and a great deal of materials and as the Minister has pointed out, there is only a certain amount of material there and only a certain amount of labour available.  We must keep that in mind.  It would be possible, however, to improve the clinics somewhat and I am glad to know that the Minister has that in mind.  But, apart from building, other things can be done without much delay, such as the provision of equipment and the necessary drugs and so on.  Some of these men complain that they do not get sufficient discretion <Col N="2294" /> with regard to the drugs they use and that they are not allowed as much equipment as they would need for the simple small operations they are called upon to perform and even for examining the patient.  I hope it may be possible to put these things right as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I spoke already about the help that would be necessary.  The question must be considered, in organising these areas, whether the district medical officer should have medical assistance or not.  No matter how small or how large the area, it will be necessary to give nursing help, that is, a general nurse and a maternity nurse to each of these areas.</P>
    <P>I had some discussions with these men&mdash;perhaps they had not reached the official stage&mdash;about the question of their hours of duty.  I suppose every member of this House realises that a dispensary medical officer is on duty all the time.  He must be available in his district except when he is on holidays or on a very special occasion, such as a death in the family or something like that, when he may get a day or two off from the county manager, but, generally speaking, from one end of the week to the other, for the 24 hours of every day, he is on duty. Admittedly, he is not working 24 hours but he is always supposed to be available. That is very hard on any man and I thought it might be possible to arrange that these district medical officers would pair off, as it were, one with the other, so that each of them could have, say, two evenings at least per week free from duty from, say, one, two or three in the afternoon until the next morning and could also perhaps have every second Sunday.  At least, in rural districts the number of calls is not very many and it will not occur very often that persons will have to send to the next district for the doctor when their own doctor is away.  It will occur very occasionally, but not very often, and when it does occur it cannot be helped.  In the cities and towns the matter could be arranged more easily because the district medical officer will have an assistant or perhaps two assistants and the duties can be arranged between them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2295" /> The same, of course, applies to some extent to other classes of the medical profession.  For instance, county surgeons are also on duty practically all the time except when they are on holidays. It is rather unnerving for men who are working fairly hard, as these men do, and who have serious cases on hands, to feel that they are never free, that they are always liable to be called to the hospital any hour of day or night, the whole year round, except for their few weeks' holidays.  I hope that the Minister will see, in any discussions he may have with the medical men regarding their conditions, that these matters will be made right and that they will get some freedom from that continuous duty that they have at the moment.  I had promised the Medical Association, when I met them about this time last year and when they got an interim increase in their salaries, that when the provisions of the White Paper then issued were coming into operation all these matters of salaries, conditions and so on would be discussed with them before they would be asked to take over these extra duties.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the present Minister agrees with that White Paper or not.  Probably he does not agree with all of it.  There are a few things in it on which I would like to get his view.  One of them is the level of income at which a person should get free treatment.  It was laid down definitely what the view of the Fianna Fáil Government was on that point. It was laid down that a person earning under £5 a week, or a landowner having a farm of less than £25 valuation, was entitled to free treatment of every kind.  Then there was an intermediate class&mdash;a person earning between £5 and £10, and the farmer between £25 and £50 valuation was entitled to free institutional treatment. I have known of two particular instances of farmers&mdash;probably about £25 valuation&mdash;who were not entitled to free treatment, even to free institutional treatment.  Both of these men needed an operation very badly, but they could not afford to pay for the institution and pay for the operation. The result was that they postponed <Col N="2296" /> going into hospital much longer than they should have, on account of their means.  These were instances that were in my mind and were probably responsible for making me suggest some scheme to the Government with regard to free treatment and a higher level of free institutional treatment.</P>
    <P>These two things could be introduced without very much delay.  I know that it will be necessary to talk to the doctors, as they will claim, I am afraid, that the conditions of their employment are completely changed when this new range of free treatment comes in. Even so, it is a pity that we should have cases in the country where men need an operation but feel they cannot afford to pay for it and who, therefore, are neglecting their health under the scheme as it stands.  I would like the Minister to tell us, in winding up, what his opinion is with regard to that particular part of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to give us his views with regard to policy in the building, first of all, of general hospitals. We might divide them roughly, as in the past, into district, county and regional&mdash;the regional including general hospitals in cities and so on. I want to know the Minister's opinion regarding district hospitals.  Before I went into the Department of Health, the policy was to make them as few as possible, but I did not altogether agree with that.  I think these district hospitals should be placed within reasonable reach of people everywhere, as far as it can be done.  The district hospital is a small institution, a one-man hospital.  A general practitioner takes charge of it and that immediately tells us what the hospital deals with.  A general practitioner is capable of dealing, for instance, with maternity cases, with a broken leg and with cases of pneumonia.  If it is desirable to shift a pneumonia case into hospital, that is another matter.  I mention these cases to indicate the types dealt with in a district hospital.  I do not know what the relative costs may be of having three district hospitals or the three amalgamated into one, but if it were only slightly more costly I would say the people should get the district hospital, <Col N="2297" /> as far as might be considered reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a growing tendency in the country for maternity cases to go to an institution, or to some hospital or other.  When I say the country, I do not mean the rural parts alone, but the whole country.  That is understandable, because it is so difficult in recent times to get domestic help that both the woman herself and her friends think it better she should get into some institution where she is looked after during that time; and someone will look after the family while she is away.  She could not look after the family, anyway, even if she stayed at home, so the tendency is to go to an institution.  The great majority &mdash;I think 97 per cent.&mdash;of maternity cases are normal and can be treated by the general practitioner and, therefore, at the district hospital.  It may be looked upon, therefore, more and more as a maternity hospital, while not neglecting the ordinary small medical cases that could be dealt with by the doctor who is in charge of that hospital. We may all have our views on that matter.  I do not know what the Minister's views may be and I would like him to tell us his general policy regarding the establishment of district hospitals where there are none at present.  When leaving the Department, I had sanctioned the provision of district hospitals in at least a few instances, but I do not know what may be the general attitude now.</P>
    <P>Then there is the county hospital, which is a bigger institution.  It has a general surgeon, a physician and a maternity man.  Sometimes, the maternity man and the physician may be the same man.  At any rate, they can deal with practically all general cases. The cases are sifted as they go up. Some go to the district hospital and some that cannot be dealt with there go to the county hospital.  We find that some cases must go further because the county hospital cannot afford to have specialists or would not have enough work for them.  Therefore, the cases that are dealt with by a specialist must go farther or, alternatively, the specialist must come down to the county hospital, and occasionally <Col N="2298" /> he does.  Some specialists, such as ophthalmologists, nose and throat men may visit the county hospital occasionally. They cannot, of course, come down every time there are urgent cases.  Therefore, these must go on to the regional, and in the regional we have both a general hospital and the specialists who are attached to these hospitals in the city.</P>
    <P>We have special hospitals dealing with tuberculosis and with fever.  It was contemplated that we would have special hospitals to deal with other things as well.  The Minister dealt fairly fully in his statement with tuberculosis, but, again, I would like if he had dealt more with the prevention side of it.  Food and housing, of course, are a <i>sine qua non</i> to good health in the prevention of tuberculosis and of other diseases.  He mentioned radiography. Mass radiography has been carried on in Dublin for some years. I hope it will be extended to the country as quickly as possible.  I think medical opinion has come to recognise that the early diagnosis of tuberculosis is helped very much by radiography. I would like to know what measures have been taken to extend mass radiography throughout the country or the facilities for X-ray so as to put these facilities within the reach of practically everybody as far as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>I do not think enough attention is paid to contacts.  Within recent weeks I came across a case where a person in a family died of tuberculosis and, as far as I could find out, nothing more was done.  There was no follow-up by the medical officer of health or his staff to check up on the people in that house to try and induce them, as far as he possibly could, to be thoroughly examined, X-rayed and so on.  I am afraid that is not done as well as it should be.</P>
    <P>As regards institutional treatment, the Minister gave us some facts with regard to sanatoria, but I want to know what exactly has been done during the last four or five months in regard to additional buildings.  I am just working from recollection if you like, but near Galway&mdash;I forget the name of the place&mdash;when I visited it last autumn there was one of those 40-bed units occupied.  I should say <Col N="2299" /> that the 40-bed unit is a very impressive type of building for the treatment of tuberculosis.  They were about to build another.  I do not know whether it has been completed since or not, or what progress has been made with regard to that second unit.  I had correspondence with some other institutions when I was in the Department.  We were endeavouring to get Peamount to put up three of these 40-bed units, and Newcastle to put up two.  That would be five between the two institutions.  I do not know what has been done since. There was some delay about a contract. I do not know whether that difficulty has been got over or not, or whether any progress has been made with regard to these additional units&mdash; the 120 extra beds at Peamount and the 80 extra at Newcastle.  Lourdes provided 43 beds.  I think they had been completed before the 18th February, and Rialto provided 80.  They were definitely completed before the 18th February.  I also met the Board of St. Laurence's Hospital, which undertook to provide 60 beds and also a thoracic unit.  I do not know what progress has been made.  I thought there would be no avoidable delay in providing those beds in the hospital.</P>
    <P>Then there were some houses.  There was a house in Killybegs.  I did not see it, but I believe it was particularly suitable for this purpose.  It was taken over nearly 12 months ago.  Some progress, I understand, had been made before I left the Department in converting it into a sanatorium.  I would like to know whether it is near completion or when we may hope to have it occupied by tubercular patients.  An agreement was also reached before I left in regard to the handing over of the property at Castlerea.  Some delay was caused there because some of the employees at Castlerea thought they were going to be victimised.  There was some short delay in dealing with that matter just before I left, but I understood from the Minister's speech that Castlerea has been handed over and is occupied&mdash;that it has been completed within the last four or five months.  There were some other houses as well.  There was a house near Waterford; there was Kilcreene <Col N="2300" /> House, near Kilkenny, and a house called St. Patrick's, at Sligo.  Last September or October I saw the house in Sligo.  It seemed to me to be very suitable, if certain alterations were carried out.  I was told that the houses in Waterford and Kilkenny were also very suitable.  I would like to know what has been done to convert them and what progress has been made in the last four or five months in that respect.</P>
    <P>Now, apart from beds&mdash;these were extra beds that we were hoping to get &mdash;we had other schemes on hands.  I think at Lourdes a new theatre and a new thoracic unit, and at Peamount a new theatre, were to be provided.  A new thoracic unit was also to be provided at St. Laurence's and I would like to know what the programme in this connection is.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister succeeded in getting St. Mobhi's.  I tried to get it and failed.  The Minister for Defence at the time very naturally said to me: &ldquo;If you can find an alternative place for the training school and if they are satisfied, you can have St. Mobhi's.&rdquo;  I failed, however, to find an alternative place and the Minister is very fortunate in getting St. Mobhi's.</P>
    <P>There were plans for three large sanatoria&mdash;a long-term plan&mdash;for Dublin, Cork and Galway.  I think that the last scheme or the last idea in regard to that matter was that there should be 1,200 beds in Dublin, 800 beds in Cork and 500 in Galway.  I saw the sites and the development work in Galway, and when I was leaving the Department my recollection was that we could expect Galway to be ready in three years and the other two to be ready in five years.  I would like to know if there has been any improvement on that schedule since the Minister took over office, and if he could give us any idea of what is likely to happen with regard to these three sanatoria.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave answers in the Dáil lately about the site for a nurses' home at Newcastle.  When I was in the Department, the committee were negotiating and trying to secure a field beside them which they thought was very <Col N="2301" /> dear.  But if the information given by the Minister, coupled with the rumours we have heard, is true, the price per acre for the farm which is now sanctioned is as much as the price per acre of the field which was beside the sanatorium. The field would have been convenient because it adjoins the sanatorium and it would give an opportunity to the sanatorium of becoming a larger institution and also of having a larger nurses' home.  I would like to know why this change was made from the field which they were trying to purchase to this farm which lies at a distance of 1½ miles from the sanatorium and which could not possibly be a suitable place for a nurses' home except at great expense for transport to shift nurses back and forward at the end of each term of duty.</P>
    <P>The death rate is undoubtedly too high.  The Minister gave the death rate and also gave a comparison with other countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain, showing that the death rate here is twice as high as it is in some other countries.  At any rate it is perhaps an advantage to discuss these matters when we are here face to face and where we are not talking to ignorant people, as the Minister probably was talking during the election campaign when he charged us with criminal neglect in letting 60,000 people die during the last 16 years.  It must be evident to anybody that no matter how successful or efficient we were in this country, we could not stamp out tuberculosis at the present state of medical science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because nobody has done it.  The most we could hope to do is to reach the same state of efficiency as exists in New Zealand, Denmark and other countries.  If we reached that very high state of efficiency we should have had half the deaths.  The Minister said yesterday, when he was talking to people who know the difference, that it takes time to get a scheme going, but he did not give us any time.  He thought that we should have stopped the deaths from the time we took over office and he attributes all these 60,000 deaths <Col N="2302" /> to us, and accuses us of criminal neglect for having let them die.  When he is talking to people who know the difference and who will not swallow that kind of talk, the people here in the Dáil, he does not say that.  The success of the campaign against tuberculosis, as the Minister has said, requires the health of everybody, and undoubtedly that health will be got, but it would be better not to make it a political question.  Better not say &ldquo;the Fianna Fáil Party were guilty of criminal neglect in letting everybody die, but I will let nobody die.&rdquo;  If you say &ldquo;Fianna Fáil were too slow and I am going to be quicker,&rdquo; then I will say &ldquo;more power to you.&rdquo;  If the present Government are able to go quicker and if they are more successful, they will have our support in trying to stamp tuberculosis out.</P>
      <P>There is no use in telling us what is wrong, that people were dying of tuberculosis or that Fianna Fáil did nothing.  What we want to know is what is going to be done.  When we know exactly what is going to be done we can offer our co-operation as far as it is required and there will be no stinting in stamping out disease.</P>
      <P>When he was dealing with hospitals and with regional hospitals, he went on to talk about special hospitals and first he mentioned sanatoria for tuberculosis, but there are other special hospitals too.  I was in Cork last September and saw the foundations which had been laid for a fever hospital and a very elaborate institution it will be when it is finished.  All the clearance work, all the development work has been done; all the passages underneath are done; the wires for electricity are there, the sewerage is laid; the walls are built to a height of three or four feet and the work was stopped on it at the beginning of the emergency. I suggested to the county manager that he should finish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is great difference between the number of people who want treatment in a fever hospital now and the number who wanted it even ten or 12 years ago, because the incidence of fever has gone down very much, but this is a building that could be proceeded with and completed very much quicker than by starting on a <Col N="2303" /> virgin site, and it would be a pity not to finish it even if part of it were to be used for other purposes, even perhaps for tuberculosis.  I would like to know what is being done about that, and if the Minister endorses the advice which I gave to the county manager, that he should proceed with this hospital and have it completed.  I might say that on that same tour I also advised the building of a regional hospital in Galway.  I discussed the plans and I advised the people to go ahead at Galway and also in Limerick. The plans for a regional hospital in Cork are not so far advanced.  The Cork people found it hard to come to a definite decision as to a regional hospital or a maternity hospital; whether they should be built on the same site or on different sites, and if they were to be divided, where exactly they would be.  I do not know if they have come to a definite conclusion since, but I would like to know what is the Minister's idea with regard to proceeding with these regional hospitals.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister made it fairly plain that he did not favour the building of hospitals in Dublin.  I think he said Dublin was fairly well catered for in the matter of hospitals. There is one, however, that I think would hardly pass the test, and that is the Coombe Hospital.  That hospital is not a modern one by any means.  It does very good work.  In fact, I think its work will compare with that of any maternity hospital in any country. But the staff there are working under very adverse conditions and they want to build a new hospital.  They had been negotiating for a certain site when I left the Department and I should like to know whether they got the site and, if so, whether or not the building of the new hospital is to proceed.</P>
    <P>I also met the staff of St. Vincent's Hospital.  They wanted to build a new hospital and I had given them every encouragement.  The same thing applies to a new wing for the Meath Hospital, which, I think, is urgently needed for a particular branch of surgery carried on there, namely, <Col N="2304" /><i>genito urinary</i> surgery, which should be encouraged and every facility given to the staff there to go on with the good work they are doing.  I also had a talk with the commissioner of the Dublin Board of Assistance about, let us say, the county home part of St. Kevin's.  I authorised him, so far as my authority was needed, to proceed with plans for the building of a home to take everybody away from that institution except the acute medical and surgical cases, that is hospital cases.  I do not know what progress has been made in regard to that, but I think it does require as much attention as any other county home in the country.  It would be a good thing if something were done to provide a decent building somewhere else to receive these people.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of county homes, generally there are three classes of people concerned, and I am afraid that to deal with the question of county homes properly and in a comprehensive way we would have to take these three classes separately. In practically every county home&mdash;not all&mdash;there are unmarried mothers with babies, there are the mentally deficient, and there are the old and infirm.  Many people have the idea that these county homes are housing the old and infirm only.  In fact, as the Minister mentioned, there are in these homes people who should be really in hospital or in a sanatorium, people, say, suffering from a fairly chronic type of tuberculosis.  I am afraid these three classes will have to be dealt with separately if we are to deal with county homes properly.  There are at least three or more special institutions of different kinds for unmarried mothers with babies and they are very well run by a special order of nuns. It is a great pity there are not more of these institutions in the country.  In fact, it is a great pity there is not a sufficient number of special homes of this kind to take all the unmarried mothers with their children out of the county homes.  That, I think, is the only solution as far as that particular class is concerned.</P>
    <P>Then there are the mental defectives. So far as I remember it was estimated that there are about 6,000 mental defectives <Col N="2305" /> in the country who should receive institutional treatment.  Those who are in the county homes are not getting proper treatment.  They are being taken care of, but they are not getting the educational and medical treatment that they should get. The difficulty about these mental defectives is, first of all, that you must have different homes for the different classes of mental defectives. There are at least three grades according to the seriousness of the trouble and they should be kept in these separate grades.  In fact, if you could make more than three grades, it would be better still.  That would mean a number of homes.  In any case, you should not have too many people in one of these mental defective homes.  The smaller the number is the better.  50 or 60 or 80 would be very much more preferable than 200 or 300.  Therefore, we require a great number of institutions for these mental defectives.  We have some of these institutions and they are doing very good work.  A certain number of these mental defectives if taken in time could be educated sufficiently to earn a living.  If, of course, they are not taken in time or not trained in that way, they are a burden on the community and on themselves also.  It is a pity therefore that we cannot provide those institutions which are necessary for the mental defectives.  Then you have the middle grade of mental defectives who, with a certain amount of training, could at least be educated to look after themselves.  There is also the third grade who are not capable of looking after themselves and must be looked after by somebody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he intended to introduce a Bill.  A Bill has been on the stocks in the Department of Health for some time.  It is well over 12 months since the Bill was prepared, but it was postponed for various reasons, one of them being that we had to try to get going with some programme for the provision of these institutions before there was any necessity to bring in a Bill.  After all, there is no use in bringing in a Bill one of the provisions of which would be to enable local authorities to send those children to institutions unless the institutions <Col N="2306" /> are available, and they are not available.  There may be other provisions in the Bill which may be useful, and it may be no harm to bring it along, even if certain provisions of it cannot be implemented at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The third class and the class which everybody thinks of in these institutions is the old and infirm.  There are many suggestions about what you should do with these old and infirm people.  It always appeared to me that the most sensible suggestion is to get rid of as many of them as you can to their own relatives.  In many cases the difficulty is that the relatives cannot afford to keep them.  These old people are costing a great deal in these institutions and, looking at the matter purely from the economic point of view, it might be just as cheap to pay considerably more to the relatives than has been offered before, so that they might take these old persons back home again.</P>
    <P>Apart from the economic point of view, in some cases I am sure the old people would much prefer to be with a close relative than in one of these institutions.  Of course, if they did not want to leave the institution they could remain there.  In most cases, however, they would prefer to be with their relatives and provision should be made for paying a higher contribution to those relatives to take him or her, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>A suggestion which I must say I would favour very much, if it were practicable and workable, would be to make much smaller rooms in these county homes.  Unoccupied country mansions could be taken over and properly renovated to hold 16 or 20 old people.  A matron would be required, but hardly any other staff would be necessary, because these old people would do most of their own work in the way of looking after the house, the fires and so forth.  I honestly think that the scheme could be worked economically in the case of those who are able to potter around&mdash;those who are able to be up every day and look after themselves and carry out the house duties.</P>
    <P>Another system would be the colony system&mdash;to have a number of small cottages <Col N="2307" /> in an area where the old married couple, or three or four men or three or four women, might live, and have a common dining-room and reading room. The other idea would be to stick to the county home and to improve it as much as possible.  Whatever is done, however, will not be done in a day or a month, or even in a year or two except, of course, the scheme of paying the relatives a higher contribution to take them out.  In the meantime a great deal could be done to improve the position.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into what the Minister has said to his political adherents in regard to county homes except to point out that they have not the same beds.  As a matter of fact, in 1847 they slept on straw.  In the old county homes you will see a platform where the straw was shaken down and on which the people slept.  Since then the beds were introduced.  Further, the people in the county homes are not getting soup two or three times a day except for some special reason. The dietary is not bad.  As far as I can find out there is little difference in the dietary of the county homes and that of the county hospitals.  If, however, there is anything wrong there is no necessity for the Minister to go down to Galway to talk to the remnants of his organisation there because he has the power to right the matter himself. No local authority, I am quite sure, will refuse to treat their county home patients better if the Minister says he will pay for it.  Under the schedule of health services he does, in fact, pay for anything extra spent by the local authority on health.</P>
    <P>There is no need for the Minister to complain any more about the county homes.  He has only to advise them to treat the patients better and to see that it is paid for.  I am sure some of the counties will resent a statement of that kind.  Take, for instance, my native county&mdash;County Wexford.  Of course, you may not have had the advantage of seeing what a county home was like 30 years ago, but if you had and if you look at the county home in Wexford as it is to-day you will be surprised that a responsible <Col N="2308" /> man such as the Minister would make the statement he made.  Take even the poorest county in Ireland&mdash;I hope I am not offending anyone when I say Leitrim&mdash;and look at the county home there.  It is a splendid institution compared with what county homes were like ten, 20, 30 or 35 years ago.  The whole place has been renovated and made cheerful and it is as good now as, I think, any county home could be made.  The statement was, therefore, entirely unjustifiable.  If the statement was made, let us say, because something was wrong and if the Minister wants to improve matters, both as regards food and bedding, the remedy is in his own hands.</P>
    <P>A Children's Bill was being prepared in the Department.  I want to know what progress is being made in that connection.  I was very interested in it, because I consider that the whole law with regard to boarded-out children and all children under the Children's Act and so forth is entirely out of date.  I was very keen on having that Bill prepared.  I should like to know whether the Minister has been presented with that Bill; and, if so, whether he intends to go on with it or not.</P>
    <P>We have talked about good food, good housing, better treatment and other things, but, as the Minister himself has said, a very important thing is the personnel.  We must have men with good medical knowledge and we have them in this country.  No matter how good a man may be, if he is in a dispensary and cut away from colleges and central hospitals he has no opportunity of keeping up with modern scientific thought, of learning new ways of diagnosing and of treating the patients, and he must, therefore, get an opportunity of post-graduate study from time to time.  I hope that the scheme which has been in force for some time to provide an opportunity for post-graduate study for such men will be continued and intensified.  In this connection I would include post-graduate courses in special lines, such as diseases, from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to know that the plan to provide higher training for our younger surgeons, which was inaugurated <Col N="2309" /> some considerable time ago, is being proceeded with.  Up to this if a man did well in his final in surgery and had a taste for it he got a certain amount of training as a house surgeon, but he had to go foreign in order to get more experience.  There would be no necessity for that if we were to provide our own facilities.  There is no reason why we should not provide facilities in places such as St. Kevin's, where we have surgeons as good as are to be found anywhere.  We should provide the facilities to enable these surgeons do their training here.  I am very glad to know that that scheme is being proceeded with and that we may expect our young men to train here in future&mdash;that is, if they want to do their training here; they can go foreign if they like.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Health the scheme of sending these medical officers of health to foreign countries was inaugurated.  The countries in question at the time were Canada, Denmark, Sweden and, perhaps, Great Briain.  Two men would be sent, say, to Canada for six months or longer if necessary, and they would get their experience there.  They would learn all about any medical advances, in addition to organisation service which is a very important training for a medical officer of health.  They would be able to compare notes when they came back of what is being done in the various countries and in that way we would be able to get the best services in all the countries for our own country.</P>
    <P>There was also a scheme for the training of nurses for higher posts. There is no such thing in this country that I am aware of as training nurses to be matrons, assistant matrons and sisters.  That training could be provided also in St. Kevin's in its post-graduate school in addition to the training of the young surgeons.  I hope that that will be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a publicity officer.  When I was building up the Department of Health, in addition to having a secretary, an assistant secretary and three, four or five principal officers there was to be a publicity officer.  I did not get him in time and I went out, but he is the first man the <Col N="2310" /> Minister got and he has a Supplementary Estimate in here to pay him.  A publicity officer is required in order to keep disseminating knowledge to the public about keeping healthy and the avoidance of certain diseases.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that he will be employed to do something other than what he has been doing up to this, as we have not heard anything from him except what the Minister is saying down the country.  I hope he will get us some more useful information as time goes on.  Last year, I felt at one time, it was a pity we had not got a propaganda officer at the time that the anterio poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, looked like making headway here.  At any rate, the medical staff in the Department of Health, in co-operation with the medical officers of health in the counties, dealt with that outbreak of infantile paralysis very efficiently.  They had a technique different from that adopted in other countries near us, but evidently it was the right technique, as the disease did not spread here.  Great credit is due to the medical men in the Department and to the medical officers of health, for that reason.</P>
    <P>I would like to have heard a little more about medical education, but I think the Minister has not got the information yet.  As soon as the committee dealing with that makes its report, I hope that we will have the benefit of the report as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Hospital Fund is not as high as we would like it to be, but I think it was quite evident to anybody for the last few years that some time or other the expenditure on the building of hospitals and institutions of that kind would outstrip the income from the Hospital Fund and that something would have to be done to bridge the gap.  No one would suggest that we should stop when that money had run out&mdash;everyone would agree that the State would have to provide it.  There is no use in worrying about this Hospital Fund.  As long as it is there, well and good; when it runs out, let the State provide the money, as we must go on.  In that connection, I am disappointed with the Minister's target <Col N="2311" /> of spending about £10,000,000 in seven years.  In the White Paper we issued, we thought about £37,000,000 would be required to give us all the hospitals and sanatoria that would be needed.  We thought we could possibly make a great impression on that&mdash; though not complete it&mdash;in ten years. We should not stop for want of finance.  Materials and workers may be a little scarce, but that will pass.  We should set a higher target and reach it as soon as possible.  I can assure the Minister that if he comes back here looking for more money for health services, as far as we are concerned he will get it.</P>
    <P>Regarding local health authorities, I do not think the position is very satisfactory, as the county councils really have not time to deal with health as well as everything else.  I would have proceeded to get a board of health of some sort in every county, appointed more or less on the same lines as the county committee of agriculture, and that board would look after health matters and be responsible for them. I wonder if the Minister has thought about that matter and, if so, what his opinion is.</P>
    <P>No one would suggest either voting against an Estimate for health or cutting it down in any way.  The only criticism anyone would have for a Minister for Health, whoever he may be, is that he is not spending enough money, and I am sure that is the general criticism the Minister will deal with in replying to this debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the statement which he has made to-night, and also Deputy Dr. Ryan on his lucid and detailed enunciation of certain matters &mdash;even if he did not agree entirely with the views which the Minister has expressed. It seems to me to be a fair intrepretation of the Minister's statement to divide it into three categories &mdash;prevention, treatment and cure.  It is under these three headings that I wish to make some observations on what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> The earlier part of his statement referred to what, in medical terms, is known as prophylaxis, the prevention of disease.  He has enunciated to the House certain proposals which he hopes to put into practice with a view to preventing disease.  Some of the means by which these proposals will be put into effect are already in existence, some he proposes to modify, and others to change a good deal.  In general, the Minister's statement dealt with something new, as many of the things he said were revolutionary&mdash;or, if not entirely deserving of that word, they were capable of being interpreted as being suggestive of his determination to make radical changes in the administration of his Department, particularly in regard to the dispensary services and possibly in regard to hospitalisation.  I hope that any changes he may propose to make in the administration of hospitals will not affect the traditional method of administration&mdash;generally and in principle&mdash;which has prevailed in voluntary hospitals.  I move to report progress.</P>
