      <P>In the 12 months prior to November, 1948, 660 complaints were received by the board in connection with registered hotels and guest houses.  In 219 cases the complaints were considered well founded and appropriate action was taken with the hotel and guest house proprietors concerned.  In 285 cases, the explanations furnished by the proprietors of registered premises were considered satisfactory and in the remaining 156 cases the evidence offered by the complainants could not be accepted by the board as conclusive.  In approximately 100 cases of complaint about overcharges, refunds were made to the complainants by the establishments involved.</P>

Salaries, wages and operation expenses generally in respect of the Fáilte hotels were paid by Fáilte Teoranta, and I am not in a position to give the information sought by the Deputy until I receive the accounts of this company which are at present being audited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he <Col N="149" /> is aware that the prices of non-essential goods in plentiful supply have not been substantially reduced, and if he will now consider taking positive steps towards reducing the prices of such goods which indirectly maintain the high cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the most effective action to regulate the prices of goods which are clearly of a non-essential type, and which are in plentiful supply, can be taken by the public, who, by a refusal to pay exorbitant prices for such goods, can fully safeguard their own interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, while oats of good quality has been sold to millers at £15 per ton, the present wholesale price of flake oatmeal is £45 17s. 6d. per ton; and, if so, whether the wholesale price of flake oatmeal is fixed with his authority, and why is it thought necessary to permit a wholesaler to charge for flake oatmeal three times the price paid for oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The wholesale and retail prices of oatmeal are not now controlled.  I understand, however, that the wholesale price for six-ton lots charged by the oatmeal millers is appreciably lower than the price of £45 17s. 6d. per ton referred to by the Deputy.  On the basis of a 50 per cent. extraction, two tons of oats are necessary for the production of one ton of oatmeal and this fact together with <Col N="150" /> conversion and distribution costs explains the differential which normally exists between the price of oats and the price of oatmeal.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that I am not satisfied that the existing wholesale and retail prices of oatmeal are reasonable, having regard to the price which is paid for oats and I am having further inquiries made in the matter.  For the purpose of these inquiries I should be glad if the Deputy would give me particulars of cases where a wholesale price of £45 17s. 6d. a ton is being charged for oatmeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, as a result of an Order made by him, farmers in the Castlecove and Caherdaniel areas, County Kerry, are prevented from obtaining sea sand as manure from the foreshore at Glenbeg; and, if so, whether, in view of the great loss of this natural fertiliser to the farmers concerned, he will have the Order revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>An Order has not been made prohibiting the removal of beach materials from the foreshore at Glenbeg.  A licence under the Foreshore Act, 1933, is required for the removal of any beach material, including sand, from below the high water mark on State-owned foreshore, which includes Glenbeg.  An inspection of this area has recently been carried out and <Col N="151" /> I have been advised that unrestricted removals of sand have caused an acceleration of the natural erosion which is taking place.  To avoid undue hardship arrangements have been made to grant licences, on application, to farmers living in the adjoining eight townlands to make removals of sand for use on their own lands, seaward of a line 60 feet below the high water mark.  A number of licences has already been granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has any further statement to make in regard to the stoppage of the hand-woven tweed parcel post trade to Great Britain; whether he has received reports as to the amount of stock in hand at present unsaleable and whether he has made further representations to the British Government with a view to easing these restrictions particularly having regard to the fact that control over the distribution of clothing in Great Britain has been constantly decreased during the last six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to restrict parcel post exports of hand-woven tweeds to Great Britain was taken because it was not possible otherwise to secure the admission of these tweeds into Great Britain on a commercial basis.  The importation of hand-woven tweeds by private individuals, other than as genuine gifts, was a breach of British rationing and import regulations.</P>
      <P>This decision does not affect the concession whereby tourists returning home from a holiday in this country are permitted to take with them reasonable quantities of hand-woven tweed at the discretion of the customs officer at the point of exit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am aware, no difficulty is being experienced by British importers in securing licences for the importation of Irish tweed through commercial channels.  I am informed, however, that difficulty is being experienced in selling hand-woven <Col N="152" /> tweed commercially in Great Britain because of the heavy incidence of purchase tax thereon, and of the ample supplies of competitive cloths available there.  These cloths, including Harris tweed, are subject to the same rate of purchase tax as Irish hand-woven tweeds.</P>
    <P>I have no information as to the stocks held by traders and persons other than Gaeltarra Eireann.  I have not made further representations to the British authorities with a view to easing the restrictions applicable to the parcel post trade, as I am satisfied that no purpose would be served by doing so. I am considering whether any other steps can be taken with a view to developing export markets for these tweeds.</P>

    <P>(2)  It is believed that, for the specified months of 1948, the numbers of travel identity cards and passports granted to persons to take up permanent residence abroad form a small proportion of the total.</P>
    <P>(3)  There is no official information as to how many of the persons to whom such permits, cards or passports were granted actually went abroad.</P>
    <P>(4)  In addition to persons who actually went abroad on the travel permits, travel identity cards and passports shown in the table above, an unknown number of persons who already held a permit, identity card or passport may have gone abroad once or more times during the months specified. The period of validity of travel permits, travel identity cards and passports is five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the housing schemes of local authorities are concerned, it is a statutory condition governing the payment of State subsidy that throughout the erection of the houses rates of wages must have been paid and conditions of labour observed at least as advantageous to the persons employed in such erection as the appropriate rates of wages and conditions of labour generally recognised by trade unions at the commencement of the scheme.  This requirement applies to all local authorities.  A typical clause used is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;RATES OF WAGES:&mdash; The contractor shall pay the rates of wages and observe conditions of labour at least as advantageous to the persons employed by him under this contract as the appropriate standard rates of wages and conditions of labour generally recognised by trade unions in the district in which the work is carried out.  Where there are no such rates of wages or conditions recognised or prevailing in the district, those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar, shall be recognised.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In so far as other works are concerned, the insertion of a fair wages clause is not made a condition for the payment of grants from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, but in fact a clause having the same effect is normally included in the conditions of contract, and local authorities are encouraged to include such a clause in contracts for all works.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether on Monday, November 8th last, he was present in Naas at a conference which included members of the Kildare County Council and other public bodies, together with officials of these local authorities and members of the general public; whether on this occasion he made an attack upon the county manager of Carlow and Kildare, alleging that the bad housing conditions in County Kildare were due to neglect of his duties by the official in question, and that he could not be found on several occasions when he was wanted; whether this attack on the county manager evoked protests from the numerous public representatives present, and whether the Minister requested the representatives of the Press who were present not to publish his statements; and, further, what reparation he proposes to make to the manager for the grave wrong which he has done him, and whether, in particular, he will now withdraw the allegations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present at a housing conference in Naas on the occasion indicated in the question, but I made no &ldquo;attack&rdquo; on the county manager. I said that I had received complaints as to delays in the expeditious selection and purchase of sites and the carrying out of various other urgent items of business incidental to the preparation of the new housing programme in the county for which it was alleged the county manager might be held responsible. Deputy Harris (who presided over the conference) and other public representatives intervened to state that they had no knowledge of the circumstances to which I alluded, and I replied that I had deemed it essential to mention the position as represented to me, as it could have been an important factor in the slow rate of <Col N="162" /> progress displayed by the county council in resuming the housing drive which they had so creditably maintained up to 1939 and to some extent during the emergency.</P>
      <P>These housing conferences are devoted to informal discussions with the local representatives and local officers.  I am not aware that members of the general public were present at the Naas conference.</P>
      <P>The representatives of the Press are accorded admission to the conferences, but they are relied on to use discretion as to the extent to which the proceedings should be reported.  I was most careful to ask the Press representatives at Naas to treat my remarks on that occasion as confidential and they willingly complied with my request.</P>

      <P>Pedestrian traffic throughout the country is already regulated by the general by-laws made for the control of traffic.  These by-laws provide that a pedestrian is entitled to the right of way at pedestrian crossings, while vehicle users have the right of way over the rest of the roadway.  Furthermore, at a junction controlled by a pointsman or traffic lights, a pedestrian is required to follow the direction of the pointsman or lights, and is forbidden to cross other than by way of a pedestrian crossing where such exists. When crossing the roadway at such a junction, he must not remain on the roadway longer than is reasonably necessary.</P>
      <P>There is power to supplement these general provisions by having local by-laws made where necessary.  It is open to any local authority to approach the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with a view to having such by-laws made.  They have, in fact, been made for a number of urban areas.  In each case it is made an offence to cross a road or street where a crossing place for pedestrians exists within a distance of 50 feet on either side from such crossing place.</P>

      <P>The detailed schedule of accommodation for the proposed hospital at Caherciveen, which was received in my Department on 25th October, is at present under examination and I expect that I will be able to convey my views on this document to the local authority shortly.  I share the Deputy's anxiety to see that planning is completed and work started on this project with the least possible delay.  Considering, however, the many years of service which the new hospital may be expected to give it is important that the plans should be carefully examined at every stage to see that the hospital will be built, and can be run, economically.  I can assure the Deputy that the examination of the plans in my Department will be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Deputy Rooney yesterday, the question of granting increases in the pensions paid to national teachers has been under urgent and sympathetic consideration by the Government for some time past.  The delay in completing the review in this matter and announcing a decision arises from the fact that it is part of a general pension problem, and that it can only be decided in the light of the budgetary position for next year, which is at present under examination.</P>

Except for the stipulation that only bullock and heifer beef must be canned to meet the requirements of the Jewish ritual, the Department has laid down no conditions as regards the type of cattle to be used or the system of purchase of the animals by the association.

      <P>I am not aware that grants are available for Six County fishermen generally for the purchase of fishing boats, but grants are, I understand, provided in certain cases for ex-servicemen.  At present the rules of the Sea Fisheries Association permit acceptance by the directors of a minimum deposit of 10 per cent. in respect of a hire purchase transaction, where the circumstances of a particular applicant are such as to warrant this course.  The directors deal with each case on its merits as sympathetically as possible and I consider that the existing arrangements afford very reasonable facilities for the acquisition of boats by fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

The maximum prices in accordance with the Emergency Powers (Fish) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1944, which our fishermen may receive on the wholesale market for such fish are 9/4 per stone for large and 7/- per stone for small fish.  The actual prices within these maxima received by fishermen naturally depend on supply and demand. Considerable quantities of whiting have been marketed through the Dublin Wholesale Fish Market in recent weeks as is usual at this time of year and consequently prices have on occasion reached comparatively low levels, especially for small or ungutted fish. In the circumstances, action on my part as suggested by the Deputy is not called for.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Concerned for the future of production and employment in agriculture, Dáil Éireann disapproves of the Government's conduct of agricultural policy.&mdash;(Patrick Smith, Séamas Ó Riain).</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Agriculture (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes for which I took up the time of the House last night, I was expressing my personal resentment at the amount of time the Deputy introducing this motion devoted to a personal attack on his successor in the office of Minister for Agriculture.  It is well known and generally accepted that nobody likes his own successor, but that is no justification for devoting, on an important occasion of this kind, so much time and <Col N="182" /> so much venom to that line of argument. I also deplored the bankruptcy of policy in that statement by the Deputy moving this resolution.  There was not an argument used that was deserving of a reply and not one single suggestion was made as to how any of the evils, real or imaginary, which affect agriculture at present might be remedied &mdash; not one suggestion from a person who held the portfolio of Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Any cheapjack could get up anywhere to ventilate, exploit and exaggerate temporary conditions affecting any branch, important or otherwise of any particular industry; but we would be entitled to expect that, if a motion is to be moved asking for a vote of no confidence in the present Administration because of the agricultural conditions, at least there is some little responsibility on the mover of such a resolution to make some slight suggestion as to how the particular situation could be eased or how the disability or grievance could be removed.  What we did get last night unquestionably was very acute resentment, because, in fact, certain steps were taken to alleviate certain unfavourable conditions which heretofore prevailed and, of course, the suggestion had to be made that these active measures were taken because Deputy Smith had put down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be fair to everyone.  There are more agriculturists in this Assembly than Deputy Smith and there are certain farming Deputies in this Assembly who were moving actively and energetically in the matter of calling attention to these conditions long before a by-election arose and long before the Deputy opposite thought it politically expedient to put down this motion. Those Deputies, being genuine representatives of the farming community and not just political playboys playing around the farming community, were overjoyed and cheered up by the fact that certain measures, be they effective wholly or in part, are being taken to deal with the situation.  The Deputy, on the other hand, was bitterly disappointed &mdash; he would love if the bottom fell out of the market.  There is more <Col N="183" /> oats being threshed on Fianna Fáil platforms and in the Fianna Fáil papers than in fact is going to the mills at the moment, and that is the trouble we had to meet.</P>
    <P>When we come to discuss the policy of any Department which it is proposed to condemn, it is well, in the first place, to grasp the significance of the policy which it is proposed to condemn and, above all, the significance of the change in policy that took place when Deputy Dillon replaced Deputy Smith.  In examining the situation of any industry in relation to the State, or in relation to the activities or outlook of the political head of the Department, the first thing to grasp and understand is the concept of the relations between the farmer and the political head of the Department according to the person who fills that office.</P>
    <P>The concept over the past 16 years of the relationship between farmer and State was that the State exercised a kind of overlordship, that the State had a right to coerce, to compel, to supervise, to direct, to control; that the farmer was no better than a conscript labourer in the bounds of his own farm; and around the bounds of that farm, the gates should be opened at all times to allow easy entry for regiments of inspectors and supervisors and inquisitors of one kind or another.  That was the concept of the relationship between farmer and State that existed in Deputy Smith's time.  Deputy Dillon, when he took over, with the blood in his veins of forebears who had fought down through the generations for tenant ownership of the land, for fixity of tenure in the land, fought with fervour to place the farmer solidly, strongly and soundly on the land, his spirit revolted against all that type of thing and one of his first steps, and the keystone of his outlook on agriculture and consequently of his policy was that there had to be a complete change in the relations between State and farmer.</P>
    <P>What was the point in abolishing landlordism &mdash; some of it good, some of it bad, some of it indifferent&mdash;if we <Col N="184" /> were to put in its place a mighty landlordism far more ruthless and with far more coercive authority than any of the landlords of the past, which fortunately we got rid of?  That was a standpoint from which Deputy Dillon proceeded to develop his policy.  His conception of the functions of a Department of Agriculture was, not that they were a controlling and a directing force, but that they were there in an advisory capacity, to help, to advise, to participate where necessary in the education in agricultural outlook, to carry out scientific examination on behalf of the farmer, but after that to leave it to the farmer to develop his own enonomy in his own way&mdash; subject always to the over-riding consideration of the responsibility of the farmer to his brother man and to his country.  Deputy Dillon, unlike his predecessors, had enough trust in the patriotism and the sense of responsibility of Irish farmers to leave it to them as free men to face up to their own responsibilities and to their obligations to their neighbours.  That was the starting point of distinction and difference between the present Administration and the past.</P>
    <P>He accepted, too &mdash; and every one of his colleagues accepts &mdash; the fact that there is a far bigger obligation than that on the head of the Department of Agriculture and on the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues in the Government as a whole &mdash; that is, that it is not sufficient for them just to leave it to the farmer to go his own way and work out his own salvation and his own economy as best he can, but that there is in the modern world a very direct and distinct responsibility on Government, and a peculiar responsibility on the Minister for Agriculture, day in and day out, to make every possible effort at home and abroad to find new markets and more new markets, at better and better prices, for the agricultural community dependent for them on the Minister or the Ministers.</P>
    <P>Again, unlike our predecessors, his outlook and our outlook was that that work had to be done by Ministers meeting Ministers, assisted by civil servants, rather than by civil servants meeting other civil servants and <Col N="185" /> unassisted by Ministers.  One of the things that was preached, day in and day out, in the years gone by against that Administration was that the work of international trade and commerce should be done between countries at Ministerial level assisted by civil servants, rather than by civil servants unassisted by Ministers, as was the régime in the past.  That has been completely changed; and ever since the new Administration took over, there is not a single Minister concerned with any Department, Agriculture, Industry or Commerce, who has not seized at every available opportunity to contact Ministers in other countries, with a view to securing new and better and more extensive markets for our people.</P>
    <P>In that respect, the Minister for Agriculture has received very constant assistance from the Minister for External Affairs, who has frequently, in the course of his duty, met Ministers from most of the countries of Western Europe and from the different countries making up the Continent of America.  Never in any of those contacts has he missed an opportunity to try and further develop agricultural and other forms of industrial trade.  It has always been, in Opposition and in Government, the contention of the present Minister for Agriculture that the agricultural industry of this country could not continue balancing on the pinpoint of insincerity, dependent on the whims of markets, the whims of men and the whims of weather.  Our agricultural industry, if ever it is to get on an even keel, can only do so around a policy where the farmer would have some idea before his crop was sown, where and how and when he was likely to find a purchaser for it.  The Deputy looks up. Of course, there is more oats in the Deputy's brain than there is in the markets.  Of course, his interruption is going to be: &ldquo;Oats,&rdquo; and I am going to feed the Deputy with oats when we come to it.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that at home and abroad the present Minister has done his bit in trying to get a reasonable price fixed and a reasonable export market over a reasonable number <Col N="186" /> of years.  That policy is only in its infancy but that policy is going to be further extended and developed so as to meet the requirements of more commodities than are covered at the present moment.  I ask any individual, in any part of the House, is there anything to condemn in that outlook?  Is there anything in that particular outlook to justify a vote of no-confidence? Is it sufficient justification that one person does not like another person? Is there anything wrong with the policy of price fixation?  Is there anything wrong at aiming at, and making, a long term trade arrangement governing agricultural produce over a number of years, as long as ever we can make it? Is there anything wrong with the expressed determination to continue going that particular road and blazing that particular trail?  If there is nothing wrong with it, surely that particular outlook is one we have to support and if it is not, in the mind of anyone, worthy of support surely it is worthy of being given a chance.  That is the outlook and that is the concept of the relative position of the farmer and the State that we are asked to condemn.</P>
    <P>In the process of shaping our agricultural policy with regard to the present and the future, the Minister never fell into the mistake of making us think in relation to agriculture that it was merely a question of the land under the farmers' feet and the farmer over the land.  In his outlook on agriculture, continuously expressed and repeated time and again, he has always stated that in a policy with regard to the welfare, the progress or the prosperity of agriculture, agriculture must be interpreted as the welfare and prosperity of the farmers who own the land and the welfare and prosperity of the agricultural labourers who work that land.  Time and again he has called attention to the fact that that particular labourer, because of economic circumstances, because of low profits in the past, has been the worst paid worker in the country, although many would contend, and rightly contend, that he was the hardest worked and exposed to the greatest hardship. But that was the position, that we had an agricultural industry in this country <Col N="187" /> that was battened down into the very dirt, for the more land you held the more steeply you got into debt.  The more land you held, the more difficult you found it to carry on in an industry which had reached such a point that it took a world blood-bath to get that industry into any kind of life.  At the moment we are faced with an industry that has got slowly to its knees and painfully to its feet, and the work that remains to be done is to plant as strong a body as possible on that particular pair of feet.  In doing that, if all concerned in the industry were to be catered for, adequately catered for, that particular job could not be done by the leap-frog process of wage increasing and then price increasing and then wage increasing again to get after the prices and so on.  If one were to solve the problem by that particular process, it would be grossly unfair to the remaining members of the community who are dependent on that industry for the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>It has been stated time and again, clearly and emphatically, by the present Minister for Agriculture that the only way in which that particular problem could be solved was not so much by increasing prices as by increasing production and expanding markets, by increasing the produce from every acre on that land and by expanding the volume or the amount of animal life on that land, that it was in that direction he proposed to go and that as far as he could step by step with that increased production and expansion of the number of animals, he would aim step by step at getting more and newer markets, and developing and expanding existing markets.  Is that an outlook to be discouraged, or is it an outlook in agriculture worthy of condemnation? It may not have succeeded in eight months in every direction, but within these eight months it has succeeded in a great many directions, and the energy, the will, the optimism and the ability that succeeded in so many directions can well be relied upon to succeed in the remaining directions.</P>
    <P>One of the first necessaries in facing up to a policy of increased exports <Col N="188" /> and expanding industry, was obviously to provide the requisites for that increased production and for that expansion in the different branches of the industry.  I think it will be agreed all round that the requisites for expansion and production in many directions, constantly referred to, were fertilisers, lime, machines, seeds and maize for feeding stuffs.  The acid test as to what extent progress has been made, as to what extent verbal planning has been followed up by actual accomplishments, can be gauged by the extent of his successful achievement in that direction.  I propose to give for the benefit of the House certain figures showing what has been accomplished in those directions, and to leave it to the sound common sense of the House and the sense of fair play of Deputies to know whether this achievement is worthy of approbation or condemnation.</P>
    <P>With regard to fertilisers, and nobody will deny that the experiences not only of the war years but of the eight years before the war, were that there was a crying, shrieking demand from every acre of land for resuscitation and nourishment in the form of fertilisers.  Here are the imports of fertilisers in the present year as compared with the preceding two years. I am giving them in tons and round figures: Slag, 1946-47, 8,000 tons; 1947-48, 19,000 tons; 1948-49, 25,000 tons. Triple superphosphate: 1946-47, none; 1947-48, 500 tons; 1948-49, 20,000 tons. Fertiphos (a proprietary phosphate fertiliser), 1946-47, none; 1947-48, none; 1948-49, 8,000 tons.  Ground North African phosphate: 1946-47, none; 1947-48, none; 1948-49, 25,000 tons.  That is progress.  That is planning in fact and not in words.  That is energy and thought and action on behalf of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>With regard to nitrogen &mdash; again taking the same three years and again in tons: 1946-47, sulphate of ammonia, 4,500 tons; 1947-48, 24,000 tons; 1948-49, 28,000 tons.  Nitrate of soda: First period, 8,000 tons; second period, 6,000 tons; third period, 9,000 tons.  Sixty per cent. muriate of potash: First period, 12,000 tons; second period, 9,000 tons; third period, 10,000 tons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Fifty per cent. muriate of potash: First period, none; second period, none; third period, 3,000 tons.  Forty per cent. muriate of potash: First period, none; second period, none; third period, 7,000 tons.  Seventeen per cent.: Third period, 4,000 tons.  That is as far as progress is concerned in that direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to lime, there is actually being implemented a plan and a programme to produce 1,000,000 tons of crushed lime for disposal and dispersal annually.  Two huge crushing plants have already been established, and it is the expressed determination of the Minister for Agriculture to extend further in that particular direction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House.  There will be others anxious to speak on different sides, reflecting different points of view, but the next step, naturally, in a planned policy of development and expansion would be the amount of detailed attention that is given to the disposal of the crop after it is harvested, or of the produce.  In that respect, a very, very definite forward step, more forward than ever was taken before in the history of this country, was taken on the agricultural side through the recent trade agreement. That agreement may have its faults. If it had many faults, those faults would have been magnified and exaggerated by Deputy Smith but, on the all-over, it was a magnificent trade agreement from the point of view of Irish agriculture.  If there are any holes left to be filled, any alterations to be made, there was provision made for revision in the early part &mdash; I think it is January &mdash; of the coming year.  If in a reasonable way, not a wrecking way, but in a reasonable, constructive way, suggestions are made, calling the attention of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture to deficiences in that particular agreement, such suggestions and such proposals will be entirely welcome, and will be definitely helpful, and will be explored to the very full in the early part of the next year.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the disposal of the crop.  It has been the outlook of the present Minister for Agriculture that inducement and attraction are <Col N="190" /> much better and more calculated to be successful than coercion or fear.  His outlook with regard to the production of cereals, with regard to tillage generally, with regard to production generally, was to approach that particular question through a policy of giving as attractive a price as possible and following that price fixation by a firm market.  That was his approach to wheat.  That was his approach to barley and, in that respect, no matter what policy may be hinted at or implied by the mover of this resolution, that particular policy was clearly defined, circularised and publicised by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture as to the post-war position of agriculture in this country.  If there is a clash of views between Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Smith, either with regard to this particular question or with regard to the live-stock industry or the policy that should govern it, then I think that particular clash of views should be fought out in their own Party room and the time of the Dáil should not be taken up in trying to reconcile the outlook of Deputy Dr. Ryan with the outlook of Deputy Smith.  But, in so far as we are relying more on attractive prices as an inducement than on coercion and compulsion, that appears to have been the decided policy post-war of Deputy Dr. Ryan, publicised in the White Paper of June, 1946.  But, with regard to oats, Deputy Dr. Ryan is particularly clear and particularly emphatic that it would be idle and nonsense to try to govern or control the oat market by a policy of price fixation, that that is completely ineffective, so much waste of time, and would not fulfil any useful purpose. That will be found in paragraph 34, page 13 of the Policy in regard to Crops, Pastures, Fertilisers and Feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>That is his view with regard to the policy of fixing the price for oats.  What is his view with regard to the utilisation of the oats produced which is again contained in the same paragraph? What is his outlook?  It was planned and printed and circularised that oats should not be grown as a cash crop, that oats should be grown for consumption on the farm and that the amount grown for other purposes was entirely <Col N="191" /> negligible.  If Deputy Dillon is to be denounced by Deputy Smith for his attitude with regard to oats, be it right or wrong, let Deputy Smith associate in that denunciation his buddy there.  They should be both jointly in the dock.  If there are difficulties of a peculiar nature with regard to the disposal of the oat crop in this particular year, another buddy must stand in the dock, and that is Deputy Lemass, who as Minister for Industry and Commerce last winter, when there were oats lying in the merchants' stores and when he could not control supplies with any kind of efficiency if he did not make himself aware of the amount of oats that had accumulated in the merchants' stores, in spite of all that placed an order for the best part of 12,000 tons of oatmeal, the oatmeal equivalent of 24,000 tons of oats with so many tons of oats &mdash; and well he knew it &mdash; of the previous season's crops lying in the stores of the speculative merchants who had bought it and were waiting to unload it when and if the price went up.  That was there as a menace to the disposal of this year's crop but another menace is piled on top of that, 12,000 tons of unwanted oatmeal so as to jam further back the prospect of reasonably disposing of this year's crop of oats.</P>
    <P>What is the amount of oats which is normally produced for commercial purposes? According to a White Paper of two years ago, according to the figures supplied to me by the Department of Agriculture, the average amount of oats produced annually for commercial purposes is 8 per cent. of the total oat crop.  Approximately 80,000 tons of oats per annum are grown for cash or commercial purposes and how is that average of 80,000 tons usually and normally disposed of?  Approximately 40,000 tons, that is half, are disposed of by sale to racehorse owners and owners of town horses, and the other half, the other 40,000 tons, is normally disposed of for the production of oatmeal and that second leg of the puzzle is the leg that was bedevilled by Deputy Lemass, yet Deputy Smith has a grievance against the Minister.  I am putting those figures on record and I am putting those facts on record in a <Col N="192" /> way that is beyond challenge from the benches opposite.  In reply to a question that was rather stupidly put down by Deputy Derrig yesterday, I gave official figures as to the unloading, the dumping of oatmeal, month after month, from February of this year up to and including October and it was dismal reading.  It was dismal reading and gloomy reading for farmers that had oats to sell and for the farmer who was looking at oat millers' places chock full of the unwanted oatmeal and no room to take in this year's oat crop.</P>
    <P>What suggestion has been made to meet that appalling mess, of oatmeal, unwanted and unsound, glutting our mills; coal, unwanted and unsound, sailing up the River Liffey; wheat from the Argentine bought at the most extravagant figure ever dreamt of by man dumping into the country all this year &mdash; coal, wheat and oatmeal purchased and contracted for by our predecessors? What is Deputy Smith's suggestion to meet that appalling mess?  His suggestion is to denounce this Government, to condemn this Government, and to vote it out of office so that the messers can get back again to make a bigger mess.  That is the solution straight into your jaw.  That is the only idea you have, the only incentive you have at the back of jubilantly capering around the country.  The more oats that is unsaleable, the more jubilant are the farmer playboys opposite, because they think it is embarrassing the Government.  It is embarrassing the Government only because it is embarrassing the farmers, but the farmers are entitled to know the cause and the farmers are sufficiently conversant with that particular economy to know where the blame should lie and when they get the facts to act accordingly.  That is the position with regard to oats, and we are doing something of an active kind and at great financial loss to try to remedy it.  We have hawked that oatmeal from one side of the Continent to another, anxious to sell it and to lose money on it.  The quicker we can lose money the happier we are, because it will mean unloading it out of the mills and putting the millers in a position to take the farmers' oats.  Imagine a Government embarking on a policy of anxiety to <Col N="193" /> lose money with the greatest celerity. That is the position we are forced into, and because we are trying to lose money quickly on that blooming oatmeal contracted for by others, bought by men who did not take the trouble to find out how much oats was in the merchants' stores, we are to be condemned by the blunderers who made the mess.</P>
    <P>We have made arrangements to sell that oatmeal.  It is at a loss, but we are not concerned with the loss.  It had to be got rid of even if it were only to be sold at the price of dirt in order to get it out of the mills and to give a chance to the millers to take in.  The bottom was in danger of falling out of the market because the millers were not in the ring to buy and they could not go into the ring to buy because the mills were glutted with unsaleable oatmeal and many had not accommodation to take in oats.  We are remedying that position in two directions; we are getting rid of the junk oatmeal with one hand and with the other hand, again at the risk of losing money, we are going to keep up the bottom in the market and ourselves buy from the farmers who produced and threshed and who cannot find a remunerative market for their oats.  Is there anything to condemn in that?  Should not any farmer, irrespective of his political affiliations, even if he will not support an outlook such as that or actions such as those, refrain from condemnation?  Could any other action have been taken in view of the situation brought about by improvident purchasers and by a non-sizing up of the amount of oats that was lying there.  Was any other suggestion made on the other side of the House and are not the steps we are taking welcomed by every farmer who thinks seriously and genuinely of the farmers' difficulty otherwise than thinking in terms of political expediency?</P>
    <P>I have the data here and I could go through most fields of agriculture and I could show the expansion.  I could show the increased efforts which are being made to benefit the industry. I could show from trade figures, official returns and data supplied by worthy civil servants, who have served <Col N="194" /> two or three Administrations with equal loyalty, efficiency and reliability, figures with regard to every phase of agriculture which would at least clearly indicate that, if we have not, with regard to every branch of agriculture, exactly got where we desire to get, at least we have got there in many departments of agriculture, and that we are going firmly in that direction with regard to the remaining branches of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of uneasiness and unrest with regard to potatoes. There was a surplus, bountiful production of potatoes unequalled for the last 23 years, a bountiful potato harvest unequalled, as I have said, for 23 years, not only in this country, but in Great Britain and in the whole of Western Europe; an unexpected, unprecedented crop of potatoes.  Of course, instead of being thankful to God, we had the caoiners, the whiners in here, caoining, wailing, and whining because God was so good, in the hope that, because of the superabundance of potatoes, some potatoes would be unmarketable in this particular country.  The superabundance of potatoes that we found here was found likewise in Great Britain.  In Western Europe there was such a mighty crop of potatoes that in the starving Bizone of Germany, where the people were half-starved and dependent on the charity of others to keep them fed, within the last month orders were given to serve potatoes to animals for feeding stuffs, so as to dispose of the abnormal surplus of potatoes there.  Great Britain is in the same position.  We are in the same position.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, last summer we had an agreement entered into between Ministers of this country and Ministers of Great Britain on a Ministerial level, and although the agreement was about certain major and primary things, in the course of these discussions the Minister for Agriculture happened to raise the question of potatoes.  He asked if we had potatoes other than seed for sale would they be prepared to take them.  Doing business on that level as between friends, the British promptly agreed that, save for exceptional <Col N="195" /> circumstances, they would take potatoes.  When we asked the amount, they said: &ldquo;Up to 50,000 tons&rdquo;.  When we asked the price, they said &ldquo;£10 13s. 6d.&rdquo;</P>

In spite of the fact that they had a superabundance of potatoes, that they did not want potatoes and that they may have a bit of a problem disposing of all they have, they have honoured their bond and bought our potatoes and are buying them at that price, up to the quantity of 50,000 tons.  They are going to lose money heavily on every ton of potatoes they buy, but they are going to do it to keep us in production and to honour their bond, and I think, as acting Minister for Agriculture, I should at least express on behalf of the Department and those looking to the Department for direction and guidance an appreciation of the extraordinary degree of friendship and brotherhood contained in that particular action.  It is a headline for nations in international dealings in the present and in the future, and it is an indication of the importance of developing the highest degree of good relationship on a Ministerial level between, not only neighbouring countries, but countries that ever come in contact one with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are phases of agriculture within which there are still difficulties.  Unquestionably, there are difficulties within the dairying industry.  There are difficulties with regard to hours, difficulties with regard to price, difficulties with regard to wages, but there is no branch of agriculture that is more continuously and more vigilantly under survey than that particular branch. Anybody, be he Minister for Agriculture or a Minister with exclusive dealings with the city, anybody who knows <Col N="196" /> anything about the economy of this country knows that if there is a &ldquo;let-go&rdquo; on the dairying industry in this country not only does the whole of the agricultural steam collapse but the whole life of the community collapses, and that is the degree of importance that is attached to that particular branch of the industry.</P>
    <P>There is nobody claiming that it is in &ldquo;easy street&rdquo; at the moment. There is nobody claiming, either here or in any other place, that he has the key that is going to solve that, like a key turning in an oiled lock.  There are many, many different angles, many, many different minds as to where the solution lies.  There has to be a balancing and judgment and consideration as between the relative importance of the dairying industry and the beef industry and there has to be something in the nature of a compromise that will hold the scales evenly as between these two, without an excessive tilt in either one direction or the other.  If we were honest, I think it would be agreed that there are more minds than one on the opposite Front Bench even at the present moment on that particular point. I am not going to claim that we here in Government have all one mind on that particular problem.  We have, however, one determination in common and, to that extent, we have one mind, that we are going to continue after that particular problem until there is a solution for it satisfactory to all.  I am not going to claim that I am the person who is going to find that solution but, in that direction, if I set my mind to it, I could not make very much of a worse job of it than those who claimed to be experts before made in any other direction &mdash; not saying that I would do better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, just as a final indication of the upward or downward trend of agriculture might I give the price index figure for each month this year and each month last year?  It is true that there are many Deputies who have different points of view as to the inherent reliability of the scheme or plan that goes to make up the price index figure.  It may be that with a costing system in the course of time, we will get more certain factors that <Col N="197" /> will go to build up the agricultural price index figure.  Nevertheless, I think any Deputy, whether he criticises the foundation or the make up of the table, will at least agree that if the table shows a marked increase in the price index figure it means that standards generally are going up, and that if the table indicates to any kind of a remarkable extent a drop in the price index figure, then there is a decline in the prosperity of agriculture as a whole.  Remember, these figures embrace agriculture as a whole.  A man has eight fields.  He is doing well in six and doing badly or less well in the other two.  These figures indicate the all-over position.  These figures are based on 100 in the year 1938-39. In January, 1947, the index figure was 208, this year it was 247.  February, last year, 212, this year 248.  March, last year, 218, this year 258.  April, last year, 228, this year 268.  May, last year, 243, this year 258.  June, last year, 231, this year 261.  July, last year, 228, this year 255.  August, last year, 231, this year 253.  September, last year, 235, this year 250.</P>
    <P>That table, taken from figures officially compiled, shows at least the trend, the direction of our agricultural industry.  I would ask Deputy Smith, and I would ask any Deputy impartially, to say, when that indicates the trend &mdash; that your direction is steadily and consistently upwards &mdash; is that the time for votes of censure or is that the time to condemn an administration?  Is that the time to pull down an administration and replace it with a régime that kept it there at the lower figure.  That is a fair picture of the progress made &mdash; the progress that we made.  That is the official figure, but if I were to give the farmer's illustration of the progress made, the farmer's illustration is that there is as much being got now for a broody hen as was being got for a calf in Deputy Smith's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest very vigorously against the accusation of the Minister for Defence that Deputy Smith was personal in his speech here last night.  I defy anybody on the other side to read the newspapers or <Col N="198" /> the Official Report and point out to me where that personal abuse is.  He was no such thing.  He may have made a very strong case against the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Defence may have felt that the only way he could deal with it was to accuse Deputy Smith of being personal.  That is a very old game of the Minister for Defence and some of his colleagues, but it does not deceive anybody on that side of the House or on this.</P>
      <P>Another thing is that we have frequent jibes from the Ministers opposite, and from those who sit behind them, that we are now out of office.  The only thing I can gather from that is that the Ministers opposite are very smug and very gratified at being where they are.  I do not know, but they must think it is a grand thing to be a Minister and a horrible thing to be out.  Personally, I feel very happy where I am, but I am going to do my best, while I am here, to put an incompetent, dishonest Government out, and to put back a Government that can put this country on its feet again.</P>

Every single thing that I will say here to-day will be something that has been said to me by a Fine Gael farmer or a Clann na Talmhan farmer.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it may be, or it may be much more brief than that of the Minister for Defence, but there may be a little more in it.  It will not be very hard for me to do that.  If I criticise the policy of the Government, am I going to be accused of being personal?  I do not want to say anything against the person of the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for <Col N="199" /> Industry and Commerce or even the Minister for Lands, but I am going to say what I think about their policy, and let nobody say it is personal.  If I were to repeat what I have heard from the followers of Fine Gael and of Clann na Talmhan down the country that would be personal, but I am not going to repeat it.</P>
      <P>I am going to talk only on policy.  In part of his speech the Minister for Defence said that they had found agriculture impoverished when they came into office.  If they did, the farmers must be in a very bad way now, because there is no doubt anybody can show that the farmer is not getting any more for his produce now, taking everything into account.  His costs are much higher.  Therefore, if we left the farmer impoverished, this Government are going to put the finishing touch on him if they are allowed to remain in. Nobody will deny, not even a follower of Clann na Talmhan, that rates have gone up in the last year, and everybody knows that wages have gone up. There has been no reduction in the farmer's costs as regards machinery or fertilisers, seeds or manures, so that the farmer's costs are definitely higher than they were last year, while his income as it was when we left office has gone down, taking everything into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, before he left the House, quoted farm index prices.  He quoted them in a very clever way, but surely if any Deputy takes down the figures and examines them he is not going to be deceived.  He quoted the figure for January of last year against the figure for this year, and the figure for November last year and November this year.</P>

      <P>I thought he might have had something worth while to say.  The prices of wheat, eggs, and poultry were fixed.  I shall refer to the price of cattle later on.  The prices that did go up were effected by Fianna Fáil before they went out of office and they were effected by Fianna Fáil on the farmers' costs at that particular time &mdash; not on the farmers' costs now.  If the Minister for Defence had quoted, say, the farm index figures for the two last months Fianna Fáil were in office &mdash; January and February of this year &mdash; it would be seen that the farm index figures would read as follows: January, 247; February, 248, and for the last month he quoted, 250.  There has not been much of an improvement in the months since this Government came into power.</P>

As I intend to come back to this point later on, I merely desire to say, in passing, that that was arranged before Fianna Fáil left office.  Sheep are not any higher in price now than they were this time last year, and the same remark applies to pigs.  I do not want to quote figures from one market in an isolated way, but Deputies will note that at the Dublin cattle market yesterday the prices quoted for sheep were lower than those obtaining this time last year &mdash; and that has been so for the past three or four weeks.  The prices of wheat, poultry and eggs are, as I say, higher, but these were fixed by Fianna Fáil before they left office.</P>

      <P>The only one commodity in respect of which the price was raised by the present Minister for Agriculture is barley.  The price was raised by 5/- per barrel.  As we know, the prices of oats and potatoes are lower than they were last year.  I shall refer to that point later.  I say that the only notable change is in respect of cattle, and I say that that change is the result of the agreement which was made by the Fianna Fáil Ministers when they went to London last autumn.  The agreement made then in respect of cattle, eggs, poultry and other commodities still stands, and it is on that agreement that store cattle are sold.  The only change that was made by the present Minister for Agriculture and the Ministers who went with him to London was as regards fat cattle.  The position with regard to store cattle did not change.</P>

      <P>I do not mind these skirmishes with Deputy Davin and Deputy Flanagan.  I know that they are trying to justify their intention to vote against this motion of no confidence while, at the same time, when they meet farmers in their constituencies they will say: &ldquo;We do not agree with the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="202" /> but maybe we will try to get the Government to do something better.&rdquo; Let us try to have an understanding in regard to these interruptions.  Some Deputies are doing so for the purpose of soothing their consciences, and at the same time in an endeavour to please their constituents down the country.  If Deputy Davin is honest enough to look it up he will find that I am correct in saying that the present price of store cattle arose from the agreement made by the Fianna Fáil Ministers last autumn.  No change was made in that respect by the present Ministers when they went to London.  There was a change in the price of fat cattle, however.  What was the result?  A report of a meeting of the cattle traders, published yesterday, says that in the month of October &mdash; which is, and always has been, the month for the biggest exports of fat cattle &mdash; 181 fat cattle were exported.  That is the result of this magnificent agreement, of which we have heard just now from the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly we have a better price this year than we had last year for eggs and poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to Deputies that if you have a good price for cattle, comparatively speaking, and if you have not got a good price for milk, comparatively speaking, the experience has always been in this country&mdash; I cannot speak for other countries&mdash; in this particular item that the number of cows will go down because the individual farmer says to himself that it would pay him better to keep cattle than cows.  If we have the position, which I am afraid we have, though I may be wrong, that cattle are now paying better than cows, there is a great danger that the number of cows will go down.  The Minister for Agriculture on some occasions lately when he was met by creamery farmers and asked to give a better price for milk refused very flatly and very emphatically to do so.  He gave as his excuses: (1) that the farmers had not increased their wages; (2) that he did not want to subsidise the 300-gallon cow; and (3) that Professor Murphy in Cork had worked out the costings and had given them at a certain figure between 8d. and 9d. a gallon.  Deputy P. D. Lehane on the other side of the House dealt very effectively with that third argument in a letter to a newspaper. He showed that the Minister had not given the full facts in quoting this figure.  Deputy Lehane pointed out that a cow must be kept for the whole year round.  For the benefit of some Deputies opposite who do not know anything about the matter, you cannot have a cow in the summer time and forget about her in the winter. You must keep her for the full year, and if you do the milk will cost 1/1 per <Col N="204" /> gallon to produce and not between 8d. and 9d.  As Deputy Lehane also pointed out, the cows that were costed by Professor Murphy were in herds where the yield per cow was abnormally high.  I mean by &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; above average.  If you were to take the average farmer with the average cows his costs would be higher.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Lehane made a very good case when he said that milk could not possibly pay the dairy farmer at its present price.  Assuming that is true, one has to ask oneself what the result is going to be.  If any Deputy has any doubt as to the result he should go down to the Library and look at the statistics there.  In those statistics he will see that a distinct trend is shown. He will see that when butter and milk prices are favourable in comparison with cattle prices, the number of cows goes up; when butter and milk prices are unfavourable, the number of cows goes down.  We are facing the latter situation at the moment.  The price of milk to the creameries was fixed by the Fianna Fáil Government early in 1947. Since then the farmer's costs, his rates and his wages have gone up.  The costs of operating the actual creameries has gone up.  The farmer was only barely satisfied with the price at the time. Taking the present position, he must have very little cause for satisfaction of any kind.  There was a slight increase in the number of cows this year which would show that the price was satisfactory, but no more than satisfactory.  The farmer's costs have now risen and the price of milk has remained at the same figure and, according to the Minister for Agriculture, is going to remain at the same figure.  If that is so there is little hope that even the present level of the cow population will be maintained.  What is the remedy that the Minister for Agriculture has for that situation? The Minister for Defence, who is acting for the Minister for Agriculture, made the plea here that higher prices for commodities, inevitably resulting in higher wages and still higher prices, were not the remedy.  He said that a long-term policy would be preferable I agree that it would.  In the meantime, while we are trying to achieve that <Col N="205" /> long-term policy, the number of cows may go down seriously and our whole agricultural policy will be in a dangerous position.</P>
    <P>The Minister recommended that the farmer should get rid of his 300-gallon cow.  He said he would use no compulsion but he would advise the farmer to go in for the dual-purpose cow and he would supply suitable bulls.  If that policy is agreed upon as between the Minister and the farmer it will be a long time before there will be an appreciably higher milk yield.  As well as the 300-gallon cows there are a lot of 400-gallon and 500-gallon cows. Amongst those there will be a comparatively small number which will be fit to breed from if we are going to improve the milk yield.  If a farmer has 20 cows on an average he will have only four or five good milkers from which he can breed.  If this bull is sent down by the Department of Agriculture the position will be satisfactory only in regard to the four or five good milkers. On the law of averages the farmer will find that half his calves will be male and half female.  Therefore, the farmer with 20 cows will rear only two or three good heifer calves each year.  On that basis it will take a considerable time to replace his 15 mediocre cows with 15 good ones.  I do not know that any farmer at the present time is in a position to go in for that type of long-term policy.  Financially the farmer cannot stick it.  Therefore, the number of cows will inevitably go down unless a better price is given for milk.  The result will be that you will have less cattle.  If you have less cattle that will be very discouraging from the farmer's point of view if he is going to be faced with less produce in the way of milk and butter and less cattle as a result of that.  That result appears to be fairly imminent at the moment.  The trend is in that direction</P>
    <P>There is also a danger of less tillage. Deputy Smith referred specifically to the prices for oats and potatoes.  It is all very well for the Government and the Minister to say that we resent God's goodness to us in giving us good crops.  Nobody would believe that these same Ministers had ever sat on this side of the House.  I remember <Col N="206" /> one year when we had a glut of potatoes.  Does anybody think that problem was not raised on this side of the House then?  I did not accuse the Opposition at that time of any bad intentions.  I believed they made their protest out of the goodness of their hearts and out of pity for the farmers.  We discussed the matter and we tried to arrive at some conclusion as to what could be done. Why can we not do that now?  Why can we not discuss the matter here in an effort to find a remedy for what is a difficult problem?  Even though it is a difficult problem, the Government should not be timorous of having the matter discussed here, and having the benefit of our advice, though they may reject that advice afterwards. We are entitled to come in here and we are entitled to censure the Government if we think they are dilatory in their duty to the public.  If this motion had not been put down nothing might have been done.  Is it not obvious from the answers given to Questions yesterday, that the Government panicked because of statements made down the country at public and private meetings where supporters of the Government said that they would withdraw their support unless the Government did something?  What the Government did was to answer those Questions on the very day the motion was put down.</P>

      <P>When did they realise that there was a surplus?  Every statement they made up to this indicated that there was no problem to be dealt with. People were told to feed their oats to animals, to feed their potatoes to pigs, or put the crops in pits and stacks and keep them until the spring, but there was no problem.  Why did the Government suddenly realise on the 17th November that there was a problem? Why was it realised on that particular day that something would have to be done about it?  To show that they dealt with this matter rather hurriedly, we have the fact that they are unable to agree even yet on the details.  They had to give a promise to their followers that they would do something, but they do not know what to do and they have not the details worked out yet.  They were in such a hurry to soothe their threatening, recalcitrant followers, they had to assure them that something would be done and they would announce the details later; but they are not yet ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Industry and Commerce may say, there is not a person in the country, whether a follower of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other Party, but knows that they had to face the Dáil on this motion and on questions submitted by Deputies on this side of the House and on the benches opposite. The Government knew they had to produce a solution or get out.  Oats were sold this year for £1 a barrel; in fact, they were sold for 17/6 a County Cork Deputy told me.  It is poor consolation to these people to know that the problem will be solved now.  I hope the Government, in whatever scheme they bring forward, will be able to make it retrospective for those people who have sold their oats. I witnessed a sale of oats between two farmers at 20/- a barrel.  As far as I remember, the sale covered 20 barrels. What will be done in a case like that? <Col N="208" /> A good lot of oats was bought by merchants.  They filled their stores. What will be done about those purchases and about the oats sold from the stores, apart from what still remins there?</P>
    <P>As regards potatoes, I suppose it is true to say that it it the best crop they have had for a long time.  They have also had the best crop of oats and there is a great crop of wheat. That reminds me of the point made here by Ministers opposite and by some Deputies during the past three or four years.  They said the land was worn out.  That worn out land has obviously embarrassed the Government by yielding such a good crop of oats, potatoes and wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be delighted.  The Minister asked what about the White Paper.  In the White Paper the Fianna Fáil Government said that they would encourage tillage as far as they could by making wheat a remunerative crop, giving a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for it.  They said they would encourage barley as far as there was a market to be found for it.  They did leave oats out.  Their advertisements before they went out of office were advising farmers to grow more wheat because there was a guaranteed price and a market for it.  What did the present Minister do?  He knew what the position was.  He said wheat was a cod.  He told farmers to grow more oats, barley and potatoes and they would be doing good work for the nation; in other words, they would not be serving the nation by growing wheat, but they would by growing the other crops and the Government would guarantee a price.  Wheat was a cod, he said.  There are farmers in the country saying that oats is a cod.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the advertisements. He said wheat was a cod.  In our advertisements we advised growing <Col N="209" /> more wheat.  He removed wheat from the advertisement, and put in the other crops, and in the end he said: &ldquo;We will show them.&rdquo;  They have shown us plenty of oats and potatoes, but there is nobody to buy them.  They are prejudiced because they tried to prove by pamphlets in 1928 that wheat could not be grown here for 14 reasons &mdash; like the late President Wilson's 14 points.  When we showed them that wheat could be successfully grown they could not get over their prejudice, and when they came back to office again they removed wheat and advised the farmers to grow more barley, oats and potatoes, and they would give them a remunerative market.</P>

      <P>Some people did write. As regards potatoes, we were told that, following the magnificent agreement we have heard so much about, the British would take our potatoes. The Minister in a somewhat optimistic mood said that while the price was not attractive, still it was good to have a bottom to the market.  We were told the price would be something like £10 13s. 6d. a ton.  What about the people who had to sell potatoes at £6 and £7 a ton?  The Minister for Defence said that they are buying these potatoes, but so far none of us has heard about it.  I went to a merchant in Dublin three days ago and asked him if he would buy potatoes.  He said he thought he could because he had an export market for something like 5,000 tons. I went back to him and this is what he told me.  He said: &ldquo;I rang up the Department of Agriculture and said I had a market for 5,000 tons of ware potatoes and that there was a surplus. The Department agreed there was a surplus.  I said I wanted a permit to export the potatoes, but the Department said I would have to ask the British Government for that.&rdquo;  That arises out of the magnificent agreement under which the British promised to take 50,000 tons of potatoes.  Evidently, so far as we can <Col N="210" /> see, although we probably could sell more than 50,000 tons we will not be allowed to unless we get the permission of the British.  In the meantime potatoes are being sold at £6 and £7 a ton.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that the Deputy is very lucky.  Other Deputies know that British Queens and Kerr Pinks were sold at £6 a ton.  What is the scheme?  How will the potatoes be regulated?  Who will buy them? Is there any guarantee that all potatoes offered for sale will be taken at this price of £10 13s. 6d. a ton? That is the type of thing we want to know, if this is to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence told us that the policy laid down by the Minister for Agriculture was a very nebulous policy, a policy of giving freedom to the farmer to do what he liked.  Is there not a great deal of bunkum about that?  Can any Deputy opposite say where is the difference, so far as the farmer is concerned, between the past eight months and the period before that?  The tillage inspector, maybe, has been withdrawn &mdash; he has changed <Col N="211" /> his mind on that &mdash; but that was part of a certain policy adopted during the emergency &mdash; whether we should continue it or not is another matter &mdash; in order to produce food for the people. Leaving these inspectors out, where is there any difference, so far as the farmer is concerned, between the period before last February and since last February?  He has talked about giving the farmer his freedom and so on.  Is that not all window dressing? There is nothing in it.  The farmer would rather get a little more for his oats and potatoes than talk of that kind.</P>
    <P>The policy, according to the Minister for Defence, was one of increasing production, of lowering the farmer's costs, of giving the farmer a permanent solution of his difficulties and so on and the Minister for Defence says that, in eight months, that policy has succeeded in many directions.  He did not tell us where or how.  He went on to talk about fertilisers and I am glad that the Minister has got more this year than last year, but surely it was to be expected that, when conditions loosened up after the war, we would get more. Surely it was to be expected that the restrictions on these fertilisers would not last for all time and that we would get more as time went on.  The Minister cited the lime scheme.  The lime scheme, which was to produce 1,000,000 tons of ground lime, was initiated in the Department when I was there.  It was taken up in greater detail and put into shape by Deputy Smith when he was Minister, and handed over to the present Minister for implementing, and the Minister for Defence claims credit for the present Minister for Agriculture, so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>One matter mentioned here which may be worth referring to is this question of a certain amount of oatmeal which was left in the country. A great deal of play is being made with that, and I think it is indicative of the very poor case the Government are trying to put up that they try to get people to believe that that was a big factor in the situation.  This is almost the end of 1948.  The farmers remember that, in the spring of 1947, <Col N="212" /> oats became very scarce, and, as a matter of fact, by the harvest of 1947 oats were very dear &mdash; up to 42/- and 43/- per barrel.  It looked in the spring of 1947 as if we had not got enough oats for oatmeal and the Minister for Industry and Commerce arranged for the import of 20,000 tons in March of that year.  Deputies, I am sure, remember the years 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945 when the farseeing men sitting opposite now were on this side.  Do they remember the attacks made on the Minister for Supplies because he had not got everything wanted in the country?</P>
    <P>If there was a shortage of oatmeal and if oats could be bought in some part of the world, would the Minister for Supplies not be due for censure if he did not import that oats?  That is what he did, but that oats was there when the Minister for Agriculture was making his appeal to farmers throughout the country to sow more oats and telling them that they would get a remunerative market.  If the present Minister for Agriculture made that announcement without finding out, he is altogether to blame.  The Minister for Defence blamed the former Minister for Supplies for not looking around him and in fact for not foreseeing that an incompetent Government would be in power here in 1948 when they would have too much oats and could not dispose of them; but Deputy Lemass could not foresee those things.  Nobody could foresee that things would ever take that turn in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble and that is what is causing all the trouble. That is the very thing the people down the country are saying: &ldquo;We got ourselves into trouble, but God grant that it will not be too long before we get an opportunity of getting ourselves out of it&rdquo;.  What is going to be the result of all this?  If the farmer goes out of tillage, to some extent &mdash; I am not saying he is going out of it entirely &mdash; and says: &ldquo;I will sow less oats and less potatoes because the market is too uncertain&rdquo;, and if he says: &ldquo;I cannot make dairy cows pay on the present prices&rdquo;, as Deputy Lehane has proved <Col N="213" /> already, what will be the result?  It will be less production.  What will replace that lesser production?  You cannot replace less cows by cattle, because if you have not got the cows, you have not got the cattle, and if you have less tillage, there is nothing to replace it.  Poultry and so on will not absorb very much, so that you will have less production, and if there is less production, there is a lesser output, a lesser agricultural income and less employment.  That is the point we want to stress here to-day &mdash; that the danger is less production and less employment on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have dealt with the bigger schemes.  I want to refer briefly to some of the smaller schemes.  There is a scheme of growing root seeds, and it is to illustrate the mentality of this Government that I mention it.  During the war, we were forced into growing our own root seeds because we could not get them elsewhere, and, from 1944 to 1947, Irish seeds of swedes, turnips and so on, on the brassica side, and indeed the mangel side, were sold, on the average, at 1d. more than the imported seed.  But for 1948 the Irish seed was a good deal dearer.  And why?  Because the stecklings had to stand through the very severe winter of 1946-47, and there was practically a complete failure.  The result was that Irish seed was much dearer this year than imported seed.  Because of that failure for one year, the Minister for Agriculture has said he is going to discontinue the scheme.  Is not that, first of all, catching on to a very poor pretext to abolish the scheme? Secondly, is it not foolish?  Irish seed has been proved to be more reliable. This year there are prosecutions in many counties for failure of crop from imported seed, but so far as I can learn no prosecution for Irish seed. You had a more reliable seed grown at home &mdash; and that is only to be expected, as when it is grown at home you have the agricultural instructors and inspectors throughout the counties, who are in a position to inspect the growing crops, and see how they are threshed and stored, and see the test for germination all through the winter, and keep a proper tag on that <Col N="214" /> seed.  The result is that it is more reliable.</P>
    <P>I think everyone will admit that it makes for better farming to have a crop of that kind, because a farmer must depart more from the old system of whatever he was doing and look after the new crop, and it will improve his methods generally to have a new crop of that kind &mdash; so it should get a chance.  There are only about 1,500 acres involved, and it gives a great deal of employment &mdash; 300 to 500 men. We cannot afford to lose the employment for these 300 or 500 men.  I give that as an illustration of smaller schemes introduced during the last 15 or 16 years, which have not got the support of the present Minister.  In fact, he is hostile to those schemes. The Government should not drop these schemes unless they were proved to be altogether impracticable or unworkable.</P>
    <P>The farmer, apart from his income, gets certain help with regard to farm improvement.  That is not coming this year, in anything like what was paid out in the last three or four years.  It was delayed, I do not know why; and in every way the farmer was discouraged from going on with farm improvements.  The only explanation is that it is for economy.  The farm building scheme did not go on, either. The Minister for Finance, when bringing in his Budget, saved £6 million on paper but he only accounted for £4 million and the remaining £2 million, he said, was for saving that he was not in a position to disclose.  This, perhaps, is one of them &mdash; a secret agreement between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance that this saving would be made.  It is a great pity that these things should not be allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>We were more or less attacked here by the Minister for Defence that we were making destructive points.  I am only pointing out the facts.  I was trying to point out the fact that the farmers, on present prices, are not likely to increase their production. That is the object of anything I have said and I do not know whether I am right or not.  I am only giving my <Col N="215" /> opinion, but I know that many farmers down the country say that was why they cannot carry on.  They mean to reduce their cows if the present price continues and mean to do less tillage under present conditions.  The positive policy, naturally, is to increase production. That appears to be the Minister for Agriculture's policy also, but you will not get it unless you encourage the farmer with a better price, at least until you get him going on a more economic basis than he is going on now. The only way is better prices, in particular, I should say for milk and in the tillage crops.  Things are probably all right so far as cattle, sheep, poultry, eggs and pigs are concerned, but in these two lines a better price will be needed.  That would enable the farmer to give a better wage to his hired man and also a better income to himself and the members of his own family.</P>
    <P>The Government is standing over the present policy.  No one could have given greater approval to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture than the Minister for Defence gave, so he is standing over it 100 per cent.  Therefore, any Deputy who votes against this motion is voting 100 per cent. also in favour of the present policy.  I want to conclude by saying that, as far as our motion is concerned, the words that are contained in it, that there is a danger of decreased production and decreased employment, are the key words in the resolution and these are the words on which we stand.</P>

      <P>When I saw this motion on the Paper, I wondered why it had been put down.  It was understandable enough that an Opposition should wish, on the opening of a new session, to get into possession, so to speak; and to move a motion in order that it would get priority over other motions which were on the Paper, it was necessary to indicate that it was a motion of no confidence in the Government, so as to secure that time would be made available immediately. Frankly, I was puzzled as to why they had chosen a motion on agriculture to challenge the confidence of the Government. Having read in the <i>Irish Press</i><Col N="216" /> to-day Deputy Smith's speech &mdash; not having had the advantage of listening to him last night&mdash;and having listened to Deputy Dr. Ryan to-day, I am more mystified than ever.  We are told that the Government's proposal regarding oats was made because this motion was put down.  We are told in the <i>Irish Press,</i> and by certain speakers, that Deputy Dillon has gone to America because he was afraid of Deputy Smith and Deputy Dr. Ryan, that he was running away from this challenge. Now, I ask anyone in the House, even the most dyed-in-the-wool supporter of Fianna Fáil, to try to imagine for themselves the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy James Dillon, running away from the two performances we have had here.</P>

      <P>Is it not as intelligent as the usual Fianna Fáil interruption? Let me nail one or two things that Deputy Dr. Ryan said.  I do not believe they were said for the purpose of creating damage, but they are untrue. He said here that he had been told and assured, to the extent that he firmly believed and was prepared to stand over the statement, that a factor who wanted to export 5,000 tons of potatoes was informed that he could not export them without the permission of the British.  That statement was entirely false.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement was entirely false.  There is not a shred of truth in it, and Deputy Dr. Ryan, for 14 years head of the Department <Col N="217" /> of Agriculture, should, I suggest, have taken some trouble to ascertain from the Department, of which he was head for such a long period, whether there was any truth in that statement or not, before he made it here in public in the House.  Deputy Dr. Ryan also made a statement about home-grown seeds, just before he sat down.  That statement is not true.</P>

      <P>No, it is not abandoned; and Deputy Dr. Ryan should at least have taken the trouble of inquiring from the Department as to the actual position, before he came in and made such a statement.  Rightly or wrongly, certain people in this country will attach, I am afraid, more importance to a statement of that character, made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, than perhaps the ordinary Fianna Fáil Deputy.  If Deputy Dr. Ryan is concerned, as he says, with securing more production from the land and a better price for the farmer, he should not make statements here which can only be damaging to agriculture.</P>
      <P>The only action the Minister for Agriculture took in connection with the question of seeds was to remove from the Irish seed assemblers the monopoly of importing seeds.  That is a completely different thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan started his speech by making the statement that the farmer in this country was worse off to-day than he was under Fianna Fáil. That statement is untrue.  There is no Deputy in the House, no matter on what side he sits, who does not know that it is untrue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, we shall see who is right.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he does anything at all, does it <Col N="219" /> well &mdash; no half measures for him. Every price that is obtainable to-day was fixed by Fianna Fáil! Everything that has accrued under the trade agreement was fixed by Fianna Fáil in the autumn of last year under the agreement which Fianna Fáil made last year with the British! Which agreement?  Where is the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they could not publish it because there was no such agreement.  Deputy Dr. Ryan has not wakened up to the fact yet that the only thing they got out of the conversations last autumn was the 1½ million tons of coal which created the fuel problem here.  Deputy Dr. Ryan claims that the price of cattle was fixed last autumn and that there was a four years' agreement.  Let us have some kind of sensible approach to this matter.  I say to Deputy Dr. Ryan that I am quite satisfied that he did not himself believe in one-tenth of what he was saying, and that he was merely trying to score debating points.  He knew that he was on very weak ground and the ground has not become any more firm in the last few days in the debate on this motion.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about the dairying industry.  We hear a lot of talk over there about milk.  I must say that there is one thing I admire in Fianna Fáil Deputies, whether they sit on that side of the House or on this, and that is their courage, or, to put it very plainly and bluntly, their hard necks. When I hear Fianna Fáil speakers, particularly ex-Ministers, talking in this House about live stock, dairying, the price of milk or the price of anything else produced on the farm, and when I think of what they did with agriculture during the time they were in office, I say that no other description can be applied to their line here but simply that they have &ldquo;hard necks&rdquo;. If it were possible to destroy agriculture and the agricultural community in this country, they would have been destroyed under the 16 years' administration we had from the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that if agriculture <Col N="220" /> is on its feet to-day and if farmers are well off, or comparatively well off, to-day, that fact is not due either to the Fianna Fáil Government or entirely to this Government.  It is due to the fact that there was a seven-years' war and a consequent period of scarcity which brought high prices in its train. The agricultural community would not have recovered in the seven years or even in 27 years if these abnormal conditions had not been brought about. That is the truth and there is no working farmer in Ireland to-day but knows that is the truth.  The Deputy opposite talks about the price of calves in Abbeyfeale.  That a Fianna Fáil Deputy should mention Abbeyfeale and calves on a motion in connection with agriculture denouncing this Government, takes some beating.</P>

The Deputy most probably saw them too. If he did not, he must have been out of the district because he is not blind.</P>

Of course, there is a good reason for that, the very same sort of reason there was for Deputy Dr. Ryan talking about what the Minister for Agriculture had said and published in relation to oats and barley and saying that all he had said about wheat was that it was a cod, that he had taken wheat out of the advertisement.  That statement was applauded and approved of both by Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera. I asked Deputy Dr. Ryan across the House, &ldquo;Did the Minister for Agriculture say or do nothing about wheat,&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;No.  He took it out of the <Col N="221" /> advertisement.&rdquo;  Deputy Dr. Ryan knows, and so does Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass and every other Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the remarkable part of Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech was when he set out to prove that there is really no difference at all between the agricultural policy of this Government and the agricultural policy of the previous Government.  He <Col N="227" /> said that nothing that has happened during the last eight months shows any difference at all.  Inspectors have been taken away, certainly, he said, but nobody bothers about that, and they were only there during the emergency, the implication, of course, being that if there had not been a change of Government, he would have taken them away himself.  That may be the only difference that Deputy Dr. Ryan thinks of, but the farmer sees a very big difference.</P>

Did the Deputy read the White Paper that was published by his colleague?  Does the Deputy know that in the 1946 White Paper the policy of the gentlemen opposite when they were the Government was laid down?  Does he know what was stated in it?  Did the Deputy ever read it?  He did not?  Probably he is as well off.  The Deputy would probably be better off if as regards a lot of other Fianna Fáil propaganda he had not read it either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that we at least know something about the subject, and we know what agriculture went through during the last 16 years. We know that the one thing that is surprising to the farming community of this country and to the community generally and that has surprised even Fianna Fáil is the fact that we were able to do so much for the agricultural community of this country in such a short period.  By this time 12 months the Deputy will begin to realise how <Col N="228" /> much better off the farmers will be then than they are to-day.  I doubt if there will be any oats problem next year, because there will be enough live stock and poultry in the land to eat it.</P>

I am going out day in, day out, appealing to industrialists, to workers and to agriculturists to produce more, and Deputy Lemass, when he was in my position, did the same. I know that that is the only hope for putting this country on its feet.  This sort of motion that has been brought in here and the types of speeches that have been made have only one purpose, to try to prove that the farmers are foolish in growing more oats or potatoes.</P>

      <P>Get this into your heads.  The farmer is not losing as much on the oats crop as you are representing if for no other reason than that&mdash;and it is one of the main factors in the falling off this year&mdash;he has anything from 25 to 40 per cent, more yield in the oats crop this year compared with last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have been talking here, Deputy Dr. <Col N="229" /> Ryan, Deputy Smith, and the <i>Irish Press</i>, talk as if the whole oat crop were at stake.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, in its leading article, talks of the good farmer and his oats and the good land.  The fact is that something between 8 and 10 per cent. of the oat crop of the country this year or any year is for sale commercially.  As far as the greater number of the counties of the country are concerned there is practically no sale for oats.  In fact, the farmers buy oats.  Over 90 per cent. of the entire oat crop is fed on the farm.  Unless a man is absolutely forced either for financial reasons or because he has no storage&mdash;and storage even should not force him because he could keep it in the stacks&mdash;there is no reason why any person who grows oats should be forced to sell.  The only reason would be a purely financial reason.  I want to put this to any Deputy opposite who is a practical farmer, and to this extent I agree with the White Paper: is there any Deputy opposite who is a practical working farmer who will deny that it would pay him better, if he could afford to do it, to feed the oats he grows on his own farm than to sell it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">

Indeed, whether he does or not we will be very glad to listen to him, but I suggest to the Deputy, if he grows oats, unless he is forced to sell it, if he keeps it whether he feeds it to the calves, the hens or anything else, at present prices, he would get a better financial return than by selling it.</P>

      <P>There is one small point I would like to deal with.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he was dealing with oatmeal&mdash;I do not want to go into all that&mdash;said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Supplies, had to take action and would have ordered this in March, 1947.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This time last year the oatmeal millers came to me and said they could not possibly buy oats at any reasonable price so as to enable a supply of oatmeal to be maintained in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion which was made yesterday that that oatmeal was purchased and had to be imported was incorrect.  The importation could have been stopped at any time if the Government wanted to stop it or it could have been resold at a profit in any other part of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to import that into the middle of this discussion, but I cannot accept the last statement made by Deputy Lemass that is could be resold at a profit at any time.  That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave it at that.  Deputy Dr. Ryan could not finish without coming back to the old question about the farm improvements <Col N="231" /> scheme and the farm building scheme being held up in order to save money.

      <P>I hope the Deputy will deal with something when concluding the debate because he dealt with nothing when opening.  I hope the Deputy will deal with it.  I can give the reasons why it is not being operated as completely as we would like to see it being operated, and none of the reasons can be credited to us for its not being operated.  Deputy Dr. Ryan also made a statement about the farm building scheme.  Deputy Lemass might have given him one very good reason why that was not being operated.</P>
    </Speaker>

I want to tell Deputy Smith, and I make him a present of this and any farmer who wants to try to make use of it afterwards, that I am more concerned in seeing that for whatever building materials are available, so long as they are in short supply, building for the housing of human beings will get priority over building for the housing of animals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did know a whole lot more about the Department of Industry and Commerce when he was there than I did.  Perhaps he still knows as much as I know, but I doubt if he knows more than I know about it now.  I am making a statement here to-night that I can stand over&mdash;that cement is not yet in sufficient supply to enable us to issue licences freely for the building of houses for human beings&mdash;all the licences that are applied for.  That is the answer and I think it is a perfectly good answer.  We have no desire to hold up the farm building scheme.  We are more anxious to get on with it than the Deputies opposite were.  There is more need for it under this Government than under their Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

It certainly is not worthy of the man who was responsible in that position.  I want to say in relation to both the farm improvements scheme and the farm building scheme that this Government wholeheartedly believes in them.  I want to say that neither one <Col N="233" /> nor the other is being held up for the reason put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan namely, for the sake of economy. That is not so.</P>

      <P>Anyway, that is the position.  There is no question whatever of stalling on either of these two schemes.  I believe they are two good and necessary schemes and so do the Government, and these schemes will be advanced as rapidly as circumstances will allow them to be advanced. Let us get this into our minds.  Anyone living in rural Ireland or anyone reared in rural Ireland knows this to be true and, instead of grousing about it and trying to make capital out of it, we ought to be thankful that it is the position&mdash;that we have in this country to-day a standard of living perhaps higher than we ever had in the history of this country before.  That statement is true.  I am not saying that all farmers are getting as good prices as they would like to get; I am not saying that they are as well off as any of us would like to see them; but I say that, compared with any other year in their history, farmers are better off to-day. Deputy Corry smiles at that.  I ask Deputy Corry, who is a practical working farmer, if he can say honestly, as a farmer and not as a politician, that farmers are worse off to-day than 12 months or two years or five years ago. They are not.  There is no question about that.  Every farmer listening to me knows that that is true.  It is not right to start a ramp because we have been blessed with a bountiful harvest of oats.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy's idea of a remunerative market the scarcity price that obtained for oats last year? Does he think that should continue for all time?  Will he say what is a fair price for oats and, if so, what quality of oats?  I could say it very quickly because I know.  I may be accused myself of trying to score points, but I do want to say that the times are too serious and the agricultural industry is a bit too important for the sort of light-hearted motion which we have before us.  It was put down without much consideration.  I think that is very obvious&mdash;that it did not get very much consideration beforehand. That was made very obvious by the proposer and the seconder.  I do want to say that if Deputies would admit what is the true position they would have to admit that the motion is not justified.  We are not trying to coerce any Deputy into voting against it or for it.  If there are any Deputies <Col N="235" /> on this side of the House who are convinced on the case made either by the proposer or seconder for the motion, and on that case want to vote for it, well this is a free country and this is a free House.  If Deputy Smith, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Aiken and Deputy Dr. Ryan think that this motion, with another event that is taking place at the moment, is going to help them in East Donegal well they are entitled to get all they can out of it.  They have timed it very nicely in relation to the two other motions which were moved in the House yesterday.</P>

He thought of it long before you.  When you talk about the motion, remember that Deputy Cogan had a motion on the Order Paper long before the Fianna Fáil motion.

      <P>It is within the memory of most Deputies here that the Minister for Agriculture, in discussing Marshall aid, said that, if they could get Marshall aid by way of grant instead of loan, a huge sum of money would be made available to the Government for the improvement of land, of agricultural buildings and so forth. When Deputy Smith questioned the Minister for Agriculture as to why the farm improvement scheme was not proceeded with, the first alibi he had was that, when he came into office, there were 23,000 applications there unopened. When the Minister was cross-examined and questioned in the Dáil on that he had to admit that when he <Col N="236" /> came into office there were something like 27,000 forms filled in that had been put into his department, and he had to admit that that excuse was absolutely without foundation: that he was deceiving the country when he gave that excuse for not proceeding with the farm improvement scheme or the farm building scheme.  Now, afterwards, he let slip the real reason, which he denied on other occasions.  In speaking about Marshall aid, he said that, if they had the money, they could go ahead with these schemes.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is an artist in painting pictures in the air.  When he came back from London with the recent agreement he told the farmers to go ahead and produce all the potatoes, pigs, poultry and eggs that they could, and that he would see that there were going to be remunerative prices: that, for the first time, the farmers could go forth and plough their land, feed their pigs and hens and cows in the assurance that when they came to the market they were going to get remunerative prices for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>When he came in as Minister for Agriculture he put an end to the advertisements which were intended to encourage the farmers to <Col N="238" /> grow wheat and substituted for them advertisements urging them to grow more oats, telling them that they were guaranteed a remunerative market for them.  In September or October the farmers gently reminded him of that. But he turned on them and told them to stack their oats and that they were cads to sell the oats.  Many of them were small farmers who take conacre. When they saw the Minister's promise that they were going to get a remunerative price they changed from the planting of wheat to the planting of oats, but when they came to the Minister for Agriculture and asked him to fulfil his promise, they were told where to get off.</P>
      <P>The result of the Minister for Agriculture's change in February, March and April in the advertisements that were being issued from the Department of Agriculture was to decrease wheat by 63,000 acres and to increase oats by 57,000 acres.  Fifty-seven thousand additional acres of oats and 63,000 less acres of wheat. He has gone off now trying to get wheat for dollars.  He is begging the Americans to give him wheat for dollars; dollars which we cannot get for the exchange of pounds but dollars for which we have to mortgage the credit of this country for the next 50 years and pay interest on.  It would have been good for this country, good for the farmers, good for the consumers, good for the taxpayers if the Minister for Agriculture had not been so prejudiced against wheat and if he had gone on and encouraged the farmers to grow another 63,000 acres.</P>

      <P>We had the excuse attempted to be given by the Minister for Defence that this crisis in oats is due to the fact that we ordered oatmeal last year and that it was imported over this year.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, the purchase of that oatmeal could have been cancelled in April or May, or even February when the present Minister for Agriculture came into office.  But instead of stopping it he continued to import the oatmeal and changed the advertisements to the farmers urging them to increase their acreage of oats.  It is the combination of those two things that has left us with a surplus of unsaleable oats at the present time.  The Minister for Defence, who is the acting Minister for Agriculture, said to-day, that because of the low profits in agriculture under Fianna Fáil in the past the agricultural labourer was the worst paid.  Immediately before Fianna Fáil left office an increase in agricultural wages was announced by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Minister for Agriculture has recently announced that there is to be a further increase in agricultural wages next year.  Coupled with the increase in agricultural wages there is <Col N="240" /> a decrease in the price of agricultural; produce which requires labour for its production.  It is no wonder that the solution of the Minister for Agriculture for the world difficulties and the difficulties here in Ireland is the opening of the American gates to emigration.</P>
      <P>If farmers were so badly off that they could not pay what the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Agriculture would call decent wages under Fianna Fáil how are they going to pay decent wages when prices are falling? The result will be that the country will go rapidly out of tillage.  In an insecure world we shall have to be dependent upon foreigners to give us wheat, food for human beings, and cattle feeding.  The only solution that the agricultural worker or the small farmer will have for his difficulties will be the emigrant ship.

The Minister for Agriculture, when he returned from London, made one announcement in which I was very interested. He said that we were going to get a market for 50,000 tons of potatoes at £10 13s. per ton up to January and £11 10s. thereafter.  When he was asked if that was a fair price he said it was not a very good price but that it was at least a good thing to have that bottom to the price.  The other day he told the farmer who complained that he was only getting £7 a ton for his potatoes that he was very lucky to be getting that.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister for Defence pulled himself up rather well <Col N="243" /> to-day when he was giving the agricultural price index for last year and for this year.  When quoting the agricultural indexes for last year he stopped at September when the figure stood at 235.  He did not state that in December, 1947, the price index was 245.  In this year he stopped at September when the agricultural price index stood at 250.  It would be interesting to know what it was for October.  There was still some sale for oats in September. In September the oatmeal millers bought whatever oats they required for their production of oatmeal in the coming 12 months.  The slump came after that date.</P>
      <P>If the agricultural price index stood at 250 in September I am sure it is considerably below that figure to-day. I am sure it is below the figure of 245, or 248, at which it stood when Fianna Fáil went out of office.  Although the agricultural price index is probably lower to-day than it was at that time you have a big increase in rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They will have to face the people some time and say why it was they promised remunerative prices for everything they produced and why it was they failed so disastrously to keep their promises.  I hope that Deputy Davin will give us the benefit of his wisdom and justify, if he can, a policy which results in putting the farmers in the position that they do not know where they are from day to day in regard to agricultural prices.  If there is one industry that wants a reasonable guarantee of stable conditions over a long period, it is the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The agricultural community cannot simply switch from grass back to tillage overnight.  They cannot switch from sheep-farming or bullock ranching back to dairy farming overnight. It will be disastrous for this country, in the present state of the world, if we go back to grass at the disastrous rate at which it seems we are likely to go during the coming year.  If the trained body of agricultural labourers we now have on the land are driven off by the policy of the Coalition Government, it will be very hard in future years, if the Government wants to increase tillage, to replace them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been very unsatisfactory from many points of view.  It is unfortunate that a motion of this kind should be tabled when the Minister to whom it applies is absent.  It is like staging <i>Hamlet</i> without the Prince.  It is equally unfortunate that the two sponsors of this motion should be men who held the office of Minister for Agriculture for a long period.  It is hard to imagine <Col N="246" /> anything so strange as having these two men, with the sins of 16 years lying heavily on their souls, coming back here to plead for the farmers. It is something like the Prodigal Son coming back to his father's house.  In this instance we have two prodigal sons coming back to the farmer's door, pleading that they have never transgressed against him and hoping they will be received with open arms.  Perhaps they hope the farmer will go so far as to slay a fatted calf for their benefit.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, the motion is, even from the Fianna Fáil point of view, a foolish one.  It is vague and general in its terms.  It sets out to disapprove of the agricultural policy of this Government.</P>

      <P>This motion sets out to disapprove of the conduct of Government policy with regard to agriculture. In such circumstances I suggest that we have to go over in our minds the main features of Government policy during the past nine months. As I see it, the outstanding features of Government policy, the big events that have occurred with regard to agriculture during that period, are the trade agreement with Great Britain and the removal of compulsory tillage.  In addition to that, there was an increased price given for barley and a fixed price for wheat over a period of five years.  These were the main features of Government policy.  Every vote for this motion will be a vote of disapproval of those things.  Do the Fianna Fáil ex-Ministers for Agriculture seriously suggest that this House should disapprove of the trade agreement with Great Britain?  Do they seriously suggest that this House should disapprove of the removal of compulsory tillage?  Do they seriously suggest that we should disapprove of a guaranteed price for wheat over a period of five years?  It is upon these main features of Government policy that we have to express blame or praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I could not see my way to support a motion of <Col N="247" /> this kind.  Deputy O'Reilly and myself have a number of very important motions on the Order Paper.  They deal with specific matters.  They are not tabled to secure any political point or any Party advantage; they are tabled to achieve something of value for the agricultural community.  Those motions will come before this House in a very short time and Deputies will have an opportunity of deciding upon them.</P>
    <P>These motions seek better prices for some important agricultural products, such as milk and bacon pigs.  They seek also to ascertain farm costings and to obtain relief from the crushing burden of rates, and, what is also very important, they seek the introduction of a reasonable system of credit to promote the expansion and development of agriculture.  These are all important motions and they are, I think, the basis of a sound forward movement in regard to agriculture. There are Deputies on the Independent Benches who are not so very much concerned about what political Party or group of Ministers occupy the Government Benches.  They are much more concerned about what policy is pursued, particularly in regard to matters of economic and agricultural importance.  Since I came into this House ten years ago, I have consistently advocated for agriculture my own three F's &mdash; fixity of tenure, fair prices and fair rates.  I have never deviated from those principles and nobody can ever charge me with having failed to being these demands before the House and before whatever Government was in power at every available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Last June, when we were dealing with the Estimate for Agriculture, I laid down what I believed to be the fundamental principles which should guide a Minister for Agriculture in shaping agricultural policy.  There is, first, leadership and guidance to the agricultural industry.  It is not the right or duty of a Minister to let agriculture drift in whatever direction it may, to let any form of production develop which is not in the interests of progressive agriculture.  The Minister must give a guiding hand not only <Col N="248" /> in promoting better production but in promoting more employment on the land.  Secondly, I laid down that there must always be for agriculture in the future, as there was not during the past 25 years, a long term price policy, a price policy that will be fair to the producer and will give the producer a security which at present would be equal to the security which our fathers and grandfathers fought for in the days of the Land League.</P>
    <P>Security of price is as important as security of tenure, because, if a farmer has not got security of price, he does not know how soon he may be removed from his home and holding.  I also laid down that reasonable credit facilities are desirable and that Governmental policy should include provision for making available to the farming community the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and education.  These are the principles which should guide agricultural policy.  To whatever extent the present Minister has deviated from these principles, I have been critical of him.</P>
    <P>The question of oats has been referred to.  On 4th August last I asked the Minister if he could state what price farmers would receive for this season's oat crop and the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The market price of oats is not officially controlled.  Only a very small proportion of the crop is marketed in any season, and at this stage it would be difficult to forecast the effective demand for such part of the crop as will be offered for sale. The vast bulk of the crop is used for feeding direct to animals and the farmer who feeds his oats is assured of a remunerative return for his outlay on the crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked in a supplementary question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can the Minister give an assurance to those farmers who till extensively and who have not sufficient stock to consume all their oat crop that they will secure a reasonably good price for their crop this year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that supplementary, the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no doubt whatever that they will find oats a most remunerative <Col N="249" /> crop, but I have neither the power at present, nor for the moment the will, to guarantee the price in respect of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was very little more that could be said on that question at that time. The Minister had definitely indicated that the price would be remunerative, that the price to those farmers who used their oats as a feeding stuff and those who offered it for sale would be reasonable.  When the market opened, I found that there were clear indications that the price would not be reasonable or fair to the producer, and I wrote-to the Minister on the matter.  I pointed out that farmers had grown oats under compulsion, that there was a compulsory tillage Order by which a farmer was compelled to till a certain quota of his land, and, since it would be impossible to sow the entire tillage quota with wheat, barley or root crops, the effect of the Order was to compel a farmer to sow a certain quota of oats.</P>
    <P>My principle was then, as I made clear to the Minister, that, when the Government compels a farmer to produce a certain commodity, it is the bounden duty of the Government to provide a remunerative price for that commodity.  The Minister did not reply to that letter.  I wrote first on 8th September and I wrote again on 22nd September, emphasising the points I had made in my first letter, but he did not reply to that second letter.  I wrote a third time and only then did he consent to reply.  He informed me that, because certain speculators had purchased a certain quantity of oats during, I think, the months of June and July at prices from £2 to 45/- and because they held that quantity of oats, he could not see his way to relieve them, even though by refusing to do so he was inflicting a grave injustice upon the entire farming community, but particularly upon the poorer farmers who were compelled by economic circumstances to dispose of their oats crop.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there was no justification for the long delay on the part of the Minister in dealing with this question.  I am satisfied that it could have been dealt with, and dealt with effectively, in September, before the market opened, but, instead, the Department merely aggravated the <Col N="250" /> position by announcing that there were unlimited supplies of maize about to be imported at a low price.  During these very months, August, September and October, Grain Importers, Limited, were allowed to hawk round the country and to offer to merchants, creameries and other supplies of imported oats.  I do not know why that was allowed.  I am glad that at last this question has been dealt with, that at last machinery is being set up to purchase the oats crop which is on the farmers' hands.  I hope that a situation like this will never occur again, that no matter what Government is in power it will be recognised that the farmer has rights as well as duties and that a fundamental right is to get a fair price for his produce.  I do not care what Government is in power, I will assert that right.  A member of the Government and two or three sleek members of the legal profession went down to my constituency and accused me of political dishonesty in advocating a fair price for oats.  I will not accept that accusation from any man.  I have never been guilty of political dishonesty. Whatever I have stood by, I have never advocated anything which I did not believe to be sound, just, proper and right; and on the question of oats I can stand over and am proud of the action I have taken.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered whether farmers realised fully the extent to which they have been fooled over the past 25 years.  For 25 years, agriculture has been the plaything of political Parties.  It has been bedevilled by politicians.  That does not go for any one political Party: it goes for all.  I have been severe at times, and rightly so, upon the Party who are sponsoring this motion.  I believe that agriculture is the last section of our economic life that they should proceed to rebuke their successors in regard to.  Their entire career as a Government in regard to agriculture has been rotten, their entire policy has been wrong. They had an opportunity of putting the agricultural industry on a firm foundation. They came into power, it is true, when prices were at the lowest possible level.  That was a time when artificial fertilisers were freely available, a time when agricultural equipment of every <Col N="251" /> kind was freely available, a time when there was free trade throughout the world.  A strong Government and a far-seeing Government at that time could have put agriculture into a position of productivity that would have enabled us to take full advantage of the emergency period; but, unfortunately, the Government at that time played politics and let agriculture go to blazes.</P>
    <P>We know what the farming community have suffered as a result.  Not only have the farmers suffered, but agricultural workers as well.  The working population on the land has declined.  All that could have been avoided, if there were guiding principles of Governmental policy at that time, and if those principles were adhered to and carried out.  In the 25 years that this country has enjoyed political independence, agriculture has made no progress whatsoever.  The volume of agricultural production is as low to-day as it was when this State was established.</P>
    <P>We talk about Partition and yet we see that in the six partitioned counties the volume of agricultural production has gone up by 50 per cent. since 1922.  Why had not we the same expansion in agricultural production here?  Because we allowed sleek politicians from the cities to dominate agriculture, to make it just a shuttlecock to be thrown from one political Party to another.  We have people here in this House who have said that the bullock was a disaster to the country and other people who said that wheat was a cod.  The plain, simple farmer does not hold such views.  He does not deride or denounce any particular branch of agricultural production.  He knows that all have their place in the entire programme of maximum production.</P>
    <P>Why have we got that expansion in agricultural production in Northern Ireland, and in the last few years also in Great Britain?  Simply because the Governments of those countries have done a little bit of clear thinking and have realised that you cannot get production unless you treat the producer fairly.  When I compare the prices that are paid to the agricultural <Col N="252" /> producers of Northern Ireland and Britain with the prices that are paid here, some people will say: &ldquo;That is all right, but agricultural prices are subsidised in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; those countries are wealthy industrial countries and can use the profits of industry to promote agricultural development.&rdquo;  But what are the facts?  The facts are that the expansion in agricultural production that has taken place in Britain and Northern Ireland has more than repaid anything that was spent upon agriculture by the State.</P>
    <P>Remember this: as the Minister for Agriculture has pointed out, even to-day or yesterday in the United States, we can expand agricultural production by at least 25 per cent. without any difficulty.  But everybody who has given thought to the matter knows that we can expand it by 50 per cent. At the present time, the output of agriculture is worth £100,000,000.  If we expand it by 50 per cent., we add £50,000,000 to the wealth of this country.  That £50,000,000 would go a long way to pay the farmer a decent price for his produce.  Yet in our blindness, or rather not in the blindness of the farmers, but in the blindness of the politicians, we keep on muddling away as we have been for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that certain agricultural prices should be improved immediately. Pig prices are one of them. The price paid for bacon pigs is not an economic one.  It may be said that, some time, costs of feeding will be reduced. Well, if they are, it will be time enough, when that happens, to reduce the price to what it is at present. In the meantime, we must give the producer an economic price.  I am often alarmed at the type of advertisement that our Department of Agriculture issues in the public Press. Deputies will have noticed, during the last few weeks, large-scale advertisements in all the papers setting forth the virtues of the sow pig.  You would imagine from reading these wonderful advertisements and this wonderful publicity that the sow pig was reared in a convent and could play the piano in the drawing-room.  It said: &ldquo;She will keep her home perfectly clean, <Col N="253" /> clean as a new pin; she will produce 20 pigs in a year, worth £100 at ten weeks old.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Government to the danger of such advertisements as these.  When you say that 20 pigs are worth £100, that naturally implies that you are guaranteeing the producers £5 each for these bonhams and that will be interpreted as a State guarantee of £5 each.  The advertisement concludes by saying: &ldquo;Nothing will pay better than one sow pig except, two sow pigs&rdquo;.  If every farmer keeps two additional sows what is going to happen?  Everybody knows that in the course of 12 months or less the market will be glutted.  I do not think it would be pleasant, if that happens, for anybody who even faintly resembles the Minister for Agriculture to visit a farm where there are a few hungry and angry sow pigs owned by an angry farmer.  I think that the first fundamental in regard to hoping for increased production or asking a farmer to increase production is to be perfectly forthright and honest with him. Tell him exactly the things for which you will guarantee a price and give him a firm guarantee in regard to them. Tell him that there are other things in which there is a chance of a profit but which are more or less of a speculative nature.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had a debate in this House on the question of long term guaranteed prices which, I think, I initiated.  I then stated that there was a certain number of agricultural commodities for which you could guarantee a price over a long period and that there were other commodities that might be left to chance.  I think everybody knows that that is reasonable.  You cannot guarantee a price for all agricultural commodities and in this agitation for a guaranteed price for oats, I never asked for a long-term guaranteed price for oats because I do not think that is possible or a sound policy.  I did stress the fact that, at least for this year, when you had a Tillage Order in operation, the farmer should be allowed to get out without loss.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that milk prices at present are uneconomic.  Farmers are getting out of milk production and <Col N="254" /> it is a bad thing that they should.  It takes a lifetime to build up a dairy herd and, when a dairy herd is dispersed, it is not likely to be re-established in that farmer's lifetime.  Those who produce milk for the cities and towns are expected, and rightly expected, to conform to strict regulations in regard to the system of production. They are expected to fulfil many regulations. That is only right and proper but it is equally right and proper that they should be amply remunerated for their production.  Compare the prices obtainable for milk here with the prices paid in Britain and Northern Ireland. They are at least 25 per cent. higher in those countries.  Why?  Because the Government realises that you cannot expect efficient and decent production unless you pay a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>When we set out to compare prices here with those in Britain and in Northern Ireland, we have got to remember that, not only have the British farmers and the Six County farmers an advantage in regard to prices, but they also have a number of other outstanding advantages.  A great many of the tillage crops grown on the land there carry with them an acreage bounty which is equivalent to an additional price.  A £10 bounty on each acre of potatoes is equivalent, I suppose, on the average, to an additional £1 per ton for the potatoes.  All these things give the farmers in those countries an advantage over others.  What is the result of that advantage?  We see the results and the repercussions in a higher standard of living and a higher standard of prices in these adjoining countries.  We see our best cows being exported to Britain because the people who are getting a better price for a milk can pay a better price for cows.  We see, in addition, our best agricultural workers going across to Britain to enjoy the better wages paid over there because agriculture is more profitable and prosperous.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to look into those questions and to look into them immediately.  There is no use in people getting up publicly and saying that agriculture was never so prosperous.  Not on one occasion did the Minister for Agriculture get up in a public place and say that agriculture <Col N="255" /> was never so prosperous but that the next day an additional blister was placed on the farmer's back.  When you go around the country saying that agriculture was never so prosperous you are only asking that an additional burden be placed on the farmers.  If some people claim that we farmers are dishonest in seeking a fair price for our produce we &mdash; Deputy O'Reilly and myself &mdash; have flung down a challenge to these Parties.  We have asked the Department to conduct a farm in a district in each county, according to their rules and according to their scientific knowledge as to how a farm should be conducted and to prove, by the working of those farms, the amount of profit that can be made out of land.  The Minister and the Department have so far declined to accept that challenge. They run around it and beat about it in every possible way to avoid coming to a decision, but sooner or later they will be forced to accept it and adopt it. During the last few days the Minister for Agriculture referred again to the belief that there will be an extension of at least 25 per cent. in agricultural production. I believe that this is capable of being achieved.</P>
    <P>One of the first things required to bring about that expansion is a completely effective and efficient system of credit for agriculture.  At present there is no system by which a farmer can get assistance to improve his holding. A farmer who wants to build a new house will receive from the county council a loan of up to £1,600 on the security of that house alone. That is generous enough.  I would be inclined to think it was foolish generosity on the part of the county council. That is the present state of affairs under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, but a farmer with a farm worth £1,000 or £2,000 who wants to put the farm into efficient production by the use of fertilisers and lime cannot borrow 1/- from any source for that development.  The soil improvement and 100 per cent. increased productive capacity which could be brought about by intensive manuring would be a greater national asset than even a new dwellinghouse on the farm.  At least, it would be a greater <Col N="256" /> security for the amount of the loan. Yet, such is our outlook on financial questions and in regard to credit that, so far, no Government has had the courage or initiative to launch out boldly on the provision of better credit facilities for agriculture.  We all know &mdash; it is a matter of history &mdash; that the British Government, 50 years ago when it is supposed that Governments were not so progressive as they are to-day, advanced to the farmers of this country £110,000,000 to buy out the landlords' interest.  Every farmer in the country derived benefit from that advance.  That money was advanced on the security of the farms alone and was repaid year by year.  The farming community are an honest community on the whole.  They like to pay their way and, given reasonable opportunity, they will always pay their way.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell unduly on these matters.  I have stressed very strongly that our survival as a nation depends on our ability to put agriculture on its feet and to make it at least 25 per cent. and, if possible, 50 per cent. more productive than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>Dr. Henry Kennedy in his Minority Report on Agricultural Policy estimated that agriculture requires additional capital to the extent of £217,000,000.  He estimated that £58,000,000 is required to put the land into a state of fertility by the addition of lime and fertilisers; that £100,000,000 is required for farmhouses and building generally; that £25,000,000 is required for the provision of up-to-date machinery; that £22,000,000 is required for increased stock and that £15,000,000 would be required for the improvement of water supplies on the farm, making a total of approximately £217,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is the lack of courage, the lack of vision that is paralysing the agricultural industry.  Every day you see young people going across to England and making a living there, in a country that is fundamentally poorer than ours. They are making a living in that country because there is a Government there that is grappling in a clearsighted way with agricultural problems. Yet here we have what is in one sense an advantage in having a large acreage to a proportionately small population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> There is no reason why a population of 3,000,000 should not enjoy the highest possible standard in a country that has 12,000,000 acres of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that one of the principles that should guide the Minister for Agriculture is that it is his duty to shape agricultural policy in the right direction; it is his duty to see that the land is not only profitable to the occupier but is producing what is best for the nation.  The Minister should achieve that and can achieve that, not by coercion, not by compulsory Orders, but by reasonable inducement.</P>
    <P>I sometimes regret that the step taken in abolishing compulsory tillage has not been accompanied by a more vigorous effort to expand agricultural production. It is the duty of the Government to see that there is no diminution in the number of people living, working and getting a living on the land. It is the duty of the Government to see that that number is increased.  That can be done by inducement.  The first big step is the provision of credit for agricultural development.  The second is to guarantee that everything that the State wishes to be produced in the national interest will carry a long-term guaranteed price.  Given those facilities the farmer will, I am certain, deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>I have been, to a certain extent, disappointed with some of the aspects of Ministerial policy.  I have been disappointed, first of all, with the delay in putting the farm improvements scheme into operation.  I have been disappointed with the delay in putting the farm buildings scheme into operation. No matter what has been said to the contrary, I am satisfied that these delays were unjustifiable.  I am dissatisfied as a result of the delay in paying the farmer a decent price for his oats.  I am dissatisfied as a result of the delay in raising the price of milk and bacon pigs to a price commensurate with the cost of production; but nothing that has happened in the past nine months would induce me to trail behind the two ex-Ministers for Agriculture and vote with them on this important matter.</P>

      <P>If there were any good reason why Fianna Fáil should now be squirming and bringing into the House a motion of this character it would be that, fundamentally, the change in agricultural policy has been directed in such a way as to be completely outside the conception of either Deputy Dr. Ryan or Deputy Smith during their period of office as Minister for Agriculture.  The period has come in this country when the Minister is trying to direct its mind on broad general principles to develop an agricultural policy that will have some realism in a term of years, and not day to day expediency and the plaything of stupidity such as it was under the late administration.  If there is any reason why one should not vote for Deputy Smith's and Deputy Ryan's motion it is the futility and weakness of the case that they themselves have made.  I think that when this debate is finished both Deputy Smith and Deputy Ryan will leave this House with their oats well crushed.  I hear giggles from the backbenchers over there, but the point is, that into Irish agricultural life has come back a spirit that was there in the days of the late Paddy Hogan.  Back into Irish agricultural life has come the right of the farmer to please himself and how hard it is hitting the Opposition is to be seen when they try to build on a foundation of oats a vote of censure against the Government.  It is true &mdash; and I know it because I represent a constituency that grows a lot of oats&mdash;that in a typical Fianna Fáil propagandist way and building on the stupidity that they themselves are largely responsible for, they are trying to pit the question of the price of oats this year against the luxury scarcity price of last year.  That has no reality in practical farm economy and it has further revealed the incredible stupidity of the co-operation of Deputy Lemass and Deputy Smith in the oatmeal situation.  It is quite true that this year, through the bounty of nature, the harvest has been better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken stands up, blundering, rambling, stupid as usual, trying to make a case that we have 57,000 more acres of oats and 63,000 less acres of wheat.  If some of those 63,000 less acres <Col N="259" /> refer to land that was in wheat production last year under Deputy Smith, I am very glad that something has been got off it because nothing was got off it last year.  What is the real situation?  I will tell you what the real situation is.  Fianna Fáil in the course of the last couple of months has got so many sorry kicks in so many different directions that they are coming in here on the eve of a by-election trying to bolster up the situation that they cannot even build a sound premise for. I am not going to put a tooth in it.  I think you know as much about agriculture to-day as you did for the last 16 years and you can give as little competent criticism.  If we were to take a vote of censure in this House on the record of 16 years of catastrophic failure then we are all fit for an establishment other than Dáil Eireann. Never in your administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was criticised severely by his agricultural Ministerial colleagues but it was forced down their necks by Deputy Aiken.  That is typical of what their competent agricultural policy was.

      <P>To build an argument you must get your premises sound and to build an agricultural policy you must get your approach sound.  My approach to agriculture is the one that possibly I was born into. It is a very simple one.  We take the farmer in West Cork as an economic unit.  We plan our whole agricultural economy on a very simple basis, on what is going to yield us the best profit.  In the main, we accept the theory that the best way to farm your land is on a mixed cereal basis, to feed as much of the cereals as you possibly can to your stock and to make your real return profit out of your farm on the sale of your stock at the finish of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In parts of my constituency they grow oats, which has been so much discussed here, as a cash crop.  As has been suggested, <Col N="262" /> they grow it to meet certain commitments. I have been down there week-end after week-end since the oats situation has arisen and the attitude of the farmer there is simple.  He can see clearly some of the difficulties that have arisen with regard to the abundance of his harvest and the fact that there is no storage available in the mills and he knows perfectly well that that is not the fault of the present inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are to build an agricultural policy, you have to be able to do so on the basis of getting a farmer, if he is to till his land, to do it by the encouragement of the margin of profit he is going to receive out of his labour and that can be done, as suggested by the Minister for Agriculture and as spoken of now by Deputy Cogan, by a long-term fixation of prices in relation to certain crops.  I would go further than to say certain crops.  I feel that any crop grown by farmers should be capable of being dealt with in a plan of fixation of prices and that a farmer, no matter what particular type of crop he grows, should be in a position to be able to estimate for himself what amount of profit will accrue from that.  I feel that the present agricultural policy as directed by the Minister is tending in that direction.  We have a fixed price for wheat and a fixed price for barley. In the situation that has arisen this year I think the country generally will accept it that the Minister was never in a position to fix a fair price for oats because he was suffering from the hangover of an abnormal and unprecedented high price for oats last year owing to scarcity.  Faced with that situation, I think the Minister took at least a courageous course and that the assurance now given to us, which Deputy Smith has suggested is a purely stop-gap measure, should allay any worry on the mind of any farmer, because a large number of farmers have accepted the Minister's assurance and stored their oats which they will not thresh until the direction comes in the early spring from the Department as to where the market will be available and what the price will be like.  I think the Minister has given a fair assurance to the farmer in furtherance of his undertaking when he says that the crop <Col N="263" /> that is threshed and that is on hands will be bought up.</P>
    <P>The trend of the present agricultural policy is to get back to the idea of making your farm a more or less self-contained economic unit in which the fundamental object will be ultimately to take your cereals off the land in the way of cattle or, as is the new drift, in the way of poultry, eggs or bacon.  That is my idea of a sound agricultural policy and I think the present Minister for Agriculture is driving hard towards that policy.</P>
    <P>The second plank on which Fianna Fáil purport to build their case for censuring the Government is the question of potatoes.  I think it is generally recognised and acknowledged, and I am sure any member of the Opposition will acknowledge it, that this year has proved to be an extraordinary year in regard to the bountifulness of the potato crop.  To have arrived at the position in which the British Government, faced with a glut of potatoes of their own, are prepared to honour a bargain in a trade agreement and take 50,000 tons of potatoes off this country's market at a certain price is, I think, an achievement in regard to which any of us who have any honesty will in all sincerity take our hat off to the Minister for Agriculture for the astuteness that he showed in concluding that agreement.  Is that the reason why we in this House should now be asked to condemn that man?  Is that a reason why we should be asked now to censure his agricultural policy?</P>
    <P>There is only one complaint which I have against the Department of Agriculture, that it is going a bit too slow. If the credit of this country is as high as we are led to believe it is and as it is agreed in this House that it is, the Minister for Agriculture should exercise his mind on large schemes of easily available credit at very low rates of interest, if any interest at all, for the purpose of providing the farmer with the capital to develop to what extent he possibly can whatever holding he has.  There is no good in coming in here and purporting to condemn a man and his policy because of small incidentals that may not be right at the <Col N="264" /> moment and that I feel certain will right themselves in the course of a very short time.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the Minister for Agriculture, whom we know to have a certain type of outlook on problems, may attack a problem in a full-blooded way.  It may be that, in his urge to get farmers into oats production, they overtilled a little or even overtilled a lot in the light of the present market situation.  I feel that the Minister has stood true to his belief in what the future agricultural policy of this country can be, and if he has erred in his optimism or enthusiasm I do not think that is a reason for condemnation. On the contrary, I think it is a reason why our farming community should have great hope that under this Administration the balanced economy which should be in our agriculture will be brought about.</P>
    <P>I think that the Deputies on the other side, and the Fianna Fáil people who framed this motion, should realise that agriculture is a very much wider concept than oats or potatoes, and that there are temporary difficulties in the market everywhere at the moment, so far as potatoes and oats are concerned. I think that those opposite, in trying to take advantage of present difficulties, are only showing up in very stark relief their own gross inefficiency of that concept, their own stupidity and outlook.  I want to assert that I really believe that we are on the road back to &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this motion, we are dealing with one particular item in our economy, namely, agriculture.  I submit that is hardly a fair way to approach the whole economy of the country by taking apart one particular item.  It is true, of course, that agriculture forms a major part of our whole economy.  Nevertheless, it cannot be considered entirely apart from all the other elements of industry which go to make up the whole. I am rather doubtful as to how far one can concentrate on agriculture alone and come to a decision on it.  There never was a time in the history of agriculture in this country or I suppose in that of any other country, when there <Col N="265" /> have not existed strong grounds for complaint on the part of those engaged in it.  Agriculture is different from all other forms of industry to the extent that it is beyond the power of any Government to forecast how crop production may be affected by weather conditions.  It is different in that respect from industrial production since those engaged in it can carry on their activities under cover.  We all know how weather conditions affect the success or otherwise of crop production. In the case of agriculture, there is that element of uncertainty.  It is an element that is beyond the power of man to control.  Agriculture has ever been the plaything of the elements.</P>
      <P>There is that aspect of the problem to be considered, one which has beaten the greatest experts.  Advances of great importance have been made by those engaged in the scientific study of agriculture, particularly in the production of seeds to meet varying climatic conditions, in the treatment of animal diseases and of plant life.  Despite all their advances, they have never been able, with any degree of certainty, to establish that a particular crop can be successfully and profitably produced on a particular acre of land since crop production is so much dependent on weather conditions.  Therefore, for those engaged in agriculture there is always that degree of uncertainty.  In that sense agricultural production is altogether different from industrial production.  If we are to develop our agriculture by pushing up prices or by ensuring that those engaged in it will be paid the full price for their labour, we are faced with a problem that is immense in its implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, if we are to be equitable and say that those engaged in the production of oats, beet, wheat and other agricultural products are to be paid the full price for their labour and for their capital investments, we may rest assured that, with such a guarantee from the Government, we are going to have an increased interest taken in agricultural production here. It follows, then, that we are going to have a greater number of people engaged in production.  All that, of course, is very necessary on the surface, but in reality when we undertake <Col N="266" /> that, we must also assume that, regardless of the economic conditions prevailing at the time, we are going to pay the specific prices guaranteed by the taxpayers to those engaged in that production.  Having reached that point, is it for a moment to be assumed that we can give such a guarantee without increasing the cost of living?</P>
    <P>It will be admitted, I think, that those engaged in agricultural production, not only here but in every country in the world, are carrying far greater risks than those engaged in any other line of production.  If we are to give the guarantee that I speak of, then we must make up our minds that it is the taxpayers who will have to bear the cost.  Is there to be a guaranteed price for the man who owns land and tills it, regardless of what he produces and having regard to the uncertainties under which his production is carried on?  Are we, then, going to stand by and increase production by increasing the cost of living?  With all that before us, do we not know that the whole outcry to-day is to get back to normality? Would it not be better for the farmer to lower his cost of living than to increase the price of the commodities that he is asked to produce? I have little sympathy with the present Minister for Agriculture.  He is not by any means the most popular Minister for Agriculture that this country has known, and he has made statements that are misleading and that have caused a lot of anxiety to the farmers in the country generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I must have regard for his general policy and his long view of agricultural prospects. I leave out the individual.  In this country about 150 years ago the farmers were compelled to destroy the soil of the land which was temporarily theirs. They did so because they had to produce oat crops which were essential. They burned the soil in doing so.  If I am not mistaken it was found necessary at that time to bring in legislation to make that conduct criminal.  The results of that period of intensive tillage which was forced on the farmers of the time are to be seen in various parts of the country.  That soil has <Col N="267" /> never got back its productivity and, as far as one can gauge, it never will.  As a result of the recent emergency we have had a period of many years of intensive cultivation.  If fortune and nature had not put into storage the fertility of our soil which was created by years of grazing and years of manuring, what would have been our position during those years of emergency in the absence of artificial manures when compulsory tillage was found to be necessary and was justly applied?  To a very great extent, now, that reserve has been exhausted. Probably if this country were confronted within the next few years with another period of emergency which would necessitate intensive production and cultivation of the soil of this country &mdash; without immense increases in imports of artificial manures &mdash; we would find ourselves in the same condition as that in which our forefathers found themselves 150 years ago.  We would have to burn and destroy permanently and put out of production the soil of this country.  I am, therefore, to an extent prepared to see the experiment introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, unpopular though he may be, because I feel it is essential to bring back the fertility of the soil of this country by resting it and by applying more and more artificial manures. The Minister has promised us artificial manures.  Let us hope we will get them because they will be welcome.  Let us rest, then, so far as we can, the soil that is fairly well exhausted and preserve it for future contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of maize meal as a feeding-stuff is a welcome asset to the extent that it can be imported cheaply and thus bring about increased production in pigs and poultry and improve the feeding of animals generally.  It is well recognised that there is no substitute to equal maize meal in the feeding of farm animals.  If it can be procured cheaply the farmer will not alone be able to increase the number of pigs for the market and the number of eggs and poultry but he will be able to improve the condition of his live stock in general.  When that stage is reached we come to the highly important second point.  My first point was the resting of <Col N="268" /> the land and my second point is whether we can produce increased commodities in the way of agricultural products &mdash; pigs, poultry, eggs and milk &mdash; by importing cheap foreign feeding stuffs?  If we can, we have reached a highly important stage indeed in our development and we can, possibly, look forward to a reduction in the cost of living.  If the Minister for Agriculture can increase supplies at a reduced price without interfering with the income of the farmer or of the producer I am in sympathy with him.  Dr. Ryan said that this motion caused the Government to increase the oat prices. I believe he is fully justified in making that statement.  I do not think that anything could have been worse form than the Minister's attitude in regard to his treatment of the people who produced oats under compulsory conditions last year.  Agriculture is not an easy matter to develop.  It takes time and you must go by the season and the year; it cannot be changed automatically. Having produced under compulsory conditions the farmers are finding themselves with a surplus of oats this year owing to the favourable weather conditions for one year.  Compelled to produce them, however, and reasonably inclined to the belief that having produced them under compulsory conditions they were entitled to an economic price &mdash; and they were promised that &mdash; they found themselves unable to sell their oats.</P>
    <P>I have heard prices for which oats were sold mentioned here.  I know that in certain big oat producing areas oats were hardly saleable at 20/- a barrel.  Why in the name of goodness did Mr. Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, not take action when he saw this position two months ago?  The Government moved yesterday because this motion, as Dr. Ryan says, was down and they were challenged to do so. Their attitude of yesterday is no credit to them.  They allowed many farmers to sell their oats at 20/- per barrel, if not less, to my knowledge.  What are they going to do to make restitution to these men?  Above all, this has proved to the farmers that they cannot now believe in the policy of a Government or of a Minister who allows them to move forward under <Col N="269" /> compulsory conditions with the semi-guarantee that they are not going to produce at a loss and who ultimately leaves them in a mess in which their losses are great.  I condemn the Government beyond reprieve and I give them no credit for their guarantee given yesterday that these prices are now to be rectified.  It came late.  Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Smith may justly claim that they are responsible for bringing about this guarantee. There must be continuity in any policy if that policy is to have the confidence of the people.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, speaking here to-day, said that he &ldquo;claimed &mdash; and I feel justifiably so &mdash; that I was responsible for the increase as mentioned in the price of oats.&rdquo; He also referred to dairying and the dangerous position in which the dairying industry is at the moment.  It is true that the dairying industry is in a precarious predicament.  I appreciate fully the Minister for Agriculture's statement that he will not subsidise inefficient 300-gallon cows.  But there are other problems.  How are you going to subsidise dairying?  How are you going to make dairying an economic proposition?  How are you going to subsidise agricultural production in order to make it an economic proposition?  What is an economic price?</P>
    <P>Does the House realise that the difference between producing milk down in Leitrim, parts of Cavan, Donegal and along the West of Ireland is two or three times greater than it is in Dublin, Limerick and other places? Does the House realise that the cost of producing oats, potatoes and other commodities of that kind from Kerry to Donegal is two to five times greater in labour content and production yield than it is in other areas?  On what standard then are you going to fix your prices?  Deputy Dr. Ryan says that the farmer is not getting enough for his milk or his agricultural produce.  Will Deputy Dr. Ryan say to what figure those prices should be increased?  I assume that Deputy Dr. Ryan will say that the price should be increased to such a level as would make it economic for the farmers.  Will Deputy Dr. Ryan tell me what is an economic price for the producers growing oats in <Col N="270" /> Leitrim as against those in Kildare? What is an economic price for milk production and other commodities in Leitrim as against Tipperary and elsewhere? Is not agriculture a peculiar problem?  This bandying of word for word and challenge for challenge across the floor of this House will never settle that problem.  No Minister for Agriculture has ever yet succeeded in solving the problem as to what is an economic price having regard to the needs and necessities and the varying costs of production in the different areas.</P>
    <P>I came into this House to-day prepared to vote on the motion before the House.  Having listened to the debate, I feel that I can serve no useful purpose in either voting for or against it. When the present Government was formed I said that they were entitled to a chance.  I am not going to vote on a motion singled out because it lends itself at all times to condemnation no matter what Minister is in power.  In that fashion it casts a slur upon the existing Government.  I say they are entitled to a chance and I am prepared to give them that chance in the months to come until we see what the results are.  It is possible that there may be a change of front.  The outcry that has taken place has led to an improvement in the price paid for oats to the farmer.</P>
    <P>If the Government bring forward schemes which show that they are prepared to deal with agriculture, particularly in the West of Ireland and in the case of the small landholders, on an equitable basis so that the farmers will make an economic living out of their land, then their attitude is a just one and they are entitled to support. In the next six months I shall await some indication that the Government are going to keep their promises and that for the first time in the history of this country agriculture will be dealt with on an equitable basis for the benefit of the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Smith and his colleagues who initiated this debate had brought the matter before the House on its merits rather than as a matter of no confidence in the Minister for Agriculture personally, and as a matter of no confidence in the Government's agricultural policy as a whole, <Col N="271" /> I think we would have had a much more interesting debate and those of us who are not practical farmers would have had an opportunity of improving our education in that direction.  Having listened to Deputy Smith's introductory speech, I came to the conclusion &mdash; and I am not the only one &mdash; that this motion was brought in for the sole purpose of making a personal attack upon the present Minister for Agriculture apart altogether from the merits or demerits of the policy of the Government of which he is a member.  Anybody who reads the official report of the speech made by Deputy Smith can come to no other conclusion.  Because of the way in which Deputy Smith introduced this debate, we are compelled to show that we have greater confidence in the Government and in their policy and in their effort to frame a better agricultural economy than we had in their predecessors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith's speech was merely a continuous criticism of the personality of the Minister and of the Government as a whole.  No constructive suggestion of any kind was put forward by him, nor did he offer any alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that Deputy Smith, when he concludes this debate, will tell us what policy he would have pursued had he been permitted by the will of the people or by a majority in this House to occupy again the seat he occupied before last February.  If Deputy Smith wants us to consider this matter on its merits, he cannot achieve that purpose by merely criticising the policy of the powers that be.  He must put forward a better alternative than the present policy of the Minister for Agriculture. There are certain matters in which the Minister and the Government may be held to blame.  We must not deceive ourselves on that.  In honesty we cannot congratulate the Minister on the handling of the oats question.  The problem of finding a remunerative market for oats is a serious one in my constituency. It does not affect the large or middle-class farmers in that area.  It affects the smallholders who took conacre this year at from £7 to £16 per acre.  On the authority of several speakers here, who have the statistics at their fingertips, we know that there <Col N="272" /> has been an increase of 57,000 acres under oats this year.  Those oats have been sown mainly by the small tillage farmers.  They are a large section of the community.  They accepted the Minister's advice and took conacre at high prices.  I made representations on the matter to the Minister and I urged him to implement the promises he made to the county committees of agriculture last March and to guarantee an economic price for oats which were then about to be threshed.  I made those representations in the first week in October.  I received a reply from his private secretary from which I shall read an extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of fixing a minimum price for oats has been carefully considered by the Minister who has, however, come to the conclusion that effective control would be impracticable.  It is the Minister's view that any farmer not in a position to dispose of his oats immediately at a remunerative price should consider feeding the crop or retaining it unthreshed until next spring.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on further to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to add that the export of oats or oatmeal as a means towards increasing the demand for oats is being considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Put yourself in the position of any small farmer who grew oats as a cash crop, or, worse still, in the position of a cottage tenant &mdash; and there are many of them in my area &mdash; who took a conacre letting at a ridiculously excessive price.  They have grown and threshed oats that nobody wants and they have that crop still on their hands.  They cannot use it in the manner indicated by the Minister because they have no live stock; they grew it purely as a cash crop.  That is the position in areas quite convenient to some of our biggest flour millers, who made a fortune at the expense of the community and at the expense, particularly, of the small farmers.  If there was more pressure brought to bear on this gangster crowd of millers who have been fleecing this country for years, something better might be done for the small farmers, the people who took arable <Col N="273" /> land in the Midlands at excessive prices.  I should like to hear from some speaker on the Government Benches why more pressure was not brought to bear on Mr. Rank and some of his friends.</P>
    <P>I found myself last week-end confronted with this position in an area in my constituency where there are only small farmers.  They still have oats on their hands because it will not be bought at any price.  I know that a limited amount of oats was purchased in a certain portion of my constituency at 27/- a barrel, but the average price would not exceed 22/- for those who are obliged to sell their oat crop simply because they grew it as a cash crop and had no storage capacity.  They have to get rid of it at a pawnbroker's price.  That will not encourage small farmers or people with conacre lettings to grow this or any other crop, even on the advice of the Minister, unless there is a guaranteed market at a profitable price.  That is the policy for which this group always stood.  That is the policy we will pursue and I hope it will make some impression on the Government and that there will be no repetition in the years to come of what has happened in the case of oats this year.</P>
    <P>The constituency of the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be affected in the same way as my constituency. He knows more about this matter than I do and I hope he will see that I am not exaggerating the position.  If the Minister for Agriculture encouraged different committees of agriculture to grow oats and guaranteed a market for the crop, that guarantee should have been honoured.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with potatoes.  The price of potatoes affects both producer and consumer.  It affects the producer this year inasmuch as he has not got a profitable price for his potatoes. There is a surplus crop, due to good weather and the will of God.  What is the effect as regards the price for the consumer?  What have responsible Ministers done to control the middlemen, who undoubtedly have been profiteering at the expense of both the producer and the consumer?  What has been done in an official way to bring middlemen to their senses as regards <Col N="274" /> the price charged for potatoes?  In parts of my constituency potatoes have been sold at £5 a ton, and up to a couple of weeks ago they were retailed in the area where I reside at 2/- and 2/4 a stone.  In some cases they have been carried from the country to the city in lorries that have not merchandise plates.  That is part of the racketeering business.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for the difference between £5 a ton and 2/- to 2/4 a stone on the consumer.  There is something radically wrong there.  You could afford a much higher price to the producer and at the same time give a reasonable profit to the middleman if you were to allow retailers to charge 2/- to 2/4 a stone.  I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter.  He has powers to see that this excessive profit-making by the middlemen should be stopped. Drastic action must be taken or otherwise there will be trouble in industrial centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the standard of living here is higher than ever it has been.  Apply that statement to the wage-earner who lives in a city like Dublin where high rents are going higher.  If so applied, I do not think that that would be a correct statement. The wage-earners have received increases of only 50 per cent. over their pre-war wages, and will anyone suggest that an increase of wages to that extent is sufficient to maintain even the pre-war standard of living for a Dublin worker, a city where everything has gone up from 100 to 300 per cent.?</P>

      <P>With regard to potatoes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has as much knowledge as any other Deputy of what is going on in the city.  He knows that a food supply depôt has been established by the Dublin Corporation.  I have been informed by a responsible member of the corporation, one associated very closely with the working of this depôt, which has not yet come into full operation, that they propose to sell potatoes at 11d. a stone.  They can buy potatoes at the price ruling in the country, bring them to the city and sell them at 11d. a stone, while around them in the same streets are people selling potatoes at 2/- and 2/4 a stone. That is something that can be acted upon in order to bring down the retail price of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>One matter that was not referred to by members of the Opposition, with the exception of Deputy Ryan, is the trade agreement.  I was surprised to learn from Deputy Ryan that they made an agreement on prices with the British Government when they went over there last October or November.  When I challenged him he could not remember the date &mdash; he could not even remember the month.  It was the first time I heard from anybody on the Fianna Fáil benches that an agreement was made with the British Government last October or November in relation to cattle prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that the trade agreement made by the members of this Government in relation to cattle and agricultural products is bound gradually to improve the position of everybody associated with the agricultural industry.  I have knowledge that it is already having its effect in regard to the production of eggs and poultry, because there is a considerable increase <Col N="276" /> in eggs and poultry.  I am prepared to say that Deputy Smith and others deserve some of the credit for the prosperity which is coming to people now engaged in egg and poultry production. The agreement cannot have an immediate effect, and nobody ever thought it could have, on the prices of cattle or the number of cattle exported to Great Britain, especially so long as there is a better market and a better price available for those buying cattle in this country for export to continental countries, but it is bound to have its effect, and I have told all my constituents, since this trade agreement was signed, that the small farmers and cottage tenants would be well advised to get into poultry and egg production in parts of the country in which they have never before engaged in that industry. I say there is a great future for the small farmer and cottage tenant in following that line and time will prove whether that is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have referred to the precarious position of the dairying industry.  I have taken an interest in this matter for a good many years, and, with other Deputies, different Deputies from time to time, who were colleagues of mine in the constituency I represent, I did everything I possibly could to encourage the establishment of co-operative creameries in that part of the country.  I will do anything I can at any time to encourage that kind of activity in the agricultural industry, which will give the farmer a cash price for what he has to sell, instead of his having to go, as in days gone by, and pawn his agricultural produce with the person who was the best pawnbroker in the area.  I have read some of the reports of the co-operative creameries operating in my constituency and I read the very interesting articles recently written by Professor Johnston and published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on this matter, and one of the things that amazed me in reading these articles is that the supply of milk in many of the creameries has gone down by twothirds compared with 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every member of the Government must ask himself what is the cause of that and must take the earliest possible steps to see that the dairying industry does not get into a state of collapse.  It <Col N="277" /> might be described as the foundation of our agricultural economy and, as the Acting-Minister for Agriculture said, it is an industry which cannot be allowed to disappear.  It provides more employment than any other branch of the agricultural industry, and, listening to dairy farmers in my constituency, I have come to the conclusion that the real reason they are getting out of the industry is that it does not pay.  Some say they cannot get the same amount of labour to milk the cows, as they got in days gone by and I admit that the rising generation &mdash; and it applies to every section of the community, although I may be misrepresented for saying this &mdash; and especially farmers' sons and daughters, are not inclined to feed the same number of pigs and milk the same number of cows as did those who went before them.  That is bound to have an effect on the future position of the industry, apart altogether from the suggestion, whether it is correct or not, that agricultural labour cannot be got to milk cows on Sunday.</P>
    <P>I believe the real reason that farmers are getting out of the dairying industry is that they are not getting a profitable price for their milk.  Is there any Deputy, on whatever side he sits, who will defend the policy of providing a subsidy, if he were certain that, by providing a subsidy, he is not going to provide an economic or profitable price for a particular commodity?  I would prefer to defend the raising of whatever sum might be necessary &mdash; thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions &mdash; from the taxpayers to provide a profitable price for the dairy farmers, than to provide only half the amount necessary for the purpose.  So far as I can find out, from the latest estimates, we are providing £1,500,000.  If that is not sufficient to provide a profitable price for dairy farmers and if £2,000,000 is sufficient, go out and find the £2,000,000, and maintain an industry which we cannot afford to see destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subsidising the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in an argument on details: I am talking about the policy of subsidising <Col N="278" /> a particular industry.  There is another aspect of our agricultural problem which must have our immediate attention, that is, the question raised from these benches on innumerable occasions of providing better credit facilities for those who cannot get money from our banks in order to improve their farms and work them to the best possible advantage.  Is there any Deputy on this side or on the other side, with the knowledge he has of the huge amount of money lying unused in our banks to-day, will get up freely and say that reasonable credit facilities are being provided for our farmers by charging 4½ per cent. for agricultural loans, in the financial world as we know it to-day?  In some cases and in some places, it would be easier to get a loan from one of our banks, bad as they are, than to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and it is a disgrace to those of us who have responsibility that, in these days, when money cannot be used for useful purposes, we defend such a high interest charge as 4½ per cent.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest must be reduced, and I beg the Minister and his colleagues to give that matter their earliest possible consideration and bring down the rate of interest for agricultural loans to a reasonable figure.  I should be prepared to defend the subsidisation of low rates of interest to the farmers in order to give them the money to enable them to produce more, which is the purpose of these loans.  If we do not do everything we possibly can, whether by way of cheap loans, subsidies or cheap transport, to increase agricultural production, there is no use in blaming the farmers because they have not got the money or the labour, or are not getting proper assistance to enable them to do so.  Agricultural production has gone down by roughly 12 per cent. as compared with 1938, and, if this nation is to survive, we must reverse that policy and that procedure and give the farmers these facilities.  The farmers will do the work if they get the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Government to take serious note of what has happened this year in relation to oats <Col N="279" /> and potatoes and to take such steps in the coming year as will prevent a recurrence of that situation.  Deputy Smith may take this for what it is worth &mdash; and Deputy Aiken in particular. Deputy Aiken, when leaving for a cup of tea, implored me to come back and defend the Government.  The members of the Government are well able to defend themselves.  He suggested that when Fianna Fáil were in office they never made any mistakes.  I heard a famous man say once, and I never forgot it: &ldquo;The man who never made any mistakes never made anything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is a most honourable man; I have worked in close association with him in other matters.  Deputy Dillon believes he is infallible; that is the only thing wrong with him.  But when he is longer sitting on these benches and is more experienced, and particularly with the experience he has had this year with regard to a couple of matters that we are rightly entitled to complain of, he will be a better Minister in the future than he has been during the few months he has been in office.</P>
    <P>No matter what red herring may be drawn across our path &mdash; and this is a red herring for the purpose of the Donegal by-election &mdash; the Opposition is not going to shake the confidence of this side of the House in the Government, at any rate without giving them a fair opportunity to implement their policy.  There is no one, even sitting over there, who will say they have got a fair chance during six months.  The members of this group propose to vote against the motion, because it has been introduced for a purely political purpose and for a personal attack on the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Davin is quite correct in saying that this motion was set down for political purposes solely.  I do not believe for one moment that the thousands of farmers who now see more hopes of disposing of the oats will believe that.  I am satisfied that, although Deputy Dillon may believe that he is infallible, he will now believe he is not infallible, and this motion <Col N="280" /> has done a good turn to him, too.  A capable Opposition is absolutely essential. We have now forced the present Government, in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, to relieve the farmers of the oats that is lying rotten on their hands; and to-morrow I am almost certain they will be surprised at the price they are going to get for the potatoes.  If this motion were not introduced by Deputies Smith and Ryan, that would not have taken place, and I know what would have happened the Coalition Government and the Minister for Agriculture; so we can congratulate ourselves here tonight that we have saved them for the moment.</P>
      <P>We did a good deal more than that. There are thousands of farmers with 20, 30 and 40 barrels of oats and no place to store them, and in order to meet debts in the last month they had to sell a couple of their calves.  If this oats is now sold and they can get a price for it, they will be able to buy a few calves and will take those calves off someone else's hands.  Remember that young cattle are becoming a drug in the market, and that it was due to the fact that there were thousands of pounds locked up in rotten sacks of oats, and quite an amount in wheat.  I could not believe that such carelessness could exist, when people have been talking continually about the misery in Europe.  I do not believe there is a bit of misery or hunger to-day in Europe.  If there was, how would you have hundreds of barrels of oats at every railway station and every store all down the country for the last three weeks, and the very best of wheat, too? Surely no good luck could come to any Government that could be so mismanaged? I do not blame a single member of the Opposition: I blame that infallible Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>So there are some other difficulties which we will try to solve for them at a later stage.  There is the question of dairying.  We have a large amount of dairying in County Meath.  I remember years ago when it was not known there.  Now all the dairy people complain about the price of milk.  In all justice, the price should be increased.  It is quite true that this infallible Minister for Agriculture actually proposed to reduce the winter to three months.  I am not sure how he was going to manage it, though he made some mention about certain artificial manures that would grow grass very late in the season and very early in the spring, and in that way there would be only three months of winter.  I am afraid he attempted to regulate the price of milk on that basis. There is almost a good five months of winter here for dairying and, if I am not wrong, he should pay them an extra price for those five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement was made about glass-house farming, which is part of farming in most countries.  We have this on <Col N="282" /> the borders of Meath now, in Oldtown, where people are producing tomatoes very successfully all through the winter through the operation of electricity. These glass-house factories were very severely criticised in regard to the West of Ireland, where there is nothing else.  I think the Minister has admitted now that he is not infallible in that respect, either, and I am glad of it.  It is a form of agriculture we will have to adopt in the next two or three years, as we will not always get the present high prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is quite right when he says we have a very high standard of living.  We have; war produces that sort of thing.  It did it before here; the First World War did the same thing and one of our biggest difficulties now will be that high cost of living.</P>
    <P>No effort should be spared now to see that we are able to produce almost all we want here.  Everything that can be produced here should be produced here. If not, when this world depression comes &mdash; and it will come; I do not know who is going to get it, possibly the United States of America, as she got it before &mdash; there will be no place for our people to go.  Therefore, this question should get a good deal of attention. Finally, I want to congratulate Deputy Smith and Deputy Ryan for their ability and their energy and I want to congratulate the Deputies opposite on their good luck.</P>

      <P>This motion is intended as a vote of no confidence in the Government, but if we examine it rightly we find it is really a motion of confidence.  We have 13 separate Government Departments and one would imagine that, if a vote of no confidence were tabled by the Opposition, it should embrace the whole policy of the Government, or at least the policy of more than one Department. Yet we find that, out of the 13 distinct Government Departments, one is singled out, and out of that single Department one solitary point is taken &mdash; the present-day price of oats.  Therefore, everything else that the present Government is doing is right, according to the two Deputies who have tabled this motion, Deputy Smith and Deputy Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Certain factors have caused a surplus or at least left us with some considerable quantity of oats on hands at the present time.  If we examine the causes that produced that surplus, the first thing that comes very forcibly to our minds is the fact that we had a very bountiful harvest, for which I think we should be very thankful to Providence. Every farmer in the country is very thankful that Providence has treated us in such a magnificent way, not alone in regard to the oat crop but in regard to every other cereal and root crop, in view of the disastrous harvest we had two short years ago.  I think it is a shabby thing, a mean and a cheap thing, that members of the Opposition should seek to make political capital, for the purposes of a by-election, out of the goodness of God in giving us a harvest for which we should thank God instead of grumbling about it.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it has produced a problem but there are other factors which also contributed to that problem. One of them, the principal, is that the last Government and the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, proceeded to bring in 12,000 tons of oatmeal into this country last year or the equivalent of 24,000 tons of oats &mdash; and last year's crop of oats was not below normal.  The normal production of oats would be between 660,000 tons and 700,000 tons.  At the time that Deputy Lemass decided to bring in oatmeal, the oat merchants of the country had 20,000 tons in store or in their mills.  The oatmeal started to come in before the present Government took office and continued to come after the Government took office.  I think one ex-Minister or certainly some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, actually pressed that this Government should dishonour an agreement that had been reached by its predecessor in this regard.  That is a very cheap change of tactics.  It is seriously suggested that we have reached a stage in this country when our word should carry no weight, that when a change of Government takes place, all agreements reached by the previous Government, whether good, middling or bad, must be thrown overboard simply because they were effected by the previous <Col N="284" /> Government?  I hope we have not reached that stage yet and I hope this country will never reach such a stage.</P>
    <P>These two causes more than anything else have produced a surplus of oats and the Government has decided to take action to which reference has already been made, to deal with that problem.  In the first place a bountiful harvest has given us more oats than we expected.  Secondly those who would have been inclined to come out and buy oats could not do so because the stores were filled with oats and oatmeal carried over from last year as a result of the policy of the last Minister for Agriculture and the last Minister for Industry and Commerce. Both of these must carry a certain amount of the blame.  Everything cannot be attributed to the fact that we had such a good year.  I have not the slightest doubt that the acreage of oats has been some what increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been tabled from motives of spite, and from a spirit of peevishness, in an attempt to discredit the present Minister for Agriculture.  No Minister was ever perfect or no Minister ever will be perfect. Every Minister, past, present and future, has had and will have problems to deal with.  There are problems in my Department that are causing me many headaches and I dare say the same thing applies to every other Minister.  The last Government had to deal with its problems and it would be a very queer state of affairs if such problems did not exist.  In the present Minister for Agriculture, you have a Minister who is quite capable of facing up to any problem that may arise in his Department and so far he has not given a bad account of himself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken wanted to recall to the mind of some of the members of the present Government that we accused the last Government of depleting the fertility of the land of this country and he has argued, that, notwithstanding that, we had a bountiful harvest this year.  There is not the slightest shadow of doubt but that it was the good judgment of the present Minister for Agriculture that largely contributed to this bountiful crop because he gave the farmers freedom and he took away the inspectors, whereas Deputy Smith, when Minister, told the farmers that he would fill every field with inspectors to compel them to carry out the tillage regulations.  Deputy Dillon on the other hand took away the inspectors and he told the farmers to produce food and produce it in the way that they knew best themselves.  We see the result now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to complain here on many <Col N="286" /> occasions, as Deputy Aiken will recall, that farmers were actually being compelled by inspectors who knew nothing whatever about tillage or the growing of crops, to put good wheat into land that was not fit to grow wheat.  I pointed out that it was pure waste to put wheat into such land.  I pointed out that there was a vast amount of wheat that should be used for human food being put into ground in which farmers knew themselves it was not possible to grow wheat.  That wheat never yielded a return.  This year the farmers were allowed freedom to put into their land the crops which they themselves knew the land was best fitted to produce.  That freedom introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, has resulted in a bountiful harvest.  That in turn has produced a certain problem for us, but the present Minister for Agriculture is well fitted to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>When I throw my mind back I am amused and puzzled at the same time by the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this motion.  Let us not forget the fact that the present Minister has been only eight months in office; in other words he is in the beginning of his career as a Minister for Agriculture.  When the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture was eight months in office, what situation had we to face?  We had cattle worth £30 each being sold at £3 and £4 each, and even at that price farmers were thankful to get rid of them.  It had become a joke at that time that cattle had to be shod because they were being taken to fair after fair.  Calves were being slaughtered wholesale and it was said on one occasion that the No. 1 Army band was brought down to open the ceremony of the slaughter of calves at a certain centre.</P>
    <P>A similar note was struck last night or to-day in this debate.  There was a kind of veiled suggestion by some Deputy on that side of the House that the surplus produce should be destroyed in order to keep the price level right, the very same theory as had operated in connection with the calves: &ldquo;Kill them, reduce the number of stock and then we will have the demand that will increase the price.&rdquo;  That day is gone.  During the period of office of <Col N="287" /> this Government, food will not be destroyed in this country, whatever attempt will be made to regulate the price and keep it right.</P>
    <P>I look back over the 14 disastrous years that Deputy Dr. Ryan spent as Minister for Agriculture and review the sufferings of the farmers during those years.  I think of the economic war&mdash;a painful subject.  It would be more merciful to draw a sheet over it and forget it.  Even after that, Fianna Fáil would not learn.  Fianna Fáil has challenged this House to vote for the present motion on the ground that the agricultural policy of the Government is not a good one, that it is a dangerous policy and one that requires remedying. If Fianna Fáil wins the division, in the general election which may ensue, will the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, tell us that he has a different Minister for Agriculture to give us if returned with a majority, from Dr. Ryan or Deputy Smith?  That is the question before the House.  It is a question as to whether Deputy Dillon or Deputy Smith will be Minister for Agriculture.  I have not the slightest doubt as to what the farmers will say or as to how they will vote if that issue is put to them.  That is the issue before the House.  Has the leader of the Opposition a Minister for Agriculture to give us?  Has he a man who will give us on a motion in relation to agriculture something better than the pitiful bleating of the two ex-Ministers for Agriculture of his Party?</P>
    <P>Why was it that two years ago Deputy Dr. Ryan was removed and Deputy Smith put in as Minister for Agriculture?  Are these the best men that are in the Fianna Fáil Party to fill the office of Minister for Agriculture? I respectfully suggest that one could go down the country and the first farmer one would meet would make a much better job of it than either of them.  We are asked now, not to throw out the present Government, but to displace Deputy Dillon by one or other of the two gentlemen who sit over there and who, when they rose to speak on this motion, one of them having been in charge of the Department for 14 years and the other <Col N="288" /> having been in charge for a year or so, could not make a single point.  I cannot remember one point that either of them made.  They did not make a single point.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Fianna Fáil that it cost the farmers of this country a great effort to leave Fianna Fáil on that side of the House.  I do not think the farmers want them back on this side. However, Deputies are perfectly free to vote as they wish.  Every Deputy is a free agent.  This is a free House. If Deputies on this side or on that side think that there is a better Minister for Agriculture there in the person of Deputy Dr. Ryan or in the person of Deputy Smith than the Minister whom you have here, Deputy Dillon, they are bound to vote for the motion.  That is what I say.  If Deputies think, as Deputy Ben Maguire put it so very ably, that Deputy Dillon has made a fairly good start, if they think he is worthy of a chance, well and good, they know what to do, vote against the motion.</P>
    <P>I say that Fianna Fáil got 16 years in which to try out their agricultural policy.  They have practically wrecked agriculture in this country.  The people are flying from the land.  I shall not go into the census figures but, in County Mayo, in the period of 10 years, 1936 to 1946, the population has dropped from 161,000 to 148,000, a decline of 13,000 in one county.  The same is true of every county in Connaught and every rural area in the country.  The population of stock, fowl and every live thing on the farm has steadily declined all during the years according to the statistics published by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Yet, we are asked to throw overboard a Minister who definitely has already put every branch of agriculture on its feet, a Minister who has gained the confidence of most of the farmers of this country and will continue to gain confidence.</P>
    <P>This is a perfectly free vote and any Deputy who believes that the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy is the best one is bound in conscience to vote for the motion.  I do not think it is.  As I have said, it cost the farmers of this country a mighty effort to put Fianna Fáil on that side of the House and they <Col N="289" /> did so principally because Deputy de Valera, leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, refused to give us a Minister for Agriculture who knew his business.  It is not enough to put Fianna Fáil over there.  We have to keep them there until some man appears on the scene who promises to be a better Minister for Agriculture than any Fianna Fáil has produced yet.</P>

A very foolish idea has crept into the minds of Deputies here. Deputy Davin and Deputy Maguire said that Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Smith claimed responsibility for increasing the price of oats, and all the rest.  That is a really foolish idea.  They ought to know very well that each of these poor devils over there has a rope around his neck and the fine hefty, weighty Minister for Lands is over there waiting to heave on the rope if they speak above a whisper.  They are in the Minister's own words &ldquo;as mute as mice.&rdquo;  It is only about six months ago since I had the pleasure of having Deputy Lehane with me above with Deputy Jim Dillon discussing those questions.</P>

      <P>You are amusing me by these interruptions.  This is a serious matter, however, and should be approached in a serious way.  We put up two propositions to the Minister on that day.  I might say for the information of Deputies here that I wrote to Limerick to Mr. J. V. Rank's firm and they told me that they wanted no oats at £15 a ton.  The first proposition that we put up to the Minister was to ask him to give export licences for oats. He said that he would not let 1 lb. of oats out of the country but he said he would try to sell some oatmeal.  He <Col N="291" /> asked us had we any other proposition and we asked him to follow the example of his predecessor who found himself twice in the self same difficulty with regard to oats.  On both of these occasions, the Minister fixed the price of oats and guaranteed the merchants against loss and the State had not to pay one penny on either occasion.  He said he would consider that but he considered it very much against his will. He emphasised five times that he was not going to put a floor under oats for Mr. J. V. Rank.  That was the position up to yesterday when we were told that a floor was going to be put under oats now.  Who is the floor going to be put under oats for?  Is it for the farmers or is it for Mr. J. V. Rank?</P>

      <P>The unfortunate farmers have sold it as Deputy Davin said, for 20/- a barrel in his constituency and Deputy Ben Maguire told me that it had been sold for less.  The farmer is finished with it.  He has succeeded in paying the merchant about half what is due to him for seed.  Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, and his substitute, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, Minister for Defence and Acting-Minister for Agriculture, when the farmer is finished with oats, when the farmer is beggared, put a floor under oats for Mr. J.V. Rank.  I do not hear half the shouts now from those gentlemen who suggested a while ago that the millers should be skinned.  They are silent now on the question.  We do not hear any word now from the boys about it.  Deputy Cogan raised it in August and in September and wrote five or six times between that and October, but got no results until yesterday when most of the oats in Deputy Cogan's constituency has gone into the hands of the merchants and millers.  He knows it very well and so does any unfortunate fellow who had conacre here. For every ton of oats that a floor has been put under for the benefit of the farmer, a floor has been put under 100 tons for the benefit of the miller who has got it for 20/- to 22/- a barrel.  He is now waiting to see what price will be fixed on the wild ends of Donegal <Col N="292" /> above because that is what has fixed the price of oats.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a guaranteed market for 50,000 tons of were potatoes in Great Britain at £10 13s. 6d. per ton delivered f.o.b. at a port in Ireland between November and February.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in the Dáil, column 2596 on July 9th, 1948.  Despite that guaranteed potato market, the the best thing that Deputy Davin can do for his constituents for whose protection and safety he is supporting this Government, is £5 a ton for their spuds.  The £10 13s. 6d. is there according to the Minister.  Deputy Davin leaves his constituents to sell their potatoes in his own words at £5 a ton.  More of them are going to come up here at 11d. a stone to be sold at that price in the new co-operative or municipal shop.  What price are the farmers going to get for them in Deputy Davin's constituency?  Under those fat conditions, the labourers are going to get better wages and there is going to be more employment on the land! No wonder Deputy Dunne made serious inquiries yesterday about farmers getting out of tillage.  It is no wonder under those conditions when that is the best Deputy Davin can do. The poor man has the rope around his neck.  What is the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture towards potatoes?  We also took that matter up and what was his reply?  A Deputy who happened to be a member of the deputation said that he sold potatoes as low as £7 or £8 a ton.  He said: &ldquo;You got £7 per ton for your potatoes, Deputy.  You are one lucky man, Deputy.&rdquo; When they asked about this great market in Great Britain, what did he say?  &ldquo;Do you know, Deputy, that over in Great Britain the bank clerks, the stenographers, and the typists are out every day for the past two months, picking, picking, picking potatoes.&rdquo;  Under those circumstances he asked what was he going to do with the potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reply we got from the Minister when we asked him to help us with regard to potatoes.  We asked what was the farmer going to do with the potatoes and he said: &ldquo;I will tell <Col N="293" /> you what to do with your potatoes, Deputy.  Boil them, put them in a corner of the stable, have a few boards outside them, pack them carefully and feed them to your poultry next June.&rdquo; He wanted to provide a balanced ration for the rats.  That was the position of affairs some five weeks ago when we interviewed the Minister for Agriculture on those questions.  That was the Minister's attitude then.  We had a change of front yesterday.  I hope whoever bought the spuds down in Deputy Davin's constituency at £5 per ton has carefully hoarded them so as to send them over to Great Britain at £10 13s. 6d.</P>

      <P>That was the position as regards potatoes.  Until this motion was put down and until the writ was moved for the Donegal by-election the price of spuds was £5 per ton; now it is £10 13s. 6d.  We heard a lot of talk about the good which the Minister had done.  We are told that he increased the price of barley.  What did he tell us about barley.  Speaking in this House on the 9th July last, as reported in col. 2595 of the Dáil Debates, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I want the farmers to produce next year 700,000 barrels of malting barley at least, for which I guarantee them a price higher than they received in any year for the last ten years.  It will not be less than 55/- and it might be more.  In that connection I want solemnly to register a protest against what seems to have been the cruel iniquity of having fixed prices of malting barley in this country at a figure ranging from 35/- to 45/-, less cartage from the farm to <Col N="294" /> the maltster, when the world price of that barley was 60/- and over, and when the brewers of this country were ready and willing to pay 60/- and over and were prevented from doing so by our own Government, with the consequence that, in the last five years, the barley farmers of this country were fined by our own Government £2,000,000 sterling, which passed into the coffers of Arthur Guinness, Son and Company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After that statement I put down a question in this House asking the Minister for Agriculture if he was going to decontrol barley.  The Minister said that if I waited until the next week he would give me a comprehensive reply.  I immediately said that, of course, I would, and I went and rung up Messrs.  Guinness and asked when they were going to meet the Beet Growers' Association about the price of barley.  They told me that they had got a message from the Minister that the price of barley was remaining at the price fixed of 45/- per barrel.  I told Messrs.  Guinness that the price of barley was going to be decontrolled and that the Minister had said that Messrs.  Guinness had robbed the farmers of £2,000,000.  I was asked to come over to see them and I went the following morning and had a chat with the directors of Messrs.  Guinness. They told me that the Minister had informed them that the present fixed price for barley was remaining this season.  On the following Wednesday the Minister was not here to reply to my question, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach stated that he would reply on the next day.</P>
    <P>The following morning when we opened our papers we saw that the Minister had replied to the question down the country and said that the price of barley was fixed at 50/- Apparently he went down to his comrade Deputy Flanagan to tell him all about it.  That was the position of affairs as regards barley.</P>
    <P>The following week the Beet Growers' Association met the directors of Messrs.  Guinness and we hammered out an agreement with them fixing the price of barley, not at the 50/- fixed by the Minister, but at 57/6 for next year <Col N="295" /> with a differential, not like the differential of 5/- per cwt. less for cattle than the English farmer was getting, but of 2/6 per barrel more than the price of English malting barley and with a contract for that.  I went to the Minister and appealed to him.  I said: &ldquo;The only excuse you have given us for not taking the control off barley this year is the fear that there would be a glut next year.  We have removed the danger of that glut by the contract system.  Will you even now take the control off the barley and let the unfortunate farmer get at least a price for his barley to compensate him in some way for the loss on his oats?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now what is the position?  The price of malting barley in the English market this year is 60/- per barrel and, with our differential of 2/6, every man selling barley to the maltsters this year, if the Minister removed his control price of 50/-, would have got 62/6; that is 12/6 a barrel on 1,500,000 barrels of barley. That is £900,000 the Minister has robbed the farmers of in connection with barley alone this season.</P>
    <P>That agreement to which I have referred was published in the public Press and was signed, sealed and delivered by the directors of Messrs. Arthur Guinness and Company.  We are not depending on the Minister for Agriculture to look after the barley side.  We have looked after it ourselves without him, and we have secured that in 1949, and the following years, the price of malting barley in this country shall be not less than 2/6 above the price of English malting barley.  That is an agreement that we can be very well proud of.  The Minister for Agriculture, by stepping in and controlling the price of barley, did exactly what he blamed the last Government for doing and so robbed the Irish farmer two months ago of £900,000.  If we had that sum of money it would help to afford some compensation to Deputy Davin's farmers who are selling their oats at 22/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the price of milk.  What has happened since the price was fixed at the creameries? How many increases in agricultural <Col N="296" /> labourers' wages have been given since the price of milk at the creameries and of milk for the City of Cork was fixed last?  How much have the rates been increased since then?  I do not object to any increase in wages that the rural labourer gets.  The more he gets the better I will like it, so long as we can have a decent working agreement by which each increase in wage will be related to the cost of production to the farmer and so that the farmer will have the means to pay the man. The farmer does not want to be put in the position of having to sack a man.  These are points that have not been considered.</P>
    <P>I had some tough arguments with the former Minister for Agriculture about milk prices.  We braced up to the thing and we came to a fair conclusion, and while I might not be satisfied with it still we got some little bit from him. What is the attitude of the present Minister for Agriculture?  There are many Deputies listening to me who know where the shoe pinches.  I wonder how long do people think our farmers are going to continue in milk production at present prices?  That is a question which seriously affects the very foundation of our agricultural policy. It is a question that we have got to face up to.  I hope that, when the Acting-Minister for Agriculture is winding up in this debate, we shall have a statement from him indicating that, in addition to increasing the price of Deputy Davin's &ldquo;spuds&rdquo; from £5 to £10 13s. 6d. and giving him some increase on the 22/- a barrel for his oats, he is going to give a fair price to the farmer who is producing milk.</P>

      <P>We have this position in regard to the Cork milk supply that 50 per cent. of it is collected only on three days a week and is then brought in and run through a pasteurisation plant&mdash;I never knew of any machine that could make dirty stuff clean&mdash;and is then dished out from door to door. What is the reason for that.  It is because the Minister for Agriculture is not prepared to pay the farmers of that district a price that will meet their costs of production.  He knows what these costs of production are.  He has all the figures in his Department.  He quoted them here and quoted them the week before last in his argument before the Charleville farmers and the Limerick farmers on this question.  Let him come forward now with the costs of production that were prepared and paid for by the Cork farmers.  Surely the Cork farmers who are producing milk are entitled to the costs of production plus a profit.</P>

      <P>I will quote this, that at present the price paid to Cork farmers is 4d. a gallon under the figures supplied to the Department.  The Minister should get one of his officials to take that figure and work out what the increased cost of labour per cow and the increased cost of producing a gallon of milk has been on our costings which were prepared in the year 1946-47.  If the Minister does that and pays the farmers the extra costs of their production to-day plus a profit, there will be less talk from Deputy Dunne about unemployment in the rural districts, and there will be no need to go to the Wages Board.</P>

God help us, it is a sad old day for Ireland.  What is the position now? What do you expect that farmer, who sold his oats this year at from 20/- to 22/- per barrel, after buying the seed for £3 5s. per cwt., is going to be able to afford in the line of wages for employment during the coming winter? The amount of money he has got will not cover the merchant's bill for the seasonal manure.  What do you expect that the farmer mentioned by Deputy Davin who sold his spuds at £5 a ton will be able to pay his agricultural labourer over the winter months?  I suppose the spuds must be produced again next year because no doubt they will be wanted.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that I felt aggrieved last night when the ActingMinister for Agriculture, in opening his speech, referred to my speech as one full of bitterness towards my successor. He described it also as one full of abuse of my successor.  I say I do not feel aggrieved in regard to that allegation because I think that if any Deputy reads the report of my speech he will not find in it anything that can properly be described in that language. I admit quite freely&mdash;whether or not the charge, which was made by the Acting-Minister for Agriculture, that no man likes his successor is true&mdash;that Deputy Dillon, even as a man, is not <Col N="300" /> an individual who appeals to me.  I want to assure the House that I said nothing in my speech to him as an individual, and if my attack upon him was vigorous it was vigorous in the sense that I disagree with his actions, with his statements and with his policy. As a matter of fact, I will go further and say that if the Minister himself had been in the House when I was moving this motion last night I would have been far more at ease and I would have felt far freer indeed to deal with the problems that we have been discussing for some hours past.  Instead of being a man of prejudice, my real fear is that harm will be done by the Minister for Agriculture.  I can prove that much of his policy, if he can be said to have a policy, and that practically all, if not all, of his decisions are, as far as I can see, based on nothing else but prejudice.  I will cite a few instances for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was forced by circumstances, when I was Minister for Agriculture, to make an Order prohibiting the sale of cream. That action was necessary on my part because of the scarcity of butter.  In spite of the fact that my successor in office announced that it was no part of his policy to behave like a bull in a china shop, he reversed that decision which I had given without giving the slightest consideration to its background and the reasons which forced me to make that decision.  After a few months he himself had to re-impose that Order.  I cited in another place and, in fact, I cited in this House a decision which I made in regard to the dairying industry in so far as cattle breeding is concerned.  In defending that decision to this House I did not present myself to the Deputies here or to the farmers throughout the country as a theorist but rather as one who had some practical knowledge of this business and who had not rushed violently to the decision which I took in regard to that matter.  I can assure you that I made that decision after the fullest consideration and as a result of the experience I had as a Deputy, as a farmer and as a man who knows something about cattle.  In five minutes my successor comes along and reverses that decision.  Probably some <Col N="301" /> interested party affected by the decision wrote a letter to the Minister complaining of the injustice done to him personally.  Perhaps the Minister called down the official in that Department who had implemented policy for 25 years and questioned him about it and the official said: &ldquo;That was the Minister's own decision; it was not supported by us.&rdquo;  Without any further consideration the decision was, as I say, reversed.  I have no personal feelings in this matter.  I do not care if my successor reverses every decision I ever took.  I am merely bringing forward these points to show that, far from the Minister being justified in accusing me of being prejudiced, I can prove to the satisfaction of any tribunal that that charge can be levelled truthfully against my successor.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I shall advert is one that affects the farmers in my constituency and in the Minister's constituency.  My predecessor and myself were obliged to make an Order fixing the price for the scutching of flax.  Flax is an important product in the three Ulster counties and in West Cork.  Let me assure the House that neither Deputy Dr. Ryan nor myself wanted to meddle in the affairs of the millers when that particular Order was made.  We made the Order because we felt that if we did not do so the millers would fleece the growers.  My successor comes along and apparently without any consideration removes that control.  He tells the farmers in his own constituency that if any miller charges them more than such and such a price then they are to go to some other miller; if that miller does not scutch their flax at the price, then they are to go to the Minister and tell him about it. Scarcely had two weeks passed before the millers proceeded to increase the price and it was not very long before the Order was re-imposed.  It was re-imposed because it affected the Minister in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>I accused the Minister when he was introducing his Estimate of prejudice in relation to the farm building scheme.  It was my predecessor Deputy Dr. Ryan who initiated that scheme.  When I came into office the <Col N="302" /> scheme had not been prepared.  Deputies will admit that scarcely a week passed in this House for over two years that Parliamentary Questions were not asked as to when we were going forward with that scheme.  I was anxious to go ahead with the scheme and I was perhaps somewhat intolerant of obstacles in my way.  Every member of a Government meets with obstacles.  I was at that time blamed in the Seanad because the scheme was being delayed.  I think some English statesman described a certain politician as &ldquo;a young man in a hurry.&rdquo;  I was not in a hurry in that sense.  I was in a hurry because I knew my rural Ireland and I appreciated the position of the farmers.  I was anxious to put the farmers in a position to compete in the future.</P>
    <P>Some time around that period the agreement was concluded with Britain in relation to the egg and poultry industry. I wanted to follow that up at the psychological moment by encouraging the farmers to build houses because I knew that over 90 per cent. of them had not suitable accommodation with which to take advantage of the scheme.  I asked the Minister for Finance at that time if he would apportion some part of the moneys allocated for the tomato schemes in the West of Ireland towards the erection of poultry houses.  The Minister very generously told me to go ahead with the scheme and he would provide the money for it.  I do not say this merely for the purpose of receiving a pat on the back.  No matter how hard a Minister for Agriculture may work and no matter how sincere he may be he will always come in for criticism.</P>
    <P>When the present Minister for Agriculture was appointed he immediately started to reverse my policy.  I have here on the records of this House the statement which he made on his own Estimate.  It was obvious that scheme was implemented because of the driving force I put behind it.  I received a letter from the then Minister for Industry and Commerce when I was Minister for Agriculture reminding me that materials were short when I advertised this scheme.  It was the Minister's job at the time to remind me <Col N="303" /> that there were certain obstacles in the way.  I know that there was 25 per cent. of the cement that was being manufactured, released to traders all over the country.  It was free for me as a farmer to ask my trader to give me half a ton&mdash;to save up half a ton for me.</P>
    <P>I knew there were farmers who had stones and sand and lime on their lands; I knew there were farmers who had second-hand corrugated iron and who had trees growing on their lands. They could take the trees to the sawmills and have them sawed up.  I knew there were farmers in the West, where there is fine stonework for houses and good buildings for animals; I knew there were thousands of farmers who could avail of that scheme in order to increase production, who could take advantage of it at the psychological moment&mdash;and that means a lot&mdash;take advantage of the opportunities that were there for them as a result of the price agreement we had made with the British.</P>
    <P>But, when the Minister came in he proceeded to describe my actions in a certain way; as a matter of fact, he has accused me&mdash;and it is on the records of the House&mdash;of having used that to come here to deceive members of the House.  It is a thing I never did.  Before ever the farm buildings scheme came into existence there was initiated by my predecessor a farm improvements scheme.  It had been in existence for many years and every year, as a result of pressure of one kind or another, both here and outside, additions were made to it.  At first it referred to land reclamation, drainage, making fences, knocking down old fences that were only an obstruction and, finally, it came to the point where liquid manure thanks and concrete work were added.  When I came to a decision to advertise the farm buildings scheme I decided to include in that scheme all constructional work that was formerly done under the farm improvements scheme, because I wanted to ensure that in the division of the staff one type of staff would cover the erection of new houses, the repairing of old ones, the building of silos and manure tanks and piers, and all the concrete work. I decided to transfer the engineering <Col N="304" /> work from the farm improvements scheme to the farm buildings scheme.</P>
    <P>When my successor came in he decided not to go ahead with the farm buildings scheme.  His reason was that there was not material there, that there was not staff there, and that I had ulterior motives in bringing it forward. I admit the staff would not have been perfect if I had gone on with it, but nothing is perfect at the start.  If you wait to have everything perfect you will never get anywhere, especially when you are dealing with civil servants&mdash;and that is what I knew.  What happened?  He abandoned the farm buildings scheme and, lo and behold, he announced that he was not going to advertise the farm improvements scheme until all who had applied in the previous year had completed the work.  There was pressure from every side.  There was an outcry, just as there has been recently in regard to the matters we have been discussing, and he changed his mind and advertised the farm improvements scheme in July, when we would have advertised it in March.  He omitted to put in the concrete work and used as an excuse that I had decided to put in all concrete work in the farm buildings scheme. When I made that decision I intended the two schemes would be advertised together and he had no right to take out of the improvements scheme the concrete work that had been done under it.  I say there is not the slightest piece of evidence to show that that decision was made other than for the purpose of saving money.  I am very sorry, because I am in good form to make a speech for two hours, that I have not two hours more to go.  I find myself in the best of form, but I am sorry that time and the rules of order will not permit me to go much longer.</P>
    <P>This motion has succeeded.  It has succeeded in bringing the Government to a realisation that it must honour its bond to the farmers to whom it gave certain undertakings.  That is No. 1.  I made a prophecy last evening. I told the House that it was a dangerous thing for a politician to make any prophecy, but I will repeat it.  In repeating it I have in mind what happened some years ago when we were trying to induce farmers to <Col N="305" /> grow wheat and when we found farmers who owned land and were not prepared to till it and were offering it on the 11 months' system and offering it for sale for tillage, and advertisements were appearing in the papers saying that land was being offered for tillage but with the stipulation that the person who would take the land would not be allowed to grow wheat on it.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely anyone in this country, because it is an agricultural country, but knows something about agriculture.  There are a lot of people here who know a lot about agriculture. <Col N="306" /> I feel this in my bones.  You have been talking about unemployment, about emigration and accusing us of having allowed that state of affairs to exist in a time of emergency.  My statement is that we have succeeded in making you honour the first part of your obligations to the farmers.  My prophecy is that tillage will decline, production will fall and unemployment will be created on the land as a result of the policy that is being pursued.  I am not saying that in a spirit of vindictiveness to anybody.</P>
