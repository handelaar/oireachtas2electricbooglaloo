      <P>As the Deputy knows, aid by way of loan was offered to Ireland for the quarter April-June, 1948.  When this offer was announced, the Minister for External Affairs made representations in Washington.  The economic co-operation administrator and the State Department in Washington promised to consider the representations sympathetically, but no decision has so far been communicated to the Government.</P>
      <P>The convention signed in Paris by the Minister for External Affairs, and the proposed bilateral agreement provided for by the Economic Co-operation Act, will be placed before the Dáil for ratification and there will then be an opportunity for a full discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider extending national health insurance benefits to enable wives and families of contributors to obtain dental and optical treatment in the same way as contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) (for Minister for Social Welfare) Timothy Joseph Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) (for Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the additional benefits scheme of the National Health Insurance Society additional benefits (including dental and optical treatment) are confined to insured persons who are members of the society and satisfy certain qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>The amount available for additional benefits is limited, being determined in each quinquennium following an actuarial review of the finances of the national health insurance scheme.  The annual amount determined following the latest review is sufficient to provide additional benefits only for those members of the society who fulfil the special qualifying conditions.  In the circumstances, an extension of the benefits to the dependents of members would necessitate even more stringent qualifying conditions, and thus result in further limitation of the number of the contributors themselves who would be eligible for these benefits.</P>
      <P>I may add that the scheme of additional benefits, though approved by the Minister for Social Welfare, was framed by the society, in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to the senior book published by an Irish firm for use by children in our national schools which contains political Party propaganda and a glorification of a colleague of the former Minister for Education who authorised the use of such book; and whether he proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education does not give any instruction, direction <Col N="467" /> or advice to publishers of readers intended for use in primary schools. He sanctions on application the placing of suitable books on an approved official list.  He does not recommend the use of any particular book.  The selection of the books to be used in any class is a matter for the school manager.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that certain readers in use in schools contain matter which would appear to be specially selected for the purpose of popularising particular persons at present active in Party politics.  I would not countenance anything which could be represented as a development or a tendency of this kind, but I would be reluctant to interfere with the discretion of publishers or to depart from the practice I have outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (a) the number of national teachers in excess of requirements trained during the years 1938-39; (b) the number of lady national teachers between the ages of <Col N="468" /> 60 and 65 years compelled to retire to make room for teachers over normal requirements trained during the said years; (c) the number of lady national teachers compelled to retire on reduced pensions for the same reasons; and (d) what are his proposals to compensate the lady national teachers so compulsorily retired on reduced pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The number of national teachers, men and women, trained during the 1936/38 and 1937/39 courses was 247 (89 men and 158 women) and 206 (63 men and 143 women), respectively.</P>
      <P>As a result of the continuing decline in the school-going population, it was found in 1938 that earlier measures taken to limit recruitment of teachers were inadequate and that the number of men and women teachers trained over some years prior to 1938 was considerably in excess of requirements, so that a large number could not find employment: in 1938 the number of trained men and women teachers awaiting posts was approximately 361 and 334, respectively, as compared with an estimated number of 110 vacancies for each sex.  It was urgently necessary, therefore, in the interests of these young teachers and in face of numerous representations made by them and on their behalf, to take immediate steps to create additional vacancies for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retirement of women teachers at 60 years of age, or on completing 35 years of pensionable service, was one of these measures&mdash;others being the permanent closing of one of the training colleges for men, the temporary closing of certain avenues of recruitment, the alteration of the average attendance conditions governing the appointment of teachers, and the creation of new types of posts.  According to the superannuation scheme for national teachers the retiring age for women teachers is 60, but they may be allowed to continue for a further period with the Minister's permission, and for many years prior to 1938 it was the practice to give this permission to serve to 65; each teacher concerned, on reaching 60, being informed year by <Col N="469" /> year that she was being continued for a further year subject to efficient service. The discontinuance of this practice was, in view of the terms of the superannuation scheme, no infringement of the rights of the teachers concerned, but in any case where hardship could be shown the teacher was given an extension beyond 60, the length of which was determined by the circumstances.  As from 1st January, 1945, when the position regarding unemployment had improved, it was again found possible to give women teachers as a body permission to serve beyond 60.</P>
    <P>(b) The number of women teachers who retired under the Department's regulations between 1st October, 1928, and 31st December, 1944, before reaching the age of 65 was 788.</P>
    <P>(c) Of these 788 teachers, 645 had less than 40 years' pensionable service.</P>
    <P>(d) I regret that in view of the terms of the superannuation scheme for national teachers it would not be possible to concede that these teachers had any claim to compensation by reason of being compelled to retire before reaching the age of 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that arrangements are being made by the County Longford Vocational Education Committee for building a vocational school at Ballinamuck.  I cannot state when the actual building operations will begin, as the expenditure involved is to be defrayed from a loan to be raised by the Longford County Council and the complete official sanction for this loan has not yet been obtained. This matter is under consideration at present, and a decision will be conveyed to the committee as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The employment of labour required for works approved under my Department's farm improvements scheme is entirely the responsibility of the applicants. That will also be the case under the farm buildings scheme.</P>
      <P>Works under the new farm drainage scheme which has been commenced in Counties Galway and Mayo are being carried out by direct labour which is being recruited by my Department's local officers through the local employment exchanges, and they are finding in certain areas in both counties that far from widespread unemployment existing, it is impossible to get men to work on the schemes awaiting execution.</P>

In the meantime, I visited during the weekend the Swinford area of County Mayo, and there found that, although there are several schemes awaiting execution, no man can be found to work upon them.

The total number offered in the year 1947 was greater than the number on offer in any of the three previous years.  As regards quality, the scarcity of suitable feeding stuffs affected the condition of cattle on offer from January to June in recent years.  I hope to procure increased imports of feeding stuffs and fertilisers and thereby to bring about an improvement in the quality of our fat cattle.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (a) if an article under the title &ldquo;Traffic in Horses&rdquo;, published in an English newspaper on the 16th May, 1948, has been brought to his notice, in which it is alleged that there is open flouting in England and Belgium of this Government's Order prohibiting the export of horses for slaughter to these countries, and that these horses, <Col N="481" /> having been imported as working horses, are subjected to the most brutal treatment before being slaughtered and sold in the black market for human consumption; (b) if he has inquired into the veracity of these allegations; and (c) should the result of his inquiries warrant it, if he will take the matter up with the Governments of the countries concerned, with a view to putting a stop to these inhuman practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Frequently articles and letters in the Press reopen the question of the propriety of exporting horses to the Continent. They are usually accompanied by lurid photographs illustrating gross ill-usage of the horses.  Recently one such article appeared in an English newspaper where the letterpress referred to exports from Ireland, but the picture designed to shock, related to a consignment of horses which originated on the other side of the Atlantic and had never even touched at an Irish port.  The export of wornout horses is strictly prohibited from Ireland.  Horses presented for shipment must be in good condition, strong, healthy, fit to work and not aged.  We have always had a valuable trade with several Continental countries for working horses, troopers and blood-stock. The strictest veterinary inspection is enforced at all Irish ports of embarkation, and if any horse appears to the veterinary surgeon to be beyond its work or in any respect sick or injured, the veterinary surgeon does not allow the animal to be shipped. Furthermore, our veterinary inspectors must be satisfied that the accommodation on board the ship is adequate and safe for any horses exported from this country and that sufficient fodder and water are provided for the animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no reason whatever to believe that any horses exported from this country are ill-used in any way in transit, but it is to be borne in mind that if they are transhipped through other countries to which our jurisdiction does not extend it is physically impossible for us to maintain supervision over them once they have left <Col N="482" /> our jurisdiction.  It is true that in recent years the acute scarcity of protein human food on the Continent of Europe has probably increased the use of horse flesh for human consumption, with the result that some horses may be more valuable to purchasers abroad for slaughter as butcher's meat than they would be as working horses.</P>
    <P>My Department has never, and will not in future, sanction the export of horse flesh from this country in any form for human consumption, as to do so would be at variance with the long established practice of exporting to foreign markets nothing but the highest quality in any branch of agricultural produce such as meat or other live-stock products.  It is, nevertheless, true that in Continental countries, where public sentiment is not so closely engaged for horses and the sports and recreations associated therewith, horse flesh for human consumption is continually used and excites no repugnance in the consumers or in public opinion at large.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it does not appear to me proper to suggest that we should terminate a valuable export industry in horses because of a popular antipathy in this country to the consumption of horseflesh as human food; and I have no reason to believe that the abattoir conditions in which horseflesh is prepared for human consumption in Continental countries are such as to cause any anxiety on the score of brutality or lack of feeling in the methods of slaughter employed.  If, however, at any time, any case is brought to my notice of improper conduct in the handling of horses consigned from this country to any other country, either at the port of embarkation, in transit, or in any abattoir or slaughter-house abroad, I shall spare no effort to have it carefully investigated and in the event of any abuse coming to light, in taking prompt and effective measures to ensure that there shall be no recurrence of any such abuse.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to deal exhaustively with this matter owing to the recurrent publicity which it receives, and I trust that interested parties will have regard to this statement <Col N="483" /> and forbear from general allegations in the absence of any evidence which they may be in a position to furnish to me for the exhaustive investigation which I would be most ready to undertake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's reply is reassuring, might I ask him if it is a fact that those horses can be admitted to Belgium only for food, that they cannot be allowed in as working horses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if that were true, it would not invalidate the attitude which I have indicated as being the attitude of my Department because, provided the horses are dealt with in a humane manner and treated with care and kindness, even if they are imported for slaughter for human consumption, there does not seem to be any good reason why their export should be prohibited from this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has misunderstood the position.  There is no prohibition on the export of horses for slaughter.  There is a prohibition on the export of horseflesh for human consumption.  There is no prohibition on the export of horses which it is intended to slaughter on arrival at their destination, and it does not seem to be any part of our business to determine, if a man buys a horse in Ireland, whether he is to use it as a saddle horse, a cart horse or for the purposes of meat, provided always that the animal is treated with humanity and proper consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="484" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that the great majority of those horses exported are old horses that have given good service in this country, and is it fair or right, when we know they are imported into Belgium for slaughter and to be sold in the black market, that we should in any way assist that trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I should like to make it clear that in no circumstances would we permit any exports which we believed to be going into the black market or the illegitimate market.  Every beast shipped from this country passes through the ordinary channels of trade.  The horses are not broken-down horses.  The export of such, as I have indicated to the Deputy in my principal reply, is not permitted.  The horses, which vary in age, are almost all in first-class condition and, provided they are humanely treated, it does not seem to me to reflect in any way on the country or the Department that they should be put to fit and proper use, whatever that may be, at their destination.  If the Deputy thinks it is not desirable to eat horse, I do not see why he does not break his heart over cow, sheep or pig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether any work schemes have been arranged to afford employment to approximately 400 men who have received notice of the termination of their employment with Fuel Importers, Limited, at the East Wall and Phoenix Park fuel dumps, Dublin, or others similarly employed whose employment may terminate soon; if not, whether such work schemes are in preparation and when they are likely to commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.  The need and the feasibility of providing alternative work, through the medium of employment schemes, for the workers referred to by the Deputies, is under consideration.  I must point out, however, that the employment of these workers with Fuel Importers, Limited was of a temporary character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the men concerned are under the impression that they were promised that alternative employment would be provided, <Col N="490" /> through work schemes promoted by the Government, immediately on the cessation of this temporary employment with Fuel Importers, Limited?  Can he give me any indication at all as to when such work schemes to provide alternative employment are likely to begin?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that last week the Minister for Finance, discussing this matter in the Dáil, said: &ldquo;When we get them at the employment exchanges offering themselves for work we will give them work.  We are not going to give them easy money.  We are not going to give unemployment money so long as there is work available for them.&rdquo;  The men employed by Fuel Importers are now under notice. The Minister for Finance has made that statement as meaning that work will be available for these men.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether it is correct that work will be available, or is it not correct?</P>

      <P>These men are being paid off to-morrow.  Some of them are under the impression that they may get work when they go to the employment exchange.  They want to know whether that is so or not.  If there is work for them, their immediate future is secure.  If there is not work for them they will have to make other arrangements.  Is it or is it not true that there is work for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the representatives of these workers who approached me were under the impression that assurances had been given to a deputation which had gone earlier to the Department of Industry and Commerce that alternative work would be available? Will there be work available to these men in this week or in this month?  Can any answer be given to that question?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was explained to me that the deputation which went to the Department of Industry and Commerce was drawn from checkers and timekeepers. The men I saw were just ordinary workers employed on the scheme.  They were under the impression that the deputation from the checkers and timekeepers were given a promise, but they had no personal knowledge of the promise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making an assertion.  Was there a promise given? Was a promise held out?  I am not mentioning this merely to score a point. If the Government can give this work I will give them all the credit they can get for it and all the votes.  Four hundred men will be paid off to-morrow and 2,000 in the next month.  Is <Col N="492" /> there any effort being made to find alternative employment for them?  The men themselves want to know.</P>

      <P>During the period from 18th February to 31st May sentences of imprisonment were modified in 36 cases. In one case the sentence of imprisonment imposed was remitted in its entirety on the recommendation of the adjudicating justice, the defendant having gone to the United States.</P>
      <P>Particulars with regard to the offences, the sentences imposed and the extent of mitigation granted have been prepared in tabular form and, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, will be published in the Official Report.  I do not propose to publish the names of the persons concerned. That has never been done and I do not think it would be a desirable precedent to establish.</P>
      <P>These modifications of sentences were made at my direction after consideration and examination, in accordance with the normal practice, of appeals made by or on behalf of the sentenced persons.</P>

      <P>This matter is one primarily for the local authority.  I am informed that haulage for a distance of 20 miles is rarely necessary.  The selection of quarries where the most suitable type of stone can be obtained and where the benefits of central production can be achieved enables the best value to be got for public money.  The use of proper stone not alone gives a longer life to the road surface but ensures that the safest and most suitable type of surface is provided.  The economies effected by a properly-planned system of stone-production should have the effect of making more money available for employment on the roads.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  Deputies will probably recollect that in November, 1945, the Military Service Pensions Acts were amended to alter the scale of abatement of pensions in association with the amount of money received elsewhere from public funds.  When this Connaught Rangers Pensions Bill was originally introduced, the scale of abatement was similar to that in the Military Service Pensions Act.  When the recent Act, which I referred to, was introduced, the scale of abatement referred only to the Military Service Pensions Act and I think that it was probably an omission that the Connaught Rangers Pensions Act was not amended on similar lines at that particular time. This Bill which is before us now is to bring the scale of abatement in the Connaught Rangers Act on a par with the scale of abatement in the Military Service Pensions Act.  The Bill would be retrospective in effect to the same date as the new scale operating in the Military Service Pensions Amended Bill, namely to the 1st April, 1945.  The amount of money retrospectively to be paid under this Bill will amount to £162 and the annual increased money falling on the State arising out of the passage of this Bill will be £50 per annum.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding <Col N="511" /> £3,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, and No. 3 of 1946); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, and Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946); for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.; and for an Extra-Statutory Grant.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is a supplementary Estimate for some £3,000 by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payment in respect of medical expenses incurred by a person who was wounded during the course of his duty as a member of the Irish Volunteers and who was treated for his wounds while resident outside this country.  The circumstances which necessitate the introduction of this particular Estimate are rather confused and complicated and I will endeavour as briefly as possible to give the Dáil a full picture of those circumstances. In the early Wound Pensions Act of 1923 there was no provision for a statutory board for the administration of those pensions.  It was left to the Minister for Defence by way of regulations to provide for the machinery to administer and carry out the Act.  Such regulations were drafted by the Minister and provided for a Medical Pensions Board which would consist of a president and two members, the president and both members being medical men.  In addition to that there was an Army Pensions Board consisting of a chairman, a layman and, when required, a medical consultant.  The procedure normally was that the findings and recommendations of the Medical Pensions Board were adopted.</P>
    <P>There was another thing of significance in connection with the present proposal, namely that when an applicant <Col N="512" /> got a temporary pension that pension could not be made final for a period of two years.  Further, as long as that pensioner was on temporary pension he could get medical treatment free arising directly or indirectly out of his wounds.  If he was on final pension he could not get such medical service, hospitalisation, etc., free.  The things, therefore, to be remembered are (1) the medical board, (2) that no temporary assessment could be made final for a period of two years, and (3) that a man on final pension could not get free treatment.</P>
    <P>The particular case in question was of a volunteer who received multiple wounds in a number of engagements. He came up for wound pension in 1923 and was granted a temporary pension; he came up again in 1924 and was granted a temporary pension; he came up again in 1925 and 1926 and was granted a temporary pension.  Some time following the award of the temporary pension in 1926 by the Medical Pensions Board, the Army Pensions Board recommended that he be given a final pension at a lower degree of assessment than was recommended by the Medical Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence acted on the recommendation of the Army Pensions Board and gave him a final pension, indicating that it was final in money and in the degree of disablement. That assessment of a final pension by the Minister was within two years of the temporary assessment and appeared to be in conflict with the law as it then stood and was found subsequently by the Attorney-General to be so.  However, a year or so later, as was conceived possible by the Medical Pensions Board, this man's wounds broke down to a very extensive degree and his health broke down also as a result of the wounds breaking down. He was abroad, and he could not get treatment at State expense because he was on a final pension.  The breakdown of the wounds was extensive and the treatment was expensive, necessitating nearly two years' treatment and hospitalisation.  Because he was on final pension the bill could not be paid.</P>
    <P>Some time later the case was reopened and referred to the Attorney-General. <Col N="513" /> The Attorney-General's ruling was to the effect that, although there was an element of doubt, it appeared that this final assessment was within two years of the temporary assessment.  As there was doubt, confusion and misunderstanding in a way which can be perfectly understood, it appeared to me that the most reasonable way was not to sit in judgment by way of legislating as to which decision was correct, but to come to the Dáil asking for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, to put it to the Dáil that it was a type of case in which the person should not be mulcted in the way of money for anything that arose out of his wounds, that the expenses incurred should be recouped by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment rather than altering the whole legislative code as it stands at the moment.  That is what I am asking the Dáil to do.</P>

      <P>I am not myself aware of any similar cases to this particular case outlined by the Minister, but it is possible that when the news of this particular case is noised abroad other individuals, who may possibly feel that they come within the scope of the particular amendment, may make similar applications.  I presume that the Minister will examine these cases sympathetically, if such cases should arise.  I should also like to ask the Minister if any advance has been made in respect of the cases to which I referred on the main Estimate, that is in reference to the rather severe methods which were being adopted in respect of successful applicants who were receiving special allowance pensions. The Minister will remember that I outlined one particular case. Since that I understand that several other cases of a similar kind could also be enumerated.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister if it is possible to have the whole system of the application of the means test to these special allowance applicants sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>It is to recoup him. As a matter of general information, could we know what is the country in which this treatment was received and the rank of the individual involved?  I do not want to ask any further particulars than these.  I gathered from the Minister that it covered two years' treatment and hospital expenses.  A sum of £3,000 seems to be very substantial for two years' treatment and hospital expenses.  However, the country may have something to do with it and also the nature of the treatment.</P>

      <P>I want to be as helpful as I possibly can in this case.  I just wish to know if the Minister had this man examined since he came back to this country, or has he come back to this country?  Has he been again examined by the Medical Pensions Board at St. Bricin's Hospital?  Could the Minister give us an indication as to how exactly this £3,000 is made up? We know that in seriously wounded cases medical and hospital expenses are usually very high.  I should like if the Minister could give the House an indication as to what is the state of health of the person at present.  Has the Medical Pensions Board decided that this man is in such a condition <Col N="515" /> that he is totally disabled and unable to earn his living?  I should also like to know if he is married or single.  All these factors should be taken into consideration in arriving at the figure.  As I have said, I wish to be as helpful as I can, in view of my experience in dealing with such cases and the extraordinary items that crop up in these cases which touch human feeling.  I would be glad if the Minister could give the information I have asked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. Seán Collins Mr. Seán Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One difficulty presents itself to me.  The Minister seemed to indicate that, rather than amend legislation, he proposed to deal with this specific case by way of Supplementary Estimate.  I would like the Minister to indicate in his reply, if possible, whether there is any real likelihood of another claim of this peculiar nature coming before his Department because I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that, if cases of this nature, as envisaged by Deputy Traynor, were to arise and had to be further considered, this would not be the best way to deal with the matter.  If this is not a unique case, I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that it would be wiser to face the problem of payments of this nature by a change of legislation rather than by a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>There are certain features of this case upon which I would like the Minister to enlarge.  The Minister indicated in the course of his remarks that this matter has been more or less in hands from the period 1929-30.  Possibly that might put the Minister in a position to inform the Dáil as to whether or not this is the only case of this nature and, if no other case has arisen in all that period, whether he conceives the possibility of any other case arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one piece of information that I would like the Minister to give, if possible.  Deputy Cowan has looked for it in the main.  He asked the Minister to indicate the country in which this treatment took place.  I want the Minister to go further and, if possible, to indicate the specific type of treatment that was required which might account for what appears to me to be <Col N="516" /> an abnormally high bill for any medical treatment.  I would like the Minister, further, to indicate to the House whether, in fact, during the period these medical expenses accrued, the person in question, who is now to be given this payment by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, was in receipt of a medical pension, a wounds pension, if one might so describe it.  If so, would the Minister indicate the amount of that pension?  Finally, would the Minister indicate, if it is not inconvenient, whether this is in discharge of the complete amount of the expenses incurred by this person or whether it is a certain contribution made by the State to recoup him?</P>
    <P>I should not like the House to feel that I want any cheese-paring of any kind in relation to a claim such as this but I would like the Minister, if possible, to indicate to the House whether this is a case of unique and special merit or whether the occasion might arise in future that the Dáil, by virtue of this type of Vote, would be put in a position that it could be held up to further commitments and further payments that, properly, should have been claimed a long time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that this is the only method whereby a disability may be removed, I have no objection.  I cannot be more irrelevant, possibly, on this debate than anybody else and I would like to ask the Minister if he would take occasion soon to extend the time for the application for military service medals, and to take up with the Minister for Finance the question of expediting payments on decisions made under the 1946 Act. This Act, to my mind, was one of the most valuable pensions Acts that could have been put into operation.  It is really taking care of men who are unable to take care of themselves and it would be very useful if we could have an extension of the time for the application for medals and an expedition of the cases decided by the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the removal of the regulation which denies free medical attention to men who got final assessments. <Col N="517" /> It is possible that this case might not have arisen if men had open to them the medical attention which is open to men who have temporary assessments.  Three thousand pounds seems a very large amount, not that I begrudge it to whoever the individual is, but there are a number of others who have been dealt with rather shabbily in comparison with this.  I consider that, if there were free medical attention to all pensioners, whether on a temporary or permanent assessment, it would obviate cases of this kind.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last point first, there is such a vast number of pensioners with different classifications that have arisen over the last 30 years that if a Department of State such as the Army were to make itself responsible for the treatment of all those cases for the rest of their lives, the Army service would be totally incapable of dealing with it and the Army hospitals would be totally incapable of treating them.  This particular difficulty does not arise very much because any experienced medical board implementing this kind of Act, even if a man is 100 per cent. disabled, as long as his disabilities are likely to call for further treatment, keep him, for one year after the other, for the whole of his life, in many cases, on a temporary assessment.  That provides the latchkey for opening a hospital door any time he requires treatment.</P>
      <P>This particular case arose in the very early days before either medical boards, pensions boards, administrators or Ministers were as experienced as they are at the moment, and, consequently, this unfortunate mistake of putting a man too early on a final pension was made.  This is an attempt to rectify that mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody, who was thinking whether the man could afford this or should properly afford this, asked me what his pension was at the time.  His pension at the time his health broke down was the magnificient sum of £60 a year.  The explanation of the relatively large bill that is before us&mdash; when I say &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; I mean in relation <Col N="518" /> to costs in this country&mdash;is that these expenses arose in the United States of America, where everything is considerably higher than in this country.  Regarding the amounts making up that particular sum, I have got the evidence of the payments and sworn testimony with regard to the position; and everything on that side is perfectly normal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor quite properly called my attention to the point that there may be a number of other cases, or that other demands may arise because of the action we are taking here this evening.  That is true and that is, of course, a danger in attempting to rectify any particular case where you have any loosely allied cases.  When you open the door for one, a great number of others push in. This case is definitely peculiar, in so far as a definite mistake with regard to the medical assessment was made.  As a result of that mistake at that time, this particular pensioner was called on to meet expenses that no pensioner should be asked to meet.</P>
    <P>I am in a position to make a very clear and emphatic statement on that, as I myself administered the medical side of these things at that time and if I were as alert to the legal side as I was to the medical side, I would have seen that the Minister did not make that final assessment at that particular time.  This case also is peculiar, in so far as all the expenditure arose abroad, where expenses were very great.  It is also peculiar in so far as the Attorney-General has, to put it mildly, very grave doubts regarding the legality of altering the assessment from temporary to final within the period of two years.</P>
    <P>There are some other cases, very few in number, allied to this, but certainly not similar to it.  They are in the same rough class but have not the same peculiar claim on the State for rectification. I chose this particular method of dealing with this one, as it is in a very special compartment.  If other cases have to be dealt with, they should be dealt with in the ordinary way, by altering the law.  I would avoid that method if I could.  I can understand Deputy Collins preferring to do things <Col N="519" /> by legislation; he is a lawyer.  The rest of us try to avoid legislation.  I am doing this in a way which is simple and above-board and I would rather do in this way than by legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to special allowances, there were several recommendations, as Deputy Traynor would know, with regard to modification or alleviation of the disabilities arising out of certain aspects of the means test, under consideration by the Department for a considerable time past.  Any suggestion in that direction that was there in the past is now being pressed ahead as vigorously as I can press it.  I am not in a position to say to what extent any alteration of a substantial kind is worth making but, like everyone else, the sooner these restrictions are removed the better I will be pleased.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the date for applications for medals concerns some other Departments as well.  It is down for early consideration and decision. I am conscious of the fact that there were verbal commitments there before my time and I am anxious to see that they are honoured as far as possible.</P>

      <P>On the adjournment of the House last Thursday night, I was replying to a point raised by Deputy Flanagan with regard to evictions for non-payment of annuities.  I dealt with the point fairly fully, but I would like to add that we must take a very stern view of defaulting annuitants, as those annuities not paid by land owners must be met by the ratepayers of the particular county in which they reside.  The county council collects them in the form of <Col N="520" /> rates and pays them into us, and if we want to be honest and straight by those who always work and do their best to pay their rates, we must see that we make their burden as light as possible. However, the Land Commission will regard very leniently any case that comes to their notice where it is through genuine poverty, perhaps through hard luck or some other particular circumstances beyond the farmer's control, a man has fallen into arrears.  We will not act in a tyrannical way with any person and each case will be examined on its merits.  At the same time, I must say that our experience has been that the vast majority of defaulters could make a better effort to meet the demands if they just wished to put their best foot forward.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins complains of delay in the division of land.  I am aware of that myself, but I have not had time to go into each particular case.  In some cases it may be due to carelessness or to something beyond control. Whatever delays took place in the past, Deputies will not have cause to complain of such delays in future, save in exceptional cases outside our control.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Beegan, wanted to know the amount of land available for acquisition.  Unfortunately, there is no prophet in the Land Commission at present.  The amount there is varies very much. Land will become available for acquisition in ten years' time that is well worked and which it would not be desirable to take over to-day.  No one can foretell or make an accurate or even a fair guess at the amount of land available.  There is no shortage of land for acquisition purposes or for the purpose of resumption and if we want to go ahead we can do so.  There is plenty of land we can take over and if we want land on a big scale we can take it over.  That does not leave me in a position to state the actual acreage. I know the acreage is big&mdash;it could go up to 500,000 acres, I suppose, but that is nothing final.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My own guess would be that it would be up to 500,000 <Col N="521" /> acres, and I think that guess is reasonably near the mark.</P>
      <P>Deputy Beegan asked if ex-employees will be provided for when an estate is divided.  They will.  When we take over a farm, or an estate, on which people are in whole-time employment we are knocking them out of their employment.  We cannot just throw them out on the roadside.  In some cases, those employees may be pretty well advanced in years and, therefore, may find it difficult to get alternative employment.  They will always be considered.  They are on the priority list, and there will be no change so far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of Deputies brought up the question of the construction and maintenance of roads, and also the question of drainage, by the Land Commission.  Let me take roads first. The Land Commission makes roads for the convenience of those who get holdings when an estate is divided, but some Deputies seem to think that the Land Commission should take over other roads in the locality so as to form a link road, leading off one main road and emerging on to another.  Some Deputies also seemed to think that the Land Commission should take over drainage work.  Let me state clearly to all Deputies that if I were to ask the Land Commission to follow all the advice that I got here during the two or three days this Estimate has been under discussion, I am afraid that my Department would then have to embrace all the work done by practically every other Government Department in its activities.  It would become a sort of jack-of-all-trades.  In my opinion, the principal purpose of the Land Commission is to relieve congestion, to bring small uneconomic holdings up to a proper economic level and not much else.  It has, of course, to do with the improvement of estates.  It is concerned mainly with the acquisition and the resumption of land because that is necessary for the relief of congestion.  That, in itself, is a huge task.  I can assure Deputies that it is a task that will not be accomplished in a year or two.  It will not be fully concluded in five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we confine ourselves to the acquisition and the resumption of land for <Col N="522" /> the relief of congestion and for the levelling of uneconomic holdings&mdash;all that, of course, will include a certain amount of drainage, road-making and improvements of all kinds on holdings &mdash;I think we will have our hands pretty full without taking on the maintenance of roads, roads in respect of which no attempt has been made to improve or repair them since they were made some years ago.  I think it was Deputy Burke who described the Land Commission roads as prairie tracks.  That has not been our experience in the West.  We have always said that the Land Commission roads are the best roads of all in the West.  That may not have been so in the East, but I certainly cannot agree with what Deputy Burke said about those roads.  We cannot, and will not, take over the maintenance or repair of roads once they are made.  That is the work of another Department&mdash;the Office of Public Works&mdash;or it may be the county councils.  It has been argued that we do not make roads in such a way as to form a link road.  The roads that we make are made to provide facilities for the people to whom we give holdings or additions of land.  If we were to make roads in the way suggested by a number of Deputies it would mean the making of a county road, and that might seriously upset the proper layout of a farm on which we were allotting holdings or making additions.  It is our job to provide a good quality road into the holdings, or to the additions that we give.  These roads are made to convenience the people who get the holdings.  We definitely make very good roads in all these cases.  We have done so in the past and will do so in the future, but the Land Commission will not maintain them or repair them.  If we were to do that it would mean that we were taking over the work of another Government Department. I have already indicated what the main object of this Department is.  We propose to confine ourselves to that work.  What I have said about roads applies to drainage.  When we take over an estate we do a certain amount of drainage.  We leave the land in a pretty good shape, dry, and free from flooding.  I want, however, to point out that drainage work on a <Col N="523" /> big scale is a matter for the drainage section of the Board of Works.  It is not our intention to do work of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan seemed to be concerned about fixity of tenure or rather security in land.  If I remember correctly, he was speaking at the time on the vesting of land.  I remember that when he was speaking I interrupted him to ask what better title could any man have than that when the Land Commission hands him over his holding&mdash;which is what actually happens&mdash;the holding or parcel of land is vested in him?  Some Deputies voiced the opinion that we interfere with fixity of tenure.  We are, of course, interfering.  When the Land Commission serves notice on a landholder that it intends either to resume or acquire his land, it is, of course, interfering with his security of tenure.  There is no doubt about that, but if we are to stand back and are not to do that, then I think the next proper step to take would be to abolish the Land Commission altogether, because its main functions would have ceased except to collect the annuities.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to interfere with the tenure or security of the average small farmer.  We are not interested in him from the point of view of disturbing him.  In fact, we are anxious to get shut of every holding that is up to a proper economic level, to vest it in the tenant and to hand it over to him, because when we have done that it is, so to speak, so much written off our hands.  Why should we seek to upset fixity of tenure all over the country?  What would we gain by it? It would get us nowhere.  It would simply mean that we would be taking on an enormous responsibility with no compensating advantage, good, bad or indifferent.  Our purpose is to do away with the evil that exists, particularly in some of the western counties.  That is our main object.  That means that we must take over land, and that we are going to disturb the tenure of certain people already in the possession of land.  That has been going on for the last 50 years.  In fact, it has been going on since the Congested Districts Board <Col N="524" /> was established, and it is going on to-day. I am sure it will continue to go on.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy has not the right angle on this question of security of tenure when he expressed the fears that he did, that we are disturbing people.  We have to do it in certain cases.  We do not like to do it.  We know quite well that the ownership of land is very different from the ownership of any other form of property.  I know quite well that any man who owns land&mdash;it may be only a few perches of reclaimed bog or it may be a nice normal workable holding or a big holding&mdash;and who has inherited that land from his father, if he is a normal healthy individual, will love to work that land; he will enjoy the growing of crops on it and will like to be able to raise some stock on it.  In fact, such a man takes a peculiar delight in the ownership of that land. If you disturb such a man, well it means a pretty big upheaval for him. Nevertheless, we must do it.  If, on the one hand, we are out to achieve a certain object, and that object, as I have stated, is to relieve congestion, there is no use in saying, at the same time, that we will not acquire land.  We have to do it and we will do it.  It is a pretty big job and it will mean a big jolt for any person from whom we take land, but it is, nevertheless, something which has to be done, rather like getting a tooth extracted when it goes bad.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies, and particularly new Deputies, made suggestions rather on the opposite line to that taken by Deputy Cogan about ownership of land and so on.  Ownership of land must remain.  One Deputy made the statement that no person had a right to own land, or something to that effect.  Every man in possession of land must own his land until the Land Commission, a judicial body set up by statute quite a number of years ago, goes in to take his land for a legal purpose.  Outside of that, it is not our desire to disturb people in the tenure of land.  They must not be disturbed.  There are other big farms and we will continue to take them over, but there is also the point that we must acquire small holdings. <Col N="525" /> little patches here and there which cause trouble sometimes, by reason of their peculiar location.  If there is a holding like that, we must take it. Everybody, big, medium and small, must suffer a certain amount of inconvenience in the rearrangement of land. The desirable thing would be to have all holdings brought up to the fair level of valuation which would allow the tenants and every person working on the land to make a reasonable living, but, on this question of interference, we have to interfere and will do so, but, at the same time, we are anxious to give those to whom we allot land full and complete ownership and what I believe is the soundest title in the State to-day. Deputy Davin asked that those who live on demesnes should be put on the same footing as farmers outside.  Other Deputies mentioned that point as well and they all seemed to be living in a fool's paradise in regard to it.  These people are on the same footing as people outside.  There is nothing to stop us acquiring demesne land tomorrow, if we want to.  We can acquire land inside the demesne wall just as well as land outside the demense wall. Deputy Burke wants land for poultry farmers.  We have done that in the past and will do it in the future.  There is nothing wrong with giving land to poultry farmers for their purposes. Deputy O'Rourke asked if it is the policy of the Land Commission to give preference in Roscommon and elsewhere to local congests in the allotment of lands which are being divided.  Of course, it is.  The very first thing we do is to relieve any congestion there is round about the fringes of any estate acquired, and then, if there is any land left over, it can be utilised for holdings for migrants from congested areas in which there is not sufficient land to meet requirements.  Deputy Giles said that a number of junior inspectors appointed by the last Government were given their posts for political reasons. My information is that all our inspectors are supplied to us by the Civil Service Commissioners.  I think that should satisfy the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Quite a few Deputies were perturbed, and rightly so, about the amount of land passing into the hands of aliens at <Col N="526" /> present.  In one sense, there is no need for them to be disturbed because there is nothing to stop us from taking over these lands, if we need them, just as we take any other land in the State. We will take over just as much of it as we want at any time.  It will be a question for another Minister to consider the placing of a prohibition of some kind against foreigners or aliens, desirable or otherwise, acquiring property in this country.  Some Deputies, and particularly Deputies from eastern and midland counties, spoke of foreigners who have bought up land and established stud farms and so on. Deputy Fagan and Deputy Hilliard seemed to be of the opinion that big farms were an advantage and that such farms in the East were necessary to finish off the store cattle of the West.</P>
    <P>I am aware that that has been the practice up to the present, but I cannot agree with any of these Deputies in that regard.  It will perhaps mean an upset in our agricultural economy if all the big farms in the East and in the Midlands disappear, but I hold that they will disappear and we shall then have to change our economy.  If there were larger holdings in the West, there would not be such a store cattle trade as exists at present and we would be able to finish off our cattle, the few cattle we have in the West, if we had larger-sized holdings.  The trouble at present is caused by the fact that the store cattle have to be sold off the small holdings, simply because we have not enough room to finish them off ourselves.  It will, perhaps, mean an upset in our agricultural economy, as I say, when these big farms disappear and the buyers so familiar to us at fairs down the West and, I understand, in the South, too, no longer attend; but if such a day comes, we shall have to change our hand and try something else.  The demand for land acquisition and resumption will continue until the greater number of the people are completely satisfied with holdings of reasonable size.  If it does mean an upset in our agricultural economy, we shall have to try something else, but I put it to Deputies that it is more desirable to have houses and families on land than cattle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> To give a short summary of the situation as it stands, it is my intention and the policy of the Government that the relief of congestion and the raising of small uneconomic holdings to a fair size shall be the first consideration of the Land Commission.  That will be the first consideration during the lifetime of this Government, whatever that lifetime may be.  It is a pretty big problem, particularly along the western seaboard.  We have at present no land on hands worth mentioning for the purpose.  I said last week that, when the war broke out, the then Government decided to close down completely on land acquisition.  The land on hands during the war years was gradually divided up, and there is no land now on hands.  I confidently expected that there would be a certain amount of land available for me to go ahead with when I took over, but I find that there is little or none.</P>
    <P>The acquisition and resumption of land was permitted for about two years in a few of the western counties, but that is all, and Deputy Moylan, my predecessor, and Deputies generally know quite well that there is very little land now left for that purpose, even taking into account the large farms which are available there.  I think that all the large farms in any single constituency down there could be counted on the fingers of the two hands.  We are acquiring and resuming small holdings when they come in the way of the final rearrangement of villages and so on. We need to face up to the problem on a pretty big scale and we intend to acquire that land in every possible place we can acquire it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that we have not sufficient powers at the present time.  I think we have sufficient powers but if, in the course of six months, nine months or 12 months, I find that we have not sufficient powers, Deputies will probably find that I shall come to the Dáil asking for greater powers.  At the present time I do not like to make a definite statement on the matter until I have examined the question or at least have a little more experience because, as I have said, I have no experience of the <Col N="528" /> acquisition of land.  If we meet with difficulties in the acquisition of land, I shall be asking the House for more powers to acquire land for the purposes I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that when the Deputy was not here.  Nobody can say that with certainty.  The pool varies from year to year.  A farm of land which the commissioners might acquire now, they might not acquire in a year's time.  Similarly they might acquire a farm in two or three years' time which they would not consider acquiring now.  The pool is constantly varying.  A good deal depends on the general prosperity on the land.</P>

They are settled peacefully between the commissioners and the persons from whom the land is being acquired.  There are some who grumble at the price which they get and others who do not.

My guess is that they got badly frightened by the bad mess that had been made of the land they had divided up to that.  In two years they divided 250,000 acres, but a few years afterwards they had to bring in an Act to dispossess some of those to whom they gave land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Two facts remain.  Land acquisition was suspended.  Perhaps price was an important factor in that. But I hold that it was quite a different factor altogether that governed the suspension of land acquisition.  That is the one I have already given. Perhaps, when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 they had a genuine desire to tackle the land question.  Be that as it may, I am afraid that their method proved to be quite hopeless.  The country is now in a very unsatisfactory position as a result of their method because the best and most fertile land was taken by them.  They had at their disposal many big farms.  If we want an area of 1,000 or 1,200 acres of land to-day we have to deal with five, six or eight different owners.  Fianna Fáil took the land which would have been the most productive had it been properly worked.  They gave that land to people against whom in 1946 they had to bring in an Act in order to dispossess them.  Speaking last week I said that the numbers of bad users was <Col N="532" /> round about the 1,000 mark.  The number has actually gone into 1,300. We have not yet investigated all the cases of bad users all over the country because there is not sufficient staff in the particular section of my Department which deals with that matter to carry out a thorough investigation.  I think that one of the principal reasons why Fianna Fáil were unable to reach their goal in the production of food during the emergency was because of the bad management of a large number of holdings.</P>
      <P>The ex-Minister for Lands displayed a very poor judgment in giving what I consider to be the richest and most fertile land in the country to people who did not appreciate it.  A statement of the situation makes rather deplorable reading.  This Government has been charged now with a task of bringing about some improvement.  I shall do my best to deal with the situation. I do not for a moment believe that my campaign will be a popular one.  I shall, however, act a man's part with the backing of every single member of the Government Party behind me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Commons raised the point that gangers working for the Land Commission had not received the increases to which they were entitled.  Under the old scale gangers received from 10/6 to 12/6 per day. They are now getting 12/6 to 14/- per day.  Supervising gangers who were in receipt of 12/6 to 14/6 per day are now getting 14/6 to 18/6.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by the Deputies during the course of this debate.  Many Deputies raised the question of bogs and asked why we did not take over bogs that were vested in the local authorities during the emergency.  We are always ready and willing to take over bogs.  As a matter of fact in many counties, including my own, bog plots are running scarce and the provision of turbary may become a first-class problem in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House have promised me the co-operation for which I asked in my opening speech.  I <Col N="533" /> am glad that they have done so because their co-operation is absolutely essential if I am to make a success of my work.  In some cases when we try to rearrange an overcrowded townland we find ourselves up against opposition from one or two people.  If Deputies, particularly on the Opposition benches, would help in a matter of that kind they could play a very useful part in helping our local inspectors by advising such recalcitrants to fall in.  I issue that specific appeal to them and I ask them, in cases where one or two householders in a village of 16 or 20 houses stand out, to pull their weight in trying to make such people see commonsense. In some cases the opposition comes from old people who do not care very much and who have no thought of the future.  Their attitude is &ldquo;Well, it is good enough for my time.&rdquo;  They forget that they are thereby working to the disadvantage of their neighbours because if land is in rundale it must be together.  It is my desire to make every holding a complete entity with dwelling-house, out-offices and so on.  We want to erect dwellinghouses and provide roads.  In my opinion it will take two or two and a half years before we can get into our stride.  We are starting now from scratch.  We must first of all secure a sufficient acreage of land to form a reservoir and, as we take away from that reservoir, we must keep adding to it also.  We shall need land on a pretty big scale.  We shall take land on a big scale.</P>

      <P>I would be on my feet before the Deputy would be on his if anybody, particularly a Minister, sought to infringe even in the slightest way the privileges of a member of this House.  Every Deputy is free to make representations.  That is what each Department is there for, and the Ministers are there to receive these representations. Lest, however, the Deputy may be under a misapprehension, I should like to make it quite clear that I have the strongest possible objection to Deputies approaching inspectors and in some cases worrying them, threatening them&mdash;perhaps even coaxing them for all I know.  I shall take my own steps to stop that.  I shall not be infringing any Deputy's right then. My advice to any Deputy is that when representations require to be made, not alone to my particular Department but to any Department, or as soon as any complaint is brought to his notice, he should approach the secretary of the Department or the Minister in the matter.  If he does not like the particular way I view matters there is always my secretary to approach.  I shall not know anything about such representations&mdash;nor do I want to&mdash; and they will receive the fullest possible consideration.</P>

There is nothing to stop any inspector who may want information on any point going to the local Deputy, the local Senator, the local county councillor, the parish priest or any other person who will give him the information he desires.  I should like to bring this to the notice of Deputy Moylan and the House.  Deputy Commons, I think, complained during the course of his speech of inspectors going to men to whom they should not go&mdash;those with a valuation of £25.  I want to tell the House that inspectors are bound under pain of dismissal to furnish the most minute details to the Land Commission when they are furnishing a report.  It is their duty to make the fullest possible inquiries so that the case of a deserving person may not be overlooked. If a Deputy were to bring to my notice, in the course of the division of a piece of land, the case of a deserving person who did not get a portion, my first step would be that the inspector responsible would be asked to account for it.  I desire that no hindrance whatever shall be placed on inspectors seeking information so that the very fairest distribution of the property of the State in the hands of the Land Commission will take place and that the most deserving, regardless of their political affiliations, will get it.</P>

The Minister knows what it is&mdash;his word.  I gave the Minister my word that there was no political interference with the Land Commission.  Of course, possibly my word was tainted.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £265,430 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years past my predecessor had to report that the extent of the <Col N="538" /> tree planting programme was diminishing and that nothing could be done to alter the position.  After the cessation of the war it was hoped that an immediate improvement could be made, but until quite recently it was found impossible to secure from any source adequate supplies of rabbit netting.  I can, however, now announce that this obstacle has been overcome.  There is every prospect of a substantial increase in next winter's planting programme and for a continued expansion thereafter. In anticipation of this, steps were taken to increase the stocks of plants in the State nurseries but some further time must elapse before the full 10,000-acre programme per annum can be realised.</P>
    <P>The present season's planting is still in progress and it is anticipated that not less than 4,000 acres will be planted during the season.  The stocks of transplants in the State nurseries have been supplemented by purchases from commercial nurseries.  For the season 1948-49 we are making provision for a minimum planting of 6,000 acres, and this also will be exceeded if the plant situation will allow of it.</P>
    <P>The State nurseries at the beginning of the war were stocked with enough transplants to provide for a planting programme of 10,000 acres but the stocks gradually diminished through the impossibility of procuring the necessary seed for replacements.  The situation is now improving and stocks in 1946-47 showed an increase of 10,750,000 as compared with the previous year.  During the past winter orders have been placed for 1,915 lbs. of seed of various species (mainly Scots Pine, Larch and Spruce) from the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Holland and Scotland.  It is not possible to say what proportion of this quantity will ultimately be obtained but prospects are good.  To supplement purchases from abroad home seed collection has been pushed vigorously and the results have exceeded expectations.  About 516 lbs. of conifer seed has been collected and over 10,000 lbs. of hardwood seeds, mainly oak and beech.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the coming year represents an increase of £25,910 on the <Col N="539" /> amount provided for 1947-48.  The increase is due in the main to provision for an increased planting programme. A large increase in the receipts from sales of firewood was anticipated but the change in the fuel position has altered the situation.  There is no longer the same necessity to provide stocks of firewood in the larger cities and retail prices have fallen.  Against this fall in receipts there has been a saving on labour during the past year as felling operations were stopped in many forests from which it had been intended to supply firewood to Dublin, Cork and other centres.</P>
    <P>The position as regards acquisition of land is not very satisfactory.  Though the total area acquired last year compares favourably with acquisitions for the years immediately preceding, the percentage of unplantable land included is very high.  One of the main difficulties is that associated with the securing of suitable land in large blocks.  Three hundred acres of plantable land is the minimum necessary for economic working.  In fact much larger blocks can be developed with approximately the same overhead costs for supervision, etc.  The process of building up economic blocks from small areas is slow and expensive and is complicated by the fact that mountain land is held in undivided shares by a number of people or is subject to grazing rights similarly held.  For these reasons it is difficult to secure agreement with all the persons having an interest in the land and negotiations frequently drag on for years before purchase can be effected.  The forestry division has a reserve of over 30,000 acres of unplanted land in hands but without a yearly increase at least equal to the area planted the reserve of land will soon begin to diminish and co-ordination of nursery and planting programmes will become still more difficult. Special attention is being given to this problem and the staff dealing with the purchase of land, particularly the outdoor staff, will be strengthened as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the establishment of large forest areas, the co-ordination of nursery and planting programmes is a most important and complicated part of the business, <Col N="540" /> and is one about which there appears to be widespread lack of knowledge or understanding.  Trees intended for timber, and by timber I mean good commercial timber, cannot be grown as easily or as quickly as hedgerow or other ornamental or fruit trees, nor as easily or as quickly as ordinary crops.  Nursery programmes have to be planned considerably in advance of the actual planting out of trees in their final positions.  The plants used for planting out are normally three years old, so that sowings of seed made, say, in the autumn of 1947, will not leave the nurseries as young trees until 1950 or 1951.  Assuming normal germination and healthy growth, the co-ordination of nursery and planting programmes would necessitate a decision now, i.e., at least three years beforehand, in regard to the extent and nature of the ground to be planted in the winter of 1950 and 1951.  That is necessary so as to ensure that the proper variety and the requisite quantities of seeds should be purchased.  Not only has the variety of the trees to be determined on a scientific basis in relation to the timber needs of the country, but it has also to be determined in relation to the type of land to be planted and to considerations affecting the best mixture of trees in the plantations.  Different species behave differently, and experience is constantly pointing to the varying requirements of growing timber.</P>
    <P>Put as a simple example in which, say, the Government might decide by systematic afforestation to build up <i>ab initio</i> an area of, say, 500,000 acres of plantations in 50 years at the rate of 10,000 acres per annum progress would work out in this way.  More than 10,000 acres of plantable land, including nursery land, would have to be acquired in the first year.  The land would have to be scientifically examined to decide the species to be planted and would have to be prepared. Nurseries would have to be established and seed purchased and sown to produce, let us say, sufficient sitka spruce plants at the end of four years to plant an area suited for that species in the first 10,000 acres acquired.  No planting could be done in the first year.</P>
    <P>In the second year at least another <Col N="541" /> 10,000 acres of plantable land are acquired, the area surveyed and a selection of species made as before. Seed has to be sown in the nurseries to produce enough plants of spruce at the end of four years to plant and area selected for that species in this second 10,000 acres.  In addition seed has to be sown to produce enough plants of larch and other species at the end of three years to plant an area suited for these species in the first 10,000 acres. No planting could be done.</P>
    <P>In the third year at least another 10,000 acres of plantable land are acquired and surveyed and a selection of species made.  Seed has to be sown in this year to produce spruce at the end of four years to plant the spruce areas in this third 10,000 acres.  In addition, seed has to be sown to produce the larch, etc. at the end of three years for the second 10,000 acres and seed has to be sown to produce enough plants of pines and hardwoods at the end of two years to plant an area suitable for these species in the first 10,000 acres.  No planting could be done.</P>
    <P>In the fourth year at least another 10,000 acres of plantable land are acquired.  Seed has to be purchased to produce spruce at the end of four years to plant the spruce areas in this fourth 10,000 acres.  In addition, seed has to be sown to produce larch, etc. at the end of three years for the third 10,000 acres and seed has to be sown to produce pines, etc. at the end of two years for the second 10,000 acres.</P>
    <P>In the fourth year planting of the first 10,000 acres can, now be carried out with four years' old spruce, three years' old larch, etc., and two years' old pines, etc.  The number of plants grown, if everything has gone satisfactorily, should be just sufficient for planting this area and no more.  In the meantime, however, many things may have happened to prevent the correct numbers being produced.  There may be surplus of some species and deficiencies in others.</P>
    <P>In the fifth and subsequent years the procedure is as for the fourth year and the afforestation scheme should be in full swing.</P>
    <P>The procedure just outlined would be ideal for carrying out an afforestation <Col N="542" /> programme, but its success depends on the regular acquisition of not less than 10,000 acres of plantable land annually, upon a delay of four years before any area is planted to enable the proper species and types of plants to be grown in the proper proportions, and, lastly, upon no hindrance to the production of these trees in the numbers required.</P>
    <P>This simple position is, however, very different from what is and has been actually happening in this country for many years past.  Owing to the great difficulties of getting land, seeds and materials, there has not been, and there could not have been, a firmly fixed programme for annual planting.  The annual programme had to be arranged as best it could, and had to be built up of a large number of small patches of land here and there, some of which have been acquired for three years, some for two years, some for one year and some for only a few weeks before being planted.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the different subheads of the Forestry Vote, I propose to refer in detail only to those items which show appreciable differences from last year's figures.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head C. (1.) has been reduced by a sum of £5,000 as compared with last year.  This does not indicate any slackening of efforts to secure additional land for forestry, the intention being, as I mentioned earlier, to endeavour to increase the rate of acquisition as soon as possible. The reduction is, I hope, a temporary one and due merely to passing conditions. During last year, the forestry division purchased 7,345 acres of land and now has in the Land Acquisition Fund a total of approximately £44,800. Subject to the completion of the usual legal formalities, the division has agreed to purchase, from private landowners, at a cost of £23,034, areas totalling 5,890 acres and from the Land Commission 765 acres at a cost of £2,475.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have also reached an advanced stage for the purchase of of 3,476 acres from private landowners at a cost of £9,847 and negotiations are proceeding with the Land Commission for the purchase of 6,397 acres at a cost of £22,760.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> For various reasons some of these negotiations may ultimately prove abortive and others will take a considerable time to complete, so that the provision of £20,000 will probably be sufficient to meet actual outgoings during this financial year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2) is the main item in the Forestry Estimates and provides for the maintenance of existing plantations and the planting and development of new areas.</P>
    <P>The amount first voted under this sub-head last year was £260,089 and was intended to provide for a planting programme of 6,000 acres.  Owing to the nursery situation and late arrival of rabbit netting such a programme could not be carried out, nor, owing to a rise of about 20 per cent. in the wages of forestry labourers, would the amount provided have been sufficient.  During the year the provision was increased by a sum of £52,216 to provide for additional labour to be recruited for the felling and preparation of about 40,000 tons of firewood for Messrs.  Fuel Importers' depôts in the non-turf areas.  The anticipated shortage of fuel was relieved by the arrival of imports of coal and fellings were discontinued or reduced at many centres.  Considerable quantities of logs and blocks intended for transport to the cities will be available for sale locally in the neighbourhood of the forests.</P>
    <P>The programme of road making which has been in operation for some years past will be continued this year wherever necessary to allow of the extraction of poles and timber from those plantations which have reached the thinning stage.  At present there is a good market at home for poles for various uses and any surplus over requirements can be sold for export as pitprops, etc.</P>
    <P>It is essential, for the purpose of extending planting operations in future years, that adequate stocks of plants be built up in the State nurseries. This requirement is not being overlooked though certain varieties of seed are still in short supply.  Since it takes on an average three years to produce a transplant of the proper age for planting out, no immediate replacement of unforeseen shortages is possible. <Col N="544" /> Nor is any advantage to be gained by the sowing of unduly large stocks of such varieties as are obtainable without an assurance that suitable ground for the growth of such species will be available for planting in three or four years' time.  In view of the length of time it takes to grow a tree to the stage at which it becomes a marketable commodity, it would be a mistake, for the sake of a year or two, to plant any species on ground where soil or other conditions were definitely unsuitable for their normal growth.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the outbreak of war, the forestry division purchased a number of portable crosscutting machines for use in the preparation of firewood blocks from inferior timber standing on ground which had to be cleared for the planting of more suitable varieties.  With the fuel situation which developed during the war, the number of these machines was increased and some of them have been continuously in use so that they are now nearing the end of their periods of usefulness.  This happily coincides with the disposal of the greater part of the stocks of purely firewood timber which the Department had on hands and also with a probable large falling off in the demand for firewood.  The provision for the upkeep and running of these machines has, therefore, been reduced and probably some of them will have to be sold as scrap and a reduced number concentrated in those areas where a market for firewood, fencing stakes, etc. can still be found.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head C (3) provision is made for the working of the Department's sawmills, of which the two most important ones are those at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and Cong, County Mayo.  The third mill is at Avondale, County Wicklow, and is used mainly to give experience to the forestry trainees.  The mills at Dundrum and Cong do a steady local trade in rough boards, fencing stakes, cart material, felloes, spokes, etc.  Both of the mills are old, and consideration is being given to the remodelling of them for more efficient working.  The erection of up-to-date drying kilns at Dundrum from which seasoned timber can be turned out, both for the Department's <Col N="545" /> own use and for sale, is also under active consideration.  It is hoped to demonstrate by means of the products of these kilns that native timber can be marketed in a condition to compare most favourably with imported timber, and that the prejudice against native timber which appears to exist amongst architects, builders and others is due, not to any inherent defects in the timber itself, but to the way in which it has hitherto been used in an unseasoned state.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head D an increase of £500 is required in the provision under this sub-head, out of which payment is made of the grant of £10 per acre, which, under certain conditions, the Department is prepared to pay to private landowners and local authorities who carry out planting operations on their own lands.  Up to the present, very little planting has been possible owing to the impossibility of procuring rabbit netting and the scarcity of suitable plants.</P>
    <P>The position regarding rabbit netting for general use is improving slowly.  During the past year the forestry division were in consultation with the tree nursery trade, on which falls the duty of meeting, at reasonable charges, the public demand for suitable transplants, and I should like to state that any persons who are bound to plant as a condition of a felling licence, and who find difficulty in procuring the specified varieties, will be advised as to the substitution of other suitable varieties if details are submitted to the forestry division.  I am particularly anxious that everybody who has an acre of land suitable for the growth of trees should take advantage of this grant.</P>
    <P>In sub-head H, it will be observed that there is a drop of about £18,500 in the receipts estimated for this year. This is due to the fact that a considerable quantity of firewood prepared during last summer and winter for despatch to Fuel Importers' depôts is no longer required and the material will have to be disposed of locally at the best prices obtainable.  Apart from this there is likely to be a decrease in the receipts from large sales of timber due to the fact that most of the mature <Col N="546" /> timber in the State forests has been sold to meet demands arising out of the shortage of imported timber during the war years and to the necessity of conserving the small remaining lots of timber of building quality for the Department's own requirements.</P>
    <P>In consequence of the reappearance in the markets of quantities of imported timber, the number of felling notices being received annually had begun to show a decided decrease but the abnormal weather of the spring of 1947, coupled with the shortage of all types of fuel, caused a large and sudden increase.  It is hoped that for the future the number of felling notices will decrease and that owners will endeavour to reduce fellings to a minimum and to retain ornamental strips and groves wherever possible.</P>
    <P>It is also to be hoped that a considerable amount of voluntary planting will be done on private lands to make up for the abnormal fellings which conditions during the past eight years have forced upon the country.  Apart from what may be done in this way, there is considerable leeway to be made up in regard to replanting which has to be carried out as a condition of the issue of felling licences.  The factors which rendered replanting practically impossible are slowly disappearing and as soon as conditions permit the Department intends to take up strongly the question of enforcing replanting conditions.  Persons concerned are reminded that, so far as registered land is concerned, the obligation to replant will, as soon as the Act of 1946 comes into force, and this will now not be long, be entered in the relative folio as a burden on the holding and will continue as a burden until evidence has been produced to show that the necessary planting has been satisfactorily carried out.  Failure to replant, apart from the other penalties which may be inflicted and which may be considerable, as it is a continuing offence which cannot be escaped at the cost of a fine, will render sale of a holding less easy and may appreciably reduce the price which might otherwise be obtained.</P>

      <P>A Minister has a great advantage in presenting an Estimate. <Col N="547" /> Of course, at the start he discloses his views to criticism, but he has always the opportunity of finishing up and confusing his critics.  I am not the only one to notice that.  It seemed to me during the Lands Estimate debate that there was as much jostling for position as there was at the Derby a few days ago.  Everybody waited for his colleague to get up so that he could have a crack at his own opponent.  I would like, too, to wait until I hear some of the developments.</P>
      <P>Looking round the House a while ago when the Minister spoke on forestry, I began to ask myself: &ldquo;Where are the snows of yesterday?&rdquo;&mdash;60,000 acres from Clann na Talmhan per annum; 1,000,000 acres in four years&mdash;and only Deputy Kinnane in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that much, I think that this is an Estimate on which we might have a completely non-Party discussion.  All of us regard forestry development on the largest scale possible as wholly desirable and our only differences are as to the methods that might be used and the extent of the development.  I do not mind very much what is said in this House between my opponents and myself. One time Tim Healy was accused of attacking William O'Brien very harshly and he said: &ldquo;I have never said a word to William O'Brien save in the way of business.&rdquo;  One would expect, however, from the newspapers a more objective outlook and when they hold up the opposition by Fianna Fáil as being completely destructive, they are, I think, doing us a good deal less than justice.  I think that the best thing that has happened to this Government in quite a long while is the fact that they have a strong coherent Opposition in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, whatever Government is in power in the future, that we will have a strong coherent Opposition.  I am that old-fashioned <Col N="548" /> thing, a patriot.  I will admit that I do not see much hope for the country from the present Government, but I wish them every success.  Anything that they can do to forward the welfare of this country I wish them success in it and offer them my co-operation. That is the attitude of Fianna Fáil, even though we will criticise anything that we do think needs criticism. Therefore, in this important matter of forestry I want an entirely objective approach.  The things that I could say about the 1,000,000 acres in four years and the things that I might say about the 60,000 acres a year would be very interesting, but probably they would not make for progress.</P>
      <P>What we ought to look at here is what are the problems presented to us by the Estimate, and I think they are: an assessment of the value of the work done; a decision as to how and how far forestry development should proceed; and suggestions from the various Deputies as to the methods whereby the desirable end might be achieved by the shortest route.  The present position is, I take it, that the Land Commission have roughly about 200,000 acres of land, about 120,000 acres of these planted, about 300 acres of nursery, about 40,000 acres of plantable land, and about 40,000 acres of unplantable mountain and marsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Fianna Fáil policy was 10,000 acres a year, with an eventual forest cover of 600,000 acres, and possibly 100,000 acres of scrub and rough protective land.  That was a more effective policy in regard to forestry than the Cumann na nGaedheal policy was.  But, when Cumann na nGaedheal took office, there is no doubt that forestry was moribund in this country.  There were not 1,000 acres per annum being planted, and it is difficult to build up an organisation and to create a new idea, and credit must be given to Cumann na nGaedheal for bringing the plantation from 1,000 to 3,000 acres in their time.  Then Fianna Fáil took office with their idea of planting 10,000 acres a year.  They never reached it.  The greatest amount planted in any year was 7,500 acres. That was, I think, in 1938, and I believe we would have reached 10,000 <Col N="549" /> acres but for the war.  I think the greatest hope we have for the future is in the fact that all during the war years, under tremendous difficulties, difficulties due to shortages of all kinds, an average of 4,000 acres per year were planted.  Knowing the difficulties, that to my mind is a great achievement.</P>
    <P>In trying to discover what exactly should be our aim, if I refer to proposals of Parties other than the Fianna Fáil, I am not doing it in the spirit of the hustings.  I merely want to discover what is the right thing to do and to try to see how we might get agreement upon it and be helpful to each other.  Clann na Poblachta promised 1,000,000 acres in four years, Clann na Talmhan, of course, not to be outdone, promised 60,000 acres per annum.  I do not know if they promised it, but I did see an advertisement in the newspapers during the election time putting up this idea as a feasible one.  Fianna Fáil policy was 10,000 acres a year.  But the policy of Clann na Poblachta and of Clann na Talmhan are impossible and, if they were possible, they would be wholly undesirable.  Experience in other countries, particularly in New Zealand, would show how entirely undesirable was the 60,000 acres per year, and it would be impossible apart from its undesirability.</P>
    <P>My own view that I hold strongly and have held is that the rate of planting envisaged by Fianna Fáil at 10,000 acres per year is too little.  I think we should do much more.  But there are many difficulties.  One difficulty is that the demand for forestry is an urban demand and not a rural demand.  There is so much of a desire for agricultural land and, indeed, any kind of land, that the rural opposition to forestry outweighs urban enthusiasm.  There is no shadow of doubt about that.  The Land Commission had an experience in County Galway some time ago&mdash;at Gort, I think it was&mdash;where an attempt was made by the Land Commission to plant, when guns were brought out, people were moonlighted and every opposition to the plans of the Forestry Department was carried on.  In Tipperary, on land eminently suitable for <Col N="550" /> forestry, all kinds of destruction was carried out by the local people, people who had not a shadow of a right, legally or morally, to the land which was being planted.  Recently the Land Commission did everything to meet the needs and the desires of the people in County Mayo at Cong.  Here again is land eminently suitable for forestry. It is a most desirable place to plant. All the arable and agricultural land that could be given has been given to people there.  Yet we had opposition to any planting down in Cong, and that with the support of a number of Deputies.</P>

Deputy O'Higgins the other night spoke about the number of people waiting in Laoighis for an estate to be divided and gave the impression that his view was that these people had a perfect right to demand land.  I was glad to hear the Minister say in the Land Commission debates that we will have fixity of tenure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be permitted to make my case.  I will talk about forestry.  I am glad that we are to have fixity of tenure, even if I am out of order.  But, I am in great measure in agreement with Deputy Peadar Cowan.  Land is such a fundamental <Col N="551" /> property that, even though we do admit, and will fight for, security of tenure, the people of the country have an overriding right to land and no single individual can get up and say that he has any kind of a right to land being divided by the Land Commission. But, in the question of the acquisition of estates by the Land Commission we can apply compulsion and, while compulsion is inherent in the Forestry Acts, yet the compulsion for purposes of forestry development is not the same type of compulsion that can be used in regard to the acquisition of land for division.  There must be peaceful penetration and we must develop local goodwill. The greatest difficulty confronting the Department of Forestry is the question of the acquisition of land.</P>
      <P>Judging by what I can see, I think the pool of land is drying up and I doubt if, by the present methods, we can ever hope to reach even the modest amount that is envisaged in the Fianna Fáil programme of forestry.  I have the view that we ought to have a secondary forestry policy.  Our policy is that of growing 600,000 acres of commercial timber.  I would be sorry to accuse the Land Commission people of being perfectionists but I think that is a doctrine of perfectionism.  That will not be grown immediately or in time and you will not get the land to grow it immediately or in time.  I think it is necessary that we should have a secondary forestry policy, an uneconomic policy, for the purpose of creating soil conditions that would help us in 20 or 30 years' time to develop our real forestry policy of commercial timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Cumann na nGaedheal took office and even since Fianna Fáil took office, soil science has progressed a good deal.  Methods of reclamation and soil aeration are known now that were not known 16 years ago and much of the unplantable land that we hear about, if it is not on too high an elevation, might be prepared nowadays for planting.  At least, the thing is so important that it is well worth a few failures and a few experiments.  I will not blame the Minister, I will defend him, if he makes an attempt to develop a secondary forestry policy and, if he <Col N="552" /> fails in it, I will say that it was worth while doing it.  I am sorry my interrupter, the Parliamentary Secretary, has gone because he might interrupt me again.  I confess that I am not entirely enamoured of the Arterial Drainage Act.  It will be possible to give a good deal of relief in river areas, marshy areas, and low-lying bog areas but, conceivably, the Arterial Drainage Act, put into full operation, could lower the water level in the country and make arid what is very valuable land now and what you gain on the roundabouts you may lose on the swings.  We ought to combine our policy of drainage with a policy of water conservation and flood control.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will have read within the past few weeks of the great disaster in Oregon and Vanport on the Columbia River.  That was brought about by the destruction of forests in British Columbia, in Washington, and in Oregon.  What happened in the River Columbia yesterday has been happening every year on the Mississippi and on the Tennessee Rivers and you will notice that on the Tennessee River particularly the American Government has combined with drainage the question of flood conservation and forestry.  We had recently a lesser known but much more damnable flooding in Turkey, in a valley on the shore of the Mediterranean where, again because of the destruction of forestry, a whole countryside was laid waste.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister.  In regard to embankments, something might be done there but we have the Shannon in Munster and the Blackwater and all the Kerry Rivers doing tremendous damage every year to the farmers and a wise policy of afforestation combined with our arterial drainage work would be of tremendous benefit to the farmers and would not affect the now arable lands that might be made arid by the operations of the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>I think I heard the Minister say that a good deal of success had accrued to the collection of native seeds.  It will be a long time, I do think, before we will be able to get the amount of plants we would need from foreign countries and no matter what success you have had in the past year, that success could <Col N="553" /> be quadrupled if a real effort were made.  Without the seeds, we cannot have the plants.</P>
    <P>We ought to have this year adequate lands in hand at least to bring us to the 10,000 acres, if we have the plants. It is quite possible that we have not the plants but, if we have, there is nothing really to stop the Land Commission or the Department of Forestry from getting us the 10,000 acres this year, and I will be very pleased with the Minister, and glad that we have changed places, if he achieves the 10,000 acres this year.  This is a very uncertain world&mdash;the 18th February told us that&mdash;and it may not always be easy to get rabbit wire, barbed wire and tools of various kinds.  I trust that the Minister is taking steps to build up, against eventualities, a big reserve of these items.  While the Land Commission made tremendous efforts during the last war and had great successes, the successes might have been greater if we had had a big reserve of material.</P>
    <P>On the Land Commission Estimate the Minister said that no Minister appointed by Fianna Fáil knew anything about land and, of course, the implication was that the Minister now knows everything about land.  I have no belief at all in the Minister-expert. I believe that a man with an open mind who has experts to help him will do a far better job as Minister than a man who knows the job particularly well. Experts are like the mills of God: they grind exceeding small, and it takes them a long time to do it.  Every advice the Minister will get from the experts of the Land Commission&mdash;who are real experts and know their job&mdash; will be ca' canny.  If Deputy Dunne advised the Federation of Irish Labour to go as ca' canny as the commissioners and inspectors will advise the Minister here, we would all be knocking Deputy Dunne.  Forestry in its initial stages employs one man to every 100 acres.</P>
    <P>There is no good in telling the general public of the tremendous dent we can make in unemployment by a proper forestry policy.  The Minister should persuade his experts to present him with a method, while he is in office, of increasing the amount of employment in forestry to at least one in <Col N="554" /> 50 acres.  In ten or 15 years' time, with a progressive policy, there is no reason why we should not have one man employed on every 25 acres.  If we can employ one man on every 25 acres of our worst land, we will be doing more for the country than all that might be done in the efforts to relieve congestion in the West.</P>
    <P>I saw in some newspapers that caretaking of our forests was costing 1½d. an acre.  That is a very small sum and I think that much more must be paid. Listening to the Minister's statement, as well as I could hear and understand it, it was a litany of difficulties, where it was not a litany of glorification. I would like the Minister to tell us something about the fire hazards and about the forest that has been destroyed during the past year as a result, in some cases, of the fact that we pay only 1½d. an acre for caretaking. There were 100 acres of a ten-year-old forest burned in Killarney a few days ago.  To my mind, that is inexcusable. There will be burnings, there will be accidents; but to lose 100 acres of ten-year-old forest seems to me to be inexcusable.  As our forests develop, the risks will be greater.  I wonder if enough care is taken, apart from the question of getting timber to grow, with the general lay-out of forests, with the creating of rides and roads through them, as fire gaps?  I wonder also if it would not be a wise thing, in this climate of ours where we get now and again a very hot season, to have a greater proportion of broad leaf trees?  I would like the Minister to tell us what percentage of hardwood he proposes to plant in future.  I think we are given too much to conifers and that we should try to plant a good deal more of the hardwoods.</P>
    <P>We will not have forestry without the creation of public opinion.  I believe in forestry development and I was glad to see Clann na Poblachta talking about 1,000,000 acres in five years, even though I know it could not be done.  I was very glad to see that the barb of Clann na Poblachta had got stuck somewhere in the hindquarters of Clann na Talmhan, as they came along with &ldquo;60,000 acres a year&rdquo;&mdash;but that is all to the good.  We really must try to instruct the general public with regard <Col N="555" /> to the value of forestry and the need for it.  I saw on a few occasions a map and exhibit at the Dublin Show&mdash;a very informative map and a very valuable exhibit&mdash;in which a tremendous amount of interest was taken by the people here in Dublin.  Why cannot we have that map and that forestry exhibit in provincial centres, where the country people could get a look at what is being done and see the value of forestry?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has been very wrath with the Land Commission because they have not planted trees in West Cork.  If there is forestable land in West Cork would not one way of getting after it, one way of creating public opinion, be to take that forestry exhibit and map down to a very well run show in Clonakilty and let the West Cork people see the value of forestry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>There is too much talk about West Cork.  If the Minister has time from his onerous duties, I suggest that he should go across the yard from here into the School of Art, where this week there is an exhibition of posters, by far the best exhibition that has been in the School of Art for the past five years of any kind of pictures. Having seen that, I would like him to get a new idea and start a competition for artists, dealing with forestry matters, so that we might have artistic posters in the schools throughout the country, sinking ideas into the minds of the children and of the general public&mdash;especially the idea that forestry was valuable, that the Government was in earnest about it and that they should themselves evolve some civic spirit with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I think there is a certain amount of laziness in the officers of the Forestry Department, a certain lack of initiative, shall we say, in the junior inspectors.  Inspectors must lay out work.  They must have some forethought if they are to employ men effectively.  It takes a little energy and initiative to do that, but it takes no energy and no initiative to sack a man. <Col N="556" /> I instance two districts because what is happening, or has happened in those districts, is probably happening in other districts.  In the Banteer forest last year a number of men were disemployed, and in the Newmarket, County Cork, forest this year a number of men have been disemployed.  Now, economy ought to have some relation to facts.  There is plenty of work for these men in those forests, in making clearances, in drainage and in fencing, and with a little energy, initiative and forethought these men need not have been put on the dole.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have had some encounters with the Department of Finance in relation to forestry labourers whose wages are geared to the agricultural rate in the particular district where they work.  When the wages board makes an advance to a farm labourer's wage it seems to me that the forestry worker's wage should be automatically advanced.  Instead of that, after constant application, one is told that the matter is under consideration by the Department of Finance.  Why cannot this Department, or any Department, be so independent in dealing with its employees that it can pay what is legally due to them without questioning the Department of Finance?</P>

Why should they have to wait three months for it?  I wish the Minister much more success in developing forestry than ever I had.</P>

      <P>On the note that Deputy Moylan finished on I intend to start.  May I say at the outset that I <Col N="557" /> am terribly disappointed with the statement in connection with forestry just given by the Minister, because I feel that the time has come when forestry should be approached, in what I am sure many people in this House will ultimately describe as a revolutionary way.  I have one precept of economy&mdash;I may be right or I may be wrong&mdash;and I think there is no branch of activity in this State to which it can apply more readily than forestry where the gain is to be posterity's. I am convinced that it is posterity that should pay the bill.  I think the time has come when some of our high credit&mdash;that is how we describe the financial position of this country&mdash;should be utilised for the purpose of raising a very substantial amount of money to be placed at the disposal of what I shall try to elaborate as a forestry bureau for the purpose of planning and developing forestry on a systematic basis, so that in the course of time there will be a rotational forestry system from which certain cuttings can be made and certain plantings made to keep the revenue position of forestry on a proper basis.</P>
      <P>Criticism may be made of the ambitious policy of Clann na Poblachta. I do not criticise as ambitious a policy that looks for 1,000,000 acres over a number of years.  If it failed to get it, I would not criticise the policy that aimed at getting the maximum done in the shortest possible time where forestry is concerned.  Whether the policy is practical or not, is a question that, I think, has not yet been properly resolved by any Department, and least of all by the Forestry Department.  I am going to subscribe to one thing that Deputy Moylan said. I think he was perfectly right and in my opinion it is worth a good deal of respect.  He suggested to the Minister that he should go in for a secondary forestry policy, and said that if the Minister failed in that, that he, at least, would offer no criticism of him. He suggested that such a policy was well worth trying.</P>

    <P>I think that the maximum effort will have to be applied to forestry as a whole.  I am not satisfied that the experts, to whom Deputy Moylan has <Col N="558" /> just paid tribute, have really done their utmost either by way of experiment or by way of a proper survey to give the Minister full information as to what land in this country would be suitable for forestry purposes.  Even though they suggest that we have much land that is not suitable for forestry, I think that, with a little of the preparation suggested by Deputy Moylan, and indeed in some cases without preparation but with the introduction of certain new types of trees, much of our land would become plantable.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister with all earnestness that his statement was far from the approach to forestry that I had hoped for.  I am sure it is conceded by everybody that there is an ultimate benefit to the State in forestry, and that at some future date the present day investment of this State in forestry is going to show an appreciable profit.  If that is not conceded, then the whole theory with regard to forestry is meaningless; but, working on that basis, I want to suggest to the Minister that in the situation in which he finds this country at the moment, a country with an agreed high credit, he should use his best endeavours&mdash;and if he does he will have my earnest support&mdash;to get raised at once what he and his experts would consider as an adequate amount of money to enable him to tackle, in the shortest possible time, the question of the complete afforestation of the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that he do that so that he will have adequate money to give proper conditions to his workers, adequate money to give a chance of real experiment to his various forestry experts, adequate money to place at the disposal of the Forestry Department to pay a reasonable price for the acquisition of land suitable for forestry and adequate money to advance, as was very sensibly suggested by Deputy Moylan, a propaganda campaign whereby the country could be educated into a forestry policy.  If there is any justification in any economy for a large expenditure of money, I say that one of the fields in which it can be spent is forestry.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking of £1,000,000 or <Col N="559" /> £2,000,000; I am thinking in terms of the raising of a loan, if the situation demands it, of £7,000,000, £8,000,000, £9,000,000 or £10,000,000.  Let posterity pay for the benefit it will reap and let the approach to forestry be on a real business basis in order to put this country in a position in which, in 40 or 50 years' time, it will be able, on a rotational system, to supply, or nearly supply, the timber needs of this State.  There was a lot of hard, common sense in the suggestion made by Deputy Moylan that it might be better if we started growing more hardwoods. What is wrong with the forestry system, to my mind, is that it is over-conservative, and much criticism will probably be levelled at me for weaving webs or spinning fantasies; but when you have a situation in which the country has high credit and there is a lot of money floating around, I cannot see any real obstacle in the way of this new Government raising, by way of loan to be repaid by posterity, a sum to tackle the complete problem of afforestation.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that the target of a very large acreage is as impossible as suggested by Deputy Moylan, but I will agree with him that it is an absolute impossibility, if the Department is to carry on its present slow but sure, plodding activity. If the propaganda campaign so lucidly described by Deputy Moylan is to be carried out in other constituencies, I have no objection to posters going from one end of West Cork to the other to advocate something which the people are looking for, if, in their wake, comes some practical evidence in the shape of planting to show that the Government is in earnest.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of difficulties, I will be told, in the way of this scheme.  I suppose the first and loudest cry will be that the seed situation is very difficult. I wonder whether an exhaustive search throughout the length and breadth of this world has been made for seed.  I wonder if this searching for seed has really been done on an extensive basis or if the Department, with its typical conservatism, has limited its inquiries to sources from which it at one time <Col N="560" /> got seeds.  I wonder whether any Government in this country to date has been in earnest about afforestation, or whether they have accepted it as a necessary evil.  I wonder if there was any real appreciation of the reproductive value of trees, apart altogether from the aspect of picturesqueness and apart from the protection which forests can give in certain areas, if there was any real appreciation of the true economic value or true potential economic value of adequate forests.  Because I am young and have not become too versed in the conservative ways of politics, I may be described as reaching for the moon, but will anybody give a practical reason why, in a problem of this nature, this Government, the previous Government or the Government before them, were not entitled to commit the credit of the country for this ultimate benefit to posterity and ask posterity to pay for it?</P>
    <P>We approach big national problems in the wrong way.  Maybe the fault is not in ourselves, but in our systems, but, wherever it lies, I am taking this, the first, opportunity I have had of airing my views on forestry in an endeavour to get somebody to tell me why the approach I suggest on a large national basis cannot be made.  There is a tremendous amount of land in Ireland available for afforestation.  I do not think that all the opposition spoken about by Deputy Moylan exists.  My limited experience in my own constituency has been that in many areas there is an insistent cry that land be acquired and that afforestation should go ahead.  I feel I should say, in fairness to all Governments in this country, that their approach to forestry was hemmed in by budgetary considerations, but the time has come when, where you have a really sound definite value with which to back the moneys you ask for, where any money asked for is backed by the ultimate return to the Exchequer which will come from State forests, this new Government&mdash;it may be a case of &ldquo;third time lucky&rdquo;&mdash;should establish what I describe as a completely independent forestry bureau or Department, with only the drive and the constant insistent pressing of the Houses of the <Col N="561" /> Oireachtas for more activity as a check on it.  So much for my general idea as to how the problem should be approached.</P>
    <P>Taking it on that basis and taking it that the country is willing&mdash;and if it is in earnest about afforestation it must be willing&mdash;to give a considerable sum of money towards the carrying out of general forestry schemes, I would suggest that forestry be planned on the basis of getting the maximum possible done immediately, having due regard to the seed position.  Side by side with that, I would suggest that the maximum possible preparation should be made to get further areas that may not be absolutely suitable for forestry into a position where they would be suitable for forestry, and that an all-out intensive search, a world-wide search, be made to try to find our seed requirements; that conditions of employment for all sections of the community engaged in forestry work be stepped up and made attractive.</P>
    <P>I am not going to encroach much on the province of forestry workers or their wages because I have the feeling that Deputy Dunne of the Labour Party, having a good deal more knowledge than I, will most probably adequately handle that matter, but I would say that if the Government is really earnest about afforestation, the lot of the forestry worker must be radically improved.  I may be countered by the argument that we have not an adequate number of trained experts to deal with forestry as I envisage it, but I would say to the Minister: let the amount of money that you are going to ask posterity to pay for the gain that ultimately is going to be posterity's, be sufficient to cover all your needs.  Let it be sufficient to cover all essentials in training, equipping and getting as large a staff as is necessary to implement a complete scheme.</P>
    <P>I know that like many other things advocated in this country what I advocate may fall on deaf ears but at least I should like to know from the present Government, through the Minister, whether they are prepared to consider the problem of afforestation on the <Col N="562" /> plane I put it because I feel if it is not considered on this basis, these piecemeal contributions towards a solution of the problem will continue to an inglorious end.  Let my exhortation to the Minister be: face the problem courageously, do not be afraid to look for money and to fight for money outside budgetary considerations so that you can shake off the grip of conservatism and sloth of your Department. Do not be afraid to ask posterity to pay for its own ultimate gain.  Let the Minister not be afraid to try to implement and in fact to try to exceed, the stated ambition of his own Party, that we might have 60,000 acres a year planted in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of timber was felled in my county during the emergency years, particularly in the last two years.  It indicated in one respect the value of forestry units, the value of belts of trees.  They were a valuable source of wealth to the owners of the land on which the trees grew.  We appreciated the difficulties during the emergency, and perhaps up to the present, of putting Section 50 of the 1946 Act into operation in the country because of the lack of net wire or rabbit wire.  The Minister has indicated to us that supplies are becoming available to a greater extent.  Inasmuch as they are becoming available, we ask the Minister in my constituency to put into operation Section 50 of the Act in order that land owners shall be compelled to replant the valuable belts of forest on which they cashed in during the emergency.  A large amount of ditch timber was felled.  Valuable ash and elm, which provided shelter and protection in the Midlands and which were a picturesque feature of our roads around there, have been removed.  There were hundreds of <Col N="563" /> them.  In my own parish there were small ditches for which the owners got £300, £400 or £500 because of the timber in them.  No attempt has been made to replant these.  It may be a difficult task to implement Section 50 of the Act.  In the case of the ditch timber wire netting would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I know that if the Minister turned the entire Army and Garda force out on this work night and day they could not keep count or a proper record of the amount of trees felled.  A felling permit was given for so many trees in a district.  It did not matter whether a tree was five feet thick or only 18 inches, everything went down before the axe and everything was carted to Dublin so that an area which had been under wood became in time a wilderness. Possibly some land owners will do their duty.  Others are under the impression seemingly that if they fell 100 trees they need then only stick in 100 young plants into any corner in order to fulfil the conditions of the Forestry Acts.  With the staff the Minister has at his disposal at the present time it would be impossible for him to enforce the full code in regard to replanting.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Collins advocating a loan, if necessary, for the purpose of carrying out the various sections of the Forestry Acts.  If the Minister needs a loan or a Supplementary Estimate for that purpose, he should not hesitate to ask the House for it.  Apart from the commercial value of timber, Deputy Moylan has indicated how afforestation can affect climate, drainage and the fertility of land.  He has indicated what has been done in America in that respect.  In England, too, the British people are beginning to realise the losses they have suffered through the destruction of forests all over Great Britain and Scotland during the 1914-18 war and again during the more recent one.  In the north of Scotland very successful experiments have been carried out. Up as far as the Hebrides and towards the Shetland Islands, experiments have been carried out on the sand dunes whereby the sand has been fixed. <Col N="564" /> Scrub planting has then followed on that and now forests are being built up. Surely, that is something we might examine here.</P>
    <P>I dispute with the experts, who advised the previous Government and who will probably advise the present Minister, that one cannot plant trees beyond certain heights in Ireland.  The roots of the trees are there on these heights showing clearly that forests stood there in bygone days.  On the Gradwell estate in my own parish the forestry unit are only going to a certain height on the hills; they will not go above 750 feet.  They are not taking in the tops of the hills at all.  I do not know the reason for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not doing the tops of the hills at all.  They plant to a certain height and then stop.  That is the standing policy of the forestry section of the Land Commission.  I have seen forests in Germany and elsewhere going up thousands of feet.  I understand that in Norway forests grow on the crags over the ocean.  Here the theory is commonly held that one cannot plant successfully beyond 800 or 900 feet.  I think that is a ridiculous theory and the whole position should be re-examined in the light of what has been done successfully in other countries.</P>
      <P>In County Westmeath a short time ago, we passed a resolution asking the forestry branch of the Department of Lands to take over certain belts of wood which are now under the care of the Westmeath County Committee of Agriculture.  These woods are all over the County Westmeath.  They are a monument to those people who planted them when the county committees were first set up.  Some of that wood proved very useful during the emergency in the county institutions and the mental home.  Unfortunately the management of them is not all that can be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House detailing these particular belts.  I am sure the information will be available to the Minister from our committee.  The belts are nicely <Col N="565" /> situated and the land adjoining them could be acquired, if necessary.  I think the forestry branch should take over their care, maintenance and development. That is the unanimous decision of the committee, and I appeal now to the Minister to take them over.</P>
    <P>I asked a question, either in this House or directly to the Land Commission, as to what lands were available in County Westmeath for further forestry development.  I was told that the only lands on offer were the lands of Kinturk.  I ask the Minister to get to work on these immediately.  There will be a big labour content in them.  There is a lot of drainage to be done, a lot of levelling and a lot of development. There is a good deal of cut-away bog and some marsh-land.  With proper expert management by the forestry branch these could be developed, drained and planted, thereby giving much needed employment.  It is noticeable that since the woods were cut in County Westmeath, cold and frost are much more severe; there is more flooding since the timber was cut down. It is somewhat remarkable that at the same levels where timber still remains standing, the ground is not marshy and provides good grazing.  I am convinced from that that forestry serves a useful purpose in drying the land.  At certain levels it helps to retain moisture.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speakers who asked for bigger staffs and better development.  I cannot see why the present Government should as an economy measure have dismissed a number of staff under the forestry branch to which I have already referred.  If the Department of Lands took over Kinturk, plenty of employment could be provided there.  I appeal to them to take that over and to take over also the belts to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>As a new Deputy in the House, I must express my disappointment at the lack of interest shown in this Estimate.  That lack of interest is evident from the sparse attendance of members in the House.  I think this problem of forestry is one of the most important matters with which our <Col N="566" /> Government has to deal.  I believe it has potentialities of which a great number of people have no conception. Deputy Moylan in the course of his remarks made a statement&mdash;practically his only statement with which I agree.  It was to the effect that the Irish public very badly need to be educated on the value of afforestation.  However, if we were to embark on a policy of advising the Irish people of how valuable forestry is we would need a much more ambitious scheme of advertisement and education than the mere sending of our map down to Clonakilty.</P>
      <P>I believe it should be part of the policy of the Government to develop a campaign throughout the country to advise our people fully as to what a good, well-developed, programme of reafforestation can mean.  Deputy Moylan stated that the target of 60,000 acres per year was not alone an impossible target but an undesirable one. He did not state why he thought it was undesirable or even why he thought it was impossible.  To my mind it is both desirable and possible.  If we examine the details of the working of the Forestry Section of the Department we will find that what previous speakers have referred to is entirely true.  We find very grave understaffing.  We also find a decided lack of imagination on the part of the responsible Minister and the senior officials who have dealt with this problem in the past.  British rule in Ireland was responsible, in a large measure, for the denuding of this country of a great deal of its timber. That was done with a purpose.  It was done because the British realised that by denuding our country of its timber they were helping to impoverish it. The reverse, that the more timber we grow the more we enrich our country, must also apply.  One of the foremost authorities on afforestation has stated that the greatest loss a country can sustain is the loss of its forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made, I think by Deputy Moylan, to the need for soil examination.  It is undoubtedly true that one of the first steps that must be taken, in so far as the growing of trees is concerned, is to secure a scientific survey of the potentialities of <Col N="567" /> our soil.  I am sorry Deputy Moylan has left the House because I would have liked to ask him how it was that such a survey was not undertaken over the past long number of years&mdash;why, when the previous Government was in office, they did not take the opportunity which they then had to embark on such a survey.</P>
    <P>The number of acres in this country that are or could be made available for forestry is, I believe, a question of opinion.  I am told that successive Ministers in the different Governments which we have had in this country hitherto have insisted that we have not in the country an area of more than 300,000 acres suitable for planting.  A commission was set up by the British Government in 1906 who gave as their opinion that the total amount of land available for reafforestation was in the neighbourhood of 2,000,000 acres.  I do not consider for one moment that any political Party which advocated the maximum reafforestation was speaking foolishly or that it was indulging in flights of imagination.  I believe there is no greater enterprise which can have a larger labour content than the planting of trees.  I would urge our present Minister for Lands most strongly to bring to this question of afforestation a desire, which has not been evidenced in the past, to inflame the imagination of the entire country as to the great potentialities of reafforestation.  We need a completely new policy in this regard.  Deputy Moylan spoke of 10,000 acres per annum as being something which should be striven for.  It seems to me that that is a policy of restriction and one which holds out very little hope for the future of forestry in the country generally.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer especially to the question of forestry labourers.  I regret that the Minister did not deal with this very fully in his statement&mdash;he made a passing reference to it and no more.  They are a body of men who have been the subject of many Parliamentary questions here from time to time in years gone by.  I consider that forestry labourers form one of the most unjustly treated sections of workers in the <Col N="568" /> country.  Deputy Moylan stated that their wages are geared to those of the agricultural workers.  Why are they so geared?  Is there any good reason why there should be that relationship between the wages?  I have a considerable amount of experience dealing with this question and I have never yet heard a convincing argument brought forward to support the contention that because a farmer working a small, uneconomic farm&mdash;bad land&mdash;cannot pay more than a certain figure, the forestry worker logically, must not receive more. I think that is a very bad policy, one which must be abandoned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan complained&mdash;and it certainly is to me a novel experience to hear him complaining&mdash;that the increase for forestry labourers had been delayed.  They have so far received an increase of three shillings since the Agricultural Wages Board increased the minimum rate by five shillings.  I feel confident that the Minister will listen to the demand of forestry workers all over Ireland that the policy of tying their wages down to the level which obtains in respect of agricultural labourers should be thrown overboard, abandoned.  There should be an admission of the fact that these men who work in the nurseries and in the forests of the country, in very great hardship most of the time, should receive at least a reasonable rate of wages.  Nobody, I am sure, will argue that the wages they are receiving can be described as living wages.  There is no reason whatsoever why this State should not make available to these men a wage on which they can live.</P>
    <P>Wherever forestry workers are employed, I am certain that Deputies are aware of the hardships they undergo. I know cases of hardship even in my own constituency in County Dublin, which has been neglected to a great extent so far as reafforestation is concerned. In that county there are cases of workers who have to travel up to eight miles across open mountain before they start work.  They must leave their homes at six or before six o'clock, get out on the bleak mountainside, and be available to start work at the usual starting time.  Not alone that, but they have so far been denied protective <Col N="569" /> clothing of any kind.  I would have liked to have asked Deputy Moylan on how many occasions he refused the request that forestry workers be provided with rubber boots, which is a simple requirement that any reasonable employer will provide.</P>
    <P>Men who work in the nurseries and forests are skilled.  Many of them are engaged upon what are relatively dangerous occupations.  As regards timber fellers and sawyers, any man who has worked in rural areas or any Deputy with experience of this class of work knows well that the worker who has to knock timber or work a saw-bench is in continual danger. Although in other employment such workers are given special consideration, these workers employed by the forestry branch have hitherto been denied any kind of reasonable consideration. I brought to the notice of the Minister instances where such workers have been denied an opportunity even to attend Mass on Holydays.</P>
    <P>Deputies have an opportunity of discussing the policy and the administration of the Department on occasions such as this.  There are two things that struck me forcibly on this Estimate.  We must have a new outlook so far as forestry is concerned, and we must build that outlook on the principle of fair and equitable treatment for forestry workers.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  It relates to the wages of forestry workers.  These workers, although reduced as it were to the level of agricultural labourers, must yet pay a greater rate by way of national health contribution than is required from agricultural labourers. It may seem a small matter, a difference of 2d. per week, but it is not so small to the men who are-concerned.  I ask the Minister to take steps to have that complaint remedied.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here concerning unemployment in different areas.  I am one who subscribes to the view that it is the Government's duty to see that every worker who is able to work should be provided with an opportunity to do so.  Here, I believe, is one avenue whereby work can be provided <Col N="570" /> for any unemployed we may have, work of a productive nature which will enrich the country, not work of a type which will leave unwanted piles of fuel on our hands, such as we now have in the Phoenix Park.  It is work which will mean in time to come that the country will be richer than it is; it is work upon the results of which future generations can look and say that the Government responsible for it had indeed done well by the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a deliberative Assembly.  We have the right to inquire into the working of every Government Department, and, as far as it lies in our power, to give whatever help we can to the Minister with a view to greater efficiency.  There is one thing that many of us have to complain of. It is difficult for us to obtain the accurate information which we require in order to form a clear idea as to how the Department is working or what it ought to set out to achieve.  Some time ago I asked the Minister a question, and I must apologise for asking a question at a time when the Minister was so new in office&mdash;I think he was only a week in office at the time.  I asked the question with a view to obtaining information which would enable me, and other Deputies too, I suppose, to form a clear idea of the value of the work which is being done. I asked the Minister to state the net average profit on State forests.  I did not ask for definite figures but for an approximate estimate of that profit. The Minister, in his reply, said that he could not give such an estimate as it takes from 50 to 100 years for a forest to mature, and that in any case the work of afforestation was not undertaken solely for the profit.  I quite agree with those two statements; the work of the Forestry Department is not undertaken exclusively as a commercial undertaking, but at the same time it is necessary, in order to make progress in this matter, to be able to compare the value of an acre of timber with the value of the same acre of land if it were utilised for agricultural purposes. We must remember that there will always be a considerable amount of land which can be utilised either for agricultural purposes or for planting <Col N="571" /> You have the type of high, dry land on hillsides which, with a little reclamation, a little application of fertilisers, could be turned into good grazing land. It is of little value at the present time but it could be turned into agricultural land suitable for grazing sheep.  You have to decide whether it would be better in the national interests&mdash;you have always to look at a case of this kind in the national interests&mdash;to utilise this land for sheep grazing or to utilise it for the production of timber.  If we have an accurate estimate, or rather an approximate estimate, of the value of native timber and the cost of production, we might be able to come to a decision more readily between utilising that type of land for grazing sheep or for afforestation.  But we have never got that estimate and we can never get it, I am afraid, and that is a mistake.</P>
      <P>In connection with afforestation, we do not come up against the same difficulties as the Minister and all of us come up against in the administration of the Department of Lands regarding the acquisition and division of land.  In afforestation you are dealing with a work of national development; you are seeking to provide a national asset; you are not taking property from one set of individuals to give it to another; you are taking property from its present owners to utilise it for national development.  You have not the ancient clash between the haves and the have nots, but you have, perhaps, a clash of interests between the community and an individual.  In the main, the Forestry Department have always sought to meet the existing owners in a fair and reasonable way and wherever possible to give a fair exchange to the existing owners who are dispossessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is possible to form an accurate estimate of the acreage of land which we require for afforestation. On this question we should be guided mainly&mdash;and we must be guided mainly &mdash;by national requirements, and consideration of what would be a reasonable measure of self-sufficiency in the matter of timber must be a guiding factor in deciding the acreage of timber which we are going to plant.  Having <Col N="572" /> regard to the ever increasing need for timber for various purposes, such as housing and so on, we must recognise that the acreage which the nation will require will be very substantial and that the present rate of afforestation is only tinkering with the problem.  We need not a double or a treble increase but an almost tenfold increase on the existing annual plantation.  I think that can be done but it requires a great national effort and it requires the provision of a very substantial amount of finance.  In this connection I have often wondered why it is&mdash;since the provision of State forests is the establishment of a national asset&mdash;that it is not considered desirable to borrow for the purpose of creating more State forests.  I do not know why afforestation should be paid for out of current taxation. Since we are establishing an asset that will benefit posterity, I think that it would be only right and proper that posterity should pay their share of the cost.</P>
    <P>I can readily see that there will always be difficulties, as the Minister said in his opening statement&mdash;and I know those difficulties perhaps as well as the Minister&mdash;in acquiring land and in meeting all the claims of the various people who are interested in that land. Most hill land is owned jointly by a number of owners and there is difficulty in meeting all their rival claims and even in ascertaining the number of people who have legal rights in an area of land.  With goodwill, however, and with the support of public opinion generally, I think it should be possible to move forward much more rapidly than the Department are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Department almost invariably treat existing owners fairly and I think that is only right and proper.  When you disturb a person's right of ownership and dispossess a person of his property, it is only right that he should get the full market value of that property and even in some cases some little compensation for being dispossessed.  I know in my own constituency when the Electricity Supply Board decided to acquire a large area of country for hydro-electric development, they paid the full market value of the land and compensation for <Col N="573" /> the disturbance.  It is only fair and right, proper and desirable that the policy of the Forestry Department should be to treat the existing owners fairly.</P>
    <P>There will always be a conflict of opinion with regard to what particular land is suitable for planting and what land is unsuitable.  Deputy Kennedy suggested that there is a tendency on the part of the Department not to plant on higher lands.  I am sure the Forestry Department have good grounds for any action they have taken in this matter.  I am sure they have made many tests and experiments in regard to it.  Having regard to the difficulty they have in acquiring land, they would be exceedingly foolish if they were to leave high mountainy land bare and unplanted after acquiring it.  That is a matter about which we may differ, but it is a matter which must be handled carefully.  I know that in recent years quite a number of plantations were damaged by the severe frost.  I do not know to what extent they were damaged, but I know it was fairly extensive, thus revealing the fact that everything is not plain sailing in the matter of planting trees. It is not merely a question of putting them down and they will go ahead.  A lot of things have to be considered, such as the nature and type of land and the type of plantation that is suitable. But, having regard to the enormous work that has to be undertaken and the amount of money and effort that will have to be put into it, it is essential that the work should be carried out on the most thorough and efficient lines.</P>
    <P>Farmers are often accused of being antiquated in their efforts, of failing to utilise up-to-date mechanisation.  It is only right, therefore, to draw the attention of the Minister to the desirability of the Forestry Department utilising the most modern and up-to-date methods of clearing land and of draining and fencing it.  The most modern and up-to-date machinery should be acquired.  I agree with Deputy Dunne that it is most desirable that Forestry Department workers should be well paid.  These men have to undertake work of a very strenuous <Col N="574" /> type.  It must be remembered also that many of them are highly skilled.  They have got to learn their trade over a number of years.  A man does not become a skilled forestry worker within a year or two years.  It takes quite a long time to become fully trained.  It is only right, therefore, that such men should be reasonably paid.</P>
    <P>Another matter that often struck me is that we all recognise that forestry workers, by the nature of their work, have frequently to travel long distances to work.  It is desirable, therefore, that some system of transport should be provided wherever necessary.  It is unfair to expect men to travel long distances on bicycles or to walk long distances to their work.  When they have to travel long distances by road, they should be provided with some sort of mechanical transport.  Having travelled a considerable distance by road, we all know that they often have to travel a long distance across hills to their work. So far as the road portion of the journey is concerned, they should be given means of transport.  Everything should be done to get the utmost output from the number of men engaged, and every assistance should be given to them in the way of mechanisation and also in the way of transport.  These things are necessary if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties the Department always complained of coming up against is securing a sufficiently large area for plantation in the one place.  I have commented on that in this House in the past and I think it is necessary to direct attention to the problem again.  From a national point of view and the point of view improving the general appearance of the country, we all know that it would be much better if we could have more plantations scattered about the length and breadth of the country.  It would be much better if we could secure planting in very much smaller areas than the Department at present considers economic. I know the difficulty that arises in regard to fencing and supervision. Nevertheless, the desirability of having smaller areas of plantation scattered throughout the country is so urgent that I think this problem should be <Col N="575" /> considered again.  If anything could be done to reduce the cost of fencing or to improve the method of supervision, it should be done.  You can get areas in every parish of five, ten, 20 or 30 acres which would be very useful for afforestation, but which, under the present policy of the Department, are considered uneconomic.  Yet, though the Department may consider them uneconomic, they would be better almost from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the statement made by Deputy Kennedy that the County Committee of Agriculture in Westmeath were seeking to induce the Forestry Department to take over certain woods planted by the county committee in former years.  I would be rather inclined to think that the development should be in the opposite direction, that we should be travelling more in the direction of decentralisation. I think the Forestry Department should be endeavouring to get local committees to take control of small woods.  One Deputy said that the British during their régime denuded the country completely of timber.  I do not know how far that may be true; it may be true of certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We all know, however, that what was known as the British garrison, the landlords, in many areas tried to provide for forestry.  They did provide woodlands which were very desirable. Unfortunately, in some places when the landlords were got rid of the woods were also got rid of.  I think that some kind of local organisation or committee should take the place of these big land owners in the various parishes and, with the assistance and cooperation of the Forestry Department, plant lands which were formerly planted and plant small areas which are eminently suitable for planting. There may be small areas of ten or 20 acres which the individual farmer might be unable or unwilling to plant but which a local committee could undertake to plant.  It would be a very progressive step to provide the capital for such local or district committees by way of a long-term loan, which would enable them to acquire an <Col N="576" /> area of waste land and to plant it. That would encourage local initiative. It would help local people to take an active interest in beautifying their localities.  It would encourage the local or district forestry committee to take an active interest in their own areas and it would give them a valuable asset which they could own and develop and in which they could take pride. There is no reason why that should not be done.  Of course, at present, there is a scheme whereby farmers may obtain assistance from the Forestry Department to plant up to five acres but in many cases the farmer who owns the waste land is not in a position to avail of that assistance.  A local committee, if provided with a long-term loan, could much more easily undertake it and in that way would be contributing their quota to the great work of the reafforestation of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Seán Dunne who said that the British estimated that 2,000,000 acres were available for planting in this country.  That would be a reasonable estimate and I think that amount could be secured if we were prepared to undertake the planting of the smaller areas to which I have referred.  In every parish and district there are small patches of waste land which are simply crying out for forestry, which are of very little value at present but which could be turned into a national asset.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent experiments have been carried out to test the value of low-lying lands for forestry purposes.  We all talk a lot about 5,000,000 acres of waste land.  A certain proportion of that is certainly on a high elevation and an even larger amount is boggy, low-lying land.  It is a question how much of that land could be drained and utilised for afforestation. If we are ever to reach the target of 2,000,000 acres under forests, we will have to bring in some of that land for planting.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister to do two things.  First of all, I would like him to investigate costs&mdash;costs of acquisition and maintenance generally. We, as a deliberative assembly, would like to know exactly what it costs to produce an acre of timber and the estimated <Col N="577" /> value of that timber when produced. Having got that information, we would like to think that the Department of Forestry were concentrating their energies upon reducing costs by stepping up efficiency and by cutting out unnecessary expenditure.  We all know that farmers are often blamed for the round-about and antediluvian methods they adopt on their farms.  We would like to think that the Forestry Department were adopting the most modern and most up-to-date methods. There is room for a certain amount of mechanisation in afforestation.  There is room for better organisation to eliminate waste of time in many directions. That is why I consider checking up on costs so essential.  It is only by making the Department as efficient as possible that we can hope to produce the acreage that is required, and to produce it at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to direct the Minister's attention again to the question of finance.  Some means should be found of raising the money for afforestation and it should be raised at the lowest possible rate of interest. Forestry involves a high rate of expenditure and a very long period must elapse before there is a return. It is therefore essential that the rate of interest at which the money is obtained should be as low as possible.</P>
    <P>In one of the Minority Reports of the Banking Commission it was recommended that a development commission should be set up which should have power to raise the money required for development work, including afforestation, by the issue of credit.  I do not know whether that report has been seriously examined by the present Government but I believe that afforestation is one of the types of national development work for which credit is required at the lowest possible rate of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has the assurance from all parts of the House that Dáil Eireann is very keenly interested in the development of afforestation and that any steps which he may take to expand the programme, to make the work more efficient or to create more employment will be enthusiastically supported.  At <Col N="578" /> the same time, those of us who have had experience of the administration of forestry work, as well as giving some views based on our experience, whatever their value, are in duty bound to suggest that if we are to get the best value for the country and the best return&mdash;those who are most enthusiastically in favour of afforestation will not deny that these also should be objects of our interest&mdash;we ought to approach the problem somewhat more realistically than some Deputies who are new to the House seem to view it. In the first place, we have not had very long experience of afforestation.  Reference is made from time to time to reports by English commissions, but these commissions, I suggest, cannot possibly give us the data or the evidence that is necessary to help us to come to conclusions as to what are the best courses to pursue in this matter. That can be obtained only by experience. We have had a good deal of experience now since the Irish Government was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I would suggest that if we are to obtain the best results from discussion here we must, as Deputy Moylan suggested, address ourselves to what has been accomplished and what has not been accomplished. If Deputies feel that the accomplishments have not been up to expectations and want to know the reasons why, they will have to study the question from the administrative point of view rather than from British Blue Books or criticisms by those who have no real experience of afforestation. What we do know, and what the war brought home to us in a way that nothing else could, is that it is a very serious matter for a country to find itself so completely dependent on timber imports as we found ourselves. We are still suffering from that position. In justification of the policy of making ourselves as far as possible self-supporting eventually in regard to timber, we are safe in assuming that not for a very long period of time, perhaps never again, will timber become available from North America as freely as it has been.  The forests there must be dwindling very rapidly, having regard to the demands that are being made upon them for pulp and other <Col N="579" /> purposes.  As far as Eastern Europe and the Baltic States are concerned, with the political condition of Europe and the fact that it is being severed into two blocs&mdash;which will, as present indications go, scarcely conduct normal trade relations again in the way they were accustomed to formerly&mdash;it looks as if the timber supply for the future, so necessary for our housing programme, will be considerably curtailed. Therefore, from that point of view, it seems to be extremely difficult to find the answer to those who strongly favour, as I do, going ahead as fast and as fully as we can with plans for the expansion of afforestation.</P>
    <P>As well as providing a very necessary raw material which we cannot get on without, at certain times of the year when agricultural work is slack afforestation work is of extreme value in providing employment in the rural areas. Although at the present time agriculture is in a comparatively prosperous condition, we do not know whether that will continue for a long period. We may be faced again with the situation we had after the first world war, when there was a general agricultural depression here and throughout the world.  In such circumstances, we may be very glad to find that we have large afforestation schemes which give constant employment and which, in times of such depression, are able to absorb an additional labour force.</P>
    <P>The most serious question that the forestry branch is faced with is land acquisition.  As the Minister has pointed out, unless there is a very substantial acquisition from year to year, based even on the target of 10,000 acres of plantation per year&mdash;which, in fact, has never been reached&mdash;and unless we turn our minds to building up such a reservoir as will enable that programme to be carried out and expanded over a period of years and unless we can fairly rapidly and speedily within the next three or four years expand the available pool of land, it is quite obvious that afforestation work cannot be expanded. As Deputy Moylan pointed out, the difficulty is that we have not a public opinion in this country on afforestation, an informed opinion to <Col N="580" /> strengthen the hand of the administration in going ahead with its development. We have certain people interested and enthusiastic but, as Deputy Moylan said, the country generally and especially the rural areas apart from those where there are forestry centres and where employment is given, show very little interest.  In fact, if Deputies pursue this question, they will find that there is a certain rivalry between the agricultural interests and the interests that look for more afforestation.  If we are not extremely careful in dealing with that opinion, the afforestation side will suffer.  Nearly half our population is interested directly in agriculture and unless it is brought home to them that it is to their advantage as well as to the advantage of the community in the long run, to expand afforestation in existing centres and in new centres where there is suitable land, we will not get the goodwill which is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan put his finger on the key difficulty when he pointed out that for the relief of congestion there are powers of land acquisition.  I gather that even the Minister feels that those powers may not be sufficiently drastic to enable him to do what he would like for the congests in the West.  Now, whether the powers of the Land Commission are sufficiently drastic or not, no such powers are held by the Forestry Branch.  If one asks why such powers were not sought and whether the Dáil would not have been willing to give them, the answer is that the Dáil probably would&mdash;and I feel that those powers will have to be secured in the long run.  If, however, we are going to make progress and go into new areas, where farmers are interested in mountain grazing on a large scale and where that is important to their economy, it is just not sufficient to take over those lands and say they are necessary in the national interest.  There must be a campaign in which the local interest would be fully alert to the advantages and realise that any disadvantages they might see would be overcome and set at nought by the advantages in other directions.  We have to apply ourselves to the mentality of the individual farmer who is interested in this mountain <Col N="581" /> grazing, who has been in possession of it for a very long time or who feels that he may secure it.  His legal rights may be questionable, but he feels that he could make better use of the land than the Forestry Branch.  So long as that state of affairs continues, you will have these difficulties, which have arisen not alone in the areas to which Deputy Moylan referred, but in almost every area in the eastern and southern counties, outside County Wicklow, where it was obviously good policy for the Government to acquire very large tracts of land needed for afforestation.</P>
    <P>These areas must have reasonably good land.  The land must be drained or it is not going to produce commercial timber.  It may produce scrub or something that might be described as useful from the point of view of shelter or climate, but it will not give anything like the return from the point of view of being utilised as commercial timber unless the land is reasonably good.  Unless the shelter and the elevation are suitable, good results will not be obtained.  If there is serious exposure, the land will not be suitable for afforestation, if our objective is to produce commercial timber.  Our assumption was that 600,000 acres of land under forest would be the greater part, if not the whole, of our requirements and would, in the main, enable us to be self-contained as far as wood and timber were concerned.  If you have regard to the fact that some 450,000 acres or perhaps 500,000 acres more of plantation is necessary, you will see at once that very large areas must be acquired.  It takes the same amount of legal procedure, the same amount of time, perhaps not the same amount of cost&mdash;I do not suppose that would mean anything significant&mdash;to acquire a comparatively small amount of land as it does to acquire a large amount.  At the present time, with the work of afforestation scattered throughout the country at over 100 different centres, it follows that all that makes the programme of work very difficult.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given particulars of the preliminary steps that are necessary, first of all, to ensure that from <Col N="582" /> year to year you have sufficient in the pool, and not merely sufficient to accommodate you for the coming year or coming two years, because you cannot plant exactly the mathematical proportion that you would like at each one of your 100 centres.  Each year you have to allow for a certain amount of give and take.  That means that the pool will have to be sufficient to carry out the programme as a whole for several years.  There is also the difficulty that he referred to of planning your nursery requirements.  Having regard to the fact that these young trees will be about three years when they are transplanted, that aspect of the work takes a number of years of rotational work.  Then again you have to have regard to the different species that you require.  In regard to the acquisition of land and nursery requirements, you must have in your mind the fact that you have over 100 centres in the country to deal with, as well as staff and other things.  Deputies will see, therefore, that it is not at all easy to work out a programme.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Forestry Branch is limited.  It has to get sanction from the Department of Finance from year to year for its requirements.  It is not an independent body like the Electricity Supply Board, which can raise money itself for its own purposes.  The Forestry Branch has to get sanction, so that all questions with regard to wages and other necessary things which arise in the course of administration must receive Finance sanction.  That means, perhaps, that it is not, obviously, so easy to plan a long-term programme under a Government Department.  I believe that it is not as easy as if the planning body was independent and was able, as I have said, to finance its operations in its own way.</P>
    <P>The areas that it is believed offer the greatest potentialities for the expansion of afforestation include, of course, Wicklow, which is in the premier place and which has received a good deal of attention in years past, and other mountain areas which are not too exposed such, as for example, the Slievebloom area, the Waterford area and the South Tipperary area across into Cork and Limerick, and perhaps the Blackstairs area.  Unless <Col N="583" /> some procedure is adopted by which the Minister will be empowered to schedule large tracts of land in those four or five chief areas where expansion seems most worth while, where it would be most economical and could be done most efficiently, where he has already a very large amount of planting done, where he has an organisation and where clearly it must be more economical to proceed with further work than to go to isolated centres which are small and where land is difficult to obtain, I do not think we can make progress.  If we are to have regard to the fact, which I have already emphasised, that unless the reservoir of land in the pool is sufficient at the beginning of any particular year to cover the programme for at least three or four years ahead, you will not be able to make your plans, and you will not be able to work out things in the way that you would wish, whatever the authority might be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to the question of agricultural wages and asked why should the wages of forestry workers be geared, as it has been called, to the level of agricultural wages generally.  Well, the position is that the level of agricultural wages in this country is very important from the point of view of our chief occupation and chief industry.  In the first Great War&mdash;Deputy Dunne will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;large increases of wages were secured for farm workers.  Farming was then, as it is now, in a rather prosperous condition.  Prices were high and returns were good.</P>
    <P>Farmers were not looking forward to any depression in the future and, willingly or unwillingly, they increased the wages of their workers, but, after the war when the depression came about and prices fell, it became clear to everybody, even to those responsible in the labour organisations, that you could not maintain the wage standards of the war period.  The result was that you had strife and discord and a very serious conflict indeed.  Perhaps we are not in danger of such conflicts now since we have an Agricultural Wages Board to which the farmers and their workers can go to settle their differences. At any rate, there is always the <Col N="584" /> possibility that if agricultural wages, or other wages related to them, are forced to unduly high levels, later on adjustment, if adjustment becomes necessary, will be more difficult.  It has been stated by the Minister for Finance&mdash;we have had a great deal of reference to it in the course of the Budget debates&mdash;that, unless there are very exceptional reasons, increases in wages should not be sought.  It is admitted in many countries and by many statement that where prices follow wages, the wage carner who thinks he is better off because he has got an increase may, in the end, find himself worse off because his real wage, and what he can get for it, has actually decreased.</P>
    <P>I want to state that, as far as the County Dublin, for example, is concerned, the wages of agricultural labourers in it are higher than they are elsewhere, and so are the wages of forestry workers, accordingly.  Undoubtedly, the forestry worker has a very difficult occupation.  He has to be out in the open; he suffers a great deal from wetting and exposure, but in some ways he is perhaps better off than the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that either section are as well off as we would wish them to be, but those working on the land for farmers are generally envious of those in regular employment, on either county council or other schemes, because they regard them as having certain advantages.  They work regular hours; they are in company; and they are in a position very often to secure advantages and privileges which the agricultural worker may not be in a position to get in his occupation. The agricultural worker undoubtedly feels that workers in other comparable occupations in rural areas, on local authority or Government schemes, are better off.  They have more permanent employment and more security.  Their hours are shorter, and, through their organisations, they have from time to time been enabled to improve their working conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties, in my view, so far as wage levels generally are concerned in this country, is that, under these national schemes, wages <Col N="585" /> are set up which have relation to the particular levels in Dublin, or round about it, but which are out of proportion in certain other rural areas, and I suggest that, in fixing wages, having regard to rural conditions and rural employment generally, the Forestry Branch and the Ministers responsible have had a certain amount of justification on their side.  There are two sides to the question.  You may, if you wish, take up the attitude that any organisation in this country, organised in a national way and having support throughout the country, and particularly if it is in a position to enforce its demands upon the rest of the community by withdrawing some essential service from the people, is quite entitled to do so, that that is the only way progress can be made, from the labour point of view; but I suggest that there are other larger considerations, that every section of the community must get fair play from the Government of the day and that they certainly must have regard for the interests and the economy of the farming community.</P>
    <P>If the position is that farming is to be mechanised, if we are to produce a great deal more and if it be that, with a higher level of wages, we are able to get more productivity, to get more out of the land and therefore ought to be able to pay better remuneration and give better conditions to workers on the land, then, as Deputy Cogan says, if we apply the same economics of mechanisation to afforestation or to anything else, and if we can get a greater output, a better return, there is no reason whatever why, side by side with that, working conditions should not be improved; but those who address themselves seriously to this question or to any other question of wages will have to realise, if they face the position frankly, that, as the Swedish Prime Minister said some time ago, increases in wages for any section of the community without a comparable increase in production in the industry mean nothing.  If you are to get real progress and if you are not to be faced with a position later on in which you have to retrace your steps after a good deal of trouble, confusion and perhaps dissension in the country, <Col N="586" /> you will have to examine the question of how, side by side with improving wages and working conditions, the standard of production can be improved.</P>
    <P>In the Forestry Branch, a principle was introduced which, I think, was rather valuable.  As the position of the agricultural worker and the forestry labourer, who seemed to be in competition in certain areas, was difficult of reconcilement, a device was instituted, by which, after a period of, say, three years, the forestry worker was graded as a skilled man.  His remuneration increased accordingly and he received certain increments.</P>
    <P>Through the Labour Court, the labour organisations have been able to improve their position.  Every time they went to it, they have either been able to secure increased wages or better working conditions, or both.  If they did not succeed in securing them and if they did not think it right to force the issue and compel the community to accede fully to their demands, they always had the option, which I think is one of the most valuable things about both the Labour Court and the Agricultural Wages Board, that they could go back again if conditions changed or if they were able to show that the circumstances of the times were pressing unduly upon them, and have the matter reviewed.</P>
    <P>We have then the present system of grading, having regard to agricultural wage levels in the different areas, and this principle that has been introduced of giving special recognition to men who have spent three years on forestry work.  If others in the House think that that is not the best way to approach the situation, they may have it their way, but, in my opinion, afforestation and the interests of the country generally will suffer if we do not have regard to the reactions of what we may do in respect of wages to forestry workers upon wages and conditions in agriculture generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dunne, concentrated on the conditions and pay of forestry workers and it was not my intention to dwell on that point. My idea was to deal with a few other points concerning forestry, but, in view <Col N="587" /> of the statements made by Deputy Derrig, a few words on the subject will not be out of place.  It has struck me forcibly for a long time that the old capitalist idea of supply and demand is at the root of the wage question in rural Ireland, and it seems clear from the attitude of the Government in this country in the past that they adhered to that principle.  Deputy Derrig mentioned that these workers had the right to go before the Agricultural Wages Board, but I want to say here&mdash;and I shall be surprised if Deputy Derrig and other Deputies are not aware of it&mdash;that the Agricultural Wages Board is a board packed against the workers.  Apparently, the trouble was that, if a higher rate of wages and better conditions were given to forestry workers, it would interfere with agriculture.  May I now ask that is the reason why our agricultural industry at present is so far behind? If we had a little more competition, through an intensive forestry campaign, against the methods employed in agriculture, perhaps agriculture would not be to-day in the deplorable condition in which we find it.  I leave the question of wages with that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the Estimates there are a few points that strike me&mdash;the question of salary for the director and the question of salaries for the inspectors and mapping staff.  I do not have to say that I am not objecting to the salaries these officials are getting but there is just one remark I wish to make on the question of the mapping staff. The word &ldquo;forest&rdquo; has been frequently used in this debate.  I believe that after all the years of self-government in this country we are in a forest of bewilderment.  Progress for the last 25 or 26 years in connection with reafforestation certainly cannot be said to have been on any extensive scale in this country.  Deputy Moylan may point out&mdash;in justice to him perhaps I should say he is right&mdash;the difficulties that arose in the last few years but Deputy Moylan cannot say that these self-same difficulties faced the Department, and above all the responsible Minister, in the years before the war. I condemn not alone Fianna Fáil but the Government which preceded them <Col N="588" /> for their attitude towards reafforestation. Many Deputies here have spoken about drainage, a very important subject in itself, but do they realise that, no matter how many million pounds we spend in connection with drainage schemes, unless we are going to put the land surrounding these valleys and rivers under timber, within a number of years we shall again be faced, through continuous downfalls forcing the soil from these woodland areas into the adjoining rivers thereby causing further silting, with more flooding which will eventually mean the expenditure of further considerable sums for drainage purposes?</P>
    <P>The Minister in opening the debate mentioned one matter and I wonder whether it indicated another point upon which we are going to disagree. I refer to his statement that nothing under 300 acres would be worth taking over.  I believe that has been the policy in the past but I sincerely hope it is not going to be the policy of the present Minister.  In South Cork, we have large tracts of land which are fit for reafforestation.  The late Deputy Hugo Flinn, God rest his soul, in the course of an election campaign in the Donoughmore district, referred to the necessity for planting the Baurahauring area.  In justice to him, let it be said that he sent an inspector there after the election but, of course, what was not surprising, the report of the inspector was that the soil was not suitable.  It is strange that the soil was suitable in years gone by for the growing of timber.  Since our own native Government took power, the soil has altered so much that it is not now suitable for growing timber.  I know that during the last five or six years when timber was cut down in many areas there was a price fixed for standing timber of about 7/6 per ton, but I say openly here in this House that the owners of this timber charged as much as 22/- and 23/- per ton for it.  The people had to pay that price for it, they had no alternative because they were in areas where they were unable to get turf plots and they had to depend on timber for fuel.  The owners of these wooded areas, after making fabulous charges for the timber &mdash;and I say openly that the prices were <Col N="589" /> fabulous&mdash;were assisted to replant these areas.  That is again where the joke is continued.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this matter in the Budget debate and, though at all times I dislike repeating myself, I still consider this subject of such importance that I think it right to concentrate on it.  I remember speaking to a man some time ago who had experience of afforestation in Germany.  This man informed me that during the 1914 war prisoners of war were employed at cutting timber in the forests.  When the trees were felled, the men had to lift the roots from the soil and the roots were sold at a cheap rate locally. Before the replanting process was undertaken, the ground had to be prepared practically as carefully as we here in this country would prepare a kitchen garden.  Here in the Twenty-Six Counties, or in South Cork at any rate, certain people, after getting three times the price to which they were entitled for timber and after being subsidised in connection with replanting, paid men 5/- or 6/- per day who were occupied at the work.  They had not to lift the roots out of the ground nor did they clear the ground of briars and all sorts of dirt that encumbered the place.  No matter what Minister was in power, surely the inspectors of the Department should realise that it is part of their duty to see that the owners of these woodlands should be forced to ensure that the planting of the young saplings was carried out under proper conditions.  It is true that the first four or five years are the most important part of the life of the young tree, and when we consider that these roots were left in the ground, within a foot or two of the young saplings, we can quite realise that when these young trees or saplings come to maturity as timber they will be fit for nothing else but firewood.  They are bound to be warped.  The presence of briars and all sorts of dirt choking the young trees will ensure that the trees will never mature to timber of proper quality.  All that is going on and nothing is said about it.</P>
    <P>In this country we have but 1 per cent. of our total area under timber. We may say a lot about England.  We <Col N="590" /> know that England is an industrial country and yet in England to-day there is up to or over 7 per cent. of the land under timber.  Further they have now a special forestry commission set up to acquire land and to abolish a lot of the red tape that probably existed there in the past and that exists here to-day.  I hope that the Minister will do all in his power here to cut out red tape.  In France there is 18 per cent. of the land under timber. Deputy Derrig mentioned the question of climatic conditions.  Is it not strange that climatic conditions should hinder afforestation here, when we realise that in northern countries like Sweden there is 22 or 23 per cent. of the area under timber?  In Finland, another northern country whose climatic conditions are not as favourable for the growing of timber as ours are, there is 40 per cent. of the land under timber. Yet Deputies stand up here and say we are progressing in the year 1948 when we have 1 per cent. of our area under timber.  We see land in South Cork which is valued at the present time at about 3/- per acre.  If that land were put under timber in not so many years it would average from £23 to £25 per acre for valuation purposes. Would not that be an advantage to the State?  Surely all these factors should be taken into consideration when we consider the subject of afforestation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area under afforestation, I know that in my constituency in Cork there are huge tracts covered in furze and gorse.  To anyone with a poetic mind gorse in bloom in summertime may be a very pretty thing, but it is very little consolation to the unemployed in rural Ireland who are writing to Deputies in this House every other day asking if there is any hope of work.  It is small consolation to them to tell them we are waiting for the bloom to go off the gorse and that we shall then concentrate on giving them employment on reafforestation work.  The experts may tell us that it is not profitable to plant an area under 300 acres.  Perhaps I am a poor judge in matters like this, but I would tell the experts that more than book learning is required.  Experience can teach too.  In order to find <Col N="591" /> out whether timber growing is profitable on areas of less than 300 acres, we must ask some questions.  Do the experts realise the amount of work that would be provided in the rural areas in preparing the ground and in the growing of timber?  Do they realise that employment given in that way could effect a saving to the State in regard to the labour exchanges?  Do they realise that for the money paid on that employment a dividend will accrue in the future?  Do they realise that large tracts of land could be brought up for valuation purposes to £23 or £24 per acre per annum?  Do they realise that at present in Sweden afforestation, and the industries allied to it, are giving employment to many people, while here in Ireland we are giving employment to a miserable 4,000?</P>
    <P>I say to these experts that afforestation must be considered as a subject vastly different from anything that has been considered by our Government up to this.  It is in a vastly different position from that of the industrialist in Cork or Dublin who, when he considers any outlay made by him, considers how long he must wait until he reaps a return plus a profit on his outlay. We cannot look for a quick return on timber growing.  The importance of afforestation is not whether it will bring an advantage to us.  We are something passing.  At some stage we will cease to be members of this House. But we have a duty as Deputies in regard to the future.  We cannot reap a reward but the nation as a whole will reap a reward in the years to come.  It is for the future that we plan and it is to the future we must look. I ask the Minister to concentrate as much of his attention as possible on this question of reafforestation.  By afforestation we can build up agriculture. It is because agriculture has had no competition in the past that it has failed so miserably.  We have only ourselves to blame for that.</P>
    <P>I know that Corkmen are supposed to be very loyal to their own but, as a Corkman, I have to admit that a Corkman failed as Minister for Lands.</P>

      <P>The first thing I would like to do is to express my appreciation and gratitude to the Department for what they have done in those areas in which I am interested which run from Carrick along the banks of the Suir to Clonmel and on to Waterford. Afforestation has been carried out in these areas most successfully.  I am surprised that one Party in this House has shown so little interest in this Estimate.  My experience was that when we were keen on seeing a policy carried out and when we were anxious to have something done we made it our business to be here when the appropriate Estimate was under discussion. To-day there has been an almost complete absence from the House of members of the Clann na Poblachta Party, although that was the Party that said it would plant something like 1,000,000 acres of land in four or five years.  The public will take notice of their conduct in this matter.</P>

While I am on that subject I think it is necessary to comment on the speeches made by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Desmond. It is not fair to the workers themselves to be raising their hopes and giving them the idea that there is an El Dorado ahead if only they give as much trouble as they can.  The basic industry of the country is really agriculture. The farmer can pay only just as much as he is able to and, until the productivity of the land is improved or mechanisation takes place, one cannot force these boards.  They are not packed boards.  The members are very fair men representing the two interests and the agreement arrived at represents the sensible judgment of ordinary men who know their work from day to day.</P>

I do not think the Minister mentioned anything about a scheme in co-operation with the Department of Defence. During the period of the emergency, the Army was very anxious to preserve trees with as much protection as possible because they provide a very excellent form of cover for troops.  I should like to know if schemes which, I think, were in contemplation at that time are being carried out and whether this Government proposes to carry on the tree planting along such roads as the Army may require?</P>

      <Col N="595" /> In conclusion, I should like to ask if a more intensive propaganda campaign can be carried out with reference to shelter belts.

I feel, however, that the enormous value, from the point of view of the land, of having these shelter belts developed all over the country is not sufficiently brought home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few matters on which I should like to comment on this Estimate.  A question was asked by the ex-Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, as to why a certain section of employees who were employed in the Forestry Department in the Newmarket area were recently released.  It seems rather strange to think that we should have had a particular type of person in charge of four, five or six men as the case may be in this particular wood for a considerable time past.  Now we have come to the point where there are only three persons engaged in this work.  I think that this is not a good policy for the present Minister to adopt in view of the fact that every member of this House is, I am sure, interested in placing people in useful and constant employment.  I feel sure that if the Minister will go to the trouble of looking up the files in his Department he will find that some of these employees could be placed in useful and constant employment on this particular estate. We have, during the past 12 or 18 months since operations started in this district, a considerable amount of firewood piled in stacks quite convenient to the river bed.  I should like to say that in the event of a change of climate in the near future I cannot see anything else happening other than these stacks of firewood being swept away by the local river which happens to run convenient to this wood.  There is a considerable amount of work to be done on this estate, as I have already stated.  The men could be employed in clearing away the shrubbery in the wood, if the Department is anxious to have this wood replanted.</P>

We had a considerable amount of game preserved in the locality over a number of years and it became stocked as a result of the game being preserved in the wood.  The ex-Minister for Lands, or his Department, have been responsible for renting the game rights of this wood to local people.  The position now is that the game in the locality has become, in general, very slack.  I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure that the preserves are safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are all more or less amateurs in the matter of national forestry I do not think our experts will gain very much knowledge from this debate.  My view of forestry is that it is a long-term policy.  Side by side with forestry go drainage and land division.  The three go hand in hand. We cannot have a rushed forestry scheme.  It must be slow and tedious. I consider, from what I have seen while travelling throughout the country, that whatever the Forestry Department has done in the line of forestry has been well done and that it is a credit to those who did it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Meath is concerned, we have very little forestry estates there so far.  There are some, however, and they are making good headway.  We have often heard of the plains of Meath.  What forestry is there is flat-plained. Although Cromwell did drive men to &ldquo;Hell or to Connaught,&rdquo; the planters whom he settled on our lands had an eye to beauty.  I suppose that beauty was brought about by slave labour, but whether it was or not the forestry plains in Meath were very <Col N="597" /> picturesque, beautiful and good.  Their commercial value was great.  Since we got our native Government about 25 years ago and land division began to take place, those vast wooded belts and those big estates are gradually being broken up.  The woods are being denuded.  The Minister should concentrate on drainage and forestry in Meath.  Vast areas of poor quality land are there which could be taken over and earmarked for forestry.  Near where I live there are at least 300 acres of land, including bog land, which could be taken over without any trouble&mdash;in fact, they would be handed over.  I have been pressing the Land Commission for the past five or six years to make an effort in this connection, but the Minister has said that there is not enough land there.  I say that there are 300 acres there to be taken over and I would ask the Minister to take them over.  That is the Langford estate at County Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take you at your word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 300 acres there and there are fine nursery plantations.  There are nurserymen whose families have carried on the nursery business for a couple of hundred years, made a success out of it and got a good living out of it.  These men would be of immense value in getting forestry under way there.  Also in County Meath there are vast areas of decaying forest land, trees hundreds of years old decaying and new timber coming out.  The decaying timber was left there because the gentry of the day did not worry about it and they would not let any man take a sprig out of it.  Those big trees have been lying there since the big wind of 1903 and not one was removed.  Thousands of them were left to rot.  The Land Commission should not allow that type of thing to take place.  They should cut down the old forest belts and restock the land, if those in charge will not do so.  It would be good national work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a better effort made to impress on our farmers to have a little shelter belt on every farm.  There are few shelter belts on farms in the <Col N="598" /> Midlands.  Parts of the country are a wilderness for want of shelter belts.  If we could establish them all over the country they would be very useful.  If farmers could be encouraged to plant a rood or a half acre, putting in good timber, it would be of decided advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is plenty of work ahead of the Minister in connection with drainage, forestry and land division.  The three go hand in hand. I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to County Meath and especially the area I spoke of where there are 300 acres waiting to be taken over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Giles, I am not qualified to speak exhaustively on this subject, but I would like to make two points, one in particular and one in general.  The point in particular refers to the growing of ash.  My particular concern about the growing of ash is for the making of hurleys.  The Minister might say that that is a matter for the Gaelic Athletic Association, but that in itself would not be a sufficient reply.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, being one of our greatest national organisations, should merit the particular attention of this House. We must regard it also from the point of view that its outlook is so broad, it deals with every part of the country, north and south of the Border, and it goes into every parish.  For some years past hurleys have become increasingly scarce.  There are two reasons for that. We had the shortage of fuel during the war to contend with and we had also to meet the growing popularity of the game.  Within recent years hurleys have become scarce and expensive and the quality of what was available was not so good.  It is a serious problem to remedy the ash shortage that exists for the making of hurleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is worthy of mention from another point of view.  The making of hurleys is an industry of some commercial importance.  In most parts of the country, though possibly not so much in the Minister's area, but more especially in Munster, Leinster and Galway, quite a number of people find employment in the manufacture of hurleys.  Recently there has been a <Col N="599" /> dearth of hurleys and of good hurley makers.  It constitutes a serious problem for the Gaelic Athletic Association throughout the country.  I feel I would be failing in my duty if I did not impress on the Minister the desirability of paying more attention to the growing of ash.</P>
    <P>My second point is more general. The policy of afforestation is a policy for the future.  Its fruits will not be seen next year or the year after.  It is a policy which will benefit generations to come.  It cannot go hand in hand with the policy of the present Government which is a policy of retrenchment. I would impress on the members of Clann na Poblachta, who feel so keenly about afforestation and who made such lavish promises to the electorate, promises which purported to give us between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 acres of land under timber, to use all their influence with the Government to encourage afforestation and forgo their policy of retrenchment; otherwise it will be futile for them to tell the people that afforestation figures largely in their programme while at the same time the policy of retrenchment predominates among the members of the Government. If their election promises go for anything, they now have a say in the Government and it is up to them to make good those promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind afforestation, being a long-term enterprise, should be financed by posterity.  We cannot expect any return for the work involved in afforestation for quite a long period.  I suggest the Minister should ask for a considerable loan, the repayment of which should not be begun for 25 or 30 years.  By that time there would be a prospect of some return from the work involved in the planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to consider afforestation we should endeavour to make up our minds for what purpose we propose to produce timber, whether it be timber for house construction, firewood or for other purposes.  In this connection I suggest that the Minister should employ the best expert advice as to what type of timber is best suited <Col N="600" /> to our soil and climate.  I do not pretend to be an expert on timber, but at the same time, although a farmer, I have some knowledge of the qualities of timber for construction work and, furthermore, the types that will succeed, particularly in elevated positions here and there throughout the country. Deputy Lynch suggested we should concentrate on the growing of ash and I agree with him.  It seems to be very suited to our soil and climate, and, of course, its uses are very many.  But along with ash we could also grow splendid oak.  We can grow elm, larch, beech and so on, but the type we set out to grow must be influenced by the purpose for which it will be used.  If we seek poles and so on, larch makes a very good tree for that purpose; it grows rather rapidly and will give a return in a comparatively small number of years.  It is very well suited to the elevated position.</P>
    <P>As far as the districts that are to be planted are concerned, I think that my constituency of Cavan has a considerable area that would lend itself admirably to afforestation.  There is a considerable area in the western portion of it, the congested area, which is given over largely to sheep farming. While that, of course, when it is carried out in an extensive way, gives a comparatively good yield to the people who are engaged in it, it is a more or less precarious livelihood.  In the storm of a year ago people there suffered very considerable loss and many of them were practically put out of business through the losses of sheep in the snow. But if that area were developed for afforestation it would give considerable employment to the people who live there, it would be continuous during the years to come and it would help to maintain them at home.  Coupled with that, if cottage industries were developed in the home, it would maintain the people in this rather elevated position.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, expert advice should be obtained for there is no use in going headlong at any enterprise without a purpose.  If we do not, we are looking for trouble and courting failure and I would suggest that the <Col N="601" /> Minister should proceed cautiously but at the same time progressively.  It should be the aim of any country as far as possible to produce its own requirements of timber and not to be dependent on outside sources, but if we produce a type of timber which is not suitable for housing we would be wasting the energy and the finance of the country.  With those few remarks I would wish the Minister success in his enterprise of afforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have during the past two years had some slight dealings with the Forestry Department and apart from those dealings I have a certain personal knowledge of their activities in my constituency.  Labouring under the difficulties that they have laboured under in recent years, I believe that the Forestry Department have been doing and are doing a good job of work, but there are one or two suggestions which I have to make.</P>
      <P>Some speakers here this evening have suggested that posterity should pay for reafforestation and I quite agree with that.  I think that we are only fiddling with the job at the moment and the reason is that with all the other demands on the national purse sufficient money is not forthcoming for reafforestation.  I think that the way we should approach that matter is this.  We in our generation and in the next generation, too, are not going to receive any benefit from the reafforestation which is going on at the present time, but we are building up by reafforestation a growing asset and a permanent asset to the country, an asset increasing in value year by year.  I would recommend some scheme of finance under which what might seem to be an unreasonable sum perhaps with regard to other services would be forthcoming in such a way that the burden of the money would rest on the generation which would reap the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which I would like to refer is the question of reafforestation by private individuals.  It should be obvious, and I think everyone would agree, that the Forestry Department in its own activities is suffering under a certain amount of <Col N="602" /> difficulties.  The lot of the private owner of land which, whether he likes it or not, involves reafforestation, is very much harder, and I would like to see a development brought about, and I do not care how it is brought about, for the Department to evolve a scheme under which the private owner would be facilities in his reafforestation without damaging in any way the resources of the country.  One instance is the question of young trees and plants for replanting.  The Forestry Department, as such, grow their own trees.  They have them ready at a selected centre and they transport them to an already prepared planting ground, but the private owner is in the position of having to go round from nurseryman to nurseryman in order to obtain these trees.  I understand that the reason for that is that the Department, as such, does not wish to compete with the nurseryman in his own business.  But I think in the case of a man who cuts trees and who is obliged to replant a certain number laid down by the Department, the Department should be in a position not only to tender advice but to supply at a reasonable price trees in place of those which were cut down.</P>
    <P>A third matter which I should like to refer to is that I would like to see attached to the Forestry Department &mdash;I do not know if that would be the Department proper to have it attached to, it might more properly be attached to some other Department&mdash;a scientific section applying its energies to the question of the chemical treatment of woods.  I understand that in countries like Sweden, Norway and other countries in northern latitudes where timber is good and plentiful, as a result of scientific research a considerable amount of synthetic materials have come into being from the chemical treatment of timber, not necessarily high-grade timber but even from low-grade timber.  We are only at the outset of this research, but as a result of the war and since the war, it has made enormous strides.  I have seen specimens of timber treated with chemical injections which had almost the appearance, the durability and the hardness of metal.  Deputy Desmond <Col N="603" /> referred to the number of people who are employed in factories in Sweden manufacturing articles, the basic material for which is timber, either sawdust or timber treated in its raw state with chemicals.  I think we would be well advised to devote a certain amount of research to that subject.  It is all very well to say that we should call in experts from other countries to advise us on the matter but that is not a correct approach as our climate is different and even the trees of the same kind that will grow here vary in quality from the trees that grow in these countries.  We should set up some sort of inquiry to find out how we can apply these chemical and scientific discoveries in connection with turning what might be otherwise timber of very little use into very solid materials for the purpose of building and so forth.  Such an inquiry, first of all, should be in the direction of ascertaining how we could, according to the way timber is being treated abroad, treat the timber that we actually can grow here successfully.</P>
    <P>We might, as a result of this inquiry, discover that this soil could produce something that belongs to the category of timber&mdash;it might be a shrub or a large-size tree&mdash;which is being grown very much abroad at present and which might be a basic substance for the production of the material which is generally known under the head of plastics. I urge the Minister to look into that suggestion.  We might find that we have ready at hand here a source of wealth which would provide us with employment and with use for our soil and, in addition to that, might provide us with very valuable raw materials for our building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to debates in this House for 21 years on the question of forestry and to all kinds of suggestions with a view to seeing if we could get reafforestation going at some pace that would be satisfactory. I remember shortly after the 1914-18 war the comments that were made by the people as to the extent to which timber had been taken out of this country during that period.  I remember <Col N="604" /> seeing small mountains completely denuded of timber.  Since native Government was established here, I believe approach has been made with a view to seeing how this job can best be done. A realistic approach has to be made in the matter.  First of all, we have to decide what type of timber is most suitable to our soil and the type of timber which, in addition to being suitable for the soil, will be suitable for the use of the people.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies spoke of subsidiary industries.  I have a distinct recollection that at the last election the discussion on reafforestation reached its crescendo when it was adopted as one of the main planks of the Clann na Poblachta Party.  I heard numbers of their speakers dealing with the matter and I read an immense amount of literature about it.  I actually saw a film by which this matter was brought to the notice of the people with the greatest insistence.  From the attitude of Clann na Poblachta then, I was expecting that on this Vote in this House there would be a full muster of the Party and that they would tell us what was said by some of their spokesmen both here and abroad, that not alone were they going to have a sufficiency of timber in this country to meet all requirements, but that they were going to produce petrol from the additional amount of timber that would be available as a result of their policy.  Now we find on this Estimate, dealing with one of the most important planks of their platform, that the House is denuded of Clann na Poblachta spokesmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Clann na Poblachta was one of those Parties who drew the attention of the public outside to the fact that these benches were not always filled.  The spokesmen of Clann na Poblachta who made these statements did not know then that Deputies have an immense amount of work to do in the Library, in the writing rooms, and in interviewing people outside the House.  Now they find themselves in the same boat as we are&mdash;that we cannot attend to our duties as Deputies <Col N="605" /> if we devote all our time to sitting here listening to or taking part in debates, whether we know something about the subject matter or not.</P>
      <P>I have given a great deal of thought to this matter of reafforestation.  At one time in our Party we had a Deputy who is now dead&mdash;the late Deputy Dowdall&mdash;who devoted practically all his spare time to this problem and actually was instrumental in having a book published on this matter about which he felt so keenly.  I also know that the Department of Forestry did employ an expert from the Continent with a view to seeing what assistance could be got from that particular officer who was on loan to us from another Government, and who was one of the leading experts in Europe on afforestation.  He was here for many years and did a great deal of valuable work.  I also know, like other Deputies who speak quite fairly on this subject no matter what Party they belong to, that if we travel through the country we shall find here and there distinct evidence of the attempts made to deal with this problem.  One can see in parts of Wicklow young forests growing up, not to a great extent, I agree.  Reafforestation, as I understand the problem, having listened to debates on it here for 21 years, involves a very serious problem.  On the one hand, we have land hunger.  We have a great many people whose needs have to be met by allocating to them a sufficiency of land to give them an economic holding out of which they can make a livelihood.  These people will not tolerate land suitable for farming being put aside for the growing of trees.  We have to limit the areas that we put under trees to land not suitable for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard some Deputies talking about putting the cost on posterity.  I think it was Deputy O'Leary who suggested that the Minister should try to get the Minister for Finance to agree to borrow money for this purpose which would be repayable 25 years from now.  We have a duty to posterity. That reminds me of the gentleman travelling in the East who saw an old native planting a date tree and said to him: &ldquo;Why are you planting this date <Col N="606" /> tree?&rdquo;  The old man replied: &ldquo;Why should I not plant it?&rdquo;  The gentleman said: &ldquo;You will not get dates from it for 40 years and you will not be alive then.&rdquo;  To this the old man replied: &ldquo;I ate dates off trees my father planted when he was an old man.&rdquo;  In the same way, we have been handed down a country which past generations suffered to preserve and we have a responsibility to posterity.  In our generation we must, even at a cost to ourselves, make provision for the future welfare of the people.  We spend large sums of money on education; we make provision for old people. Yet we seem to think that in this matter we should separate the present generation from future generations and say: &ldquo;We will do it properly but, if we do it properly, we must put the charge on the backs of the people in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that the Forestry Department is doing the best it can, taking into account all the circumstances.  I think the Clann na Poblachta afforestation policy will have to be changed considerably, because if we are to take their idea of planting with a view to having such a sufficiency of trees that we will have raw material for paper and the production of industrial alcohol, then I think the Minister for Agriculture will have to consider changing his policy to make room for that.  We have to do it within the possibilities.  The Department of Agriculture must consider this matter in line with what Deputy Sir John Esmonde has said.  You cannot go at this work like a bull in a china shop and leave the mistakes of to-day to be discovered in 40 years time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sir John Esmonde that this question must be considered from a variety of aspects, and I commend to the Minister the aspect he has put before the House, namely that there must be a highly scientific approach.  People who have been considering this matter will probably agree with that point of view. The Department of Forestry must find suitable land in various districts.  It has to consider planting from a variety of aspects, including the provision of shelter belts.  Nobody would welcome <Col N="607" /> an accelerated pace in reafforestation more than the members on this side of the House but, as time goes on, we are forced to recognise that there is a limit to the acreage that can be planted each year and that there must be a very careful investigation each year of the plantations of previous years so as to profit in each succeeding year from the mistakes made, with the best intentions, in the earliest years.</P>
    <P>I recognise that certain types of industries can be developed from afforestation, but not the magnificent schemes we heard about during the election.  In the thinning-out process timber should not be wasted.  Use should be found for it which would give local employment.  On the Continent, particularly in Germany, in pre-war days, where there were a considerable amount of forestry operations, there were subsidiary industries adjacent to forest stations.  I saw them making rustic furniture, using wood which was not otherwise suitable because it was not mature, for that purpose.  They found a use for it in making garden furniture.</P>
    <P>Every side of this House, as far as I understand it, will welcome any advance that can be made but let us not pretend for one moment that miracles can be performed.  They cannot be performed.  On this particular subject whole libraries have been written but we have to come down to solid earth and, as Deputy O'Reilly said, we must consider the type of timber that is suitable to our soil and the type of timber that can be applied to some use and, as Deputy Sir John Esmonde said, we must approach the question, not so much on the advice of outside experts who have to learn the conditions here, but from the point of view of profiting from highly advanced scientific methods of dealing with the particular subject.</P>

      <P>The question of forestry has intrigued the Dáil for many years and still intrigues us.  In my opinion the question is not seriously tackled.  I do not wish to say anything harsh against the people responsible for the forestry section of the Department <Col N="608" /> of Lands.  I am sure they are imbued with the highest ideals and are anxious to make a success of their job. Not through their fault, but because of the absence of a machine in the form of legislation that would enable them to get ahead with their job, they belong at the present time, in my opinion, to the most inadequate section of a Department in this country.  They have plans but their plans, to my knowledge and experience, are antiquated and out of date and their these are not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the efforts made by past Governments in bringing experts to this country from countries wise in forestry.  I have had experience of an expert who came here to advise the Forestry Department and, while I do not wish to be harsh or to say anything unkind about the individual or the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands, I will cite this instance as an example of my experience.  I am not citing this for the first time.  I have not previously cited it in the Dáil but I gave my experience to responsible Ministers of the Government that were responsible for bringing in the expert.  We had in my constituency an area of approximately 1,000 acres.  Repeated application by the committee of agriculture to have the area planted was turned down by the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands.  The local horticulturist tried experiments in the way of shelter belts and other belts in the area and he was satisfied beyond doubt that trees could be grown successfully on over 1,000 acres of land.  Despite that effort, year after year the proposal was rejected by the Forestry Section on the grounds that the area was not suitable. An expert was brought in from outside and the then Taoiseach, with whom I discussed the matter, told me to get him down and get his advice.  Down came the expert and with him were the older officials of the Forestry Section and with me was the local horticulturist who had actually grown timber around the area for years, experimenting with shelter belts.  We arrived at the mountain side and, having made a survey, under bad weather conditions I admit, the officials returned to where I stood on the road and said: &ldquo;There <Col N="609" /> is no hope of growing timber up here; the altitude is too high on a bog basis.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is not bog.&rdquo;  I knew by the foliage growing on it that it was not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This occurred about 12 or 14 years ago.  At that stage two men came down through the fog and I said: &ldquo;Can you find us a spade?&rdquo;  They found a spade for us and they commenced to dig, and upturned a strong alluvial soil of any depth you like.  The tables were turned and the expert then said: &ldquo;With that knowledge we can grow timber on this altitude because the basis is not peat.&rdquo;  It was alluvial soil with boulders in it.  They said: &ldquo;We can grow the timber all right, but we will have to get a foundation a few hundred feet lower down to begin our shelter protection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What has been done by the Department since to acquire that area?  Not a single thing.  That area of 1,000 acres is still derelict.  Is that efficiency?  We talk about forestry and Deputy Briscoe twits Clann na Poblachta for being absent from the House, but what are we to say about such a condition of affairs as I have outlined&mdash;a position in which there are 1,000 acres of waste land and the Forestry Branch have not reached the stage of planting one tree, although horticulturists in County Leitrim have grown splendid little shelter belts, the trees in which are now growing into maturity.  If the Minister looks up the records, he will find that, as far back as 15 if not 20 years ago, representations were made by the Leitrim County Committee of Agriculture for the planting of that and other areas.  Many of the men who started the agitation, local county councillors, have since died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House another story on somewhat the same lines and I will give all the particulars to the Minister if he wishes.  In doing so, I am not blaming the responsible officials, whom I have always found efficient and helpful, but I knew from my own experience that they were helpless because they were unable to deal with problems as they arose.  Last year, I <Col N="610" /> submitted a proposal with regard to another area of about 1,000 acres.  I asked to have it investigated and said that the owners of the land were very anxious to sell at a reasonable price. After considerable delay for which the Forestry Branch was not responsible&mdash; the Department of Lands was responsible&mdash;I learnt that the Forestry Section had written again and again to the Department of Lands for a map of the area, but the Department of Lands had withheld that map for almost 12 months&mdash;the map was sent over, but the value of land had increased in the meantime.  The forestry people went down there and offered £4 per acre for the land&mdash;an entirely inadequate price at a time when the value of everything had appreciated.  There was no regard paid to the devaluation of money or the increase in the value of land.</P>
    <P>The former Minister will remember my having a discussion with him on this matter.  The land in question was semi-useful agricultural land which had been a waste from which the people had fled, but, when it got out that these people were to get £4 or £8 an acre, some local people saw the possibility of investing at that rate and bought the greater part of it.  What is the use of &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves?  There is the case of a Department which offers people £4 an acre for land at a time when such a price was absurd.  I tell the Department that they are an antiquated, antediluvian collection of people.  Let the Clann na Poblachta Deputies, if they are sincere, as I believe they are, in this matter, examine this problem and let them say to the Government: &ldquo;Between the Land Commission and the forestry people let there be some modernisation of plans and give power to the forestry people to acquire land for forestry purposes.&rdquo; If that is not done, what is the use of talking of afforestation?</P>
    <P>The Forestry Branch is out of date for the past 20 years and there never yet was a serious effort, during the lifetime of any of our Governments, to deal with forestry.  It must be remembered that we have no vast areas which can, with ease, be turned over to plantation.  The most valueless land in the country is occupied, as the <Col N="611" /> Minister ought to know, as he comes from a county as poor as my own. What about the areas of land in Mayo, Galway, Sligo and Leitrim which is not really land, but which has been used by generations of people to assist them in making a living&mdash;areas of mountain on which they graze sheep and other animals during the summer months? These are the only areas which can conceivably be made available in a large way for afforestation.</P>
    <P>These areas were utilised by our forefathers because they could find foothold nowhere else, and, as a result, we have congested areas and all the poverty that goes with them.  That problem is solving itself, and, to a large extent, has solved itself.  The people have left these areas but we still have a few people remaining there&mdash;comparatively few compared with 35 years ago.  Can the Government in planning Land Commission schemes for the future not have examined the whole question of these areas and see if it is economic to continue the expense of keeping people living on these mountain sides, people who, with their families, must ultimately go on the dole, and find out the proportion which have to be maintained on the dole?  Would it not be better business to compensate these people who may have acquired a right to graze sheep and other animals for a few months, to migrate them to the Midlands and acquire and plant these areas?  That is all they can possibly be useful for.  We talk about migration and about creating economic holdings. In the name of goodness, what is an economic holding if the idea is, as it is and has been, that we give some additional acres of land to a small farmer to bring him up from 15 acres to 25 or 30 acres or from £1 valuation up to £5 or £10?</P>
    <P>That is not tackling the problem. The idea should be to utilise the land of this country in the most economical way that it can be used for the benefit of the people.  What is the use of giving a few additional acres of waste land to a man?  The idea should be to take him out of the wastes and put him on land from which he can get some return for his labour.  The waste land <Col N="612" /> could be used for forestry purposes. The Minister is new to his office and I am sure he means well.  He should know the conditions in the poorer parts of the country.  I suggest to him that he should analyse and examine thoroughly this whole question of land division in conjunction with the question of afforestation.  I have no proposal to make to him that will solve the problem.  What the Minister is prepared to undertake now will be disclosed in this country in the next 40 or 60 years.  It cannot be done without scientific planning or with the present machinery of the Land Commission. The forestry section is being jolted by the Department of Lands, and may I say that both are antiquated, helpless and without hope.  Both need to be reformed on new lines.  The Minister should begin at the beginning and have an examination of fundamentals.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on afforestation. I first spoke in this House on the subject 20 odd years ago, but I might as well have kept my mouth shut.  I have no grand scheme to put forward now any more than I had then.  I am speaking of the situation as I see it. Speaking from experience, I do want to say that nothing will be achieved unless the Minister is prepared to reform the whole system of land division in conjunction with afforestation work.</P>

      <P>As one of the representatives of Clann na Poblachta, I ought to feel very happy that so much attention was paid in this debate to-day to Clann na Poblachta and to its policy with regard to afforestation.  The former Minister, Deputy Moylan, in his usual courteous manner referred to the programme of 1,000,000 acres that Clann na Poblachta had advocated during the general election.  He said that was an aim and an objective that could not be achieved or realised in five years.  Deputy Moylan spoke on somewhat the same lines during the general election campaign.  Not only did he prophesy that our plan was incapable of fulfilment, but he also prophesied that the Fianna Fáil Government would be the Government after the general election.  I think that Deputy Moylan is as wrong in one prophecy as he was wrong in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> While Deputy Moylan wishes this inter-Party Government well, he did say that it could be kept on the rails because there was a strong Opposition in this House.  I ask you, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, to look at the strong Opposition.  That Party did talk about the absence of some Clann na Poblachta Deputies.  I want to say that one of the matters that I have noticed since I came to this House is the considerable numbers of Deputies absent for considerable periods.  I think if the records are examined that the attendance of this small Clann na Poblachta group, since we came into the House, has been as good as that of any other Party, and certainly much better than that of the strong Opposition that we have heard of.  Not only did Deputy Moylan refer to that in a courteous way, but Deputy Little came into the House to make the same observation.  Deputy Briscoe also honoured the Chamber with his presence for a few moments to make a similar observation.  I think this House will find, as time goes on and when the records can be examined, that this small Clann na Poblachta Party will do its duty to itself and to the country in this House.  I would have preferred that that line of criticism had not been followed here to-day.  I take it that one of the reasons for this form of criticism is the fact&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming to it&mdash;that one of the reasons for this form of criticism was the active part that Clann na Poblachta took in advocating afforestation from the day it was founded.  When we examined conditions as they were in this country we found vast numbers of people unemployed; we found the emigrant ship carting away or shipping away tens of thousands of our young people, and we felt that was a loss that this nation could not sustain.  We looked around for some means whereby that unemployment could be ended and that emigration could be stopped, and, having examined many problems, we <Col N="614" /> came to the conclusion that afforestation offered the greatest possible means of ending unemployment, of abolishing forced emigration and of bringing prosperity to the country. We took this problem of afforestation seriously, believing that it would end these evils I have mentioned and, at the same time, enrich the nation.  All over the country we advocated a new approach to this problem and if our target was fixed high at 1,000,000 acres in five years it was to draw public attention to the desirability and the necessity for an active policy and programme of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This State is over 26 years in existence and, as Deputy Maguire has said, during those 26 years there have been innumerable debates in this Chamber and there has been much talk about the programme of afforestation in this House and elsewhere, but the concrete practical steps that should have been taken to establish afforestation on a proper basis were never taken.  I understand that, if 26 years ago a large area had been planted with soft-wood trees, we would now have forests capable of being converted into wood pulp, paper, cardboard and similar materials. Those forests would have employed a substantial number of people looking after them, preparing them in the first instance, and then caring for them. Then there would have been, in the period of a little over 20 years, the building of mills and factories to convert the trees into wood pulp and other materials.  The result would have been that new communities would have sprung up in the vicinity of the forest areas&mdash;new communities in which the wage earner would be in receipt of a decent wage, where there would be an opening for the sons of the workers to find employment, opportunities for those sons to get married and to start rearing families themselves.  That is how we in Clann na Poblachta approached this problem and for those purposes and those reasons.  We still believe in that policy and believe it is an absolutely vital policy if we are to get a proper grip on unemployment and emigration and do the things that ought to be done to enrich this country.  I make no apology to anyone <Col N="615" /> for having advocated that policy and that programme in many places.</P>
    <P>I understand that we are fortunate here in our director of forestry.  I am told by people who are in a position to judge that we are particularly fortunate in having available a man of his expert knowledge.  I must say I was particularly glad to know that.  If we have a person with the expert knowledge that our director of forestry has, and if we have a Minister who is determined to give that expert a chance, then we are well on the way towards the implementation of Clann na Poblachta policy.  However, I am also informed by people who are acquainted with the difficulties that face the Forestry Section, that much good work that could be done by that section is held up because of the delay in acquiring land through the Land Commission section of the Department of Lands.  Deputy Maguire has mentioned some instances, and every Deputy is aware of the delay in acquiring land compulsorily. Those delays, by running into a period of years, must inevitably restrict the work that the Forestry Section can do and would like to do.  I am quite sure the Minister has done it already, but I would suggest to him again, that he should discuss this problem with the director of forestry; and, anxious as I know he is to get on with the job, I would ask him to smooth out and crease out any difficulties that may be put in the way of afforestation by the Land Commission section of this Department.</P>
    <P>In these discussions, the general viewpoint seems to be that only waste land should be utilised.  I understand that that is a mistake and that, while a considerable quantity of land that now appears to be waste can be utilised, if afforestation is to be a success, good arable land and extensive tracts of good land will have to be acquired by the Forestry Section. Some Deputies have expressed surprise that such a thing should happen and have suggested that it would be an encroachment on the province of the Department of Agriculture if such a thing were done.  However, if afforestation is so important, if it is going to <Col N="616" /> provide employment for thousands of people who cannot otherwise find employment, if it is going to guarantee employment to the sons of those persons, if it is going to enrich the land, if it is going to help in the drainage of the land, if it is going to make the rest of our arable or agricultural land rich, then it is necessary that a certain amount of arable land be acquired and be used for afforestation purposes.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>At Question Time to-day I asked the Minister for Education:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether he is aware of the serious hardships imposed on national teachers by the delay in increasing their salaries and if he would establish the proposed arbitration board within a period of one month so that the claims of the teachers to an increase in their remuneration may be investigated, decided, and put into effect before the 1st day of October next.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To that question the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have already indicated that it is intended to set up an arbitration board to which questions relating to the salaries of national teachers may be referred, but I cannot say at present when the board is likely to be formed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I considered that answer unsatisfactory and I gave notice that I would raise it on the Adjournment.  Quite recently we discussed the Estimates for the Department of Education and the debate on those Estimates was conducted on the basis that an arbitration board would be set up.  That was the idea I had in mind during the debate and I think it was the idea that every other Deputy had who took part in the debate.  When the Minister was replying he made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On the question of salaries, Deputy Butler seemed to issue some kind of challenge that something had <Col N="617" /> been left undone in that matter. When the change of salaries was brought about at the end of 1946 it was stipulated in the provision then made that there would be a review of salary scales not later than November, 1949.  Beyond whatever special things may arise in the meantime, I have not in mind that there would be a general review of the primary teachers' salaries between this and 1949, but I have in mind that the arbitration body that would act as a permanent piece of machinery, arbitrating in matters of salary or conditions of service for the primary teachers, would be set up possibly towards the end of this year, so that there would be plenty of time to have whatever considerations that are to be reviewed fully reviewed before the period contemplated in the last scheme will have concluded and, whatever changes in conditions of service or salary are going to be introduced, the teachers will be quite clear with regard to what these are by September, 1949, so that there will be no lag in any change that will then take place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reference to that is Volume 110, No. 16 of Dáil Debates of 26th May, 1948, columns 2237 and 2238.</P>
    <P>That statement of the Minister's was like a douche of could water thrown down the backs of the teachers.  In effect it was tantamount to saying to the teachers &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  Now, the Minister is aware, as this House is aware, that the matter of teachers' salaries has been engaging the attention of most public-spirited citizens of this State for a long period.  When the teachers could not get redress in any other way they had to resort to strike action to draw attention to their grievances.  In the Estimates for the Department of Education which were debated in this House at the time of the strike there was general sympathy expressed for the claims of the teachers.  In the recent general election when the teachers took an active part in the campaign, the great majority of them, I am glad to say, on the side of Clann na Poblachta, they took that part for the purpose of bringing about a change of <Col N="618" /> Government so that the matter of their salaries would receive immediate and sympathetic consideration.  During the election campaign a circular was sent out by the teachers to the Leaders of all Parties.  To the Leader of every Party contesting that general election a question was put.  The question was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If returned, are you prepared to take steps to raise teachers' salaries to a level commensurate with their qualifications and the importance of their work?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that question the Minister, General Mulcahy, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  Not only did he answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but he stated: &ldquo;Among my other Dáil references to this matter see Dáil Debates, Vol. 96, No. 9, 27th April, 1945, columns 2643 to 2260.&rdquo;  I am not going to read the Minister's, then Deputy General Mulcahy, indictment of his predecessor for his treatment of the teachers because I would not have time to do it.  If any Deputy wants to read what the Minister, then Deputy General Mulcahy, thought about the teachers and their just claims at that time he can find it in the Dáil Debates to which I have referred.  The same question was addressed to the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Norton, and he replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It was addressed to Mr. MacBride, the Leader of my Party, and he answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  No answer was received to this circular apparently from either the Leader of Clann na Talmhan or from the Leader of National Labour.  The circular was simply acknowledged by Mr. de Valera's private secretary.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that when the strike ended in the way it did and when the teachers engaged in political action of a strong and earnest kind they did that in the belief that those promises made to them by the Leaders of these Parties were sincere and were intended.  As far as I am concerned, standing as I did on Clann na Poblachta election platforms and advocating the claims of the teachers to an increase in their remuneration, I did that honestly and sincerely believing that if there were a change of Government <Col N="619" /> the claims of the teachers would receive immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>Now, the teachers issued a leaflet drawing attention to their salaries and that leaflet has been quoted in this House, certainly by Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, because I read his contribution in the Official Debates to-day.  It has been used also by other Deputies in this House.  That would go to show that the salary scales offered to the teachers and upon which the teachers are existing at the moment are entirely inadequate. Taking into account the present-day cost of living, the maximum salary of the most efficient teacher with the longest service is very little more than £5 a week.  Everybody realises the importance of the teachers to the community.  We depend on the teachers to develop the character of our children.  We depend on the teachers to train our children and to make good citizens of them.  They take the place of the parents to a large extent.  Teachers have always been held in an honourable position in this country and it is only right that that should be so.  However, under the salary scales that are in operation at the moment and that have been in operation for some time past many teachers are unable to meet their obligations. Many teachers are unable to pay their way.  Many of them are existing on money that they have borrowed from their friends, relatives, or somebody else.  I know many cases of teachers with young families who in the years before the war were able to pay a small deposit on a house; who had received the balance of the money from a building society; who had stinted themselves repaying the amounts that were due on these building society loans and who, through the increase in their cost of living, were compelled either to sell their houses or to remortgage them for a higher mortgage and pay off out of the proceeds the smaller one.  That in turn put them in the position of having greater expenditure.</P>
    <P>When a person, no matter what walk of life he may be in, goes to the trouble of establishing a home in which <Col N="620" /> to bring up his family, it is a very hard thing on him if he has to sell that home because he is not in a position to pay for it.  I think it is a scandalous thing when the person involved is a national teacher, to whom the State owes so much, that that national teacher should have to deprive himself of his home simply because the State will not pay him enough wages on which to live. There is no use blinking the fact that in the teaching profession&mdash;and nobody has put this more strongly than the Minister for Education when he was a Deputy and Leader of the Opposition &mdash;some teachers have had to borrow money from moneylenders.  That was explained to this House by Deputy General Mulcahy when he was Leader of the Opposition.  There is no doubt that in this city teachers going to their work have received threatening letters from people to whom they owed money for household bills or something else.  I am personally aware of cases where teachers have civil bill officers calling to their schools to serve civil bills on them, or the sheriff's officers calling about decrees that the sheriff wants to execute.  How can a teacher teach and look after the children committed to his care if he or she is worried in that way?  There is no doubt whatever that the position is as the Minister himself explained to this House two years ago when he was Leader of the Opposition.  The position has not improved since.  The position may even be worse to-day.  I say that to put teachers in this position is a disgrace.  For a government to do it is shameful.  I think that one of the tests of good government is the just treatment of the teachers to whom we commit our children for their care and education in their earlier years.</P>
    <P>To increase the salary of the teachers is a debt of honour to which this inter-Party Government is committed.  It is no use for the Minister to say that he will increase the salaries in 1949, in September or October.  During the period from now until October there will be many empty plates on teachers' tables.  There will be many a teacher's child going around in the winter without sufficient or adequate or proper <Col N="621" /> boots to wear.  The Parties which compose this inter-Party Government have won a general election.  We have won it through the instrumentality and the great assistance of the teachers.  I repeat that it is a debt of honour and, as far as I am concerned, I want the Government and the Minister for Education to realise and understand that that debt of honour must be repaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with that.  I should very much like to have been able to give a more satisfactory answer.  Perhaps the only point upon which I would mention disagreement with the Deputy at the present time is if he suggests that in the conduct of the debate on the Estimate I suggested otherwise than that the arbitration board would be set up at a rather later period than he expects now.  I should like to disclaim any responsibility for not putting any cards in my hand on the table during the debate on the Estimates.  I should like to emphasise that that is what I have been doing all along in these matters concerned with the teachers and that is what I want to do now.  I am grateful for the raising of this matter by Deputy Cowan.  I accept it as a kind of warning and a threat&mdash;and also from Deputy Byrne, if I interpret his interjection correctly&mdash;that he will see to it that nobody is going to be let sleep on the difficulties and disabilities under which the teachers work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all personally aware that, in so far as the rates of salaries at present in operation for the teachers are concerned, they are such that the whole teaching fraternity of the City of Dublin went on strike against them; I am not forgetting that, and I do not propose to let anybody else forget it. <Col N="622" /> I take it that Deputies are still carrying on their work in this House under the shadow of the bill that was presented to the House in the Budget and under the shadow of the discussions that have taken place on that.  I have systematically set out, in relation to the body referred to here&mdash;that is, the primary teachers&mdash;to envisage all the difficulties under which they labour, which make their work and their conditions of working unsatisfactory to them and which, so far as monetary considerations go, make their lives difficult.  I have put a certain number of things in order of precedence and I am tackling them as speedily and as effectively as I can.  Quite a number of matters that there is no necessity for me to detail now have been satisfactorily settled, and that will make it possible for the teachers to carry out their work with less friction and irritation than was possible in the past.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters that I desire particularly to deal with.  If the arbitration board were there, I would like to see it go ahead and examine the problem that exists, but before any other moneys would be spent in connection with the pay and pensions of national teachers, before there was any change in this scale, there are two matters that I would like to see money spent on.  One of these relates to the pensions of teachers. From what you see at the present time with regard to the financial position, there is no likelihood that the Minister for Finance in the current financial year will find any other substantial sums for disbursement in any way.  I hope that it will be possible for me to deal with certain proposals with regard to pensions&mdash;pensions for teachers particularly.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want money spent on which is just developing at the present time.  There would be no point in discussing it here, but if Deputies are interested in the position with regard to salaries and if they think it can be tackled in a piecemeal way, I would like them to look at document 11/46, published in September, 1946&mdash;New Scales of Salary and Other Grants for Teachers of National Schools.  There you have a <Col N="623" /> whole piece of a very intricate set of scales.</P>
    <P>There are, I know, classes among the teachers that are more adversely affected by the pressure of these scales than others are, but I cannot see any opportunity in the immediate future of going in a piecemeal kind of way into the scales that are there.  Any revision of these general scales must be left to such a body as is contemplated, when we say we will set up an arbitration board to deal with all these matters for the primary teachers in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies who are concerned with the teachers and with their general scale of pay to realise that I am in constant full and frank discussion with their representatives; that I have discussed every single matter adversely affecting the teachers, either in their work or in their pay.  I have discussed these matters in detail with them; my door is open and will remain open for constant touch on these things.</P>
    <P>There is a certain number of things which, one by one, I am dealing with. I am particularly anxious that the teachers would be satisfied with their scales of pay, because I do not think you can have the atmosphere of our schools, or the whole educational atmosphere of the country, what it ought to be, with a warm, fostering effect on our education, if we have teachers teaching in the schools who are not able to maintain themselves in their homes and who are not able to maintain their families.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cowan is in touch with individual teachers or organised teachers and will consult and consider with them what are the things that are pressing on them and what is the cost of relieving them of these difficulties, I think he will get the situation into a better perspective and there will be less danger of his misunderstanding what I, as Minister for Education, and the Government, which he and his Party support, are trying to do for the teachers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can say in reply to what the Deputy <Col N="624" /> has raised, but I would like to assure him that I am in full contact with the teachers' organisation on this particular matter and that I am quite ready to have any aspect of the problems that are there fully and frankly discussed here.  There are some things that, at the present moment, for diplomatic and other reasons, I am not able to discuss.</P>
