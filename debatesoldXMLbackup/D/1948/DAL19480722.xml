      <P>I feel a considerable amount of sympathy for the Minister in his very heavy task.  The Department of Industry and Commerce touches on many matters vital to this community.  I have often felt that it should require more than one Minister and one Parliamentary Secretary to deal with it, and, in present circumstances, where that Parliamentary Secretary is also Parliamentary Secretary to another Department, I feel that <Col N="1212" /> the position is not as satisfactory as it ought to be.  It may be suggested that, after all, over a period of years, the Department was administered in that way, but I think it will be appreciated that it is easier to build up a Department, adding additional responsibility from time to time, than to take over the whole complicated machine and get to understand it in a reasonable time. I feel that this Department is so vital that the Minister might consider some reorganisation that will necessitate the appointment of an additional Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I have been disturbed by reports that I have received from time to time in the last few months with regard to the disemployment of persons engaged in the clothing industry, particularly that section of it that deals with the manufacture of clothing.  I am told that the country has been flooded with articles of foreign manufacture and that those articles are being sold at prices against which our own industrialists cannot compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Travellers from Irish firms that have been endeavouring to build up a business and that have been endeavouring to maintain their staffs, find, in travelling through the country, that they receive no orders at all, and they are bluntly told that it is cheaper to buy goods that are extensively advertised by British firms, because the duty on those goods is apparently only 25 per cent.  Those English industrialists, I understand, for the purpose of getting business here, for the purpose of getting a market here and exporting goods here, have come to arrangements with the importers that they will bear half the duty.  As a result of that, I understand that some hundreds of trained and experienced girls in the City of Dublin have had to be dismissed within the past few months.  Not only that, but they have had to go across to England, bringing with them their technical knowledge and experience. That is a national loss; it is a tragedy, and I suggest that whatever steps are necessary, by means of increased tariffs, to protect our industries, the clothing industry in particular, should be taken so as to end the closing down of those <Col N="1213" /> businesses, the dismissal of the workers and the forced emigration of trained and experienced operatives to England.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by a firm that they are up against a difficulty such as this, that if they manufacture garments and if in the manufacture of these garments they require machined braid, they are compelled to pay a duty of 100 per cent. and if they require to use imported buttons to put on the garments, they have to pay a duty of 75 per cent., whereas if a garment is manufactured completely across in England with the braid and the buttons on it, it is imported here at a 25 per cent. duty, half of which is paid by the English exporter.  I am sure the House and the Minister will agree with me that that is an unsatisfactory position. I would ask the Minister to investigate that matter and put an end to that situation before all those businesses are closed down and the trained and experienced staffs are dismissed and forced to leave the country.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Lemass, Deputy Larkin, Deputy McQuillan and others who have appealed to the Minister to cut the loss on fuel.  I agree with them that, if the timber is allowed to remain in the dumps, it will deteriorate and become useless in a very short time.  I think if the Minister could arrange a scheme whereby all that surplus fuel could be disposed of at a price that would enable the poor in Dublin and other cities and towns to buy it between now and next winter, although it may mean the loss of considerable sums of money, it is better to face that loss now before it becomes much greater.</P>
    <P>I agree substantially with what Deputy Lemass said in regard to aviation. I have been rather worried by conditions in Aer Lingus.  I understood that when the transatlantic air service was abandoned, it might lead to the unemployment of the people who were engaged or who were about to be engaged in that service.  I understood also that there would be a reorganisation of Aer Lingus but I did not understand that that reorganisation would lead to so many dismissals from Aer Lingus.  One of the objectionable <Col N="1214" /> features in connection with those dismissals, is the dismissal of Irish ex-servicemen, men who have served in our Defence Forces right through the emergency and many of whom have served in the Defence Forces for years prior to the emergency.  In the dismissals that have taken place the general impression is that they have been singled out for dismissal in the first instance.  That is the impression of the men who have been dismissed and it is a serious matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not true but that is the impression of the men concerned.  Not only that, but I am informed that to participate in the organisation of the Irish ex-servicemen in Aer Lingus, is to leave oneself open to dismissal.  I have here in my hand a letter from a man who was employed in Aer Lingus and who served in the Army as a captain for many years.  He tells me that the Irish Federation of ex-servicemen considered it necessary last March to place before the Minister certain facts regarding the management of Aer Lingus, with particular reference to the treatment meted out to ex-servicemen.  A branch of the federation was established at the airport and he was elected chairman:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Within a few days of my election, I was called before the staff and services controller, and he informed me that he, acting on behalf of the management, had to inform me that he could not, and would not, tolerate any such association within the company.  He warned me that in view of my position in the company he might find it necessary to withdraw me from my post of administrative officer and cause me to be transferred to some other such appointment, if such existed, and if not, then it would be his duty to recommend my dismissal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This officer felt that he had a right to belong to the association and that these directions were an interference with his constitutional rights.  Particularly he objected to it in view of the fact that there did exist in the airport an ex-Royal Air Force organisation or <Col N="1215" /> association, and no action was taken against that association or organisation.</P>
    <P>I need not go into the facts in any greater detail.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was obvious to all interested parties that my time in the company was limited and this forecast was proved to be correct during the last week when I was granted three months' leave, with pay, prior to the termination of my services on the grounds of redundancy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that individual well.  I know him for a long period.  I know that he is a man of the greatest efficiency, that he is reliable and industrious and I think it is a shocking thing that he is dismissed from his employment after having been warned of his possible dismissal if he associated with the Federation of Irish ex-servicemen in Aer Lingus.  I ask the Minister again to see that this whole position in Aer Lingus is examined thoroughly.  I find the Irish ex-servicemen there perfectly reasonable.  They realise that there are certain British interests involved and that, because of that, many individuals who had no service in our Defence Forces during the emergency may have to be employed there.  What they do object to is the unfair discrimination against themselves.  That is what they object to.  Many of these people have had long experience in matters relating to air services, and it is regrettable that they should find themselves in that position of being discriminated against unfairly.</P>
    <P>Apart entirely from any other aspect, I would express my agreement with Deputy Larkin's proposition that there should be in control of Aer Lingus a management that was not a Civil Service management.  As I said in the beginning, I appreciate the big problems that face the Minister.  I know that it takes a long time to become familiar with the work of a Department, and particularly in his case he had a number of difficulties to face since taking over office.  It was for that reason that I suggested earlier that there should be another Parliamentary Secretary in that Department <Col N="1216" /> so that all these matters could be examined and investigated at the earliest possible date.  The Minister must bear the responsibility for his Department to this House, but we must realise that it is humanly impossible for one individual to make himself familiar with the hundred and one details which arise on all the different matters that come under the control of the Minister and of his Department.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has been mentioned. I feel also that the time has come when its machinery should be examined, and that there is something unsatisfactory about the position when we find that on so many matters referred to the court its decisions are not accepted.  My view over a long period has been that members of trade unions are not unreasonable.  If they are now getting the feeling that the Labour Court is there, that they just must go through it but have no great respect for its decisions, then I think the time has come for a reorganisation of its machinery.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when concluding, to inform the House of the conditions on which the bread strike was settled.  I understand that approval was given for an increase in the cost of the loaf.  I am not aware that that increase has come into operation.  The workers have received an increase in pay.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell the House on what grounds exactly the strike was settled, and how the increase in the cost to the bakers has been solved.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that an investigation is going to take place into railway matters, I do not propose to say anything other than this: that I asked the Minister a Parliamentary question some time ago as to what was the amount of the accounts outstanding in Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister felt that he was unable to give me that information.  I am informed that the accounts outstanding amount to over £80,000.  I understand that some new system of accountancy was introduced to which most railway accountants would take exception.  Under the old system the local stationmaster collected the local accounts.  He knew when a <Col N="1217" /> particular individual would be available and called on him, if necessary.  He usually called at the right time and got paid.  I understand that system has been changed, and that the accounts are now collected by members of the staff sent out from the head office. They travel to the country in a car. They arrive at a man's premises to get payment of the account and may find that he is away from home.  Several calls may have to be made in that way by those staff officers using a staff car and getting paid travelling expenses. That is one of the matters that probably may come up for examination at this inquiry.  I do not know whether it will or not, but I imagine that it should.  If by any chance it should not, I would ask the Minister to draw particular attention to this matter of accountancy and to the collection of these outstanding accounts.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter that I would like to refer to in conclusion. Just as in business, or in any other walk of life, there must be a certain amount of imagination.  I think it was Deputy Lemass who described the penny-wise pound-foolish policy as a foolish policy.  I would say that in the Government, and particularly in the Department of Industry and Commerce, there must be vision and imagination and a reasonable determination to take a chance.  Unless that is done we are going to make no progress.  I think that this House would not be unreasonable if the Minister, in any particular sphere of industry, decided to take a chance if that chance was likely to lead to substantial benefits for the country, and that there would be no severe or undue criticism if later by any chance the venture should not ultimately prove to be a success. Everything that is tackled cannot be a success.  The situation has to be judged as a whole.  I incline to the viewpoint that there is a tendency now to decide matters on a wrong basis. There is this tendency to job along, to take no risk, to take no chance.  We have often heard in regard to agriculture, that the farmers are conservative and will not adopt new methods.  That is not entirely correct, but it would appear to be the policy of the Government <Col N="1218" /> to take no chances at all, to jog along and to try to balance the Budget, to make no reasonable effort to set up new industries or to develop along new lines.  I would say to the Minister that that policy is entirely wrong; there must be a spirit of adventure even in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will give to the Department that lead that the Department needs to build up new industries, to try new methods, to make sure that there will be employment for all our people here at decent rates of wages and under decent conditions, we will see improvements, gradually, slowly, but nevertheless improvements whereas if he is not prepared to give that lead, if he is to take the line of preventing any new development, of taking no chances, then I think it will be a bad thing for the community and for the country.  In so far as he takes reasonable risks and is actuated by vision and imagination in trying to build up the industry and the employment of the country, he will have my full support and co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Estimate has been covered pretty well in a general way by Deputy Lemass and I only want to deal with it from the local point of view of Cork City.  During the recent lightning strike in Córas Iompair Éireann, great confusion was caused to many people, but I would like especially to draw the Minister's attention to the loss that was suffered by some workers in the Cork area.  The Minister is probably aware that a lot of workers in Cork City go to Rushbrooke and Haulbowline on the morning trains, and vice versa, rural workers come in to Fords, Dunlops and other places.  All these were held up without any alternative means of coming into work on the first day and suffered a loss.  The firms concerned, I believe, provided alternative transport on the second day.  I think that some action should be taken to prevent lightning strikes, especially in vital industries. We have had a fair share of them lately, and if the Minister is not in a position to take action, I would appeal to the trade unions to impose some penalty on their members who are the <Col N="1219" /> cause of these lightning strikes as they are very unfair and cause terrible hardship, especially on their own fellow trade unionists.</P>
      <P>There is also a complaint about the rent charged for meters by the Electricity Supply Board.  Surely if a man has a meter for a certain number of years he should be entitled to get it free.  I know that in Cork the gas meters are given free and I see no reason why a man should be paying rent all his life for a meter which must have been paid for very early.  I would ask the Minister to go into that matter and see if something could be done. The cost of the meters cannot be so extravagant and there should be some time limit for the payment.</P>
      <P>There is also great dissatisfaction in Cork about the delay in the change-over from D.C. to A.C.  This is a great disadvantage to people who are getting in electric appliances because most are on an A.C. basis and you cannot get them in if you are on a D.C. basis. Most of the centre of the City of Cork is on a D.C. basis still.  I had a personal experience some time ago.  There was an electric welder on the market and you could not get it if you had D.C., only if you had A.C., or else if you bought a transformer, which would be practically as dear as the welder itself.  We have had delay in hospitals in getting in new x-ray and the Electricity Supply Board have to deal with these institutions in a special way, which, I am sure, must be more costly than if they did a whole area.  I would ask the Minister, if he could, to speed up that change-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to make a statement about the coal position. There is great difficulty of late in getting proper steam coal, and undoubtedly the same amount of coal is not coming into Cork port as there was.  I would like to know if it is the policy of the Government or not to try to use up the stocks that are already there.  They have been drawing out of the stocks of American coal lately.  If the people felt that the Minister was responsible for getting in less coal recently, it would ease their minds and <Col N="1220" /> it would satisfy them to know that it was not a case of our being cut down in our allocation from across the water.</P>
    <P>I do not think that enough is being done by the tourist board for Cork.  It has done nothing as a matter of fact. We have a seaside resort at Cross-haven, 12 miles from the city, which is the only place the majority of the citizens can go to, and I think that the tourist board should cater for our own citizens as well as for visitors.  Anyone who has concerned himself with the question, knows that there is a slob right in front of that village which could be easily reclaimed, and I think that that would be a great advantage to the seaside resort.  If a little money were spent on that it could be made a beautiful place.  People go from the village out to the different bays that are very near, but the village itself could be made very attractive if that slob-land were reclaimed.</P>
    <P>I think that something more should be done at Cobh to facilitate people coming in from the liners.  We have great delays there from time to time due to the want of proper facilities. There is not proper hotel accommodation there.  The tourist board bought the Commodore Hotel and I think that they should seriously consider putting the place in order and opening it, because there is not much use in buying a place if you are not going to do it up and open it.  The harbour board and local tourist association have done everything they can in the matter of the facilities at Cobh and I think they should be helped in a more generous way by the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the tourist association should have ground-floor premises in Cork as in Dublin.  There is just as much attraction for tourists in the South as there is around Dublin and they should have ground-floor premises and let the people know that there is such a body which can give them information as to the places to visit in the immediate locality.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of many people, there are more pleasant beauty spots adjacent to Cork than to Dublin, places such as Killarney, Glengarriff, Blarney and so on, and the tourist board should <Col N="1221" /> treat Cork a little more generously than they are doing.  As I have said, Deputy Lemass and others have dealt with the matters arising on the Estimate fairly exhaustively and I merely draw these local matters to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A.P. Byrne Mr. A.P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to tell the people, preferably through this House, when he is replying, because it is very important, in the present state of the nation's economy, what steps, if any, he has taken or proposes to take to ensure reasonable quantities of meat at reasonable prices for our townspeople, while, at the same time providing a reasonable profit for the producer, the distributor and everybody else concerned with bringing the meat to our tables.  I ask him to tell the lady with her shopping bag in Moore Street why it is that she has to pay the very highest prices for the very poorest meat, while the best meat, as she reads in the papers every Wednesday evening, goes to Belgium, Holland, and the Isle of Man to bolster up the tourist trades of these countries.</P>
      <P>Since the new Government came into office, it has been quite the thing to raise questions here in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann, and I assume from that that the Minister has taken over somewhat more responsibility than the previous Minister in that respect.  I should like the Minister to tell Córas Iompair Éireann that there is not much use in his agreeing to the spending of many thousands of pounds on the tourist trade, and, in particular, on making an impression on tourists when they arrive here, if Córas Iompair Éireann are to continue to provide the type of carraiges at present provided for conveying tourists from Dun Laoghaire to Westland Row.  The majority of tourists come through Dun Laoghaire and Córas Iompair Éireann provide, for bringing them to Westland Row, the smallest and most dilapidated carriages they can find in all Ireland. They are ancient horseboxes, which in many cases are dirty and they provide no knee room for those travelling in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a short journey, I agree, but <Col N="1222" /> most of these people have travelled a long journey.  There is no room for baggage; the little racks they provide barely hold a travelling bag or overcoat and will not hold any decent-sized travelling case.  I urge the Minister to make strong representations to Córas Iompair Éireann with a view to getting them to provide decent railway carriages for these tourists, because I have heard many comments by cross-Channel visitors about the facilities, which are the laughing stock of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Estimate which has particular reference to my constituency of South Kerry, that is, the tourist trade. Killarney is internationally known and it cannot possibly cope with the numbers of visitors who wish to come there each year, and numbers have to be turned away.  Some years ago Mr. Butlin was prepared to build a first class hotel in Killarney.  The late Lord Castlerosse and he visited Dublin with the intention of getting in touch with the chairman of the tourist board, and, even though two appointments were made with him, on each occasion he failed to turn up, and so Killarney lost a hotel which it could very well do with.  I hope the Minister will do something about building a clubhouse at Killarney.  Some years ago the land was purchased and plans were prepared by the Tourist Board, but, so far, there is no clubhouse.  There is also in the vicinity of Killarney a natural landing place for aeroplanes, and I suggest that the Minister should send down some of his technicians to help the people of Killarney to put this vast field into better condition.  The people down there are quite willing to bear the cost of it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of the tourist board building luxury hotels which do not pay, it would be better if they encouraged the opening of hotels in lesser-known beauty spots.  I know very many of these places in my own area, places which have facilities for fishing, shooting and mountain climbing.  If these lesser-known places were developed, the farmers would be able to get rid of their produce on the spot.  It would perhaps be well also if farmers in these <Col N="1223" /> areas were encouraged to make the necessary provision to accommodate tourists.  It would add to their finances and I believe that, if certain types of tourists knew that such facilities were available, they would avail of them and come in their hundreds.  The tourist trade would be a big factor in enabling us to balance our national budget and improve the future of our principal industry, agriculture.  It would be better business to bring people in to consume the goods we produce rather than to have to send them by road, rail and ship, with resultant increased cost and all the risks attendant on transport over long distances.  Bringing in tourists and accommodating them in the various beauty spots would also assist local industries, such as the tweed industry.  New Zealand, France, Switzerland and other countries are all making provision for expanding their tourist trade and I think that in this country we can offer tourists something more than these countries can offer, and, in view of the shortage of dollars, everything should be done to attract American visitors.</P>
    <P>South Kerry is a non-wheat growing area owing to the unsuitability of the soil and all during the emergency and up to the present time the ration of flour and bread in that area has been inadequate, especially in the case of labourers whose work takes them a distance from home and who have to bring lunch with them.  I understand that an extra ration is given to a certain type of labourers but, even with that, in all cases the ration is insufficient. I hope that as a result of the investigation promised by the Minister in regard to subsidies that the time will come when the rationing of flour and bread will cease.  If the Minister would also consider the profits of the flour-millers, perhaps the abolition of the subsidy would not mean that there should be an increase in the price of flour.</P>
    <P>In South Kerry and in various other turf-producing areas, there are many private producers.  I trust the Minister will allow certain facilities for the sale of their turf.  For instance, if he insisted that certain institutions, hospitals, <Col N="1224" /> factories, and so on, would take a certain percentage of turf of that kind, it would enable those people, who are principally small farmers or labourers, to get a fairly good price for their turf and, consequently, to improve their standard of living.</P>
    <P>There is another question we have to complain about in South Kerry, that is, rural electrification.  A survey was made recently of the Milltown area. The response was very favourable&mdash;so much so that the installation was to receive priority.  The first installation, however, was made at Fenit, for the obvious reason that, while the response there was not as good as at Milltown, there are golf links and other things on the way from Tralee to Fenit and, perhaps, there was rather undue influence brought to bear and Fenit got the preference.  A survey was also made of Ardfert.  The response there was by no means as good as at Milltown yet the latter place has been neglected again.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter and to see that Milltown is not forgotten in the next installation of rural electrification. It is only right that South Kerry should be considered and that all the good things should not go to North Kerry.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the success of his recent mission to London.  In spite of all the difficulties he has met with since coming into office, he is dealing with all matters in such a way as to receive the support and good wishes of the majority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment in the clothing industry was the subject of one of the speeches here this morning. The Deputy referred to unemployment in and around Dublin and to consequent emigration.  The same is unfortunately true as far as clothing industries in Cork are concerned.  In recent weeks I have met several young men who have spent all their working years training to become highly skilled in the use of the intricate machines on which some of our wearing apparel is produced.  I can sympathise with any Minister for Industry and Commerce in a question like this because <Col N="1225" /> he has the problem of maintaining as many of our young people as possible in employment within the country and at the same time the problem of keeping prices at a reasonable level so as to keep the cost of living at a reasonable level.  In addition, he has to take into consideration international trading relations and the importance of not imposing offensive tariffs against people from whom we expect goods that we cannot produce ourselves.  All three considerations go hand in hand. namely, production of our own goods, maintaining prices at a reasonable level, and the imposition of tariffs.  I do urge on the Minister that he should make an immediate examination of the situation as far as unemployment in the clothing industry is concerned and that he will see to it that, if it is a case that the profits reaped by the owners of these firms are too high, that those profits will be brought down to such a level as will allow the home produced article to compete with the imported article, even if the imported article is to be subject to some tariff. Unless our own people are kept in employment at home, it will matter little in the long run if we can get imported goods at cheap rates and the cost of living comes down as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a certain element of protection given to firms over the past few years in the manufacture of goods, the raw materials necessary for which are in short supply, or the market for which is limited.  If the complaints I have received recently are justified, some of these protected firms, who owe a great debt to the State and State protection, are using that protection, not for the benefit of the people, but for a very selfish purpose in cornering the market for themselves and putting up their own profits.  I have in mind the manufacture of mirrors in this country.  Up to recently glass could be imported from many countries in Europe that was suitable for the manufacture of mirrors of all classes and quantities.  Recently two Dublin firms have got practically a monopoly in the importation of glass suitable for the manufacture of mirrors.  Unfortunately, the mirrors that they manufacture are <Col N="1226" /> of an expensive type and people in the country who want, and have a market for, mirrors of a cheaper kind, will not be supplied by the Dublin firms, who probably find the more expensive mirrors more profitable.  That has a double effect, inasmuch as the purveyor of the small mirror is being driven out of business and those who want to buy cheap mirrors cannot get them.  If the man who sells cheap mirrors wants to continue in that trade he has to import them from places like Belgium and has to pay a very high duty.  I would ask the Minister to look into that particular problem of the importation and distribution of glass suitable for the manufacture of mirrors.</P>
    <P>I received a complaint recently from employees of a very old firm of glass-cutters and manufacturers in Cork City.  They have been recently told by the people in Dublin who have been supplying glass for that purpose that they propose to cease supplying glass suitable for cutting mirrors of certain size and shape, but that they propose to supply glass already cut in these sizes.  It is now proposed to supply glass to this Cork firm, quite suitable for making mirrors for wardrobes and dressing-tables.  This firm in Cork has several men employed in cutting glass and if this Dublin firm is allowed to get away with the proposed cutting of the glass themselves, in suitable lengths and sizes, that will obviate the necessity for having it cut throughout the country and it will mean further unemployment in Cork, particularly with this firm of glass-cutters.  I would like the Minister to inquire into that matter.</P>
    <P>When materials are in short supply, I agree with the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce that all the firms should have the benefit of those materials and that mushroom firms should not be encouraged to too large an extent.  If our raw materials are in short supply, it is only fair that people with an old tradition in a particular industry, and who have had employees in that particular industry for a number of years and possibly for generations, should get the largest measure of protection.  In this respect, I have been told that a firm manufacturing steel windows in Dublin have <Col N="1227" /> been given a monopoly by the Department. Other firms who have a <i>bona fide</i> intention of starting in a similar industry are being deprived of the necessary facilities to do so.  The reason given is that the market for steel windows is not sufficient to allow of more than the old-established firms.</P>
    <P>Those who have had occasion to apply for steel windows for house building recently, know that this firm cannot meet the demand.  In Cork there is a firm which has been assembling steel windows for some time and giving a very small measure of employment. When they applied for the necessary facilities to establish this industry on a proper basis, they were told that there was a firm already in production of these windows and that it was quite sufficient to meet the demands of the trade.  Nevertheless, this small firm has on hands orders that, as a result of their not being afforded facilities by the Department, they are unable to carry out.  There is a demand in excess of what the Dublin firm can turn out.  I am sure the Minister knows the firm to which I am referring, and I would like him to look the matter up and, if this firm cannot meet the demand, see that other firms get an opportunity of making up the deficit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in his very valuable contribution to the debate, mentioned the development of shipyards, and urged the Minister to explore the possibility of developing our existing shipyards and of bringing them to a pitch where we could build ships, rather than just have a small repair service as we have at the moment.  In this connection, I would like to commend to the Minister the Rushbrooke docks near Cóbh.  All through the war everybody realised the debt we owed to the foresight that provided us with a small mercantile service.  All those Irish ships were serviced, and very well serviced, at places like Rushbrooke.  If there is any proposed extension or development of our ship repair or shipbuilding yards, I would urge the Minister to keep Rushbrooke very high in his mind, as it is entitled to priority. There is a tradition there and I am <Col N="1228" /> sure the Minister realises that that counts for a lot in any industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass urged the development of the steel industry, and in mentioning Haulbowline he mentioned that it may not be the most suitable place.  In most industries that depend for their raw materials on imports from abroad, it is well known that the best possible place to establish those industries is near the quays.  In Haulbowline you have a place right in the centre of Cork harbour.  It is an island, but the Minister could develop that particular island for the purpose of the steel industry by supplying it with better wharves and landing facilities, and then it would be ideally suited for the development of the steel industry down there.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have made an appeal to the Minister to cut the losses on the fuel that exists in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, in Cork Park, and, I am sure, in many others round the country.  I would join in urging on the Minister the desirability of that.  He said, in opening, that the coal situation seemed reasonably secure until the end of 1949, but I am sure he could hardly say the same about the world situation.  At the moment, it is anything but secure. For that reason the Minister should not only distribute, at a reasonable cost, to the poor, the present stocks he has on hands, but he should undertake to replace, at least to some extent, the stocks that are already there.  We have no guarantee that we will have peace until the end of 1949, and the Minister will be criticised in the long run if he finds that, at the end of 1949, he has no coal coming into the country and he has no fuel dumps at convenient places throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister recently on the distribution of petrol.  I understand that is primarily a matter for the petrol companies, but I think the Minister, with his guiding hand, should make sure that these companies provide proper and adequate storage facilities within the country for the petrol.  In recent months we have been particularly hit in Cork City by lack of petrol storage facilities, and there have been times <Col N="1229" /> when the industrial and commercial trade of the city have been practically crippled by lack of petrol.  As a result, there has been unemployment in garages.  For days on end petrol supplies in Cork have from time to time been absolutely nil.  Sometimes we are told there is a tanker on its way from Dublin.  It is very bad business to be depending on tankers running a shuttle service from Dublin to Cork to keep the whole south supplied with petrol. These petrol companies are given certain facilities by the State and, in return, the State should demand that they will provide sufficient storage facilities to permit of an even and constant supply of petrol for the purposes for which it is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the tourist board and its almost complete boycott of Cork.  I understand the tourist board is to expend a lot of money in the development of Youghal, which is at one extreme of the County Cork.  Strangely enough, they intend to expend far more money on the development of Tramore, which is only a very short distance from Youghal.  It is bad policy for the tourist board to be concentrating all their resources on places in close proximity to each other, putting all their eggs into the one basket so to say.  If the tourist board have money provided by the Government to spend, they should distribute it evenly throughout the country and develop seaside resorts fairly good distances apart around the whole coast. However, I hope the tourist board will not go too far with the development of these seaside resorts. A large measure of the attractiveness of our seaside resorts and countryside is due to their natural and unspoiled beauty, and I would urge on the Minister, so far as he has control over the tourist board, not to allow them to make hurdy-gurdies of our nice seaside resorts and other beauty spots. By all means develop them where necessary and bring them up to such a pitch that they will provide good facilities for our own people and for tourists, but do not go too far with it.</P>
    <P>Not so much in this debate, but in the debate on the Budget there was a long discussion about the abandonment <Col N="1230" /> of our hand-won turf scheme.  As a necessary consequence of that we have hundreds and hundreds of lorries rendered idle all over the country.  I think the Minister will admit that up to this stage he has been completely floored by the problem of how to utilise these lorries in the immediate future. He has called in an expert to go into the whole matter of transport and he has shelved this problem until the expert reports on the general transport problem.  Nevertheless, these lorries are lying idle at present.  In many cases they have been bought out of the gratuities of men who had served in the Defence Forces during the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy realises that this problem had floored my predecessor also and was handed on to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's predecessor had not much time to consider it.  I shall offer the Minister a temporary solution of that problem which he can take for what it is worth.  In the country we have about 250 main creameries, and about 750 branch creameries, making approximately 1,000 milk receiving depots in all.  I do not know whether I am exaggerating, but I think I am being rather conservative in that estimate.  I think I would be conservative also in saying that about 50 producers supply milk to each depot every day.  That would be approximately 50,000 milk suppliers.  Each of these suppliers approximately takes two hours per day to deliver his consignment of milk, totalling about 100,000 man hours per day.  I think that works out at something over 30,000,000 man hours per year.  With the present shortage of labour on the land generally, I think that drain on the possible output of agriculture is very considerable indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consider, as a temporary solution of the problem with which he is faced so far as these lorries are concerned, allotting a certain number to each of these creameries, giving priority to those men who were engaged in the transport of turf and possibly also to ex-members of the Defence Forces who <Col N="1231" /> bought lorries for that purpose.  By that means I think the Minister would be able to solve at least temporarily the problem with which he is faced in regard to these lorries.  Apart from that, as I have pointed out, he will be able to save about 30,000,000 man hours per year, which could be devoted to agricultural output.  That figure may be an exaggeration, because some of the people who deliver milk in donkey and horse carts to creameries are not capable of working on a farm. In some cases they are young people who have just left school and who are not strong enough to do heavy work on a farm.  In other cases they are elderly people or people with some disability. Nevertheless, there is a considerable loss of output on farms as a result of the present method of delivering milk to creameries.  I do not think the proposal I have made would cost the country much even if it had to be subsidised by the Minister's Department. In any event that would be made up for by the increased output from agriculture. I put the proposal to the Minister for what it is worth.  He may be able to bore holes in it and tell me it is fantastic, but it is a matter which occurred to me and I think it is worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  I appreciate the very great effort which the Minister made in connection with the recent London Trade Agreement so far as industry is concerned.  I should, however, like to stress that much remains to be done so far as the encouragement of industries in this country is concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to encourage people from the other side to come here, to give them a feeling of stability and of friendship, a feeling which, I think, has been established in the last few weeks.  We have many people unemployed in this country and that is one way by which we could solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that comes under the Minister's jurisdiction is that of the tourist board.  I have heard many comments with regard to the facilities <Col N="1232" /> provided for tourists here, some very complimentary and some not quite so complimentary.  Within the last few days I met people, some of whom had been in the South and some in the West, and I regret to say that their complaints with regard to some of the tourist board hotels seemed to me to be justified. Even though, perhaps, a hotel is graded class A it does not invariably mean that it could not have been graded class C, not to speak of class B.  Some steps will have to be taken in order to encourage tourists to come here and at the same time to ensure that when they leave us they will tell their friends of the fair do they get in our hotels.  That is not the case at present in many instances.  On the other hand, we have some hotels which were there before the tourist board was heard of and they held their own with the very best hotels in any other country.  There is a definite slip up somewhere, and it will have to be remedied.  Without in any way desiring to be scornfully critical, I think that it might be a help if, instead of having men inspecting the various hotels, lady inspectors were appointed.  They would be able to get down to rock-bottom and to ensure that the visitors would have the benefit of the things that count most to them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for a man to be a judge of this, that, and the other, but he does not always understand the small things that count.  Nevertheless, when he goes to a hotel and pays the top price, he expects just as much as anybody else.  Within the past week I have heard complaints by both men and women, some of whom were English and others Irish.  That goes to show that there is nothing personal in the complaints, and I might add that I have heard them from people of all kinds and classes.  Something should be done to ensure that in places where top prices are charged top value will be given.</P>
    <P>With regard to the seaside resorts, might I say that we want a better understanding between the tourist board and the people who run the various hotels and boarding-houses there.  There seems to be a feeling of antipathy to the tourist board in some <Col N="1233" /> cases because of the way they were treated and the way in which the inspections are made from time to time. It is quite understandable that a person should feel that her home is her kingdom, and that she has a right to run it as she feels.  Generally such a person feels that she can run it better than anybody else.  It would bring about a better understanding if these inspections could be carried out in a nicer way without a feeling of Government dictation and a sort of tyranny behind them.</P>
    <P>Without proper road services in the way of buses it is not possible for many people to visit some of our very best watering-places.  It should be remembered that proper road services are a prime encouragement to tourists.  I have in mind a place in County Waterford known as Annestown.  It is about ten miles from Tramore, yet there is no bus or rail service to it.  It is an extremely pretty place but unless one has a private car or can hire a car there is no way of getting to it.  The same remarks apply to Ardmore, which is in the west of the county.  It has a bus service of a kind on week-days but none on Sundays, and, as will be readily understood, Sunday is the very day when most people are free to visit such places.  I would ask the Minister to consider, even during the summer period, the provision of a bus service there.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister a matter which has caused a certain amount of alarm and discontent among the people in Ardmore and that is the taking over by the tourist board of a very large building which has been unoccupied for many years.  It was formerly an Irish college.  No local committee can hold a meeting there now even though applications have been made.  No local person has any say in regard to that building now.  It is lying derelict now &mdash;the window-panes broken and the slates could be blown off.  It is a complete loss to the ordinary person in Ardmore because it would have been a convenient place to hold meetings of any kind and it would have been ideal for social occasions just once in a while, as will happen in the country.  The <Col N="1234" /> people are very concerned as to what is going to happen this building.  Since there is so much talk about tourists why not turn it into a hostel as it was meant to be some years ago.</P>
    <P>In many places in my constituency which I have the honour to represent there is no sign of the rural electrification scheme of which we have heard so much and people there are now throwing their hats at it, so to speak. These people are ratepayers and taxpayers and yet they do not seem to get full value for their money as compared with other sections of the community. I would urge the Minister to speed up this scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister every success and I offer him, on behalf of my constituency and myself, our sincere congratulations on the magnificent job of work he has done up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether other Deputies find themselves in the same difficulty as I find myself in discussing this particular Estimate.  The problems which face the Minister are so intimately involved with the agricultural policy to be pursued and with certain aspects of the work of the Department of Lands that I must confess I find myself in some difficulty in discussing this Estimate separately.  At the outset I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for reasoned planning.  Criticism is often made of the present age, but it is an age in which we are subject to too much planning.  I should like to point out to the Minister the dangers inherent in our being without a definite planned idea as to the future industrial development of the nation.  I think, perhaps, that it was a pity that before decisions in connection with the turf industry were taken there was not a little more advance planning.  I know the difficulties that confront the Minister. I know and appreciate the validity of the arguments advanced for the stopping of the county council hand-won turf schemes.  I realise fully also that the decision to stop these schemes had been taken prior to the Minister's advent to office.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has a reputation both inside this House and outside it for bringing the standard of debate down to his own particular level.  I do not propose to follow.  I would urge upon the Minister the necessity, even at this late stage, for taking such steps as are necessary to provide immediately alternative employment for those disemployed as a result of the decision to abandon the turf schemes as they were previously constituted.  I appeal particularly to <Col N="1236" /> the Minister with regard to the men at present employed by Fuel Importers on the turf dumps in the Phoenix Park.  I suggest that he has a duty towards those men and that that duty is to provide them with immediate alternative employment.  I think it is a pity also that when there was a change in policy, so far as turf was concerned, the coal was permitted into the turf areas, and I would submit to the Minister that the case for banning coal in the turf areas is an unanswerable one. Similarly, I think it is the Minister's duty, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, to ensure that all local institutions throughout the country will, where feasible, use turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for pursuing a policy which will adopt turf as our national fuel.  Reference was made by Deputy Lemass to the White Paper yesterday.  I trust that in the main the recommendations in that White Paper will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points upon which the component parts of this inter-Party Government found themselves in complete agreement, on the formation of this inter-Party Government, was that State-sponsored corporations and companies should be made amenable to this House.  I understand from a reply given to a Parliamentary question by <Col N="1237" /> the Taoiseach that it is proposed to implement that particular portion of the ten-point policy agreed upon.  But I would suggest to the Minister that it is something which ought to be done speedily and something in which delay cannot be brooked.  I do not want to say anything which might make the Minister's task in any way more difficult.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects, however, of administration in some of these State-sponsored companies which call for comment from me.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, a company controlling what has become a major and important industry, is at the moment facing a very critical situation, according to my information, due to a dispute which has arisen between a section of the workers and the management. I know that as matters stand at present it is difficult, if not impossible, for the Minister to interfere beyond a certain point.  I submit that that is a situation the continuance of which cannot be tolerated.  Where we find a set of circumstances which makes it obvious that there should be interference by the Minister, I suggest that that is a cogent argument for the making of State-sponsored corporations such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, amenable to this House and subject to the control of this House.</P>
    <P>I understand that an immediate or early settlement of that dispute might possibly be effected were it not for the fact that, due to statements made by the management, the men on strike have reason to apprehend that a number of their leaders will be victimised and will not be reinstated in their employment.  I would like to take this opportunity of impressing upon the Minister the necessity for assuring the men on strike that once the award of the Labour Court is accepted there can be no question of any victimisation of any of the men on strike.  Reference was made here&mdash;I think by Deputy Cowan&mdash;to a certain set of circumstances which, he alleged, exist in Aer Lingus.  I am not in possession of the same information as Deputy Cowan, but certainly if the set of circumstances he alleges do exist, it is high time that this House gave the <Col N="1238" /> necessary power and authority to the Minister to intervene.</P>
    <P>We on these benches have never believed in a policy of unreasoned criticism of everything done by the predecessors of the present Government. During the initial years of the last Government valuable national progress was made in the field of industrial development.  An attempt was made to give this country what Arthur Griffith described as an industrial as well as an agricultural arm.  I think that in broad outline a policy of as near an approach to national selfsufficiency as possible, consistent with the maintenance of a decent standard of living, should continue to be pursued.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, he certainly gave evidence&mdash;although there were many facets and aspects of his activities with which I for one violently disagreed&mdash;that he was a hard and unremitting worker.  We in Clann na Poblachta believe that the fundamental mistake made by the previous Government in their policy of industrial development was their failure to develop those industries ancillary to our main industry, agriculture.  The Minister should shun haphazard development of samll industries necessitating the importation, not alone of raw materials, but of partly manufactured articles, and all his bias and concentration should be upon the development of those industries that are subsidiary and ancillary to our agricultural economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that there would be kept out of this debate any acrimony as regards what previous Governments did or did not do.  I honestly think that if the present Government succeed in carrying on with the industrial progress of this country half as well as the previous Government did, they will have reason to congratulate themselves&mdash;very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Davin last night speaking about the transport system, the position and condition of the transport <Col N="1239" /> system.  It is all rather amusing, particularly when I remember the condition of the transport system in 1932 and the road that was made by Deputy Davin and his colleagues down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to have the position rectified.  At that time there was grass growing on every rural platform and up through the rails at every railhead in this country.  That position was rectified.  Deputies who speak about the transport situation should remember the conditions under which transport services were run here since 1939.  There was no coal, no petrol, and everything was done practically from hand to mouth in so far as transport was concerned.  I think there is a deep debt of gratitude due to the man who succeeded in overcoming those difficulties during those years.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the transport problems of to-day&mdash;they are numerous. I think that no organised transport can cater for the rural community like the ordinary rural man with a lorry for hire.  I held that opinion always and there is no change in my attitude; only the years make me more convinced of it.  I think the war period has proved that we cannot do without a rail service. No road transport can pay or hope to cater for the amount of freight that has to be transported.  If that were all put down on the roads, then the ratepayers might as well give up the ghost.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat anxious about a statement made by the Minister as regards cement for the runways of airports. I suggest that all the cement in this country should be held for the housing of our people.  I would like to know what quantity will be available for farm buildings this year.  When that scheme was brought in here. there were complaints made by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, about the delay.  Last year he made a very scathing attack on our Minister because he had not gone ahead with that scheme.  Now he has an opportunity, together with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, and there should be no delay over the scheme this year&mdash;he can go ahead <Col N="1240" /> with it.  This thing of balancing the reduction in the price of cigarettes by withdrawing this money from the farmers is a joke.  The cement should be held for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to industries and the comments made here on them, I could take Deputies' minds back to the condition of affairs when we had our flour mills working for two days in the week, when we had all our flour imported from Britain, and when in 1933 I succeeded in reopening the flour mills in Clondullane that were closed down by the previous Government.  I could take the condition of affairs then existing in my constituency and compare it with the conditions existing to-day and I would be painting a very rosy picture.</P>
    <P>Middleton Flour Mills, which formerly worked two days a week, are now working overtime.  You have, in addition to that, a factory in Middleton giving employment to between 200 and 300 hands and a second factory has been opened there for the building of farm machinery.  In the town of Cobh, which was derelict, you have Irish Steel, Limited, working full belt and giving full employment to between 300 and 400 hands.  You have Rushbrooke Dockyard, which was derelict, now catering for the repair of our ships. In connection with those two industries alone, I should like, on behalf of my constituents, sincerely to thank the last Minister for Industry and Commerce for the work which he did and the way in which he handled the situation there.  I can say also, from my knowledge of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, that I do not think that he is going to do anything other than help out these industries to the best of his power and ability.  I am anxious to see the shipbuilding yard extended to greater capacity.  There is no doubt that there is room in this country for a shipbuilding industry.  We should go ahead with it and there is no occasion for paying the foreigner to build our ships and for sending skilled men over there to do it for us.  There is an opening undoubtedly there of which we should avail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> I had occasion here a few weeks ago to call the Minister's attention to the import quota on waterproofs.  That was an industry that had been killed by a former Government.  There are now in County Cork between 500 and 600 workers gainfully employed in that industry.  Let us go ahead with that and not go back.  That was why I drew attention to what was, after all, a very small matter, but we cannot afford to allow imports into this country of anything that can be made here with equal skill and ability.  The waterproofs manufactured in this country are second to none.  Right through my constituency or, at any rate, the constituency which I had until recently, the effects of the previous Government policy have been to put a very large number of people into gainful employment which they would not have otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am personally worried in connection with three towns that have been handed over to me in the redistribution of seats.  One is the town of Youghal which is practically in a derelict condition.  There is urgent need there for a decent heavy industry which will give employment to young men and relieve them of the necessity of flying to England for employment. In connection with that, I would appeal to the Minister to take in hands the applications he has received from the Youghal Harbour Commissioners. These people, unfortunately, have no money or no means to put their house in order, so to speak, and I am sure that when the Minister looks into the facts he will realise the necessity of relieving the situation there.  If we are to have decent conditions in that town, we must see also that a heavy industry is established there.  Practically the same condition of affairs obtains in the town of Fermoy.  That town was an old military centre and, for one reason or another, it has not got the benefit which other towns in Cork County have received.  I suggest to the Minister that when anybody calls on him looking for a suitable centre for an industry, he should be sent to those towns where unemployment is rife and where there is a crying need to provide employment for our young men, especially young <Col N="1242" /> townsmen, and so avoid the necessity of their having to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that if transport, as we view it, is to be put on to the roads, you are going to have a condition of affairs in which the ratepayers cannot maintain the roads.  It will be physically and financially impossible for them to do so.  Already their bill has been doubled and trebled, and when you are considering the transport system of the country that is one of the major matters that will have to be taken into consideration.  If there is going to be road transport, who is going to bear the burden?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane mentioned the trouble in Córas Iompair Éireann in connection with strikes.  My only worry, as chairman of the beet-growers' association, is that we should not be put in the position we were placed in last year and every other year.  When the beet is ready to go into the factory we are confronted by a strike.  Surely there are nine other months of the year in which these parties could compose their differences, if they have any differences.  I should like to issue one warning, that it is my intention, in view of the upset to farmers last year and the year before in this industry, to increase the price of beet this year to cover that danger. We are going to take out insurance policies against strikes, and add the cost of that to the price of beet.  Then they can argue about it as much as they like.  I have no intention of allowing farmers who produce 70,000 or 80,000 acres of beet to be held up. To-day it is a rail strike, to-morrow a cooks' strike, the day after that it is the fellow sweeping the yard who goes on strike and the day after that somebody else.  The result is always the same.</P>
    <P>The year's work done by the farmers is held up, and there is very little consideration for them by the gentlemen in the factories.  The farmer and his labourers are held up when the land is dry in the month of October, the most suitable time for pulling the beet.  The crop is then in fair order for getting it out.  Those men are <Col N="1243" /> held up until Christmas week, and then they have to go out and pull it in the frost and the snow, and all because of strikes in these factories. Deputy Lehane also mentioned that he was anxious to have industries based on agriculture, which is our main industry.  In that regard I have viewed with fear and trembling the advent of Deputy James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  When I arrived home on Saturday morning I had a letter from the manager of the Mitchelstown factory to say that 360 men would have to be disemployed on account of the lunatic activities of this Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am interrupted I am going to answer the interrupters.  I now want to deal with the position of the town of Cobh and the facilities that are afforded there for the unloading of vessels that cannot go upstream to Cork.  We had the spectacle there during the last few years of seeing the Liberty ships which have come over, having to wait for a high tide so as to be able to pull into the quayside and <Col N="1244" /> then unload for a couple of hours, pull out again and wait until the tide came in again, then pull in again and unload another bit, and when all that had been finished after two or three days they were able to go upstream to Cork.</P>
      <P>A proposal has been sent forward by the Cork Harbour Commissioners to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the establishment of a deep water quay there which would not alone end that position of affairs but would also facilitate passenger and freight traffic.  It would enable our liners to come alongside the quay and discharge.  This is a very important matter, and I am sure it will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am anxious to see that job undertaken and carried out.  It would put an end to the state of affairs that obtains there at present.</P>
      <P>I know that the time for discussion on this Estimate is limited.  I do not think there is anything further that I have to say.  I have felt it my duty to bring these matters to the notice of the Minister.  He is a new man in his job; he is an old member of this House and has had long experience.  It is not my intention, and I do not think I could fairly censure him for anything that has been done, except to advise him again that for heaven's sake he should put a gag on the Minister for Agriculture or choke him with butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was prepared to do all he could to encourage and foster Irish industry.  It is what one would expect from the Minister.  All of us here would like to see new Irish industries started in the country.  We know what great value they are to the nation.  I was glad to hear the Minister clarify the position in regard to industry.  I was also glad to hear Deputy Lemass make reference to some industries which he thought should be started in the country.  I am sure we all agree that Deputy Lemass was a brilliant and excellent Minister for Industry and Commerce. He was quite familiar with all aspects of industrial development.  I do not claim to have a great deal of knowledge <Col N="1245" /> about industry, but Deputy Lemass certainly possesses a wide knowledge of the history of industry and commerce.  In the course of his speech he made reference to the dockyards at Rushbrooke, where a certain number of men are employed in the repair of ships.  I see no reason why we should not have a shipbuilding yard there.  Shipbuilding, as we know, is carried out on a very extensive scale in the North of Ireland.  I see no reason why shipbuilding could not be carried out as efficiently in the South of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the fuel position.  We have a lot of turf and timber in the dumps all over the country.  As a matter of fact, we should be pleased to have this fuel. All this turf and timber was, of course, produced in the country, and big sums of State money were spent on its production. All that money circulated amongst the people.  I would appeal to the Minister not to leave that fuel too long in the dumps, because a good deal of it may go bad and there may be consequent waste.  That applies particularly to the timber.  Some of it may last for a year or two, but more of it&mdash;the soft woods&mdash;may go bad quickly and destroy other timber.  I daresay that, if the price of this timber and turf were reduced, people would be inclined to buy it.  British coal to-day is expensive, and the quantity coming into the country has been cut considerably.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there are any other points I would like to touch on, but I have no reason to believe that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce will not fulfil his obligations to this nation just as well as Deputy Lemass, and I wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to detain the House, and I certainly will not trespass on the time to any great extent, as I would not like to deprive Deputy MacEntee of the opportunity of delivering an oration on the administration of his colleague, Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I just rise to remark that, now that we have a <Col N="1246" /> new Minister for Industry and Commerce, it would be more genuine to hear from the Opposition Benches speeches pledging support to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than speeches similar to that of Deputy Corry and other speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was elected to that position and appointed by the Taoiseach last February and he will occupy that position for long and many a day.  He expects the support of the Fianna Fáil Party as well as of the Government to enable him to discharge his duties in a satisfactory and capable manner. Deputy Sheehan was quite right when he said that Deputy Lemass was a very able Minister.  I must admit that he was a very able man and a very efficient man, but I say that in the Department of Industry and Commerce to-day, equally as good a man is in charge as Deputy Lemass ever was.  He is equally capable and equally efficient.</P>
      <P>I rise to draw the Minister's attention to a few matters which I believe to be important.  I would like if he would bear in mind the various protests made in this House time and again concerning the policy of Córas Iompair Éireann in closing down branch lines throughout the country, and I am very glad that an inquiry is under way into our whole transport system.  Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, was warned of the dangers; he was warned here in this House of the results, which we have now seen come to pass, of giving a monopoly of transport to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I maintain that Córas Iompair Éireann made a blunder in the matter of transport and Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Party were responsible for it.  The issue was put to the people in the general election, and surely, if the people were so reckless, they cannot expect roses to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people were asked about the Transport Act and they were asked about the policy of Fianna Fáil and now we see that the company was <Col N="1247" /> run at over £1,000,000 loss.  This was due to a certain amount of blundering, jobbery and bad management and I am very pleased that an investigation is being held.  Córas Iompair Éireann are certainly by no means rail-minded. They are going on the roads and in my constituency a considerable number of branch lines have been closed down without any justification&mdash;the Roscrea Birr line, the Banagher-Clara line and the Portlaoighise-Mountmellick line. There is as good business for the operation of these lines to-day as there ever was.  They have mostly replaced the rail services by road services at increased charges and I consider it most unfair.  If railway lines are laid down, if the stations are there, if there is an efficient staff on the line, there is no reason in the world why the line should not be put into use and the fullest possible operation.</P>
      <P>While I am dealing with the question of transport, I would appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do something for the lorry owners.  I think that it is a deplorable state of affairs that we should have reached the stage when a man with a lorry of his own is prosecuted and fined heavily in the District Courts for carrying goods outside his licence.  This is unfair and I think it is not right.  In view of the large number of lorry owners in the country, many of whom have bought their lorries on the hire-purchase system and have not yet paid for them, these people have a genuine grievance. I think that the Minister should give sympathetic consideration to their case and do something for them.  I am thoroughly in disagreement with the severity of the fines imposed by district justices throughout the country on persons prosecuted as a result of drawing merchandise and goods in their lorries without having a merchandise plate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to draw the Minister's attention to is the development of our own coal.  In my own constituency there are a number of coalfields, especially in South Laoighis, where great employment is given and has been given.  The ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy <Col N="1248" /> Lemass, has an intimate knowledge of the coalfields in question, as he is intimately associated with the company in charge.  May I say that since the elections it is common knowledge in the district that the same company are now making no effort whatsoever to increase the output of coal in these mines.  If a person wants seven tons of coal and goes along to the mine he has to wait there with his lorry until the seven tons come up from the ground, as no supplies are laid aside. Where there was always six days' work for the men before they are now told that they must go on half-time.  A number of men have been laid off for no reason whatsoever only the directorship of the coal mines in question with which Deputy Lemass is concerned. Since the present Government came into office the men are not required, and every effort has been made to blacken the present Government by the directors of the coal mines.  I wonder that Deputy Tom O'Higgins has not brought this matter up, because he knows all this equally as well as I do. I am referring to Fleming's coal mine, and Deputy Lemass is associated with Fleming's Fireclay, which is a company similar to the company which controls these mines.  No effort has been made to keep the mines in operation or to have their output increased, and I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inquire into the management of these mines at the present time.  The miners have always been given good full-time employment, and I fail to see why, since the change of Government, the conditions of the production of coal should be changed completely or why men should be let go without any reason whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is the question of those men who have lorries and who have entered into contracts for the haulage of turf.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the possibility of giving petrol for the haulage of turf for an unlimited distance.  At the present moment many people with a contract for the haulage of turf cannot complete it.  Such a person cannot <Col N="1249" /> complete his contract if it is for a distance of over 50 miles, as he is only given petrol for a distance of 50 miles. I know hauliers in my own constituency who have contracts for 60 or 70 miles and who are unable to get an allowance of petrol from the Department of Industry and Commerce. They will get an allowance from the bog to the railway station, right enough, but there again they are held up by transport.  In any case, this method is not as efficient as if the lorries could draw direct from the bog to where the contract is.  I would ask the Minister to consider sympathetically making this limit, instead of 50 miles, 65 or 70 miles.  These men are dependent on these lorries for their livelihood and they should be encouraged to interest themselves further in turf production in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the wages paid by Bord na Móna.  In my district a number of workers are employed on Clonsast bog.  I have here the time-sheet of a worker employed at Clonsast, a man named Thomas Hibbets of Mountmellick.  This man was employed on day work, and he worked for 8¾ hours on Clonsast bog, for which he received a cheque for 1/10.</P>

      <P>It is Bord na Móna which requires to be examined.  I am handing this cheque and time sheet to the Minister, in the hope that he will make some inquiries about this man's case.  I hope he will deal with it in his reply.  If my constituents are to be employed on Clonsast bog for 8¾ hours for 1/10, they would be fools to remain in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee, at Question Time during the week, referred to turf production in my constituency in an indirect way and inquired if I was about to shirk my responsibility, so far as turf production and the action of the Minister are concerned.  I stand 100 per cent. behind the Minister.  I have never done anything I was ashamed of and I have never done anything I backed out of, and I stand 100 per cent. over the action of the Minister. That is what we have elected him to do; that is what he is doing; and this Government has implicit confidence in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to building licences, I urge the Minister to expedite the numerous applications which have <Col N="1251" /> been made for these licences.  General dissatisfaction, so far as the Department is concerned, is expressed by those who have applied for them and who have not received them.  I know of a number of cases where building licences have expired, because of the difficulty experienced by private citizens in obtaining contractors to carry out the work, and, when it was sought to get the permits renewed, there was further delay.  In the case of an expired building licence, there should be no delay in issuing a duplicate to enable the citizen to carry on with his building scheme.</P>
    <P>I am inclined, for once, to agree with Deputy Corry when he asks the Minister to see that supplies of cement are made available only for housing and farm buildings.  It is unnecessary at this stage to give building licences for cinemas, dance halls and similar places of amusement when there is such a crying need for houses.  All the available cement and other materials should be kept for the provision of houses instead of for cinemas and such buildings.  I am sure the Department follows that practice and I hope they will continue to follow it.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that in this city and in the country generally, for some weeks past, there has been a very serious shortage of cigarettes. Cigarettes are not officially controlled by the Department, and it is generally rumoured that these cigarettes are being smuggled across the Border.  I cannot say if that is true, but the Minister should inquire into it and find out the reasons for the shortage.  He should also make inquiries from the cigarette manufacturers with a view to ascertaining when they will be in a position to take on new customers. No new customers have been taken on for a number of years past, although I understand that output has been increased.  There are a number of ex-Army men and others who have gone into business and who cannot get a cigarette quota.  I wonder when it will be possible to have a general statement as to the cigarette position and as to when supplies will be made <Col N="1252" /> available for those who have gone into new businesses.  Hotels and other establishments are held up by reason of the present restricted supplies, and I say that the cigarettes must be going across the Border.  There must be some serious trafficking in these cigarettes, because there are none to be got, and we can only assume that they are going across the Border, where a greater margin of profit can be secured.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to make inquiries into the profits on motor cars.  If one examines the prices of motor cars in Great Britain as set out in the periodical <i>The Autocar</i> of 18th June, 1948, and contrasts them with prices here, one realises that somebody must be making a good thing out of it. It is a disgrace that there should be such a great difference in the prices.  I think it is a complete racket and the Minister should inquire where the profits are going, who is getting them and what is the reason for the high charges in this country.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to shipping and I understand that Irish Shipping Limited were seeking a number of new ships.  I wonder if Irish Shipping Limited have placed an order with any of the Northern Ireland shipyards for any of these ships.  If we are sincere in our desire to end Partition, there is only one way in which that happy state of affairs can be brought about, that is, through co-operation between the people on both sides of the Border. We would make no greater friendly gesture than, when we require ships, to place our orders with the Belfast shipyards.</P>
    <P>The establishment of industries in our towns is, I am aware, a matter for private enterprise, but I ask the Minister to bear in mind the requests made for the establishment of industries in three towns in my constituency, Banagher in Offaly, and Mountrath and Abbeyleix in Laoighis.  There must be a fairly large file in the Department of requests that have been made for the establishment of factories in these towns in order to give local employment. If anything can be put in the <Col N="1253" /> way of these towns I would ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I ask the Minister to inquire into the manner in which an officer of his Department got immediate promotion after the Locke Tribunal.  I understand that the Minister is the head of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that he has a good deal of responsibility as far as the staff are concerned.  I would ask him to make inquiries in his Department to ascertain if an officer of the Department, which was deeply concerned with the Locke Distillery case, which took place some months ago, has since got promotion and, if so, the reason for the promotion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane, in the course of his remarks, referred to the fact that it was one of the planks in the now dismantled platform of Clann na Poblachta to bring undertakings which he described as State-sponsored companies, that is to say, statutory undertakings, under political control and, as justification for that attitude, he referred to the fact that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann was facing a critical situation due to dispute with the workers.  He demanded here in this House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should interfere in that dispute, quite overlooking the fact that there has already been interference by <Col N="1257" /> a Minister of State in that dispute but the Minister who did interfere, and quite improperly interfered, was not the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The speech of Deputy Lehane is, I think, the strongest proof that nothing should be done to give effect to the policy of Clann na Poblachta in regard to these statutory undertakings.</P>

Here is a Deputy attempting, by political methods, to supersede and set aside the persons to whom the State, through its responsible Minister, has entrusted the care and management of a vast industrial undertaking.  The individual members of this House have little or no knowledge of the merits of the dispute to which Deputy Lehane referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has full knowledge of them and, with that knowledge, the Minister has not seen fit to intervene in this dispute.  I take it that he would have intervened if, in his judgment, the interest of the people and of the State called for it.  Yet Deputy Lehane comes in here and, fully conscious that the Minister is depending constitutionally for office on the support and votes of himself and those who sit with him in Clann na Poblachta, tries to induce the Minister to go against his own better judgment and intervene in this matter, not on behalf of the company or of the community, but on behalf of those who have defied the findings of the Labour Court on the issues in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that these attacks on <Col N="1258" /> State-sponsored companies and allegations that they are not subject to supervision and criticism are made with the object of making their administration and management subject to political control.  The Fianna Fáil Government did not establish the present system, nor did they develop the present practice.  It was not the Fianna Fáil Government which first laid down the principle that these statutory undertakings should not be subject to the day-to-day criticism and supervision of this House, but should be made responsible to a Minister who was, in turn, responsible to the House for the general conduct and management of these companies.  It was our predecessors in Cumann na nGaedheal who did that.  If the management of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is not subject to detailed discussion here, that is due to the fact that we accepted the principle laid down in the Act constituting the Electricity Supply Board. That is the model which we have followed and which, in my judgment, the State has been wise to follow, since it gave effect to a good principle, a sound principle, and the only principle upon which these statutory undertakings can be controlled and managed with due regard to the general interests of the community and to the need for efficient and economical management.</P>
    <P>There is nothing that the Minister has said which we consider objectionable. His statement rather indicated that, so far from abandoning the policy which they subjected to so much criticism and attack when in opposition, the Minister and his associates propose to continue the Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the normal industrial developments in this country.  We are also grateful to the Minister for the fact that his speech afforded us some gleam of hope that certain decisions which were taken rather hastily in regard to turf development and mineral exploration and development are likely to be reconsidered. The country has reason to be grateful to the Minister for the fact that he is now prepared to reconsider the decisions taken in relation to these matters and, perhaps, so far as mineral exploration is concerned, to revert to <Col N="1259" /> the programme which had been accepted by the Fianna Fáil Government and allow mineral exploration and development to proceed as we contemplated it should.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister referred to the present wheat situation and proceeded to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am confident that, in the coming year we will get at least enough wheat to enable the present ration to be maintained.  Without the international agreement, it is not possible precisely to forecast what the price will be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we are, three years after the termination of hostilities in Europe, and with a Government members of which, in earlier years, criticised us because in 1946, for the first time in the whole of the period that ensued upon the outbreak of the war in 1939, we were compelled to adopt a system of bread rationing.  When bread rationing had to be introduced, we listened to many complaints that the ration was insufficient, particularly for those who had to engage in heavy manual labour. Here we are, after the year 1947 has passed and when the summer of 1948 is well advanced, and all that the Minister can say in regard to these restrictions upon one of the most important elements in the staple diet of our people, is that he is confident that in the coming year we will get at least enough wheat to enable the present ration to be kept up.  I should like the House to contrast that with the announcement made in Great Britain yesterday that they have been able to abandon the rationing of bread there and remove all restrictions on bread, so as to make it now in free supply in Great Britain&mdash;a country where, in contradistinction to ours, bread was very severely rationed over a considerable number of years.  I would like the Minister to tell us how it is that the British Government is able to make this announcement at present, whereas the best we can hope for under this Government is that our present bread ration is likely to be maintained during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss at any great length the recent trade agreement <Col N="1260" /> with Great Britain, but must make a passing reference to it.  That agreement provides that our Government shall keep in close consultation with the British Government regarding grain supplies.  That is the agreement which was made on behalf of the people of the State by the members of the Government, who went over to Britain to discuss trade matters recently.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was a member of the delegation, whether before they agreed to this condition in the agreement they were informed by the representatives of the British Government that that Government had decided to abolish bread rationing in Great Britain.  The undertaking to consult with the British before purchasing grain supplies arises out of the fact that we have undertaken to limit our demand for dollars.  Consequently, this undertaking to limit our demand for dollars restricts our ability to purchase wheat.  We find that, apparently, the British are in a position to purchase all the wheat they require to give their people an uncontrolled supply of bread, while we at the same time are, apparently, in the situation that we cannot purchase enough wheat to dispense with bread rationing in this country.  Not only, apparently, can we not purchase it, but the question arises whether, even if we had the ability to purchase, it would be supplied to us even in exchange for dollars.</P>
    <P>I presume that since the British have been able to dispense with bread-rationing they have secured an increased allocation of wheat from the International Emergency Food Council. If the British have succeeded in doing that, why cannot we secure a similar increase?  Why cannot we buy enough wheat to free our people from bread-rationing? If the British Government have been able to secure wheat and are able to pay for it, why cannot we spend dollars on buying wheat for our people? Is it because of the recent trade agreement, which includes the condition to which I have referred, that our people must go short of bread, or is it because the Minister for Finance will not allow the necessary purchases of wheat to be made?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> We know, of course, that for such wheat as he is buying this year he is not paying fully.  He has decided instead to leave the burden of paying for the wheat we are consuming this year to his successors.  I am not going to refer to how the Government are going to get £2,500,000 which the Minister for Social Welfare indicated is going to be the cost of the new pensions scheme. We do know, however, that to the extent of at least £2,000,000, the Minister for Finance in his Budget announced that he would not pay for the wheat purchased this year.</P>
    <P>I think it is very important that the Minister should deal with that question, which I shall repeat again.  Why is it that, while the British are abolishing bread rationing and are apparently able to pay for the imported wheat necessary to enable them to do that and are apparently able to get that wheat in the markets of the world, that the best the Minister can tell us is that he is confident that in the coming year we shall get at least enough wheat to enable the present bread rationing to be maintained?  It is very important that we should know why that is.</P>
    <P>Last year people were talking about the insufficiency of the present bread ration to meet the dietetic requirements of those engaged on open-air work. Deputies who spoke on behalf of the agricultural labourer stressed the fact that he required a great deal more bread than those engaged in sedentary occupations in the towns and cities.  Others spoke about the need which those engaged in turf-production had for a much greater ration than those engaged in sedentary occupations.  We heard Deputy Byrne and others talking about the hardships inflicted upon dock workers and those engaged in heavy manual labour in the city because the bread ration was insufficient.  Again, I ask if the British can now free their people from the restrictions on the consumption of bread why cannot we do likewise?  There must be some answer and I think we are entitled to have it. I think we are entitled to it, particularly in view of the fact that the present Minister for Agriculture has frowned on the cultivation of wheat by <Col N="1262" /> farmers, has indicated that, so far as he is concerned, he would much rather see them producing other cereals, such as barley and oats.  Why is it that in this year the British are able to give their people all the bread they demand and our people must still be content to be rationed?</P>

      <P>Those who have heard it will remember it.  It is going to be a critical issue and an issue which the Minister and his colleagues and those who support them will have to face up to.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the question of the transatlantic air service.  I am greatly surprised that under the present Minister for Industry and Commerce a decision should have been taken to liquidate Aer Linte and abandon the project for a transatlantic air service.  I am particularly surprised having regard to what the present Minister said on 24th May, 1946, as reported in Volume 101, column 858, of the Official Reports. The present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Morrissey, speaking from the Opposition Benches, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Speaking for myself, I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the way in which the whole question of aviation has been handled so far and on the initiative, enterprise and, if I may use the word, imagination shown in connection with that development.  On that score, I think we have no reason in the world to quarrel with the Minister or his officers and I realise to the full its value.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement was made after the then Minister for Industry and Commerce had disclosed to the House that it was intended to initiate a transatlantic air service and that that service in the early years of working would probably make heavy losses.  May I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce upon the generous tribute which he paid on that occasion to his predecessor, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce?  I think it was a very pleasing testimony and showed the broadminded and progressive <Col N="1263" /> spirit in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared then to approach these problems.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this magnificent tribute, however, and this endorsement of the policy of the then Minister in regard to civil aviation in this country, we find that the transatlantic air service has been abandoned.  To my mind, that air service occupied a key position in our whole scheme of civil air development.  Yesterday, Deputy Larkin rather endorsed the decision which the Government had taken in regard to the transatlantic air service and did so on the basis that, with the development of fast first-class aircraft, traffic was likely to by-pass the Shannon.  Frankly, I think there is a great deal of substance in what Deputy Larkin said in that regard and, because I believe there is some substance in it, I think that the establishment and maintenance of an Irish transatlantic air service is much more important and significant than has been apprehended by most of those who have spoken in criticism of that project.  While with the development of aviation first-class high speed traffic may pass the Shannon by, nevertheless, those who will travel in that way will be mainly people to whom money will be no object, for the fares which will have to be charged for accommodation on these highspeed long-distance planes will be very high indeed, since the farther a plane has to fly the greater the amount of non-paying load it has to carry. That non-paying load is very largely composed of the petrol which is necessary not to carry the plane over the early stages of its flight but to carry it over the concluding ones.  It therefore becomes very much more expensive to carry passengers over Rineanna and on to an English or to a continental airport than to cross the Atlantic and allow the planes to land at Rineanna and allow them to refuel there.</P>
    <P>If we had developed our transatlantic air service we should probably not have been catering for the multi-millionaire class of passenger at all or for those to whom money is no object.  Rather <Col N="1264" /> should we have been catering for those people who, while they might want to reach their destinations in a hurry, would, nevertheless, be prepared to touch earth at Rineanna in order to allow their planes to be refuelled there and thus get the advantage of the very much cheaper fare that could be charged in consequence.  If we had maintained our transatlantic air services we should always have that competitive element under our control because we should always be able to maintain a cheaper service across the Atlantic than any other company could. I think we would always have&mdash;very largely, perhaps because of the sentimental and cultural ties which exist between our people here and the people in the United States&mdash;a sufficient number of persons prepared to travel by that route to justify our maintenance of it.  And as we would be prepared to offer that service, so too would other companies who might otherwise be inclined to say: &ldquo;Well after all, our own planes will only carry so many people.  Only so many want to touch down at Shannon.  We will carry them to an English or to a continental airport and we will charge them for flying back to Ireland, if they should want to do so.&rdquo;  Because of that I feel and those of us who discussed this matter in the Government also felt that by establishing an Irish transatlantic air service we were, in fact, ensuring that Rineanna would continue to be used as a large-scale airport and that it would become the centre of the bulk passenger traffic between the Continent of America and the Continent of Europe.  Moreover, it was also going to be very important to us as a feeder service for the continental air services which were going to be built up, with Rineanna as a centre and as a focus.  Therefore, I think that, from the point of view of developing our civil air service, the abandonment of the transatlantic airline is a most regrettable and retrograde decision to have taken.  If by any chance Shannon airport should fail to fulfil our hopes in regard to it, it will be very largely due to the decision in that regard which has been taken this year by the present Government and accepted, I think&mdash;perhaps against <Col N="1265" /> his better judgment&mdash;by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I do not believe that.  I think the airports here are of value to the country....  I definitely favour the establishment of airports, and I do not believe that Rineanna will be overrun by rabbits in ten years, as suggested by certain Deputies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That extract from Mr. Common's speech will be found in Volume 105 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates, columns 1227-28.  The abandonment will cause a great deal of inconvenience to other Deputies who also spoke on that occasion in support of the policy of developing our civil air services.  For instance, it will cause some inconvenience to the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who on May 28th, 1946, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister and his Department deserve the congratulations of the House for the manner in which they managed the air agreements and for the extension of air facilities...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That extract will be found in Volume 101 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates, column 912.  I know that the present Parliamentary <Col N="1266" /> Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce was, shall we say, rather critical of the establishment of the transatlantic air services. I hope his has not been the malign influence in the Department of Industry and Commerce which has been responsible for the abandonment of that air service.  I should have thought that when he had had a fuller opportunity of examining the situation from the inside and of considering all the factors he too, like other people before him who had to approach this problem with a very critical mind, would have been converted to the view that the establishment of the transatlantic air service is of vital importance to the people of this country.</P>

      <P>Since then the Parliamentary Secretary might perhaps have read the debate upon civil aviation which took place in the House of Lords yesterday.  If so he would have seen the explanation for that.  It has arisen out of the fact that, like the Parliamentary Secretary's Government, we were anxious to be upon the best possible trading relations with the British Government in regard to this matter.  We had entered into a pooling arrangement with regard to traffic which has meant, at any rate, that the air travel facilities between this country and Great Britain are under Irish control and, in our anxiety to maintain that position, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;as he himself has pointed out&mdash;compelled Aer Lingus to buy planes which our British participants in the company desired should be purchased.  That purchase turned out to be unfortunate, and it is very largely responsible for the heavy losses which Aer Lingus sustained in its last complete year's working.  That position, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, is a passing one and it is the sort of situation which may often arise where a large undertaking has to be developed in a hurry.  The Parliamentary Secretary is surely not going to use the fact that the combined company made heavy losses last year as justification for an Irish Government <Col N="1267" /> abandoning an air service to which the credit of this State had already been committed and which, as I have said, is vital to our whole civil aviation setup.</P>
      <P>I am not going to talk about the damage which has been done to our reputation abroad in this matter.  I have seen advertisements in the National Geographic Magazines and other magazines of the same standard indicating that this air service was going to start on a certain date.  It has not started and I think that very grave damage has been done to the commercial reputation of this country by reason of that fact.</P>

I hope, however, that just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reconsidering his attitude in regard to mineral exploration and development and just as he is reconsidering his attitude in relation to industrial development, he will reconsider this matter too.  Mind you, though we heard a great deal from Deputy Flanagan last year about foreigners being invited into this country we are now told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they would welcome them with open arms and that they would give them all the facilities they would require for starting new industries in this country. We are told that they will not insist, as we did, on a substantial amount of Irish capital being invested in these concerns.  However, that is not the issue I propose to raise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pleasure to speak while he is here.  I want to refer to a number of matters that are <Col N="1269" /> connected with this Estimate.  First of all, I want to refer to the turf industry about which much has been said in this House since the election and long before the election.  This matter has been debated time and time again over a number of years and efforts have been made to create the impression in the public mind that the present Government wants to strangle the turf industry.  I think that those efforts which have been made and are still being made are disgraceful because it is evident that the present Government, in common with the previous Government, is anxious that this industry should progress and should become part of our economy.  It was, however, always evident that the winning of turf by hand for supply to the large cities was not an economic proposition and none of the speakers who are now on the opposition side of the House ever attempted to justify hand-won turf as an economic proposition.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I made a statement here concerning the fuel workers in the Phænix Park.  I indicated that the men who worked and who still, to some extent, work at the turf in the Park appreciated the fact that the turf industry was approaching a slump period.  Much capital is being made out of the unemployment which has, undoubtedly, been caused in certain areas by the stoppage of the hand-won production of turf and by the unemployment which is occurring in the Phænix Park and at the North Wall. The men at the North Wall and in the Phænix Park do not care what kind of work they have to do provided that they have a good job and that they earn a good week's wages.  As long as they are doing work of some productive kind they are not particular as to its nature.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that, so far as these men are concerned, they are not particular what they work at so long as they can earn a decent week's wages which will enable them to live in some degree of comfort.  While I agree that there is a certain amount of <Col N="1270" /> redundancy, so far as the workers in the Phænix Park and at the North Wall are concerned, I say that I consider it to be the duty of the Government to provide employment for these men, and not alone for these men, but for every unemployed person in the country.  So far as I can see, it has not yet been accepted by any of the previous Governments, either Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal; it has not been accepted as part of the duty of the Government to provide employment for the people they govern.</P>
      <P>I think it is a principle that must be accepted, that the Government of a country has a duty to provide a livelihood for everybody within that country, and has the duty of preventing the wholesale exodus of thousands of workers.  That has now become a feature here, although it has been quite common since the Famine years.  There is annually an exodus of people to other lands to get a livelihood.  I trust the Minister will act as speedily as possible, in so far as it falls within his function, in connection with the unemployment created as a result of the position at the Phænix Park and the North Wall.  The men who are unemployed at the moment are not concerned with what they work at.  I believe that plenty of employment could be made available for them, and one obvious avenue for the absorption of such workers is the building trade. It is much more important now that we should build houses, and in that way we could absorb the idle men in the Phænix Park or at the North Wall. There should be no wishful thinking. Schemes should be put into practical effect so as to make employment available for these men.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to give consideration to the production of turf by means of machinery.  I think it has been found that turf produced by machinery can be produced at an economic price and a ready sale can be got for it, at least for industrial use. It is a very important industry, one which must be encouraged, because it represents in the rural areas a means of taking in a lot of the slack where there are large numbers of workers who might otherwise be unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large scale production of turf is <Col N="1271" /> now centred in Bord na Móna.  So far as the turf workers are concerned, the experience they have had at the hands of Bord na Móna heretofore has not been a happy one.  Everybody is familiar with the disputes which took place within the past couple of years. The reasons for these disputes have been represented in this House, when the previous Government was in office, as having their origin in various sources.  All sorts of efforts were made to stir up trouble among the turf workers.  The fact of the matter is that there was no dispute on the bog other than what was due to a just dissatisfaction on the part of the workers because of their wages and working conditions.  Until such time as the men achieved a certain degree of organisation, they were treated in a scandalous manner.  Even yet it is not possible for a turf worker, unless he is an exceptionally good man and has an exceptional degree of skill, to earn anything like a reasonable living wage.</P>
    <P>Within recent weeks the union representing the bulk of the turf workers and the other unions representing the skilled sections appeared before the Labour Court with an application for an increase of 11/- per week and, to the absolute amazement of everybody concerned, the Labour Court made no recommendation&mdash;in other words, they decided that the workers should get no increase.  I do not know what view the Minister has in relation to the Labour Court, but I submit that before this industry can grow or prosper the principle of a fair wage must be laid down. No industry can be successful unless the workers in it are contented.  At the present moment there is tremendous discontent among the workers employed by Bord na Móna because of the Labour Court's decision.</P>
    <P>I think the Government should make it clear at an early date that they mean to push the machine production of turf to the very utmost and encourage it as far as lies in their power, because it may be of very great importance to us in the coming years.  Everybody is aware that the world situation is very menacing.  It behoves us to develop our industries to the maximum point <Col N="1272" /> of self-sufficiency.  It is to be hoped that never again will we find ourselves in the position we occupied during the emergency, when the people in our cities and towns were absolutely scourged, so to speak, by the very bad turf they were forced to burn.  We hope the machine production of turf will be developed, so that if another emergency should occur we will be in a much better position to meet it than we were on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take a particular interest in the situation that exists on the bogs following the turning down by the Labour Court of the workers' claim for a fair wage.  I might say that there is now developing among the bog workers an interest in turf production which was not present before this.  Largely through the impact of the workers' organisation upon Bord na Móna, there is developing a slightly better outlook in relation to working conditions.  So far as the industry generally is concerned, efforts should be made by the Government to remove from it, so far as the workers are concerned, that state of impermanency that is there.  Efforts should be made on large bogs to build villages and try to bring to the turf workers the comforts of home life which they have not now got.  The present system of building camps and bringing young men together to live there is not at all satisfectory.  It does not attract young men when they have spent one season on the bog.  It offers very little of a future and for that reason men hesitate to work on the bogs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, who represents the constituency of County Dublin like myself, referred to the air service and the unemployment which, he said, was caused as a result of the Government's decision about the transatlantic service. As a matter of fact, men were laid off at Collinstown Airport since December of last year.  There was an almost continuous laying-off of workers long before the election, and it cannot be said that the present Government is wholly responsible for any redundancy that was there.  It is the duty of the Government where there are unemployed to find employment for them, and that applies to these men at Collinstown <Col N="1273" /> equally with any who have become unemployed through the stoppage of hand-won turf production.</P>

      <P>I must say at the outset that I am obliged to the House for the way in which this Estimate has been received and discussed.  I should like to say how much I appreciate the speech made by Deputy Lemass, a speech which I think set the whole tone of the debate.  It was a well-reasoned and constructive speech, one that would be welcomed, I think, by anybody in my position, a speech in which he reviewed, from his very intimate knowledge, the many activities of this Department and a speech in which he made a number of suggestions with regard either to the starting of new industries or the expansion of existing industries.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Lemass that the suggestions which he made in the course of that speech will receive the full weight to which they are entitled, coming from a person like himself, who, as I say, has such an intimate knowledge of the whole industrial and commercial life of this country and who occupied the position of head of this Department for over 16 years.  Other Deputies, with one exception, followed the constructive line set by him.  There was a remarkable difference between the speech made by the first speaker from the front Opposition Bench and the speech of the last speaker from that bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall try, as far as I can, to answer as fully as I can the various points which were raised by Deputy Lemass and the other speakers.  I am taking first, because it is a matter not only of urgency but of major importance, the question raised by Deputy Lemass regarding the Electricity Supply Board generating stations and I shall give to the Deputy and the House the latest information at my disposal in connection with the various stations.  The Clonsast turf-fired station will be in part production by the late spring of next year and in full production <Col N="1274" /> during 1950.  The Leixlip station will also be in production, it is hoped, by the spring of 1949.  As regards the Erne development, it is hoped to have the Cliff station in commission by the end of 1949 and the Cathaleen Falls station partly in commission by the autumn of 1950 and in full commission before the summer of 1951.  I should say also that progress is satisfactory in the Allenwood, Kildare, turf-fired station and, if all goes well, it should be in commission by 1952.  The North Wall station, which will be capable of burning either oil or coal and of producing 40,000,000 units per annum, should be in commission by April.  It will be appreciated that these estimates are based on the assumption that delivery dates promised for plant and equipment will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the desirability of the Electricity Supply Board examining the smaller rivers throughout the country with a view to seeing to what extent, if any, they could be used for the development of electricity.  I am glad to say that this matter is under active consideration by the Electricity Supply Board, that quite a number of those rivers have been inspected and reported on, and that a number of others are under inspection at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer asked why in Kerry the Milltown area was passed over in the rural electrification scheme in favour of Ardfert.  It was asserted by him, and by Deputy Flynn on a former occasion. that there was some influence at work in having preference given to Ardfert over Milltown.  I am informed that it was selected because that area showed a much better percentage of potential consumers than Milltown. The actual figures are: in Milltown, with 490 houses, only 293 people were prepared to sign an acceptance to use the current.  In Ardfert which has 591 houses&mdash;100 more than Milltown&mdash;431 people or 72 per cent. agreed to take the current.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond referred to rural electrification in Waterford and seemed to think that it was being completely ignored.  A scheme in the Ballyduff area, near Lismore, is nearing <Col N="1275" /> completion and a local canvas of the inhabitants of Ardmore is actually taking place at present.</P>
    <P>I might as well deal with the question of the butchers now.  I do not know whether it is that Fianna Fáil have decided that it might be good policy to move in on the side of the butchers or whether they have raised this matter as a result of pressure from the butchers.  I want to say, for the information of the House and of the country. that the statement made by the butchers and the advertisements issued by the butchers are untrue. Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, some time towards the end of last year, controlled the price of meat.  He fixed a price and he gave a certain margin per lb. of gross profit to the butchers. They made representations to me in March that they had been losing heavily almost from the time Deputy Lemass had fixed the price, although he had allowed them a margin, I think, of 4½d. gross per lb.</P>
    <P>They stated that in January of this year, Deputy Lemass, who was at that time Minister for Industry and Commerce, agreed that they were entitled to a further 1d. per lb. increase, but he was deferring giving it to them. However, as a result of the case which they made, I agreed to give them an increase of something over 1d. per lb. on the average.  Within a fortnight of my giving them that increase they were clamouring again to be received by me for a further increase.  I said that I could not see them.  I was too busy at the time and, as Deputies know, I had a great many matters of extreme importance and urgency to deal with.  I suggested to them that they should see the assistant secretary, who is head of the prices section of my Department, if they had a case to make for a further increase.  They refused and said that they would not see the head of the prices section of the Department: that they would not be satisfied with seeing anybody but the Minister, and demanded that they should see the Minister.</P>
    <P>On a re-examination, I found that, in fact, I had given them too much when I gave them over a 1d. per lb., <Col N="1276" /> although, as I say, they were making, within a fortnight or three weeks of getting that increase, a demand for a further increase.  The actual increase which I gave them in March, according to the figures and costings in the prices section of my Department, brought their margin of gross profit from the 4½d. per lb. which Deputy Lemass had given them up to 5¾d. per lb.  What happened then when they refused to see the assistant secretary of the Department, the person who is fully competent to deal with the matter, to check their figures and statements and who, as a matter of fact, had been dealing with this from the beginning?  There was a meeting summoned by the butchers to be held in Thurles.  They started to rope in the butchers in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In Thurles they entered into a criminal conspiracy to flout the law and to increase the price of meat by 4d. per lb. over and above the price fixed. Apparently, they did not realise the seriousness of what they were doing, or the fact that they could be charged with criminal conspiracy because the chairman or president of the association got on the phone to the assistant secretary and head of the prices section of my Department and informed him that they were going to do this.  I and the Government had it conveyed to the president of the association, because we did not want to penalise or to take an unfair advantage of the man, that he was placing himself and the members of the association in a serious position, and that they were laying themselves open to a serious charge. Then they ran away from that and denied it, or tried to deny it.</P>
    <P>The next thing that happened was, I think, rather significant.  When we were in London engaged in the trade talks, trying to get for the farmers of this country a price for their cattle which are to be exported to Britain, they went further, and issued a statement saying that they were going to close down every butcher's stall in this country.  Having issued that statement, they found that there was not going to be a 100 per cent. close down, or anything like it, either in the city or towns in the country.  What did these <Col N="1277" /> gentlemen do then?  They approached the leaders of the unions and they asked the leaders of the unions would they pull their men out of the butchers' shops that would not close.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy in this House who will subscribe to that?  Is there any Deputy surprised that I refused, on demand, to meet those people?  They demanded that they would see me, and said that they would see only the Minister. They demanded in a letter to me on a Thursday afternoon that I should see them before Saturday.  Since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I have received as many people and as many representative interests as it was physically possible for any human being to receive.</P>
    <P>A week ago, when I was approached in a proper way, I agreed to meet a deputation of the butchers.  I agreed to meet them yesterday at 4 o'clock. That appointment had to be postponed until to-day because I was not sure but that my Estimate might come on earlier than it did, and I did not want to be called away in the middle of a discussion on this matter.  But apparently, they were not satisfied with that because they were in this House and in the Gallery of this House yesterday, and two Front Bench members of the Opposition Party trotted their case out here last night as well as three or four members of the Opposition Party on the back benches, I presume at their instigation.</P>
    <P>Let me go further and say that I got the prices section of my Department&mdash; Deputy Lemass knows that the prices section of the Department has all the facts in connection with this matter before it&mdash;to go fully into this at the time when the butchers were clamouring that prices were at their highest. I instructed the officials in the prices section to approach the calculation on the assumption&mdash;and this is a big assumption&mdash;that the butchers in this city and in the country were charging 11 different prices for the 11 different cuts of beef.  That is a big assumption. The officials did that, and they satisfied themselves and satisfied me that on those figures the butchers are still making a profit&mdash;what I consider to be a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Let me be quite frank&mdash;they are not making anything like the profits they made over the last seven, eight or ten years, or anything like the profits they made last year, and perhaps they are not making since March last anything like the profits they had been making prior to that.  When a Deputy opposite gets up and reads out to me that the butchers have been working since 1941 at a profit of 4.1 per cent., 4.8 per cent., 3.7 per cent. and at a loss in 1947 of 1.5 per cent. and at a loss this year of 2.8 per cent., I simply do not believe him, because all the information at my disposal goes to disprove that.</P>
    <P>We are not all living in the moon nor do we spend our entire lives in this Chamber although lately we have been spending a great part of our time here. We knock around like ordinary human beings and we can observe what is going on.  I want to make it quite clear that I have no desire in the world to be unfair to the butchers of this country.  I have very many old and intimate friends in that particular business. I know that the majority of them are supporters of this Government, but I have a responsibility to the community in the position I now occupy, and I am certainly not going to be dictated to, or bullied by any section of the community.  I know that there are certain influences at work that are trying from the beginning to play upon the feelings of the butchers and give them bad and evil advice in order to create trouble for this Government and for me.  Briefly that is the position.  I did not go to the trouble, nor am I going to the trouble now, of challenging in detail the statements which have been made by and on behalf of the butchers.</P>
    <P>I am not going to challenge in detail &mdash;although indeed I could quite easily &mdash;what appeared in many of their advertisements. I am in no way prejudiced against them, but I want to put it to the members of this House, and in particular to the Deputies opposite, to state what they want me to do. Three proposals have been made by the butchers and now I want to be told by the people who have been, and who <Col N="1279" /> are, raising this matter, what I am to do.  The demands made are: one, that control of prices should be removed altogether.  Is anybody in this House recommending that course to me?  Two, that I should grant an immediate increase of 4d. per lb. on beef.  Does anybody recommend that I should do that?  On that point, let me say that Deputy Colley was saying last night that people in Dublin could not get prime beef, that they could only get tough beef.  At the present price of beef the majority of people in this city cannot get beef, either tough or tender, and if I give an additional 4d. per lb. there will be very few people in this country outside the tourists who can afford to buy beef.  The third proposal put up to me is that I should put a levy on every beast going out of this country and that the proceeds of that levy should be handed to the butchers. Is any Deputy going to recommend that?  I do not care from which side of the House it comes, but I want to know how many Deputies in this House would vote for any of these three proposals and stand over them outside. That is roughly the position, and if anybody wants any further details about it I will be very glad to give them.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of that, I would like to go back to some of the more important matters that were raised by Deputy Lemass.  He mentioned the question of wool combing.  That is a matter on which, from what he said, he and I are in entire accord.  I agree entirely with him and he will, I am sure, be very glad to know that proposals are actually under consideration at present in the Department.  If there is any slackening, however, on the part of the promoters, if they are unable to go on, if they want to stop for any reason or if there is any undue delay in the matter, I can assure the Deputy that alternative measures will be taken.</P>
    <P>He referred to a blooming mill and a steel-rolling mill at Haulbowline.  As the Deputy, of course, knows, neither of the mills has been in production. The company have, however, engaged the services of an expert to report to them; they have received the report of <Col N="1280" /> the expert and I understand that the recommendations of the directors are to be sent to me very soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also raised the question of the proposed factory for the manufacture or processing of certain electrical equipment at Finglas.  That is going on and the foundations, I think, are actually being put in at the moment.  I can assure the Deputy that it is being pushed on as rapidly as it can and he will understand that there are certain difficulties with regard to equipment over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the International Labour Conference at San Francisco and asked whether the full report would be available.  We will have a full report of the proceedings, which will be made available.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised a question with regard to the Industrial Relations Act and the Labour Court. I do not want to say anything about that matter at the moment beyond saying that I have been watching closely the trends and the developments and that I have the matter under close examination.  I shall certainly be glad, in consultation with the interests concerned, to discuss the matter with a view to seeing what improvements, if any, can be made.  I would like to say that I look upon the Labour Court as being a very valuable piece of machinery. As the Deputies know it was introduced by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister, as an experiment.  It was discussed in a non-Party spirit in this House and it passed from this House with the unanimous approval of all Deputies.  It has been in operation for some time.  It certainly had its birth in very critical times and notwithstanding the fact that its recommendations have not been accepted, perhaps, as often as some of us would wish, I am satisfied that it has proved of considerable value.  It has done a great deal to minimise, if not completely to remove, industrial unrest and disputes in this country.  I am satisfied that with goodwill on the part of the parties concerned it can be made a more valuable instrument and that it can help us still further to minimise, if not to remove entirely, industrial unrest and disputes.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister allow me to interrupt for one moment to ask this question?  Could the Minister have some person in his office who could be approached either by employers or employees before a strike takes place if a strike is threatened?  If there was somebody in the Department who could be approached by both sides he might prevent a strike before it commenced at all.</P>

      <P>We would all love, Deputy, to be able to do that, and if we could do it, we would not want the Industrial Relations Act or the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has at its disposal all the conciliation machinery the Deputy talks about, but my strong view is that efforts at conciliation should be made before a matter is referred to the Labour Court, not afterwards.</P>

      <P>I do not want to comment on any dispute which is going on at the moment, but I agree with Deputy Lemass that it is a pity the conciliation machinery set up under the Industrial Relations Act is not availed of more fully.  So far as the Labour Court is concerned, I should like to say that, in my opinion, any interference in a dispute, after the Labour Court has considered all the facts and made its award, is, taking the long view, not to be welcomed.  If the standing and prestige of the Labour Court is damaged, if it loses its effectiveness, I personally feel that the workers of the country will have lost one of the most valuable instruments ever put at their disposal.  It will be a loss to the community generally but a particularly great loss to the workers.  However, as I say, I am watching the situation as carefully as I can.  I am prepared to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the interests concerned in any measures we can take to improve the position and make the machinery more effective.  It would perhaps be <Col N="1282" /> better if I said no more about it at this stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass and other Deputies raised the question of mechanised turf production.  I want to assure the House that mechanised turf production is going on as rapidly as it is possible for it to go.  There is no limitation put upon its activities in any way by the Government and in fact it is getting every encouragement which I can give it.  In so far as its activities are in any way restricted, this is due entirely to circumstances outside the control of the Government and the company.  The plants at Clonsast, Turraun, Lyracrompane, Lullymore and Kilberry are all in active production.  Several other bogs are in process of development in the matter of drainage, buildings, power lines and so on, and I should like to assure the House that everything that can be done along the lines of extending the mechanical production of turf is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying that the activities of the company will require the provision of increased capital and that legislation will be needed before that can be done.  Is that legislation in contemplation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I have not had time to go into all these matters, but I think that what I have said indicates what my view on the matter is.  Perhaps I might now refer to the position with regard to the fuel in the various dumps throughout the country and particularly in the Phænix Park.  That matter was raised by Deputy Lemass and it was referred to by Deputies from all sides.  There was complete unanimity in recommending that I should cut the losses and get rid of the dumps.  I am afraid that may have to be done, but I want to warn Deputies who talk about cutting the losses, what the losses are going to be.  Remember that we have huge dumps of timber, and, as Deputy Sheehan has reminded us, that timber is not all hardwood.  It is made up of all classes, sorts and sizes of timber, from brushwood to commercial timber, and, in the circumstances of the times in which it was cut and collected, it could not be otherwise.  I <Col N="1283" /> freely admit that, but we know that rapidly as turf deteriorates and loses weight, timber loses it much more rapidly.</P>
      <P>However, that is the situation.  We have huge dumps, including a lot of coal&mdash;somewhere in the neighbourhood of 450,000 to 500,000 tons of American and South African coal. Nobody wants it at its present price and some people do not want it at any price.  I have had the matter under active consideration, and it has been examined within the past week or so by an inter-departmental committee and I want to tell the House that, if we decide to dispose of the fuel in the dumps and offer it at a price sufficiently low to attract purchasers, we will lose approximately £5,000,000. I have to make up my mind whether it is better to lose it that way and dispose of it, or to leave it there to go into dust and to become useless, to become as Deputy Larkin said, a heap of rubbish which will cost money to get taken away and dumped into the bay. That is the position and Deputies will realise that it is a matter not lightly to be determined and one in which one cannot take an immediate decision.</P>
      <P>I want to warn Deputies of this also, because I know I will be accused and attacked later on, that if I reduce the price of the fuel in the dumps to such an attractive figure that people in Dublin and people throughout the country convenient to the other dumps take full advantage of it and stock up, everybody who produces a sod of turf this year, or has a clamp of turf left over from last year, will immediately attack me and say: &ldquo;You encouraged us to cut turf and now you swamp the market at a price at which we could not possibly produce it.&rdquo;  I am telling the House in time so that, if it is decided to make this fuel available at a price at which people will buy it and if people stock up, Deputies will not come in here later to denounce me because I deprived people in the turf areas of the market which they are supposed to be looking forward to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should say in this connection that there has been a lot of talk <Col N="1284" /> about coal and a great deal of talk about the effect which the imports of coal have on the production of native fuel.  The allocation of coal which my predecessor was able, after extreme pressure, to extract from the British was roughly 50 to 60 per cent. of our pre-war imports of coal, and, when I was in London recently and saw the Minister of Fuel and Power there, I deliberately refrained from asking for more coal from the British than roughly from 50 to 60 per cent. of our pre-war consumption, so as to leave for home-produced fuel a big part of the market. As a matter of fact, for a considerable time and up to the present moment, we are not taking from the British any thing like 50 per cent. of our pre-war consumption and we have even fallen as low as 25 per cent., so that there ought to be a very substantial market in this country for home-produced fuel, with imported coal selling at anything from £6 to £8 a ton.  In the turf areas, where I have been asked by numerous Deputies and other interests outside, completely to exclude coal, I can see no reason why, with the quality of English coal which is available and at the price at which it is available, good turf, either machine or hand-won turf, cannot be sold in competition with it at a price economic to the producer.  I am speaking as a person who has a fairly considerable knowledge of turf and I know that if I could get in Dublin or in the country, when I was living there, good quality turf at 50/-a ton I certainly would not pay £7 10s. or £8 10s. a ton for English coal that was not so good.  Deputies ought to face up to that.</P>
    <P>I was very glad that the subject of the production of turf on the bogs formerly operated by the county councils was not dealt with in a controversial manner.  I have no hesitation in saying this, and I do not think it will be seriously challenged, that whether Deputy Lemass did or did not, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, take a decision not to produce hand-won turf on the bogs formerly operated by the county council, I have no doubt in my mind, in the full light of all the facts that are now available to me, that Deputy Lemass if he had been returned <Col N="1285" /> again as Minister, would have had to take that decision.  There is no question whatever about that.  That cannot be challenged.  I have told the House that the position about the dumps is that if we sell the turf in them at a price sufficiently low to get anyone to purchase it, we will lose £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, as Minister, had been informed by Fuel Importers, Limited, that, if the turf was produced, there was nowhere to put it, that the dumps were all full and that it would have to be stacked along the sides of the country roads.  Those who know something about turf and country roads and stacks of turf along country roads, have a fair idea of what would happen and what the loss would be.  It would be far greater than the loss on what is in the dumps at the moment. The fact of the matter is that we would be producing something which nobody wanted and for which there was no demand and&mdash;this is the point&mdash;which would not last.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that I took any particular pleasure in stopping hand-won turf?  Does anybody think it was any particular pleasure to me that hundreds of men were to lose their employment? Was it any particular pleasure to me, who had a fairly intimate knowledge of it, to know that families who had good incomes&mdash;I am not talking about wages now; I am talking about family incomes from the bogs&mdash;were to lose that source of income? I did not put an end to it nor, if Deputy Lemass did, would it be Deputy Lemass who was putting an end to it.  It would be change of circumstances that put an end to it. Remember, those incomes that were got during the previous five, six or seven years, whether by bog owners, families working bogs, lorry owners or anybody else, were got, not because the people of this country wanted to burn turf but because the war was on and they could not get anything else to burn.</P>
    <P>Deputies lightheartedly suggest that I should not allow coal to be burned in any part of this country outside the cities.  That suggestion has been put to me in the House and outside the House by various interests and deputations. <Col N="1286" /> How many Deputies will go down and advocate that from a platform in any town in rural Ireland and get away with it?  We have to be realistic about this.  I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, while I occupy the position which I now occupy, whether it be for a long or a short time, I shall do everything in my power to develop to the full our native resources, but I am not going to ram any commodity, native or foreign, down the throats of the people of this country.  That is not my function and, if we make available for our people articles, commodities, raw materials that are on a par or nearly on a par with similar articles that can be got elsewhere, and if our people refuse to use them and buy them, then we simply cannot, by legislation, dragoon them and drive these commodities down their throats.</P>
    <P>I believe that as far as it is economically possible to develop the production of home fuel, it should be done, but if there is anybody in this House who at this late hour of the day thinks that there is a commercial future for hand-won turf in this country, he is simply living in a fool's paradise.  I deliberately use the word &ldquo;commercial future&rdquo; because turf has always been and probably always will be used as a fuel throughout rural Ireland, particularly by the farmers and farming labourers.  Before ever we had a war or before ever we had a shortage of imported fuel, when the best quality coal was being landed on the quays of Dublin at £1 and 21/- a ton, 3,500,000 tons of turf were being used by people in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us keep a sense of proportion in relation to turf production.  With the greatest drive behind the production of turf that could possibly be put behind it, we stepped up to an estimated maximum of roughly 5,000,000 tons of turf, in other words, 1,500,000 tons over and above what was produced by the ordinary people in the ordinary old-fashioned way.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about native coal.  Again let us get clear on that.  We have not unlimited quantities of coal.  We have coal, not much of it, unfortunately, particularly anthracite, that can compare more <Col N="1287" /> than favourably with the best anthracite coal imported from Wales or anywhere else.  I would ask Deputies to keep this in their minds, to show that it is a question of quality: There is one coal mine in this country that, pre-war, during the war, or post-war, was never able to meet the demand for its product.  I know something about that. I was in the business in a very small way many years ago.  I could not get, and there were dozens like me, a lorry load of anthracite coal from that particular colliery because they were unable to supply anybody outside their regular customers.</P>
    <P>I am talking now of long pre-war. That is due entirely to the quality of that coal.  We have other good coal but not as good as that and we have a lot of what is called coal but which is 80 per cent. shale and, do not forget this, we were producing coal from a coal mine during the war and, though we were glad to have it, 80 per cent. of it&mdash;that is not a haphazard figure, but an accurate one&mdash;was duff or slack.  If 90 per cent. of its output had not been taken by one of the maligned State-sponsored companies, it could not be existing at all.  That is a very rough outline of the fuel position and I think Deputy Lemass could not challenge seriously any point I have made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to another matter which I considered important but did not have time to examine as fully as I would like, that is, copper sulphate and sulphate of ammonia. Like him, I fully appreciate the importance of that product to us.  Ceimicí Teoranta is actively examining the production of both these chemicals and the views of other Departments are being obtained.  As soon as we get them, a report will be presented to me.</P>
    <P>References were made by some Deputies to gaps in our industrial position. Proposals are being received every day and every week from persons interested in starting new industries here or expanding existing industries, and they are getting from me, from my Department and from the Government every facility and every possible encouragement.  Deputies will realise that, on account of world conditions <Col N="1288" /> and world shortages, particularly of raw materials and machinery, some industries that probably would be started here right away cannot be started at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the national economic council.  He knows that matter has been discussed, both inside and outside this House, many times over the last 20 years, but nothing was ever done.  I am having the matter reopened, with a view to fresh consideration of it and I will see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned that a monopoly was supposed to have been given to a Dublin firm for the manufacture of steel windows and that a Cork firm was being penalised.  I am not aware of any such monopoly, but if the Deputy would be good enough to give me full particulars, I will inquire into the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies know the history of the Dublin bread strike and the settlement of it, so I need not go back on that. Deputies know that an application for wages was referred to the Labour Court which made an award or recommendation. That was not accepted by the bakers and they went on strike.  My Department did all it possibly could to minimise the effects of that strike, particularly on the poor, by making flour freely available.  However, the strike dragged on and undoubtedly inflicted very severe hardship on certain people, particularly on the very poor of the city.  Deputies will realise that a bread strike is the most serious strike of all, particularly in a large city and that it weighs heavily where there are large families of young children.  It dragged on and there was no sign of a settlement. Not only that, but it was conveyed to me that it was going to be extended and that the position might be considerably worsened.</P>
    <P>I admit quite frankly that I was very reluctant to intervene and that, in the beginning I refused point blank to intervene, as I did not think I should intervene in these disputes, particularly in one which had been referred to the Labour Court.  However, I felt I could not continue idly to stand by and watch these hardships being inflicted on poor people and on children.  I thought I <Col N="1289" /> should do what I could to bring the parties together.  Up to that time, efforts which had been made by others to get the parties to meet had not been successful.  I issued an invitation to both parties to come to the Department and I met them there.  I spoke to them very frankly on the whole matter and will not weary the House with all the negotiations, offers and rejections which are usual in a dispute of that kind.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, it was quite clear to me that, unless I was prepared to agree to whatever increase would be needed in the price of bread to meet the increase in wages, there would be no settlement of the strike on that day and certainly no settlement for a very considerable time, with the grave probability that the strike would be extended and that still further hardships would be inflicted on the people. In those circumstances, I agreed that I would allow the bakers an increase of not more than ¼d. on the 2-lb. loaf. That promise was made definitely and clearly to them.  I also said at that time that the Government had decided &mdash;not in connection with the strike or arising out of it&mdash;mainly because there is a subsidy of nearly £10,000,000 required to enable bread to be sold at its present price, to inquire into the whole question of flour and bread production and the subsidy given to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will operate from the day of the settlement.  The Deputy will understand that there are certain difficulties in adjusting matters so as to ensure that the bakers will not get even more out of the ¼d. than they are paying by way of wages.  If there is any lag in between, we can collect it towards the subsidy.  That is the only question.  I know quite well that I will be criticised both inside and outside the House for having agreed to give that ¼d. on the 2-lb. loaf.  I would be still more bitterly criticised if I had not agreed to give it, if the conference broke up and both parties said: &ldquo;The whole thing has broken down, the strike must go on and extend because the Minister was not prepared to <Col N="1290" /> sanction an increase of ¼d. on the 2-lb. loaf.&rdquo;  That is the story without any reservation.</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat what I said at the opening, that I appreciate very much the way in which the Estimate was approached and discussed from all sides of the House.  I appreciate particularly the valuable contribution made by Deputy Lemass to it, and I want to assure him that the suggestions which he made will be very fully considered. I should like to say that I found his speech a very helpful one and I hope, if I may express the hope, that the line he took, the tone he set and, particularly, the reasoned and constructive speech he made will be an example for others and for future debates in this House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be under the impression that the Land Commission are not now free to institute proceedings for the acquisition of lands in County Dublin.  That is not so, as the restrictions imposed during the emergency were recently relaxed and inquiries are now proceeding throughout the country generally with a view to the acquisition of such suitable lands as can be acquired for the relief of congestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the reasons for his letter to the Mitchelstown Co-operative Dairy Society asking them to discontinue the manufacture of cheese, and whether he is aware that his action in stopping the manufacture of cheese by the creamery will mean a reduction in the price of milk to the farmers of East Cork of at least 3d. per gallon and the dismissal of 360 workers; and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question the answer is no.  In regard to the first part of the <Col N="1295" /> Question the facts are that the manager of Mitchelstown Creamery approached my Department in May last with a request for permission to export cheese to Great Britain, consequent on the accumulation by him of an excessive stock of cheese as a result of over-estimating the capacity of the home market to consume it; in order to avoid serious deterioration in a large quantity of cheese permission for the export of a substantial quantity was granted; it subsequently appeared that the output of butter requisite to maintain the butter ration during next winter was not being attained and, accordingly I requested co-operative creameries and others to restrict their production of cheese and chocolate crumb in favour of butter until the necessary butter stocks were assembled in cold store; when the primary duty of converting available milk into butter has been discharged, the full-scale manufacture of cheese and chocolate crumb will be restored.  In the meantime it is not anticipated that the measures taken to help the Mitchelstown Society out of their difficulty will injure any of the categories of persons named in the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, it is not possible to measure the actual quantity of butter that may result from this curtailment.  My object is to curtail the output of the creameries in whatever they think is their most profitable occupation for the shortest possible time; that will be the moment when the total output of butter results in a sufficiency coming into the cold store and I have told the creameries and other companies that the device is purely temporary and need not be continued any longer than is necessary to ensure the butter supply which the community requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is anxious about the quantity of butter why did he not prohibit the sale of cream to the luxury hotels in this country?  I would have thought that would have <Col N="1296" /> been the first thing to do in respect of saving butter.</P>

The position, however, would appear to be improving.  At least two additional boats have recently joined the local fleet; one as the result of private enterprise and another through the medium of the Sea Fisheries Association.  Further applications from Howth members, which have been for some time on the association's &ldquo;waiting list&rdquo;, will be dealt with as soon as general conditions of supply may enable the directors to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware of the grave inconvenience, hardship and loss caused to married officers and soldiers and their families by the unnecessary separation of officers and soldiers from their families and if, in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the natural rights of the individuals concerned, he will arrange to have investigated individual cases of officers and soldiers who may wish to apply for transfer to enable them to be stationed convenient to their homes; and, further, if he will direct the Military authorities that such applications must be dealt with as a matter of urgency and acceded to where at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Army as in many other walks of life it is inevitable that some individuals, either because of the nature of <Col N="1300" /> their professions, their occupations, their training or the positions and rank they hold, have to face up to separation from their families, sometimes temporarily, sometimes for long periods. Undoubtedly such separation involves hardship and expense.  This latter was one of the considerations that influenced the granting of the present generous marriage and children's allowances payable to non-commissioned officers and privates.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that in a large and technical establishment like the Army an effective organisation depends upon the selection and placing of officers and men in the appointments and posts for which they are best fitted and in which they are most required.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the comparatively small number of barracks and posts in the Army limit the territorial distribution of units and restrict the extent to which individuals can be facilitated in the matter of living at their homes.</P>
      <P>The possibility of permitting any individual to reside at the station most convenient to his home must largely depend therefore upon the exigencies of the service.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to raise any false hopes by creating the impression that I will invite and grant a shoal of applications from individuals who may seek to be facilitated in this respect.  Neither am I prepared to direct that every application made is to be granted.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware that individual applications made by officers and men from time to time are considered as sympathetically as possible and are decided on their merits in the light of service requirements.  It is also my wish that this should continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>The Army authorities concerned with this problem are responsible officers who can be trusted to handle it in a reasonable and sympathetic fashion, having regard to all the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I ask if he is aware that there is a conception amongst certain senior officers that it <Col N="1301" /> is harmful to the Service if individuals or units are left for a period exceeding three years in a particular place and if he considers that that point of view should be forced by those Army officers on the Army?  Further, will the Minister direct the military authorities that applications for transfers should not be snuffed out at the first point of consideration, in other words, the Army is pretty small now and applications should come up to the Department of Defence and be dealt with there.  The trouble as I understand it is that these applications are killed at the very first point of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure that I got the whole of that supplementary question or that I remember the whole of it.  On the general principle of leaving individuals or units excessively long in one geographical position, that is a view of many officers and it is shared by myself.  We are only reaching normality and in normal times such considerations as are advanced by the Deputy will be met as far as possible.  The tail-end of the supplementary question contained what I regard as an offensive reference and one which I think it would have been better to omit.  I do not think it is the practice, to use the Deputy's term, &ldquo;to snuff out&rdquo; applications at birth. As a general rule applications for transfer do reach the Department of Defence.  That is my belief.  If, however, my belief is incorrect, I shall get the matter looked into and I shall see that such applications are considered.</P>

      <P>I do not know about Vote 28&mdash;Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. I think it comes under Education but, if necessary, I will take it.  I did not know that it was on my list.  Vote 71&mdash;Athletics&mdash;will not be moved.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £77,130 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
      <P>The provision, as Deputies will see, is up by £18,480.  The major portion of that increase is attributable to increases in salaries and increases in staff to a certain extent.  There was a certain provision for travelling allowances.  As financial business has already occupied many days, I do not propose to discuss it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years past, on the Estimates for the Minister for Finance and on a number of other <Col N="1310" /> occasions, the present Minister for Finance debated at great length, and occasionally with some vituperation, the question of the rates of interest, interest free money, free credits and the investment of certain sums by the Department of Finance in England. Just to remind Deputies of his point of view, and also to ask him to inform us whether his point of view has changed and, if so, in what direction, I want to give a few quotations from the Minister's speeches.  Deputies will remember that in recent months the Minister issued a loan at 3 per cent.  On the occasion when a former Minister for Finance was proposing to issue a loan, the present Minister, in Volume 97, column 2890, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... those who were the propagandists for the Central Savings Fund had been told to stop any further propaganda... that the Government did not want cheap money and that that situation is to last.  When I ask about it I am given a whole lot of medievalism about rates of interest and how much you must think of the lender as well as thinking of the borrower. But the lender in these cases was quite satisfied to get 2 per cent. and, for some reason or another, the Government decided that they would stop down on that, because they wanted to raise a 5 per cent. loan at the time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was untrue that we wanted to raise a loan at 5 per cent. or anything like it, but that is what the Minister then said.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That seems to me the most arrant nonsense, and I do not see how we could tolerate it at this stage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is plenty of money available in the country for the financing of production, but apparently our Government the whole time decides that they would rather go to the owners of money, the people who have got a fair amount of money in peculiar ways in the last four or five years.  They are going to throw open to those people loans at 4 or 5. <Col N="1311" /> per cent., rather than get, by a very simple change, the full use of this £23,000,000 which is invested in British funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Rather than get money from the Post Office Savings Bank and other places in recent months the Minister issued a public loan.  Did he get any of that loan from people who got a &ldquo;fair amount of money in peculiar ways&rdquo; in the last few years?  Was it for the purposes of giving them 3 per cent. that he issued that loan to the public?</P>
    <P>In Volume 97, column 2890, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What bewilders me more is that we have not even got any statement from the Minister indicating that there is a proper appreciation of the fact that there are idle resources here both in men and materials and that the only thing that is required to join those is this mysterious thing we call money, and we have also plenty of that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy began by stating that a lot of things could be discussed on this Vote.  I have looked up the discussions on the Vote for the Minister for Finance as far back as 1926, and at least 80 per cent.  of the matters discussed were concerned with the Civil Service bonus, Civil Service remuneration and the administration of the Civil Service. There were two occasions on which the rates of interest for housing and local loans were raised, I think by Deputy McGilligan, but the Budget may not be debated now, nor taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to debate either of them.  I am on the very narrow point which was discussed by the Minister for Finance on at least two occasions, as the Chair has pointed out, on the Finance Estimate, of the rate paid for Government money and I am going to confine myself to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;in which the Minister invested another £3,750,000 the other day. <Col N="1313" /> Again on the question of interest, as reported in Volume 94, column 2062, the Minister advocated the printing of money with no rate of interest to anybody, the type of argument that got Deputy Davin to nominate him as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not quoting now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to quote :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Banks and all sorts of houses simply create money....  We print notes when people present us here with British legal tender and demand Irish legal tender instead. We print it for them, and I suggest that we should print it at least as readily&mdash;always guarding against the dangers of overprinting&mdash;when the demand comes, not from people who have English money and want it changed into ours, but when there is some good purpose for which Irish money is required.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there no good purpose for which Irish money is required at the present time?</P>
      <P>In column 2063 the Minister said :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I simply wish to ask that we should recognise that, in the financing of a transport venture, if it is to be a source of advantage to the Irish community, that service be rendered to the community at as little cost as possible. One of the charges we should cut out is the charge for the loan of money.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There should be no rate of interest. What does the Minister propose to do in regard to the rate of interest from now on?  Is he going to print money, as he indicated should be done when it was required for any proper purpose? If not, why not?  After all, the people of this country have a right to know what is the Minister's mind on that matter.  He ranted for years on the foolishness of paying a high rate of interest on money here.  His colleague, the present Minister for Education, kept the Dáil here, hour after hour, condemning the Government for paying 3 per cent. for money and urged that they should get it at a much lesser charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> The Minister, in the Seanad recently, referred to this loan for which he paid 3 per cent. interest and said he had to raise it in order to pay off his predecessor's debts.  He invested £3,750,000 of it in England.  I wonder at what rate of interest?  The Minister and those who are associated with him in this inter-Party Government tried to persuade the people, and did, in fact, deceive quite large numbers of them, that there should be no financial difficulties, that the only financial difficulties were figments of the imagination of the Fianna Fáil Government, that all we had to do in order to blossom forth so that everybody should be prosperous, in order that the Civic Guards' pay should be doubled, that all the land in the country should be drained overnight and that all the houses we require should be built in six months, was to print this money at no rate of interest.  Has the Minister changed his mind in that regard?</P>
    <P>Why when he condemned the last Government and myself, indeed, for having Government funds invested in England, has he, instead of reducing that, increased it since he came into office?  Why did he pay 3 per cent. for money to the public here and then invest it in British securities?  Every Minister of the present Government who has come in here has complained that a lack of money is causing him trouble.  If the Minister, instead of paying 3 per cent. interest and using some of the taxes that he is going to collect to pay that 3 per cent. interest, had continued to get funds at the rate of interest at which they were obtained during the last couple of years, he might have saved on the interest bill some hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in that way would be in a position to allow the Minister for Agriculture to go ahead with the farm building scheme and the farm improvement Vote, which are held up for want of money at the present time.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister issue his recent loan at 3 per cent?  From whom did he get the money?  Was it from the people who had made a lot of money in queer ways&mdash;the people that he used to speak of in this House during the last few years&mdash;that he got <Col N="1315" /> the money?  Is he using some of this money which he has got from the Irish people at 3 per cent. to repay the Exchequer bills which I obtained from the banks at 1? per cent., and, if so, why did he do it?  The Minister has a duty to explain to the people the truth of this matter.</P>
    <P>During the last few years when he sat here he disturbed quite a number of people in the country.  He got Deputy Davin to nominate him as Minister for Finance on the understanding that he was going to print all the money that he required to do everything at no rate of interest.  Has the Minister changed his mind; and, if so, why?  The Minister for Agriculture has been refused permission to go ahead with farm improvements and says: &ldquo;I cannot promise that it will be done if we have not got the money&rdquo;.  Money used to be no trouble to the Minister for Finance when he was in opposition. Is it a trouble to him at the present time, and is the rate of interest thereon a trouble to him?  Will the Minister also inform us what rate of interest he is getting on our money that is invested in England, money which he raised from the Irish people on the plea that it was going to pay my debts?</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other matters that could be raised on this particular Estimate, but in order to restrict the debate and to give the Minister a full opportunity of dealing with that one point, I propose to conclude now by asking the Minister to answer the few simple questions that I have put to him, in order that he may undeceive the number of people that he deceived in the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised at the power which has been credited to Deputy Davin by Deputy Aiken.  I think it is well to preface my remarks by saying that there is a misconstruction in the mind of Deputy Aiken in regard to Deputy Davin's statement. Deputy Davin gave expression to his personal gratification that the present Minister for Finance occupies that position.  He did not either directly <Col N="1316" /> or indirectly through his Party have any hand or act in the nomination of the Minister.</P>

      <P>We should like to know how the Minister hopes to bring about the 10 per cent. cut in prices that was raised at the Trade Union Congress, and to discuss other things like that.  It may be possible to ask whether the Minister has any responsibility for the contraction in credits that appears to be taking place here, whether he has any responsibility for the general policy of the banks in their demands to restrict overdrafts, which, to my mind, are producing a certain amount of unemployment, particularly in the building trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but it is hinted abroad, and that is why I am bringing it up, that it is due to ministerial policy.  That, I think, would require a more strenuous denial than it has been given so far, because the denial does not yet seem to have reached the quarters where it would be most effective.  I think it would be well if the denial were given greater pungency because of what I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> There is one other item that I would like to refer to, and that is Vote 18&mdash; Secret Service.  I want to ask the Minister whether he would consider this an appropriate time to follow the new start in our political affairs by deleting from the Book of Estimates this Vote for Secret Service.  I do not know how it is administered.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us.  It may have had some force in the past.</P>
    <P>In the unhappy conditions of that time there may have been a necessity for it, but the very words &ldquo;secret service&rdquo; leave a sort of stigma on an Irish Government's Estimates.  It appears to me to be extremely obnoxious and I think it would be to the benefit and credit of any Irish Government if they deleted this altogether on account of the shameful association it has with our past history. I trust that this Government will not operate a secret service.  There is no reason for it and the Minister might appropriate the money voted for that to a more useful and beneficial purpose.</P>

      <P>Theastuigh uaimse tagairt a dhéanamh do Vóta 15, the Commission on Place Names. The particular point I want to raise is the suspension of the work of the Comisiún Log-Ainmneacha, the Commission on Place Names.  In reply to a question, I was told by the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the work of that commission was being suspended, but that the matter would be reviewed next year.  The total amount of money set aside for the work of the commission was £5,587, an increase of £1,422 on the estimated expenditure of last year.  I do not know whether the purpose of this suspension was economy or what the reason was, but I think it is a shameful thing that the work of that commission is suspended.  I prefer to believe that it arose as a result of some misinterpretation of the Minister's instructions regarding economy than that it was a deliberate action on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I admit that the work should have been done years upon years ago, but tá sean-fhocal ann, is fearr go déidheannaighe nó go ró-dhéidheannaighe. When the work was started it was estimated that in five years it would be completed, that every place name, every townland name, every district name, every name available in the country, would have been traced and the Irish equivalent found.  It is most important work in my view and in the view of many others besides me, and I believe that you will find support of that view on the benches behind the Minister.  It is shameful that it should have been suspended under the name of economy.  I think that it was an insult to the chairman of it and the members, who are distinguished and scholarly men from all parts of the country, some of whom I know personally, spent a lifetime in personal work regarding Irish place names and work associated with it such as archaeology.  I think that the Minister should mend his hand and let the Commission end their work as quickly as possible without interference. I understand that an undertaking, or at least an indication, was given that the work would be completed within five years, so it is not a vote of a permanent character, and the total vote this year is £5,587.</P>
      <P>It is no excuse for the Minister to say that it was only started a year and a half ago and that we did very well without it.  We did without it and it was late in the day when the work was started, but it is work of a supreme importance from every point of view and it is simply disgraceful to suspend it.  It is hopeful, at the same time, that there is a prospect of the work being renewed next year, but the pity of it all is that work which was under way was interrupted under the guise of economy.  The Minister should mend his hand, let the work go ahead and allow the small sum which is in this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question of rates <Col N="1320" /> of interest has been raised, I want to bring one specific case to the Minister's notice, the case of a citizen of this country who in 1922 borrowed £490 from the State for the erection of a house and since then has been paying £40 per year on the understanding that this £40 would be paid for 35 years. Therefore that citizen will be compelled to repay £490 in 35 years with a sum of £1,400.  I think that there is something wrong somewhere when a citizen, in order to build a house to live in, has to pay back to the State £1,400 for a loan of £490.  I am bringing this case especially to the Minister's notice because this money was borrowed in 1922, when rates of interest were at their highest peak, that is, I think, 7¼ per cent.  I think that there are only a limited number of people who would be affected by such exceptionally high rates of interest and the Minister should do something in connection with that limited number.</P>
      <P>I do not feel too much sympathy with the ex-Minister for Finance when he asks for a lucid statement from the Minister regarding why the State pays interest on money which is required. Throughout all the years when Deputy Aiken was Minister for Finance he failed to give any explanation in reply to this vexed question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this matter is outside the control of the Government. At least the Government have not attempted to take control of it and neither did the Minister's predecessors. I am in complete agreement with those who ask why it should be necessary for the State to pay interest on money which it requires.  All money is issued on the security of the <Col N="1321" /> State.  There is no other security.  We may borrow from Britain, but we have the Government of Ireland as our security.  It seems to be just the same as if a citizen were to pay interest on money he requires when that money is actually provided by himself.  That is the actual position with regard to money generally and nobody has ever attempted to explain it.  The Minister's predecessor never explained it, although he had a long period of years in which to do so.  I am not going to press the Minister too severely for an explanation.  He might do it and he is one man who could do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>There is one matter I would like to raise.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction in the country with regard to the restriction of bank credit.  I do not know what the Minister can do about it, but, if the banks are adopting a policy which is not in the national interest, it is always possible for the State to take action, and, if necessary, to enter into competition with the banks, provided, of course, they are satisfied that the banks are acting in a manner which is not in the national interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to Vote 15, I am not averse from the decision of the Government to abandon the committee on piped water supplies in rural Ireland. I think that problem could be solved much better by doing the actual work in a number of areas and seeing what are the real difficulties which have to be surmounted, but I should like to ask the Minister what steps it was proposed to take in lieu of having this committee in existence.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has provoked me into speaking English, I would like to refer to a certain remark of his here last year when he was speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  He was pointing out the advisability of making money available for credit for farmers to enable them to purchase machinery, fertilisers, and so forth, and he said that the whole thing would not cost any more than £217,000,000.  According to the Minister, that was a mere bagatelle. I wonder is the Minister of the same opinion still.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>His decision to cut down advertisements in the Irish language will save only £400 or £500, as far as I can ascertain, and yet when he talks about agriculture he speaks in terms of £217,000,000.  Of course, I agree it is a good thing to put as much money into agriculture as is possible, but here is what the Minister said :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;£217,000,000 is not a frightening sum.  If this country had been bombed during the war, £217,000,000 would have been very little in the matter of damage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary the change that has come over the Minister since he went from this side of the House to the other side.  We find him very tight-fisted now when he is Minister, but when he was a Deputy sitting on the opposition benches there was no end to the amount of money that he was prepared to spend.  In fact, he thought so little of money that he was accustomed to refer to the money that was invested abroad as so much paper money and, in fact, he more or less upbraided the Government of the day and the Minister for Finance of the time for not doing something in the nature of doing away with those investments altogether, that paper money, as <Col N="1327" /> he used to call it&mdash;waste paper, I think he called it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I, for one, if I saw the Minister prepared to spend money on agriculture, would applaud him, because I believe it would be money very wisely invested.  I am not the only one in this House who believes that because I remember during the general election campaign the present Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Norton, said that it was his policy to make credit available to the farmers, devoid of interest, and, as has been pointed out here before, the Clann na Poblachta people made much the same statement. They were prepared to put any amount of money at the disposal of the farmers. Now, when they are in office, what are they going to do in that direction?</P>
      <P>Deputy O Briain has mentioned the Place Names Commission.  I also deprecate the idea of suspending the operations of that Commission.  The Commission was set up for a very specific and useful purpose&mdash;to collect the place names of the country and give their meaning.  It is work of great national importance.  It should not have been suspended, again for the sake of a very small sum of money.  I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision in that matter and also in regard to advertisements and notices in the Irish language.</P>

There is a need for the revision of the payments made to workers in the Albert College and similar colleges.  There is great dissatisfaction amongst the workers at Albert College with their present rates.  I would ask the Minister to examine the question of grants to these colleges.  As has been stated, they are inadequate to meet the demands which are made upon them.

      <P>Deputies Colley and Cogan raised a point about the restriction of credit by banks, which is said to be prevalent at the moment. This matter was raised in Dáil Éireann on the 15th June of this year, in a question put by Deputy Little, who asked :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;whether the Central Bank or the commercial banks have been advised on the question of the restriction of credit; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I replied in what I thought was a very precise way, but apparently no great notice was taken of it.  I would repeat my reply, in the hope that it may get publicity this time.  I said, in column 935 :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not aware of any advice tendered to the Central Bank on the question of the restriction of credit.  In its last report the Central Bank, in dealing with the need for curbing inflation, mentioned that it was of great importance that the expansion of bank credit should not be aggravated by the granting of <Col N="1329" /> accommodation for speculative or other less necessary purposes, however apparently well secured.  I also understand that on the ocassion of the recent issue of Exchequer Bonds the commercial banks were advised not to grant accommodation to intending subscribers as it was desired that subscriptions should be met out of savings.  The commercial banks have representatives on the board of the Central Bank who are in a position to be continuously aware of the views of the board on this subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what more I can say, but if I may repeat the reply in changed language, I would say I have not been responsible for giving any advice, either directly or through the Central Bank, on the restriction of bank credit.  I doubt very much if I have any function in that matter.  I would like those who think I have any control in that way to examine the legislation and see whether or not there is any power left in a Minister in my position to operate in the way in which it is alleged I am doing.  Many stories have been told to me.  If any one person who has been told by a bank manager or bank agent anywhere that he is restricting credit, on instructions proceeding from me or officials of my Department, I would like to get hold of such a letter and then I can deal with the matter in a concrete way.  I would challenge Deputies to get that information, if they feel it is being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That feeling is general abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what the feeling is.  I am told the bank officials are saying they are acting on instructions. I would like one person in the whole community to bring me information about a particular bank official who has said that.  Then I can deal with it.  I ask that any information that can be procured be transmitted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would point out that the banks have their own problems.  They are operating in a free way and I have nothing to do with it.  They have published statistics regarding their situation <Col N="1330" /> and a bulletin is issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.  People who get certain volumes and make comparisons will see that in March, 1947, the advances inside the State were just short of £56,000,000, while in March, 1948, they had reached £85,500,000. That was a considerable extension of bank credit in that time.  Elsewhere, in bank reports and other literature pertaining to this subject, one will find that bank advances are very definitely up, whereas deposits are down and the assets that are held by banks are down. The result is that banks appear to be lending more, having in the background less assets than they used to have.  It may well be that they have, as a matter of policy, decided that they themselves must take certain steps; and with the wisdom of that I cannot quarrel.  I do not know enough about the situation and I would not be impertinent enough to advise them on the matter at all.  I am dealing with a specific point raised, that there is restriction of bank credit and that it is being attributed to the Central Bank, the impression being that the Central Bank is acting more or less on instructions from me, or that the banks have been directly advised. I have denied that before and would like to deny it again.</P>

      <P>Some of the detailed matters referred to had relation to the Vote for the Secret Service.  That Vote has been very much collapsed this year.  It is one of the Votes under which I am trying to get considerable savings and I hope it will not be very much used.  Deputy Ó Briain, followed by Deputy Kissane, raised a point about the Place Names Commission. What strikes me as odd about this highly important work which is causing so much anguish to Deputies because it has been deferred for a year, is that there was not a bigger agitation about it years ago.  It was late in 1946 before it was ever thought of.  I suppose Deputy Kissane and Deputy Ó Briain had considerable influence in their Party, and they must have had the same views then as they have now on this matter.  I cannot understand, therefore, why it was not brought forward <Col N="1332" /> earlier.  The Deputies apparently remained dumb for 12 or 14 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I am moving from point to point.  It was of such national importance that there was not great turmoil about it until 1946 when it was started.  I am deferring it for a year.  I think it can wait for a year.  There had been a certain amount of agitation about it in the House, but no one argued about the importance of the work before this commission was set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It always was. Again I am back to the point that it did not produce much activity up to the end of 1946.  I want to have a look at that matter.  I want particularly to do this.  There is something in the neighbourhood of £350,000 or £360,000 per year spent on the development of the Irish language in one way or another.  I think it is fairly common ground that there has been very little good got out of that.  I think it is widely accepted that one could get better results from the expenditure of half that sum.  That matter is under consideration at the moment, and, in connection with that particular scheme, this place names commission will be considered.  In the meantime, I am marking time and I think I am entitled to do it.  It is not of real importance.  In a time of plenty it is not a matter on which one would grudge spending a small amount, but in a very critical year like this, particularly in the hurried circumstances of these days, I felt that I was entitled <Col N="1333" /> to defer the work of that commission for a period.  It may be necessary to spend some small amount&mdash;although I am not promising this&mdash;to keep it limping along until a better view can be had of it.</P>
      <P>I was also asked about the piped water scheme which a commission had started to examine.  For the time being that is being deferred.  Some of the commissions under Vote 15 were almost at the end of their work and they will be allowed to complete whatever work they have on their hands, as long as it does not cost too much.  A certain number of these commissions will have their work entirely stopped.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kissane was rather interesting in this matter of Government advertisements. I wish the Deputy would make up his mind on the matter.  Does it do any good to the Irish language to publish advertisements in Irish in areas where Irish is not understood, or at least is not understood by 90 per cent. of the people, or where, if it is understood, the advertisements are not looked at?  Is there any real belief that that is of any good to the Irish language? I do not believe it.</P>

      <P>Because some young people, say around Dublin, will read advertisements, then they ought to be published in Irish as well as in English. The change I want to make is that in the purely Irish-speaking districts any advertisements issued will be issued in Irish and that in the other districts they will be issued in English.  The <Col N="1334" /> Deputy wants me to publish all advertisements in both languages.  If it is, say, an advertisement for a post, Deputy Kissane believes that the person who understands both English and Irish will benefit by having the advertisement issued in Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  A tremendous amount of Government advertisement is wasted.  I am trying to collapse it.  In regard to such advertisements as have to be issued, the proper thing is to make a division and to publish them in the Irish areas in Irish and in the English areas in English.  I cannot see how this is weakening the development of the Irish language.  All these matters will have to be gone into when this whole question of developing the Irish language is under review.  Personally, it will take a great deal of argument to convince me that any good is to be derived from the programme which the Deputy maps out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne raised a question about the labourers in the agricultural college.  I doubt whether there is any authority in the Minister for Finance to regulate that matter.  The Department of Agriculture may have something to say to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> With regard to the question of investing money, I think Deputy Aiken was referring to a reply to a question in which I indicated that certain moneys had been invested in English securities.  Certain moneys had to get speedy investment and there were no Irish securities available for the amount required to be invested. The moneys were, therefore, invested in English securities.  They were invested in a way which is as profitable as if they had been invested in Irish securities.</P>
    <P>As to the general matter which the Deputy spoke about, it is a matter which I should like to thresh out on some occasion on an appropriate debate.  I do not propose to go into it now in any detail.  It was brought in completely, entirely and deliberately as an irrelevancy.  The speech to which the Deputy referred was a speech which I made in connection with what was happening during the war.  I said at that time that it was quite clear that the future value of English investments was likely to be lowered and that a policy had proceeded here of piling up moneys in that type of investment.  I urged at one time that there was likely to be a depreciation in the value of these holdings and that the benefit to be derived was likely to lessen.  Time has proved that I was right.  The capital value of these assets has declined very much.  The situation is undoubtedly different now.  People are taking depreciated moneys and putting them into securities that have depreciated from their own time value.  That is the difference.</P>
    <P>With regard to interest rates and cheap money and the provision of money, I would say that it is a danger at a time when the difficulty is to absorb the amount of purchasing power which is free in the hands of the community. Even if cheap money is a desirable policy generally nobody can claim it to be so in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The matter of the development of agriculture, to which Deputy Cogan referred, is again one of these matters which can be discussed in the light of <Col N="1336" /> the circumstances obtaining at the particular time.  I do not think anybody, outside a lunatic asylum, will go in for flooding the country with a lot of money at the moment, even for good development, without paying attention to the danger of overprinting. I referred to that subject on other occasions and my views were quoted to-day.  The speech from which my views were quoted was one in which I called attention to this danger. It is a fact.  Through questions, I got it brought out to be a fact that money was printed here.  It was printed here when notes were presented by people who came from the other side.  The point is how can it be justified in one set of circumstances when it is an objection in others?  The Deputy apparently has not found the particular answer to that, but I think I have.</P>

As I said in reply to an interruption to a question recently, one cannot change a situation very speedily.  It is a very delicate matter and blundering in on top of it is not a thing I would like to do.</P>

Where was that to go&mdash;either to Irish securities or to <Col N="1337" /> English securities.  As Irish securities were not available they were lodged in the other, but at a good rate of remuneration.  I thought the Deputy was questioning whether or not the money was, in fact, used to pay debts. It was.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not then.  The point is that if you were printing for one purpose why should it not be done for another?  My objection was that what was being done here was that we were accepting inflation that was exported to us from Great Britain and that we were making that easy by the currency situation that had been established under the particular legislation.</P>

    <P>I do not think there is anything special to be said with regard to this Estimate.  Of the total Estimate of £52,740, £48,740 represents annual grants provided under Section 25 (1) of the Act for the administration of the institute and expenses of constituent schools.  The allocation is £8,390 for general expenses of administration; £14,985 for Celtic Studies; £9,370 for Theoretical Physics, and £16,070 for Cosmic Physics.  A token vote for the School of Historical Research, which has not yet been established, is <Col N="1347" /> included and the remainder, £4,000, is provided under Section 16 (5) of the Act for further reconstruction on Dunsink Observatory in the current financial year.

      <P>The details of this Estimate are, I think, of little interest to the Deputies. The actual Estimate shows a decrease on last year of £740, mainly due to a reduction in travelling expenses.  There has been one change in the staff of the Department.  The office of personal secretary to the Taoiseach has been abolished and the position of assistant principal has been created instead of that particular office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate, as Deputies are aware, provides an opportunity for the discussion on certain aspects of general Governmental policy.  The practice which was adopted by my predecessors over a long number of years was for the Taoiseach just formally to move the Estimate and then to leave the field open to Deputies to raise the points of Government policy which they wished to debate.  It has been usual to give notice to the Chair of a general idea of the points of policy which would be the subject matter of discussion.  That practice has been departed from this year and I have at the moment no information or notice of the topics which it is intended to discuss.  I propose, therefore, to adhere to the practice of my predecessor and, having formally moved this Vote, to leave it to the Deputies to discuss the matters which they wish <Col N="1348" /> to raise.  That practice is all the more justifiable this year by reason of the fact that, owing to the change of Government, there have been very full and detailed discussions on the Estimates. Those discussions ranged over all aspects of Government policy in a way that was perhaps more full and comprehensive than in previous years.  I do not think Deputies will expect me to give an elaborate account of Government policy by way of introduction to this Estimate and, accordingly, I propose to adhere to the usual practice.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I think I should advert to on this Estimate, and that is the change in connection with the use of a car by the Taoiseach.  An allowance of £350 was made to my predecessor for the running of his private car for official purposes and, as already intimated, for reasons personal to myself, which I shall give if required, I have been obliged to depart from that practice.  I think Deputy Cowan takes an unusual interest in that aspect of the matter, but it is capable of a simple explanation if he requires it.  I do not think I could usefully add anything to what I have said, but I am prepared to deal with any matters of Government policy raised in the debate.</P>

      <P>I move :&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I do so for the purpose of initiating a debate on the general trend of Government policy as it has developed during the past five months.  It is desirable that the Dáil should be given the opportunity to look at Government policy as a whole, and to consider its consequences, both on the political and economic position of the country.  I do not propose to refer to matters of detail, except in so far as they appear to have relation to the general policy or to the extent that they may not have been fully discussed in debates on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everywhere I go I meet people who ask me how long is this set-up going to last?  That question is asked by people in all walks of life, and of all <Col N="1349" /> political opinions.  Deputies opposite cannot be unaware of the fact that there is a general desire in the country that the Government should get out of office as quickly as possible.  If they are not aware of that, they should be, and the only explanation is that they are being misled by the Party associates on whom they must rely for information as to the trend of opinion in the country.  I want to state that I have met in recent weeks many people who supported one or other of the Parties now constituting the Coalition, whose sole desire was to see this set-up brought to an end at the earliest possible date.  That opinion is not prevalent merely amongst those who supported the candidates of Fianna Fáil at the recent election.  It is widespread throughout the country.  I think it is rapidly growing in volume, and is a factor that the Taoiseach should take into account if he does review the general trend of policy and the general results of administration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Let me say that the opinion I find prevalent amongst all classes of people did not exist two months ago.  Then there was amongst sections of the people the general feeling that the Government, which had emerged from the election, should be given a chance, that it was unlikely they could do much harm and, even though they could not do much good, it was just as well to demonstrate that fact by allowing them to hold office for a reasonable period. That feeling of tolerance&mdash;good-humoured tolerance&mdash;of the Coalition Government has completely disappeared. It is being replaced by something approaching anger, real irritation, that the arrangement is lasting so long, and is so disastrous to many interests, as it has already proved to be.  I am talking of economic interests of various kinds throughout the country, including all classes of people, right down to the most humble.</P>
    <P>I think it is time the Taoiseach should ask himself what has happened to have changed that attitude of the people towards the Government.  It has not happened without some cause. If he is losing support, and losing the good-will or tolerance of large sections <Col N="1350" /> of the people, in the remarkably short period of five months, it is because during that five months the Government has been misgoverning the country, and that the fact is recognised by an increasing number of people.  I would have thought it unlikely that the Government could have made itself so unpopular in such a short time.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the change of Government took place, I was the first of the Deputies on these benches to advise our supporters that the Government was not likely to leave office for a longer period than many of them anticipated.  I visualised members of the Executive Council meeting in the Government chamber with only one idea in their minds, and that was to hold together irrespective of the compromises they had to make, one to another, in order to get that result.  I saw them postponing decisions, dodging awkward problems, and leaving unsettled many urgent national questions in their determination to hang together as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I can discuss this question of the growing unpopularity of the Government more or less in an impartial way.  I did not expect it to develop as rapidly as it did, and I am anxious to point out to members of the Government the reasons for it, as I see them.  I have on more than one occasion heard Ministers talk about the new spirit of freedom in the country.  That word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; is often misused.  A ship that is normally tied up to a quay, which breaks the tie rope, starts to drift around and could be described as having gained freedom. I think that is the type of freedom this country has gained.</P>
    <P>There is everywhere amongst our people the sense that we are drifting without guidance, that we are not getting from the Government the leadership we are entitled to expect, and that there has been very little effort made by any Minister to place before our people clearly defined objectives, either in the political or economic sphere, accompanied by practical proposals for their realisation.  Whenever any one Minister attempts to define some limited objective in a public utterance, he is, in a very short <Col N="1351" /> time, flatly contradicted by another.  It is that sense of drifting, that knowledge that there is a complete absence of leadership which is, I think, primarily responsible for the growing desire that this set-up should be ended as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies who attended here during the debates on the various Estimates will be fully conscious of the fact that there is a complete absence of consistent policy in any sphere.  We have had evidence of that only this week, evidence that decisions taken by the Government, taken hastily, no doubt, and announced as Government policy, have been reversed equally hastily.  I do not know why it is that earlier decisions taken by the Government and announced during the financial debates by the Minister for Finance have been reconsidered.  I cannot hope that that reconsideration was due to the growth of wisdom in the Government councils. I cannot hope it is because they have now discovered that these decisions were wrong in the national interest and should be reversed.  I suspect they found they were unpopular and the sole determining factor in all their actions is political popularity.</P>
    <P>The evidence of a clear conflict of outlook between Ministers was again demonstrated within the past fortnight by the speeches we heard from the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was demonstrated on many occasions in casual references by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Local Government.  At one time the Government appear to have had the idea that in this Dáil, Party politics would have a smaller part than in previous Dála.  I think there is no Deputy on any side of the House who has had experience of previous Dála who will not agree with me that this is by far the most political of them all; that to an extent which never before existed, purely Party tactical considerations have governed the course of debates and governed the decisions arrived at here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I mean that questions of national interest are being subordinated to purely Party tactical considerations.  The absence of leadership, the evidence of drift, is also to be found in the fact that the Government is, on all major questions, obviously trying to shift the responsibility for taking decisions from itself. We used to have many sarcastic speeches here from these benches in the past by members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party about the appointment of Government commissions. We were often asked to take down out of the dust-covered pigeonholes in Government offices the reports of commissions which sat in the past. Nowadays, nothing is being done until some commission or committee or expert or individual has been asked to report on it, and the sole reason for that device is to shift from the Government to those commissions or individuals the responsibility for the course of action that is to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that that desire to shift responsibility off the shoulders of Ministers to people who are not in this Dáil and cannot be criticised in the Dáil was again demonstrated only to-day by the announcement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that a committee has been set up to consider the question of food subsidies, a committee consisting of a chairman, the Attorney-General, who, no doubt, is an expert upon food subsidies; a Dublin accountant and an official of the Revenue Commissioners.  Will any Deputy seriously suggest that there is to be found in a body so composed a knowledge of all the problems associated with the subsidisation of foodstuffs which does not exist in Government Departments, and which should exist already in the minds of Ministers?  It is quite clear the Government has taken a decision, but it is not anxious to carry the responsibility for that decision and, therefore, it is shifting it on to the shoulders of this preposterous committee which is being asked to advise the Government on one matter of major policy which, if it is to be decided anywhere outside the Cabinet <Col N="1353" /> Chamber, should be decided in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>More than in any other sphere, evidence of lack of leadership, lack of concrete policy and aim, is to be found in external affairs.  There is no Deputy in the House who does not feel that the present international situation is one fraught with grave dangers to this country.  If there is any Deputy who has reason to think that there is not danger of a most urgent and real kind in that situation, he should tell us and give us the reason why he so thinks.  Has any Minister, on any one occasion, spoken to the Dáil about the international situation?  Has anyone of them attempted to bring to our people a realisation that in that situation they may be called upon, and called upon soon, to take decisions of the gravest kind?  Even if we are to avoid these grave decisions until they are forced upon us by events, should we not now be making the material preparations which would to some extent minimise the dangers which that situation offers to this country?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday to give us some information as to whether any action was being taken in his Department, which is the one most directly concerned in matters which would clearly arise if there is a risk of international war, and I expressed my surprise that he had not chosen to do so in his introductory speech.  He did not even do so in reply to my invitation in his concluding speech.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach is there any effort being made by any Department of the Government to take steps which would appear to be reasonable and necessary to minimise the dangers of the international situation, should they develop.  Has there been any discussion by the Government of the problems which these international dangers may cause to this country?  Have any decisions been taken on them and, if so, what are they?  The people are entitled to answers to these questions, and so are the members of the Dáil. The policy of sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring what is taking place around them, may not infrequently <Col N="1354" /> be practised by individuals; but it is the height of folly for any Government to think that it serves either national purposes or Party purposes.</P>
    <P>When this Government was first appointed by the Dáil the Taoiseach left here to visit the headquarters of Radio Éireann.  There he made a broadcast on the policy of his Government. He said in that speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision of work, adequate food and decent housing are the immediate aims of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us examine how, during the period of office, the Government have proceeded towards the realisation of their immediate aims.  We will not ask if they have achieved them, because we know they have not, but let us see if we can find from the history of events within the past few months if they have been trying to realise these aims.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of work, we know that the number of registered unemployed has been, during the whole period the Government have been in office, from 5,000 to 6,000 each week above the number of last year. Deputies can choose to ignore that fact if they like, but it is one which is known to the public because, in accordance with the practice established by the Fianna Fáil Government, the unemployment statistics collected from the employment exchanges are published weekly.  These figures were not published during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  In fact, during that period, it was impossible, even by parliamentary question, to extract from Ministers reliable information concerning our unemployment problem.  The Fianna Fáil Government decided to reverse that policy.  They decided that if the Government was to get the necessary public co-operation in the execution of a policy designed to minimise unemployment and increase the number of opportunities for work here, the first step was to tell the public all the facts.  So we had not merely the weekly publication of unemployment statistics, but we set up a committee which prepared and published annually a comprehensive review of the whole <Col N="1355" /> employment and unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, there is no other Government in the world that does that, no other Government that gives to its public representatives and its people the same full information concerning that aspect of the nation's business.  Because these statistics are published, we know that whatever causes have been operating, the number of registered unemployed has increased over last year.  It is not merely the fact that the number of registered unemployed has moved upwards that is causing us concern.  It is the apparent indifference of the Government to the consequences of their policy upon employment.  They have taken decisions which have put people out of employment.  They have justified these decisions on the plea of the need for economy or some such other plea but they appear to be completely indifferent to their effect on the individual who, in one week, was able to earn enough to provide a livelihood for his family and who, the next week, because of their action, was queueing up at the employment exchange to draw his unemployment assistance benefit.</P>
    <P>We had during the election a great deal of talk about full employment and many assurances that the Parties now comprised in the Coalition had the secret of full employment.  What is the secret?  Is it to be found in the deflationary policy which the Minister for Finance has announced he is operating? Can one imagine, under any circumstances, a policy of monetary deflation being linked up with a programme of full employment?  Surely what the Minister ought to try to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We shall leave the question of my competence aside.  Just now, I am dealing with the question of <Col N="1356" /> the competence of certain individuals sitting in front of Deputy Collins.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear that he is pursuing this deflationary policy for the purpose of achieving certain stated results in relation to prices and wages.  Is that not so?  He spoke here in the Dáil about the undesirability of wage increases, about the heavy burden which the present wage levels constitute for Irish economy.  He spoke in the Seanad and warned traders and manufacturers that, if they did not voluntarily reduce prices, it was possible for him through the manipulation of financial policy to force them to do so and he is doing so.</P>
      <P>We have been assured that the contraction of credit which is now being operated by the commercial banks is not in consequence of any direct order from the Government.  We must accept that assurance, but I think it is not unfair to say that the policy which the banks are pursuing, pursuing no doubt in their own interest, has been inspired or encouraged by the declarations made both here and in the Seanad by the Minister for Finance. The banks are people who deal in money and it is in their interest to enhance the value of money.  Those who direct the policy of the Irish banks are, in the main, people who have not absorbed any new ideas since long before Lord Keynes revolutionised economic thought by his writings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have failed to grasp the fact that a deflationary policy, even though it may enhance the value of money and in course of time enable them to increase the interest they can charge on advances, nevertheless, because it is a policy that is detrimental to the economic interests of the country as a whole, is one that is also detrimental to their own long-term interests. These mid-Victorian economic principles which are being implemented by the banks were expressed here as Government policy by the Minister for Finance.  They are producing the same results on trade and unemployment as any person with a rudimentary knowledge of modern economic thought could have forecast.  There is, as everybody knows, stagnation in <Col N="1357" /> business.  In every branch of commerce people are reporting a general decline in trade.  That is not due, as some Deputies have suggested, to the inadequate height of our tariff barriers or to the undue importation of goods in recent periods from abroad.  The cause is much more fundamental than that.  That stagnation in trade, that reluctance to acquire stocks, that disinclination to make commitments far ahead, is to be attributed, in the main, to the general lack of confidence in the future which exists throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the Minister for Finance has deliberately set out to create trade stagnation.  We all heard him advise people to stop buying. He told the people that it was in their interest to stop spending money, except upon the minimum quantities of the barest necessities, for at least 12 months, and he promised them that at the end of that period, if they did so, there might be lower prices, lower wages and a general easing of the tax burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  On the contrary, I am convinced that our circumstances are not paralleled by those of Great Britain and that they are entirely dissimilar to those of the United States.  They were, all during the war.  There are factors at work here which are not at work in either of these countries and any deflationary policy here can only produce benefits for this country at a cost of hardships which we should not be asked to bear. The hardships will not be suffered by Ministers or Deputies or by those with cash reserves, but by those who are dependent on their weekly earnings, that large and respectable body of men, the men of no property, who are the first to suffer in a trade slump and who are the obvious victims of the policy which the Minister for Finance is trying to force on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Parties which constitute the Government set before the country as their immediate aim <Col N="1358" /> the increasing of opportunities for work in this country.  They have failed in that.  They made excuses for their failure on one ground or another, but the fact that they have failed, up to now, cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Turn, then, to the second of their immediate aims&mdash;the provision of adequate food.  We have this new committee now to consider the question of food subsidies and it is quite obvious that the appointment of that committee is leading up to their withdrawal.  That may be a further benefit to the publicans and to others who expect to get tax remissions in consequence of the withdrawal of the subsidies, but I would ask Deputies to relate that, on the one hand, to the human suffering it will cause in present circumstances and, on the other hand, to the promises they made to electors who put them where they are now.  Did they tell the electors that they were going to withdraw food subsidies?  Did they tell them that the interest of the country requires a policy of deflation?  They know quite well they did not, and they should at least go back to the public and ask for a renewal of their mandate on their new policy.  They know they are not carrying out the policy which they asked the people to endorse when they sought election.  If they think they are justified in reversing that policy, if they believe that they know more now about the nation's business than they thought they knew before, surely democratic principles require that they should go back to the electors and ask for a mandate on their new policy and see if they will get it.</P>

      <P>He must have been reading the speeches of the Minister for Justice.  He has also recanted a little.  As regards food, we know that prices have risen.  The price of meat has gone up.  We are told that the price of bread is to go up by ½d. per 4 lb. loaf and we know that the prices of other foodstuffs have also risen. The necessity for that rise in prices was a direct consequence of Government decisions, as in the case of margarine and oatmeal, where the subsidies previously paid were withdrawn. That increase in the price of essential foodstuffs is, we are told, offset by the reduction in the price of drink. Deputies, apparently, think it is good policy to put our people in this position that, assuming their incomes remain unchanged, they can buy less food but can buy more drink.  I do not think so.  Nobody wanted to increase taxation on drink, tobacco or anything else.  It was done here last year for one purpose, and one purpose only, and that was to give the Government the money by which they could subsidise food prices.  We thought it good policy to allow the prices of drink and tobacco to be raised if, by doing so, we could bring down the prices of essential things like bread. Now, the price of drink is back to the 1947 level, and the Attorney-General is presiding over a committee to consider by how much the Government can allow the price of bread to go up.</P>
      <P>As a result of all these actions on the part of the Government and their effect upon the cost of living, the country is now facing a third round of demands for increased wages.  If these demands are conceded, and in many cases they have already been conceded, then prices will rise further still, and the whole inflationary spiral, which we took drastic and unpopular measures to check last year, will be again moving.  That also has to be placed on the debit side of the balance sheet when we tot up the accounts of the Coalition Government for five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that he hopes to be able to import enough wheat to maintain the bread ration for 12 months at its present level.  He told us that on the <Col N="1360" /> day on which the British Government announced that they were abolishing bread rationing.  I am anxious to get from the Taoiseach some information as to what happened in London where the questions of our drawings upon the sterling area dollar pool, and the utilisation of dollar resources for grain purchases, were discussed with the British Government.  When he agreed to restrict our dollar expenditure to the minimum, pending a determination of the amount of Marshall Plan aid that we are to receive, and to keep in the closest consultation with the British Government concerning our purchases of grain, did they tell him that they were going to abolish bread rationing? If they did tell him that they were going to abolish bread rationing in Britain, did he say to them &ldquo;that we want to do the same thing in Ireland and that we will draw on the dollar pool to whatever extent is necessary to enable us to do just as they are doing?&rdquo; Did he ask the British Government to use their undoubted influence with the International Emergency Food Council which, presumably, must be allocating to Great Britain enough wheat to enable them to abolish rationing, on our behalf so that they would also allocate to this country sufficient wheat to enable our rationing to be ended? Does the Taoiseach regard it as a desirable situation that, in relation to a commodity which must be purchased, in the main, in dollar areas and from a fund of dollars which is regarded as the common reserve of the whole sterling area, that one of the countries in that area should be able to carry through a programme of expenditure which will enable it to abolish rationing, whereas the most that we can hope for&mdash;for 12 months ahead&mdash;is to get enough wheat to maintain bread and flour distribution at the present levels?</P>
    <P>After these London negotiations the Taoiseach, at a Press conference, was asked if he would state what were the reasons which justified an earlier statement of his that anxiety concerning the international currency position had been allayed, and he said he would not answer the question.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that is a question which a Deputy is entitled to ask and to which he should expect a reply?  Surely this is a matter of vital national interest which determines not merely the level of supplies for ordinary individual consumption but also the maintenance of business activity upon its present level.  If his anxieties have been allayed, surely he should publish in some form the circumstances which allayed them, and thereby allay the anxiety which prevails amongst the business community and the population generally.  This dictatorial attitude which the Taoiseach is now taking up is completely contrary to his earlier declarations about an experiment in democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third of the immedidate aims of the Government was stated to be housing.  I am not going to minimise the difficulties which are inherent in any adequate housing programme.  I will put on record the fact that the Dublin Corporation will build in this <Col N="1362" /> year under the Coalition Government houses for the workers to the number of 500, and that in the average pre-war year they built 2,000.  We never regarded 2,000 as a sufficient output of houses of that type.  It represented the maximum capacity of the building industry in Dublin at the time, and efforts were being made to expand the capacity of the building industry.  It is impossible to convince me, or, I think, any Deputy in the Dáil, that even allowing for the present difficulties&mdash; the restriction of supplies, the inadequate numbers of skilled workers&mdash;that 500 working class houses is the maximum output possible for the building industry in Dublin at the present time. That is the estimated output as announced by the chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an increase on last year's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the figure announced by the chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee. So far as the need for houses is concerned, there is no difference of opinion amongst us.  Any point that I want to make on this matter is related to the declarations which the Deputies opposite made prior to and during the election: that the output of houses for workers was being restricted by the Fianna Fáil administration either through malice or through a desire to divert building materials to luxury hotels and other structures of that kind. They have now responsibility and they now control building materials.  They have in their hands all the machinery of control which the Fianna Fáil Government built up, and I say to them that they have not demonstrated, by results, that it is possible for them to speed up the rate of producing workers' houses by one per month since they came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to minimise the facts or suggest that we could get back this year or even next year to the pre-war output rate, but I want them to admit that they have discovered now that their allegations against the Fianna Fáil administration were completely <Col N="1363" /> unfounded.  They just did not know what they were talking about.  I want them to admit that, now that they have got all the power, all the control and all the machinery, they cannot do one whit better and that, in fact, Fianna Fáil were doing all that could be done.  Has there been one single Order made by any Minister to change in any way the machinery of control from the way he found it with regard to building houses?</P>

      <P>Early on in the life of this Coalition Government we had this talk about an &ldquo;experiment in democracy&rdquo;.  I doubt if there is a single Deputy sitting opposite who did not use this phrase in some connection or other.  Nobody objects to an experiment; nobody should be criticised for trying an experiment; they should only be criticised when they persist in an experiment long after it has proven to be a failure. The &ldquo;experiment in democracy&rdquo; which this Coalition Government represent has proven to be a failure and it should, therefore, be ended as quickly as possible.  That is common-sense. I do not know that the Deputies who used this phrase, &ldquo;an experiment in democracy&rdquo;, used it precisely to suggest that this particular type of combination would be more effective in promoting the material interests of this country than any other.  They used it more frequently in relation to the manner in which business in the Dáil was to be conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the Coalition Government would be open to criticism from all sides, that Deputies would be free to express their opinions by voice or vote according to their own consciences; the Coalition Government did not necessarily regard itself as bound to vacate office if it were defeated upon some vote regarding a question of administration which did not imply an obvious loss of confidence in it.  Has there been one occasion since the 18th February upon which a single Deputy opposite&mdash;with one exception&mdash;voted <Col N="1364" /> against the Government? The one Deputy who did was promptly expelled from his Party. Has there ever been a majority in this Dáil as completely regimented as the majority which now sits behind the Government?  Was there ever before an occasion in the political history of this country where one Party at its annual convention announced solemnly its policy on a matter of public interest, with regard to the establishment of a short-wave broadcasting station, and then within a few weeks, under the lash of the coalition Whips and the rigid discipline imposed on them in the Coalition Government, went into the Division Lobby to vote against its establishment?  Did we not see where on the Local Elections Bill a Deputy proposed an amendment and then, having listened to a most plausible although completely inadequate explanation by the Coalition Minister, voted against his own amendment when it was put to a division? Such a thing never happened before and it justifies the statement that the coalition majority are far more closely regimented than ever the Fianna Fáil majority was, or than even the Cumann na nGaedheal majority was in the days prior to the Fianna Fáil Government.  During the lifetime of Fianna Fáil here there were many instances of individual Deputies voting against their Party on particular divisions.  They were, no doubt, spoken to severely by the Whips later on, but the one single Coalition Deputy who did it&mdash;it was like a bombshell&mdash;was passed out of his Party so quickly that nobody knew what was happening to him.  Let that be a lesson to the rest of us.</P>

      <P>It should be a good lesson, and that is what it was intended to be.  The one Deputy who showed a spark of independence was squashed quickly to prevent the risk of his escapade being repeated by another coalition Deputy.  They realised that if they did not jump quickly on the first fellow it would not be long until there was a second.  I do not know who the second will be.  Deputy Flanagan was <Col N="1365" /> discussing political events with a constituent of his and the constituent said to him: &ldquo;Mr. Flanagan, you will be the first out of the Coalition Government.&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Deputy Flanagan, &ldquo;I will be the second.&rdquo;  I am not saying that he is going to be the second, but there are some signs of weakness over there among Deputies who still have a conscience.  I say give the country a chance.  Get out of office. You have done enough harm as it is.</P>

I am sure that many of those who voted originally for the Coalition Government regret their decision now.  It can be brought to an end by any group of you, certainly by any Party.  The country requires that it should end and I would ask you on this motion to vote against the Taoiseach and his policy and to give the country that chance it is asking for.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.&rdquo;  We hear Deputy Lemass ranting and raving about the failure of the Coalition Government policy when there is only one worse thing that could happen to the country than a Fianna Fáil Government and that is another one.  If there is any real thing to be said in favour of the present Coalition Government, it is the puerility of the argument which Deputy Lemass puts up against it.  He has been very loud-voiced, talking about &ldquo;an experiment in democracy&rdquo; but Deputy Lemass, his Party leader and his Party understand nothing about democracy.  He talks about the Coalition being regimented as thoroughly as Fianna Fáil were.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Fianna Fáil were so thoroughly regimented. <Col N="1366" /> I think that in the main they were too stupid to be anything else because the evidence of what they did in this country during their 16 years in office when they could only pick out of their Party the Ministers they did pick and when they could only give the country the service they did give it, is proof enough of what the intelligence was, in the main, of that organisation. I stand here to-day, a young Deputy in the &ldquo;new set-up&rdquo;, as Deputy Lemass likes to talk of it, and I am proud to be in that &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; because it has taken this country out of a morass of stupidity, exuberance, extravagance and ignorance.  Deputy Lemass talks about work.  First of all, he apparently deprecates the Minister for Finance's effort to encourage Irish people to save money.  He misquoted the Minister first.  The Minister's advice to the Irish people was that they should, where possible, save money and do without certain commodities with a view to getting better value and a better type of commodity for the same money at a later stage.  He comes in and he moans and he groans about restriction on credit.  Why should much of the hoarding that we have not heard much about be forced on the market now to benefit the poor unfortunate person whose extra profits would go?  Is it because some friends of the former Government, who were not slow about supporting it, are now going to feel the pinch when they have to run a business on a sound economic basis?</P>
      <P>Crocodile tears do not look too good from Deputy Lemass.  He has said that five months have proved this Coalition wrong.  Let him disabuse his mind.  I am young and Deputy Lemass is alleged to be an elder statesman.  Allow me to disabuse his mind now&mdash;I will tell him what five months have proved. They have proved that there is a freedom, a hope in this country that a continuation of Fianna Fáil would have squelched for all time.  The Deputy may be crying for an election now because, rapidly disintegrating behind him, are the Fianna Fáil clubs he can no longer give everything to.  Look around at the facts for yourself.</P>

The decent thing for Fianna Fáil to do is to realise that they are &ldquo;bet&rdquo; and that they are going to stay &ldquo;bet&rdquo;.  We all here can honestly subscribe to one real principle, and I am not ashamed to announce it here in Dáil Éireann, on this, the first, opportunity I have had to discuss the Vote for the Taoiseach, that the experiment in democracy, as he calls it, represents for me a hope which I will follow and persevere in following, so long as I can keep the danger and the menace of a return of Fianna Fáil out of the lives of my country people.  That is what I have been sent here to do; that is what West Cork has asked me to do; and that is what I am going to do.  We never shouted &ldquo;Up, Dev&rdquo;, down there, and we never will.</P>
      <P>Let Deputy Lemass criticise what way he will the action of Deputies in supporting this Coalition Government, but let him take it from me, with all the earnestness and the sin of youth which apparently his Party so much deprecates, that, so long as a Government can be gathered together under the leadership of such a Taoiseach, men working together to find out what they can agree on, and not what they can disagree on, men with the wish to help their country and to co-operate with its citizens in their various avocations and walks of life to that end, then, unashamedly and unhesitatingly, my place will be behind the Taoiseach in any Division Lobby into which he asks me to go, not because I will be regimented, but because I think I would be a party to one of the basest possible betrayals of this country if any temporary stupidity of mine should allow the catastrophe of a return of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that merely for the sake of saying it.  I say it with all the earnestness that is in me, and I will go further and say that, with the people I have met throughout my constituency and other parts of the country, from day to day, the stature of the Taoiseach grows mightier and mightier, because <Col N="1368" /> gathering behind this Government is a volume of thought which is now unshackled and able to express itself and which is rapidly telling Deputy Lemass and his former ministerial colleagues that their <i>Nunc dimittis</i> is in earnest.</P>

There are lots of things which Deputy <Col N="1369" /> Davin and others think should be done.  They spent the past four or five years telling the people that, if they could only get Fianna Fáil out, they could build in a year or so all the houses required, could drain all the land, cure everybody of every disease, reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. and reduce taxation by half.</P>

      <P>I will quote for Deputy Davin, lest he might have forgotten it, the reason he put Deputy McGilligan in as Minister for Finance.  When some poor Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance pleaded that everything could not be done overnight, and that, if you wanted to have a crop from your farm, you could not spend the whole year building the house, that capital development ought to proceed at such a rate as would allow the community to make the current production for current consumption.  Any plea like that would not satisfy Deputy Davin. He thought: Print the money and you can build all the houses you want, grow all the wheat you want, make all the boots you want and do it all at the <Col N="1370" /> same time with the same people. Here is the type of stuff that made Deputy Davin vote for Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not.  I said I was quoting Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy Davin cannot put me off drawing this moral and pointing this lesson by a simple quibble as to whom I am quoting.  Deputy Davin's idea as well as Deputy McGilligan's idea was that if there was any job here to be done that was worth doing you should not be stopped for want of money because all you had to do was to print the money. All over the country you had from every platform during the last general election people like Deputy Davin and the Clann na Poblachta and the Minister for Finance yapping about what they would do with free credits.  I used to take a busman's holiday coming from Louth back through the city during the general election.  I used to go to some <Col N="1371" /> of the public meetings that were being held by the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta and Fine Gael.  I was deafened with free credits, and with the suggestion, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil, this atrocity of a Government, will not build you houses.  Put us in and we will go to the Central Bank and get all the money we want.  We will not go short of money, like these people.  We will double your wages.  We will print money.&rdquo;  Where is all that gone?  Did the experiment in democracy kill it? Why cannot the Government live up to the promises of the various members who support it in that regard?  Why, instead of creating free credits and printing money, did they increase the rate of interest for loans to public authorities beyond what the Fianna Fáil Government did?  Why did they take money from our people and invest it in what the Minister for Finance used to call waste paper?  £3,750,000 more of Government fund money was put into British securities between the 18th February and the 18th June.  Did Deputy Davin ask his pet why he bought so much waste paper in that time?</P>

      <P>Did Deputy Davin, I repeat, ask the Minister for Finance why he bought an extra £3,750,000 worth of what he used to call waste paper?  Did Deputy Davin ask the Minister for Finance why it was that, instead of issuing free credit and giving loans free of interest to all the local authorities to build the houses, they increased the rate of interest from 2½ to 3¼ per cent.?  Deputy Davin may be silent here; he can refuse to answer me, but there are a lot of people in the country who are looking for the answer to that question.</P>

Deputy Davin can, I hope, intervene in this debate and tell us what is the mystery, why when the Minister for Finance used to condemn investments of Irish money in waste paper, he bought £3,750,000 more as soon as he came into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why, when there is plenty of good work to be done, instead of printing the notes, they cut down the good work by refusing the money for it.  In the Budget speech the Minister for Finance made a statement which has caused a lot of trouble since.  The Minister for Finance refused to be candid with the people as to how he was going to make the savings that he promised to make.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are going to save another £1,220,000 in ways in which it would be premature to disclose until the money is safely in the net.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ever since he has been afraid to disclose the means.  In many instances he has been afraid to disclose that he is making savings on projects that are useful in themselves.  He made a miserable saving of £500 on publishing Irish advertisements.  He has made savings of £1,000 here and there that have come out.  But he put the Minister for Agriculture to the pin of his collar to cover up the savings that were being made by the Minister for Agriculture at the instance of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Agriculture this year is going to save on farm improvement schemes and farm building schemes somewhere in the region of £500,000 or £750,000. That was one of the things that the Minister for Finance dare not admit to the country that they were going to <Col N="1373" /> save money on.  Surely, if ever there was a good purpose for which Irish money is required, it is the development and the capital improvement of our land and farm buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years past, in spite of the fact that Fianna Fáil was a very niggardly Government, we spent more than was estimated for on land improvement schemes.  At the end of the war, I told the Minister for Agriculture not to be restricted to the £350,000 that was in the Estimates for that purpose, but that I would announce and give him out of the Transition Development Fund sufficient to cover all the applications made to him under the farm improvements scheme.  We were urged very strongly to spend money on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance intervened in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture last year. On the 18th June, 1947, he referred to the fact that our farmers were under-capitalised. He quoted reports from many sources to prove that.  He quoted a report from Dr. Kennedy stating that farms were under-capitalised to the extent of £217,000,000.  The Minister for Finance, who now forces the Minister for Agriculture to save a mere bagatelle of £500,000, or £750,000, who upset a whole policy for the sake of saving £500, suggested last year that we should spend £217,000,000 as quickly as we could on farm development and he cooed to us: &ldquo;£217,000,000 is not a frightening sum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was talk like that, from people like the Minister for Finance and Deputy Davin and members of Clann na Poblachta, that led our people to be very discontented with their lot and take all possible steps to secure as a Government in the general election the people who were going to do these things for them.  Are they going to let down the people who voted for them?</P>

      <P>Physically, it is quite easy to carry out a number of the promises that were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If those promises in relation to finance&mdash;unlimited free credits, unlimited notes&mdash;were unwise, it is up to the Deputies who made the promises to the people to retract and to point out the unwisdom of it, to point out to them that, in a situation where there is a shortage of goods, you only do harm if you increase the amount of money without using it for the purpose of producing more goods. The Deputies may smile at the way they deceived the people, but remember that, as members of a Government with responsibility, members of a Party responsible for keeping that Government in operation, their own comfort as human beings in such a situation depends to a large extent on whether they are now prepared to tell the people the truth and tell them where their theories went wrong.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Finance tell the people that there is a difference in printing a note for circulation here, in exchange for a foreign note handed in to purchase native currency, that there is a difference between that transaction and merely printing notes <i>ad lib</i>?  Even here to-day the Minister for Finance, in the debate on his Estimate, said that there was no difference between printing a note and handing it out in exchange for a British note and in handing it out for no return whatever, to use it, let us say, for Government expenses.  Can it be that our people are committed to government by men who are so crazy as not to see the difference?  If they do see the difference, surely it is up to them to tell the people the truth?  No one can be blamed for having wrong ideas in the past, provided that when he sees the truth, he is man enough to admit it, and to admit it to the people whom he deceived by telling an untruth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and other Ministers make the babyish excuse, on occasions, that they have not done <Col N="1375" /> this, that or the other thing, because it would require legislation.  Sometimes, when they are put in a corner, they allege that it would be necessary to pass legislation in order to carry out an administrative policy that obviously requires no further legislation. They deny that they have the legal power to do things which they have the legal power to do, and they do so for the purpose of deceiving a number of people throughout the country.  Why is it that the passage of legislation should stop the Government from doing anything they think is right in the interests of the people? They have a well-machined majority, there are none of the inter-Party groups going to desert the Government in any legislation they might like to pass.  They have all decided that they are going to hang together, as they know that the alternative is to hang separately; and if the Government wants to pass any piece of legislation, for the purpose of giving it legal power to do things which at the present moment it has not the power to do, they can quite confidently bring it before the House, pass it through this Dáil and pass it through the Seanad.  It is time they dropped that excuse.  It is time that they should admit, if there are things which they want to do and which require legislation, that it is within their political power to do them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the worst form of excuse given by various members of the inter-Party Government when going around the country.  Deputy Davin will say to his cronies:&mdash;&ldquo;I would love to print notes, but the Taoiseach would not let me.&rdquo; Deputy Davin has only to threaten to withdraw himself and his few cronies from the Coalition Government to get them to print the notes.  Deputy Davin has the power to force the Government to do what he requires them to do. That is another excuse which should be dropped by members of the coalition groups.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane went around the country talking about the bloody British Empire in which we were sunk, and how he was going to tear us out <Col N="1376" /> of it.  Yesterday, his leader, the Minister for External Affairs, had to admit that we were not in it, but he was not man enough to say that, as we were not in the British Empire we were not in the United Kingdom, we must be an independent republic.  He is keeping that sort of excuse for a future occasion. Deputy Lehane, who is the mouthpiece here for the Minister for External Affairs on many occasions, said that we could not send a representative to the Argentine without getting the signature of the British King to his credentials.  There is not a tittle of truth in that.  It is only an excuse for Deputy Lehane.</P>

Deputy Lehane and the rest of the boys are trying to fool some of their supporters into the belief that the reason the new Minister to the Argentine will go there with the British King's signature to his credentials is because they are legally compelled to do it.  If from this day forward a representative of this country goes to any foreign country with the British King's signature on his credentials, it is not because the Government have not the legal power and the constitutional right to send him without that signature.  It is because the Minister for Agriculture or Deputy Davin would not let the Minister for External Affairs accredit him in that way.</P>

Let the Deputies be truthful and say that if our representative goes to the Argentine with the British King's signature on his credentials it is not because they are compelled by law to do it, but because the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach would not let them do it.

If the Clann na Poblachta Party want to see the next Ministerial representative of Ireland going, say, to the Argentine without the British King's credentials, they have a way of achieving that purpose.  Nine men can do it. They asked the people to give MacBride the reins of Government, as it was put.  Mr. MacBride denied that such an advertisement existed, but he had to admit it when I brought in the advertisements and put them before the House.  The people, by a queer accident, did give MacBride the reins of Government.  They did turn down 80 out of the 90 candidates, but they did give MacBride the reins of Government and all they did was to take the shilling from Deputy Dillon.  They gave MacBride the reins.  Why did they not use the whip to get from the Coalition Government what they say it is vital in the national interest to get, and what they have been saying for years that it is in the national interest to get?

I do not know why it is that the Minister for Agriculture has solemnly announced that there is going to be no war.  We know that in 1938 he came into this House and said that <Col N="1380" /> there was going to be no war.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture is nearer the truth this time and that the heavy clouds that are at present over the world will pass off without war. Surely to goodness, however, the situation is dangerous enough, in the sort of peace we have, to prevent Ministers from proclaiming that there is going to be no war.  Surely the situation is serious enough for the Taoiseach to warn his Ministers that they should have an eye on doing in their Departments everything that would strengthen the country in the time of a world war. Has the Taoiseach seen some of the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the mechanisation of agriculture?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I can explain it quite simply.  The question of peace or war is a matter of Government policy for discussion in the Dáil.  It is a wide subject.  I do not want to pursue it into every detail, but I would point out that the last war was fought on oil. The next war is going to call for a very much greater consumption of oil than the last one did.  Surely, in such circumstances, it would be unwise for us&mdash;even if we had the means&mdash;completely to mechanise agriculture on the basis of a foreign supply of fuel. Personally, I should like to see agriculture mechanised gradually if we had a native fuel to put in the machines. I think, however, it is a disastrously dangerous policy to change over from horses at the present time and depend altogther on tractors for which we do not know how long we are going to get a supply of oil and for which we could not get a drop of oil, I believe, <Col N="1381" /> if a world war broke out to-morrow morning.  Could the Minister for Agriculture, if he wants to see mechanisation, not say so in ordinary language? Could he not say: &ldquo;Well, I would like to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

Why should the Government in regard to any body of citizens allow the Minister for Agriculture to destroy their livelihood without consultation with this Dáil?  I think it is a disaster that the Minister for Agriculture should have such power and <Col N="1382" /> for his having that power I blame Deputy Davin as well as the Clann na Poblachta Party.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, at the beginning of his reign as Taoiseach, said that everything of national importance would be debated here in the Dáil and nobody was going to be coerced into voting for the Government and that the Government would give all the information at its disposal to the members of the Dáil in order that they could debate matters in the full light of all the facts.  Deputy Lemass asked the Taoiseach here to-day for information on a very pertinent fact. He asked what was the commitment in London in relation to dollars.  The Taoiseach said he had the information but he would not give it; he would give it to him in his own good time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we succeeded in getting for nine months £14,000,000 worth of dollars out of the sterling pool.  Months after this supposed agreement has been made we do not yet know how many dollars we are going to get out of the sterling area pool.  That is a very important matter. Have we undertaken to borrow under the recent London agreement £20,000,000 worth of dollars in this financial year in order that we shall have as good a supply of dollars this year as we had last year?  If we are <Col N="1383" /> going to borrow £20,000,000 worth of dollars why are we so forced to borrow?  If the British could not give us the dollars, why did we agree to sell all but 10 per cent. of our cattle to Britain?  Why did we not hold, if Britain could not give us the dollars out of the pool, our right to sell our cattle or any other commodity we have to areas in which we could get hard currency?  According to to-day's paper we are going to borrow £5,000,000 worth of dollars for the next three months.  Surely, we should have got a free hand to dispose of our produce in hard currency areas.  Remember, £5,000,000 worth of dollars is not going to be very easy to pay back in future years unless America balances her books and unless the Americans are prepared to buy as much from the rest of the world as they sell.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Finance, before he agreed to borrow from the United States, to have a general discussion here as to the terms and conditions of such a loan and particularly as to the terms of repayment.  If the United States of America does not balance its books in the future and does not buy as much as it sells, then borrowers in the present situation will not be able to repay her.  I do not want to see the position created here in which we might have to repudiate a loan from the United States.  I would prefer to accept more onerous terms for paying when I could provided that it was admitted in the contract that I had not to pay when I could not&mdash;when the Americans would not allow me to do it by their balance of trade.  I trust that the Taoiseach will insist that before this loan is completed the Minister for Finance will come here and will discuss the matter and give the members an opportunity of criticising the terms and conditions upon which it is proposed to accept a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country borrowed £5,000,000, or thereabouts, from the United States on a former occasion.  I do not refer now to the loan that was borrowed during the Black and Tan war, all of which was repaid.  I refer to one of the loans issued here by the Free State in the early 'twenties.  One of the worst headaches that every Minister for <Col N="1384" /> Finance has since suffered is watching that loan to see that we bought it as quickly as it appeared on the market, provided we could buy it at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>It is very foolish for any Minister for Finance now, in order to get out of a temporary difficulty, to impose such a charge upon his successor.  It will be disastrous for the good relations between ourselves and the United States if we accept a loan and do not make certain that the conditions are such that we can carrry out the full letter of our contract.  Is it because we have to borrow dollars from America that we are not going to get rid of bread rationing at a time when the British are doing it?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce last night stated that the abolition of bread rationing would add to the £10,000,000 we are already paying for flour subsidies. Is the reason why we are not going to get rid of bread rationing because it would cost us another £500,000 or £1,000,000?  After all that would be a very slight additional subsidy.</P>
    <P>We subsidised tobacco smokers this year.  We gave millions in subsidies to bring down the cost of tobacco and drink.  Surely to goodness if we could afford to subsidise smokers and people who like to have a drink, so that these things cost less than half what they cost in England, we can afford about £500,000 necessary to extend the subsidy to do away with bread rationing. One of the stock in trade arguments amongst members of what is now called the Coalition or inter-Party Government, was that they were going to take the bureaucrats off the backs of the people.  They were going to do away with control.  &ldquo;Pip-squeak&rdquo; inspectors were to disappear.  Farm inspectors we were told were to remain outside farmers' fields until they were invited in.</P>
    <P>If it is want of money is forcing the Government to keep up the big machine necessary to administer bread rationing, forcing us to give every household the trouble of handling bread coupons, and every shopkeeper <Col N="1385" /> and baker's van to handle innumerable coupons, it would be preferable to all those who are so badly affected by this miserable bread rationing system, to take a little more off smokes and drink, and give that money as an additional subsidy, so that rationing could be abolished and bread sold at the present price.  If saving a few hundred thousand pounds is compelling us to keep to that system, I think it is very bad business.  It is a very bad business for householders, and bad for business people and they will not thank the Dáil or the Government for it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to get the Minister for Agriculture to reverse some more of the decisions he took.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to intervene and not to allow that Minister to smash the glass-house industry or the cheese industry which required such a long time to build up.  If we are going to smash them now we may require them later, but may not have the people to produce them in days to come.  I hope the Taoiseach will try to get the Minister for Finance not to deny to the various Departments sums of money that would help to promote either industrial or agricultural development. This country cannot live on a higher standard of life until we have greater output and production.  Whether the Minister for Finance begs, borrows or even prints the money to keep production going, it should be done.  It is disastrous that we should have even one year's delay in the production of farm improvements.</P>
    <P>There are many other projects needed but, as this is not a detailed debate I do not wish to refer to them now.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, whether the Government's tenure of office is long or short, to make it number one plank, that the Minister for Finance should not refuse money for capital development that will result in an increased output of the goods necessary for a better standard of living here.</P>
    <P>By the way things are looking this Government may hang on until this country is on the verge of or into a crisis, and upon their actions may depend the safety of our people.  I trust that, at least, they will not destroy <Col N="1386" /> what we have done to enable this country to have reasonable self-sufficiency in the essentials of life.  We were very far from having reached the end of the road, and from having the output in industrial and agricultural products that we desired to have.</P>
    <P>The present Government have opportunities of increasing agricultural and industrial output that the Fianna Fáil Government had not at their disposal as more farm manures, more farm machinery and more industrial machinery are available.  Whether the Government's tenure is long or short, let them do their utmost to see that agriculture and industry are built up, so that we will have more of the things that will make our people safe, if, unfortunately, a crisis should come upon them.</P>

      <P>Until I heard Deputy Aiken speaking this evening I had made up my mind that we had improved his political education as a result of his 15 years in office as a Minister.  After listening to the longwinded speech he has just made, I think he is only a political school-boy, as he must have been under the impression that he was addressing a meeting of the ordinary members of a Fianna Fáil cumann.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken should be the last man of those who sat on the front benches to stand up here and suggest that the inter-Party Government experiment was a failure, or that it was about time they got out of office.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that his leader and himself have been absent from this House for more than half the period of office of the inter-Party Government. It should have been left to somebody else, besides the Deputy, to take such a stand, because he could not be as good a judge as colleagues of his who have beeen sitting in the House since the present Government assumed office.</P>

I can truthfully and sincerely say that the viewpoint of the people who sent me here is that this Government must get a fair chance to put its programme into operation. Deputy Aiken knows better than anyone else that that cannot be done inside five months.  He may make up his mind that the type of speech he and some of his colleagues have made and the points directed to the members of this and other groups will not have the slightest effect.</P>

When they did so, his leader went to Arus an Uachtaráin and called a general election inside half an hour from the time the decision was arrived at in this House.

      <P>Instead of accepting the decision of the majority of Deputies in this House in 1944 as representing the will of the majority of the people, he instructed the President in Arus an Uachtaráin to dissolve the Dáil.  He did that within half an hour of the time the House voted against the Bill. Deputy Aiken is a loyal supporter of his leader, but he should be the last man to talk to us about the alleged failure of this experiment in democracy.</P>
      <P>It is no use pointing out to Deputy Aiken that many parts of the programme upon which this Government was established have already been put into operation.  Perhaps in a few days he will have his eyes opened in regard to other aspects of that programme.  I hope before the Dáil goes on holidays the Deputy will not oppose this Government in their endeavour to put into operation most important aspects of the programme upon which there was full agreement by Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Deputy Aiken knows very well that last October, when a motion was brought forward here to modify the means test in order to enable old age pensioners, with their miserable allowances, to be compensated in some way for the increase in the cost of living, the then Government could not find £550,000 for that purpose, but at the same time they were squandering twice that amount providing for a transatlantic service to carry the world's wealthiest people at subsidised fares from here to America and elsewhere. They could not find enough to compensate the old age pensioners, but they could find eleven pence in every shilling in order to subsidise the transport on a transatlantic service of some of the wealthiest people in the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken had the pleasure&mdash;a pleasure denied the majority of us&mdash;of travelling on this transatlantic service during his recent world tour.  He ought to thank us for putting him out of office, thus giving him the pleasure of touring the world on this luxury air service.  He travelled from here to America and later to Australia and other countries and he would not have had an opportunity of going around the world and improving his education in regard to world conditions if we did not put him out of office in February last.</P>

Nobody would get a bigger fright than Deputy Aiken if he were told to-night that a general election was about to take place to give the people an opportunity of showing what they think of this Government and what it has accomplished in the <Col N="1390" /> short time in which it has been in office.</P>

Let us all get back to our constituencies, and let us carry on the work for which we were elected here.</P>

      <P>To-day we had Deputy Lemass coming here in a different frame of mind.  He is extremely annoyed because he says this Government is closely regimented.  He complains that the members of the various Parties supporting this Government have persistently and consistently voted in favour of Government measures.  We have Deputy Aiken also complaining that this Government has a well-machined majority.  I wonder would these Deputies make up their minds?  Six months ago, four months ago and two months ago we were doomed because we had a Coalition Government and because we were not going to hang together.  To-day, we are doomed because we have a Coalition Government that is going to hang together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy Lemass <Col N="1392" /> gets his information from.  I think he was really trying to be serious, although he succeeded in being amusing, when he spoke about the general desire that this Government should get out of office as quickly as possible. I am aware, as is every other Deputy, that since Deputy Lemass has gone out of office, he has occupied, not a peculiar position, but a particular position with regard to a newspaper in this city.  I wonder is that his source of information that there is a general desire that this Government should get out of office as quickly as possible?</P>
    <P>The only justification for a remark like that is that Deputy Lemass came in here this afternoon with the deliberate intention of amusing the Deputies.  He knows very well that in the six months during which this Government has been in office a tremendous volume of new support has come behind it.  That information is as readily available to Deputy Lemass as it is to every other Deputy. I do not intend to follow that line of argument for any great length as I admit quite frankly that I am not sure whether Deputy Lemass was merely cracking a joke or not.  We saw another ex-Minister in the rôle of principal boy here this afternoon but I think Deputy Lemass has tried to play the rôle of clown on the pantomime stage.</P>

      <P>He has tried to do it but he did not do it successfully. I want Deputies to bear in mind for a few minutes in relation to the speech which we heard from Deputy Lemass, that most of the big blunders which were committed during the days of the Fianna Fáil Government were perpetrated in the Department over which Deputy Lemass presided as Minister. Most of the objectionable features about which people were complaining and about which Deputies on these benches complained during the recent general election and since, were to be found in the Department over which he presided.  We had the transatlantic air service.  We had the Fianna Fáil mentality with regard to spending money as opposed to the <Col N="1393" /> mentality of this Government.  The Fianna Fáil mentality was that money was to be spent on all sorts of luxuries and luxury services, luxury hotels and luxury buildings of one kind or another. There is a very big difference between that and the mentality of this Government, which is to spend money on essentials and on those whose needs call for the expenditure of money.

The reason I put that question to Deputy Lemass was that I was well aware of the fact that Deputy Lemass was a member of the former Government in which his colleague, Deputy Aiken, was the Minister for Finance. The then Minister for Finance gave exactly the same advice to the people less than a year ago.  If Deputy Lemass will consult the Parliamentary Debates, Volume 104, column 812, he will find that in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Alderman Byrne, that advice was given by Deputy Aiken.  Deputy Byrne put this supplementary question to the Minister:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can the Minister say what is responsible for the fact that our £1 note is able to purchase only 11/-worth of goods in this country and has he any remedy for such a situation?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have stated the causes.  If there were no purchases on the market to-morrow, the price of goods would fall.  The people in this matter have the remedy largely in their own hands.  If they would refrain from purchasing or from overbuying when goods are in short supply, the <Col N="1394" /> price of goods would fall.  If a person who happens to have £100 or £1 in his pocket could keep it over the next 12 months, it would probably appreciate greatly in value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the advice given by Deputy Aiken when he was Minister for Finance.  That is the advice given by the present Minister for Finance, but now because their respective positions have changed, because Deputy Lemass is sitting over on those benches, he complains that the present Minister is wrong, that that is a bad policy and a policy with which he does not agree.</P>
    <P>That brings me to two points I want to make in this discussion.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly ex-Ministers, could do a great service to the country, if they want to, by approaching debates and discussions in this House in a constructive manner, with a desire to be helpful, with a desire to assist this Government in its wishes to put its policy into operation, without the type of criticism that we have heard in this House and more particularly outside the House, from ex-Ministers.  If the Fianna Fáil ex-Ministers would make up their minds to do that, I believe they would be doing good service to the country.  It is important that should be so if Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken are correct in their view that there is going to be a European or a world crisis leading to war within the next 12 or 24 months.  I think that if these Deputies seriously believe these statements, they are not acting in the best interests of the country in continuing to devote their energies to activities such as those in which they have been engaged for the past three or four months.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter raised by Deputy Aiken to which I should like to call attention.  He complained of the attitude taken up by the Minister for Agriculture regarding the importation of tomatoes, and he accused the Minister for Agriculture of destroying the livelihood of people in this country who had gone in for tomato growing.  Of course, that is an exaggeration and I think Deputy Aiken knows it, but I want to remind him, and more particularly Deputy Lemass, of the position created in this country shortly <Col N="1395" /> before the general election by the unlimited or practically unlimited importation of footwear and of sweets, particularly the importation of sweets.  A great number of ex-Army officers had been encouraged by the Fianna Fáil Government to invest their gratuities in setting up as sweet manufacturers. I think that was a sound enough policy. It was an effort to put these people on their feet again in civilian life, but hardly had they started when the market here was swamped out by the importation of sweets from European countries.  All of us know what the result has been for these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Less than a week ago I was speaking to a constituent of Deputy Aiken's in &lsquo;Drogheda who had been employed in a boot factory at one time.  He has been out of employment for the last six months because of the action of the Fianna Fáil Government in allowing such quantities of footwear to be imported.  Is there any comparison between the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil when they were in office and the policy pursued by this Government in relation to the matters to which I have referred?</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters that I am going to refer to, but it is hardly necessary for me to do so because most of them were the subject of much discussion on the Estimates.  I think the House, generally, will regret to note the fact that Deputy Aiken considers that the increase for the old age pensioners is a petty and mundane affair, and is merely a question of the Tánaiste giving a couple of bob a week to his pets.  That is the way the matter was referred to by Deputy Aiken a quarter of an hour ago.  During the short period of six months which this Government has been in office it has in my opinion done more for that class of person&mdash;old age pensioners and others&mdash;than Fianna Fáil did in 16 years, and more than it would do if in office for another 16 years.  This Government has gone in for a policy of retrenchment but not merely for the sake of retrenchment or economy.  None of us on this side believe in that.  We are more concerned to see money spent where the <Col N="1396" /> spending of it will do most good.  We are not prepared to refuse an increase to the old age pensioners or to modify the means test for the sake of a paltry sum of £560,000 as Fianna Fáil were. Fianna Fáil were prepared to see money going for luxury airliners, luxury air services, luxury buildings and that sort of thing.</P>

They were willing, however, to increase their own salaries and the salaries of their Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of Government the country had up to six months ago when it was put out of office.  I assert and I believe that the people of the country are very glad of the change that has taken place.  I believe that this Government is going to remain in office until it has completed its programme and that it will probably remain for a much longer period.  We are discussing the Taoiseach's Estimate. In him the people have a man <Col N="1397" /> who will lead them and in whom they have the fullest confidence.  I want personally to wish him every success.  I hope that he will remain in office and will continue to tackle the tasks which confront him in the same courageous, honest and forthright manner which has characterised his handling of a number of problems up to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A shrewd observer might possibly observe some humour in the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party towards the Clann na Poblachta Party in the remorseless and venomous attacks which they hurl against those with whom I have the honour to be associated.  But behind the curtain of humour is a rather sombre humour, so that a more astute investigator might observe that this venom is based on hatred and a disregard for political ethics of any description.  It is, of course, true that the Clann na Poblachta Party broke the neck of Fianna Fáil, and for that they make no apology in supporting this Vote for the Taoiseach's establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in 26 years the head of the Government is a man who has no politics.  He is a man who has gathered around him men of different ideas, men who are determined to stand by him in the task which he has undertaken, the task of uniting our people as they have not been united for 26 years.  If it is a crime to support a man who personifies the personality of Tone in his idealism to promote that unity, then we in Clann na Poblachta are guilty of that crime.  The Taoiseach is a man whose door is always open; he is available to every Minister, to every Deputy and to every civilian in the country.  He has not closed himself up in a glasscase not to be touched, but he has put himself unreservedly at the disposal of the people whom he leads.  We make no apology for standing in line behind such a man, and if that were the only reason for our action we have justified what we have done.  We came into this House as Irish republicans; we shall stay there as Irish republicans.  We came in here after a campaign of contumely, vilification and lies; we were &ldquo;Communists&rdquo;, we were &ldquo;anarchists&rdquo;, we were everything that was despicable, <Col N="1398" /> but not one of these statements which have been uttered against us behind our backs has been made to our faces. We are glad to know that we have contributed to the formation at last of a Government which considers the interests of the people according to the national and to the equitable view which we should expect from the Christian head of a State.  We helped to form an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil while at the same time we have retained our own separate and distinct individuality.  We have been loyal units of that Government, and as long as the Government policy is devoted to the 10 points on which all Parties composing it are agreed, we shall support that Government.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been particularly noticeable since the present Taoiseach assumed the leadership of this House is that through the country a new atmosphere of personal liberty has begun again to be born.  When the people woke up in the mornings, the papers were not flooded with advertisements and orders saying you must do this or you must not do that. People began to breathe freely, to act freely, to think freely and to speak freely.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a motion before this House to refer back for consideration the Vote which this House is being asked to pass.  What is the authorship of this amendment for this reconsideration?  Let us cast our minds back over the 26 years of Government in this country and over the last 16 years in particular and ask ourselves was there unity of thought or unity of action?  Where was the confidence we should have in each other assisting each other, one for all and all for one?  Since the Fianna Fáil Administration took over in this country their whole attitude, instead of uniting our people, has been to divide them, father against son, brother against brother and mother against daughter.  The present Taoiseach, as Leader of this Government, has at least written a headline pointing the road to unity.  The Fianna Fáil Government in the whole 16 years of their office consolidated their position as perfect politicians.  In that they <Col N="1399" /> have succeeded, but possibly the perfection of that political attainment may receive a shock when the Government of the country is entrusted to honest men and their political achievements will become to us nothing but a bad memory.</P>
    <P>Since we came into this House, we have supported the Taoiseach.  As I said we make no apology for doing that, but we will not abate one whit the fundamentals on which we exist. We have one end, and one end only, the reintegration of the Irish republic for the whole of Ireland.  We will not sacrifice one iota of our policy in supporting the Taoiseach because I believe that under the leadership of men like him the days when that dream which to many of us is very dear might yet become a reality, are not far away.  I wish him every luck and success in his onerous undertaking and I am perfectly certain that when the pages of history come to be written, the name of John A. Costello will be written there in letters not of gold, but of something much more beautiful, spiritual achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we on this side of the House can re-echo the very fine sentiment expressed by Dr. Brennan when he said that it was the ideal of Clann na Poblachta that the whole of our territory shall in the very near future be reintegrated in the republic of Ireland.  I do not think that anybody can cavil with that statement, because it is the policy of Parties other than Clann na Poblachta and at least one other Party has gone a very long way along the road to its achievement.  The portion to be reintegrated is only one-fifth of the national territory and I am quite sure that, when Fianna Fáil come back to office, Clann na Poblachta will give them all the support they can in achieving that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is achieved before they come back, Fianna Fáil will give <Col N="1400" /> them very hearty applause.  I listened to Deputy O'Higgins misconstruing a statement made by Deputy Aiken and I feel that, in fairness to Deputy Aiken, I should give my impression of his remarks. Deputy Aiken was referring to the ability of one Party in the Coalition to influence Government decisions, and he was upbraiding the Clann na Poblachta Party for their inability to influence Government decisions on certain matters of the first importance.  To illustrate the point, he instanced the case of certain recent increases in the salaries of a section of the Civil Service and referred to &ldquo;the Tánaiste's pets.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Higgins, I hope without any malice, seemed to apply that remark to the increases proposed for old age pensioners.  The remark made by Deputy Aiken did not apply in any way to old age pensioners, but applied to the class of public servant to whom I have referred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken pointed out that the Tánaiste was able, by his influence in the Government, to secure preferential treatment for one section of the Civil Service and contrasted that with the failure of Clann na Poblachta to get the Government decision on the short-wave station altered.  I think that Clann na Poblachta ought to take in the spirit in which it is offered the advice tendered by Deputy Aiken and that they, too, ought to get on their hind legs and use their influence to secure the things on which they brought about the defeat of Fianna Fáil.  There is no doubt that, if the people of Ireland had not believed Clann na Poblachta&mdash;and Clann na Poblachta is the Party&mdash;when they said they would stop emigration, would give full employment and would establish the republic without any questionings of any sort, they would not have been put in a position to put out the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly on this because one of the things which Fianna Fáil did was to bring a fairly good standard of livelihood to those parts of the country which had always been depressed, and I refer particularly to the turf industry. I do not propose to labour it now, but, having heard so many statements here this evening about the many achievements <Col N="1401" /> which have improved the lot of the people, I could not avoid pointing out again to the Dáil that the standard of living of the people in my constituency has been very much depressed indeed by the abrupt and almost complete stopping of the turf industry.  In that connection, I should like to point out to the Taoiseach that the schemes, inadequate and all as they are in amount, to relieve the distress caused by that stoppage, are being carried out in a very mean way indeed. Last year was a very bad year for turf, and, owing to the weather being wintry until the middle of the year, a great many people were unable to get employment on turf production.  I know one case of nine men who were turf workers all during the war and who, because of the inability to provide sufficient turf schemes last year, for the reason I have given, were unable to secure employment on turf schemes and who were turned away because they were not employed last year.  The Government ought to realise that they have inflicted grave hardships on constituencies such as mine and the least they ought to do is to ensure that when men who are genuine turf workers offer themselves for employment, they will not be turned away on the basis of technicalities of that sort.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy O'Higgins to a criticism by Deputy Aiken of the advice given by the Minister for Finance to the people that, even though they got increases of wages and salaries, they ought not to spend them. I think that advice of that kind cannot be carried out.  It presupposes a quality of perfection in human nature which I do not think exists, and particularly with the spate of amusement and entertainment we have in this country and have had for a number of years back, when you put money into people's hands, they will spend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly did, but Fianna Fáil gave the added encouragement of withdrawing from circulation a great deal of the money spent on drink, amusement and tobacco, and when one considers that over £50,000,000 yearly are spent on these items, I do not think it was too much to withdraw a few of those millions to subsidise necessaries.</P>
      <P>But the Minister was in a difficulty because Deputy Larkin had threatened, on behalf of the Labour Party, that there would be no more standstill Orders.  Fianna Fáil believed that the only effective system of retaining the value of money was the standstill Order and I think there are many examples the world over to prove that standstill Orders are the most effective way of doing it; but when the Labour Party threatened that there were to be no more Fianna Fáil standstill Orders, the Minister for Finance had to have recourse to offering the very weak substitute of advising the people: &ldquo;Even though you get money do not spend it.&rdquo; I admit that it is very good advice but it would be very foolish to expect that the people in the main would carry it out.</P>
      <P>The damage that has been obvious in the economic life of the country has been stressed by Fianna Fáil speakers, who have referred to turf, air services and so on, but I believe the greatest damage that has been done to the country since this Government came in is the contraction of private enterprise. If we could get a true picture of the number of schemes and proposals which have been either very much cut down or abandoned altogether, the picture would make all of us, including the Government Parties, sit up and take notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was informed recently by an architect, who showed me plans he had for an industrialist who wished to expand his business on a large scale, that he had watched the progress of events for <Col N="1403" /> a while after the new Government came in and he then made up his mind that the time was not the happiest to go ahead with the proposals.  He was going to put a great deal of money into it and, like a man choosing a horse in a race, when he was not sure that the horse would win, he reduced his bet to what he could easily afford to lose.  This man was not prepared to take the risk.  That is one case that came to my notice and I have no doubt that it is typical of many when I take into account the opinions I have heard expressed in the country for the last few months.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance this evening said that he had no personal knowledge and no official knowledge that credit had been tightened up in recent months.  Several Deputies told him that that was the case.  He denied any responsibility on the part of the Government for the matter.  He said that the cue had not been given by the Government and he believed that the Central Bank had not interfered either to bring about that state of affairs. Like other speakers, I, too, have evidence of this policy on the part of the banks and I have been told by a bank official that they did get their instructions to tighten up on credit and not to issue credit, and that has been done in recent months.  I am not saying that the banks have done this simply because there is a Coalition Government. All I want to tell the Taoiseach is the fact.  I have evidence.</P>

      <P>The Minister was so sceptical that there was any contraction of credit&mdash;he did not believe it.  He said he had no personal knowledge and no official knowledge of the matter It is because of that statement of the Minister on that very important matter that I now have thought it well to include in my remarks on this Estimate an account of my own experience in the matter, and what I have been told by a bank official.  Having said that, I will pass away from it.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Taoiseach that as a result of the abandonment of our national fuel policy there is a sum of about £1,500,000 at stake in the matter of lorries and the people who own lorries stand to lose very heavily.  It was too precipitate action on the part of the Government to throw a large sum of capital in that form into the melting pot without there being alternative means of employing the lorries or reimbursing the people who had incurred outlay.</P>
      <P>One of the principal things to which I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention is the recent Order of the Government in reference to public advertising in Irish and English.  I should have spared the Taoiseach the bother if the debate on the Finance Estimate had not collapsed so soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to ask the Taoiseach on the matter is if he would consider having in Irish only all advertisements which are purely of a formal character.  I would specify such things as a notice by a person about to apply for a betting licence or a notice under the Dance Halls Act&mdash;things of that sort&mdash;which, as the Minister for Finance said, are read neither in Irish nor in English.  If the Minister believes they are not read by the public either in Irish or in English, I suggest that he should have them all in Irish, because I do know people who do not read such notices in English but who, if they see them in Irish, particularly if they have a modern knowledge of Irish, will try out that knowledge on the notice in Irish and in that way it may do a good deal of good.  I hope the Taoiseach will have the matter considered as sympathetically as possible.</P>
      <P>I am not taking up any attitude in the matter but I would like to say this about it, that this matter of confining Irish advertisements to the Gaeltacht has not a great deal to justify it. Unfortunately, the people in the Gaeltacht do most of their reading in English.  They cannot get it in any other medium.  For that reason, when they leave school, they are practised more in the reading of English than they are in Irish.  In any event, there may be a danger of creating a feeling amongst them that they are like an Indian reservation if you make one arrangement for them and something else for the rest of the country.  They feel that they are part of the country the same as everybody else.</P>

    <P>I would like again to remind the Clann na Poblachta people that their charges against us of having been so many &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men all down the years can now be turned against themselves.

      <P>The Clann na Poblachta Party, as is well known, were asked to fight this question of the short-wave station and they have not been as fortunate as the Tánaiste was in the particular line he took up.  The cue has been given in the matter and they have acted under the leadership of the Government, as they used to charge us so often with acting under the leadership of our Party.  They have turned down their convictions in this matter and have trooped into the Lobby against a matter which they announced was of the first importance to the nation.

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of joining the Deputies from this side of the House who have expressed good wishes to the Taoiseach.  I am glad that the people of the country, reading the newspapers to-morrow morning, and in particular reading the speech of Deputy Lemass, will realise how successful this Government has been and how successful the present Taoiseach has been.  If ever there was a cry of wailing from one of the have-nots, it came from Deputy Lemass, a wail because this Government, under the leadership of the Taoiseach, is succeeding where he hoped it would fail.</P>
      <P>The prophecy made by the Leader of the Opposition, shortly after the change of Government, that the Government would last only until the Budget, is as wrong as many of his other prophecies in the past.  The Government has lasted far longer than the Budget and it will see many other Budgets introduced into this House, because as an experiment in democracy, it is succeeding.</P>

      <P>Any fairminded Deputy who discussed with his constituents what they think of this Government, will find this reaction&mdash; that down the country the ordinary citizen feels that he has a say in the Government now, whether he is a supporter of the Labour Party, whether he is a farmer or something else.  He feels that he is being represented in this Government and that no longer is there a Government, and a Party backing that Government, that dance to every tune played by one man; and no longer are the affairs of this country kept secret from the people. For that reason, the people have welcomed this Government.  I must sympathise very much with Deputy McGrath and the rest, in the plight in which they find themselves now, because their return to this House after the next election will depend, not on their being Government Deputies and Government candidates but on their own merits as Deputies; and I think they are beginning to realise that now.  Up and down this country, the Fianna Fáil clubs are disappearing.</P>

      <P>Down in my constituency of Leix-Offaly&mdash;I am sorry there is no Fianna Fáil Deputy from Leix-Offaly here now&mdash;I know of three places in particular, where even at the last election Fianna Fáil could have commanded 90 per cent of the votes.  I know now the change that has taken place.  In those three areas, Fianna Fáil has receded recently, because the people who supported them in the past now see, under this Government, a chance of better times. The people are clearly behind the Government, not because the Government can satisfy everybody, not because the Government can work miracles or is working miracles; but because the ordinary people see, in the present team occupying Government <Col N="1408" /> Benches here, a team of men each one of them capable of doing his job, under a leader who derives no benefit from the position he occupies but who brings to that position the energy and the honesty of an ordinary, decent Irishman.  The people appreciate that &mdash;and the sooner Deputies opposite realise that, the better for themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, Deputy McGrath and the rest of them, who are endeavouring to make political capital out of difficulties of their own creation, would be far better advised in joining behind this Government and behind the Taoiseach in the task he has set himself of rebuilding this country.  Fianna Fáil preferred to play the lone political game.  Fianna Fáil preferred to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Government's &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on every possible occasion, but they will find very, very shortly the mistake they are making; and as their stock goes down and their support gets less and less, they will begin to realise the mistake they made in not joining in this Government.</P>
      <P>We have had Deputy Aiken, fresh from America, popping the old question: &ldquo;What is Ireland&mdash;a member of the Commonwealth or an independent republic?&rdquo;  It is a regrettable fact that, after 26 years here in an Irish Parliament, we should be asking ourselves what we are.  An effort was made some two years ago to find what we were, from an English dictionary. I do not know whether that effort was successful, or whether it convinced either the people of this country or the people of other countries; but I do say to the Taoiseach, if a definition of what this country is, is to come from each succeeding Government, let him give to the country his definition of what this country is.</P>

      <P>In recent years, regrettably, we have been honest neither with the people of our own country nor with the people of other countries, and I would welcome now a <Col N="1409" /> clear declaration of what this country is to be.  If it is to be an independent republic, by all means let it be so; if it is to be a member of the Commonwealth, let it be so.  We are not going to do ourselves harm by being honest with ourselves and much harm can be done by endeavouring to conceal matters like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I hope the suggestion made yesterday by Deputy Sir John Esmonde on the question of Partition will be adopted.  All of us, whether we are a long time or a short time in this House, have had a surfeit of speeches about Partition, shadowboxing down here in the South or shadow-boxing in America or England; but we have had no plan, no policy, no concrete proposal, adopted by a Parliament which claimed to represent the Irish people.  From all sides of the House, through all the years that this Parliament has been established, lip service has come on the aim of restoring the unity of our country, but nevertheless in recent years, every single bit of our domestic policy has been aimed at making Partition more permanent and the restoration of unity more distant.  Some Deputies may think that Partition can be solved by propaganda, by appealing to the better instincts of our fellow-Irishmen in the North or the better instincts of the British people.  It may be that through propaganda some solution lies.  But, wherever it lies, it is the duty of this Parliament to find that solution, and not only the duty of Deputies on this side of the House, but of Deputies opposite.  Partition is a national problem and must be solved in a national way.  We cannot solve it, however, by merely talking about it down here.  We cannot solve it ourselves; we must get help in the North and we must get help in England.  As a first step I would recommend to the Taoiseach the suggestion made for an all-Party movement in connection with Partition.  We cannot in a small country like this afford to dissipate our resources and our abilities and I am certain that in a Parliament like this and in the Parties represented here, if there is goodwill, sincerity and honesty, we can find such a solution. Speaking for the people I represent in <Col N="1410" /> my constituency and as a Deputy of my Party I do wish the Taoiseach many long years in the position he now occupies and the greatest of success in the job he has undertaken.</P>

      <P>Listening to the statements to-night about the length of time this Government is going to last I got a kind of idea that they must be going to take the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and extend the period of the Dáil to 50 years.  I think it would be a good idea.  If I can give a tip to the boys over there it is that they should have a good look around this week and next week and I think they will find that like the lady who went for a ride on the tiger, the tiger will come back with the lady inside.

We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a whole lot of cement was going to go towards the making of new runways.  We were told here, too, that the agricultural community must wait and do without the £150,000 that was guaranteed by the previous Government for their farm buildings&mdash;because, apparently, the material is required for cement for runways for those luxury travellers Deputy Davin was talking about a short while ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the storm has subsided I want to say that I think this House appreciates the fact that we have in charge of the Government a man of sincerity and a man who will bring to his task the enthusiasm, the energy and the honesty that that task demands.  Deputy Corry has been inclined to talk a good deal about agriculture. I would be rather inclined, when speaking on the Taoiseach's Estimate, to ask him to regard himself in his function as head of the Government as a farmer with 26 fertile fields under his control, but as a farmer who is always anxious and determined to add to those 26 fertile fields six other <Col N="1418" /> fields which have been amputated from us.  I ask the Taoiseach to bend his will during the four years, at least, when he will hold office as Taoiseach to developing these 26 fields as a farmer would develop his farm&mdash;that is, to get the last ounce of productivity out of them and to ensure that they provide for the people in this area the maximum of comfort and the best possible standard of living.  That is the function which the Taoiseach is called upon to perform.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry appears to be in fear and trembling that before the Dáil meets again there will be a general election.  He knows well that were it not for something that happened on the 18th February last he would have put his general election over him during the past few months and the 13th Dáil would be as dead as Queen Victoria. We have now a Taoiseach with a sense of responsibility and a Taoiseach who does not go galloping off to the Park on the slightest provocation to dissolve Parliament simply because he is not getting his own way in everything or because he thinks it will help to benefit his Party.</P>

I did that not because I believed that there was any outstanding merit in the representatives that Fianna Fáil might send in to the Government but because I believed that, as representatives of the people, they were entitled to representation in the Government.  I think the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party now regret that they did not accept that invitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not like the note upon which Deputy Lemass closed his speech to-day.  It sounded like a note of distrust.  I am one of those who always had a very considerable respect for Deputy Lemass.  I have always thought that he was a very able man and a very able Minister.  I regret that he should be so bitterly and venomously angry because time has proved that it is possible for this country to carry on under a Government which Fianna Fáil does not control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many urgent tasks immediately ahead.  It should be the Taoiseach's function to hold the <Col N="1420" /> balance fairly between all sections of the community.  I have always held since I came into this House ten years ago that that balance has never been fairly held.  Agriculture has never been fairly treated.  Half the people of this country are gainfully employed in agriculture.  Yet, up to the period of the war they were never able to win for themselves more than one-fourth of the national income.  That was always a crying injustice.  That is an injustice that must cease if we are to prevent the steady divergence of our people from the rural areas to the towns and the export of them abroad.</P>
    <P>I have always been somewhat amazed at hearing Deputies speak about a machine majority in this House.  I wonder do those Deputies know what they are talking about?  As an Independent farmer Deputy I have never known of any machine that could either induce or compel me to cast my vote in a particular way in this House, direct me as to how I should speak in this House, or as to how I should act. I have always acted on my own independent judgment.  I have never recognised any Party Whip.  I think that is true of all Independent Deputies.  We judge the issues on their merits.  We stand over decisions we have taken.  I think it is desirable that there should be a certain number of Independent Deputies in this House.  We can view matters impartially.  We can at times, perhaps, influence Parties when they seek to submerge vital national interests for purely Party gain, or Party advantage, or to score Party points. There never was in the history of our country a time when there were so many urgent national questions requiring attention.  The Taoiseach is the head of a Government who have declared that their first object as a Government is to promote the expansion of agricultural and industrial development. There has been an equality of interests upon those two branches of development.  Agricultural development and expansion are essential and desirable; so, too, are the development and expansion of our industrial potentialities and our mineral potentialities. All these things require to be developed in order to keep our people in productive and remunerative employment <Col N="1421" /> within this country and to undo the evils under which this country has laboured.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach success in the onerous tasks he has undertaken.  I want to make a special appeal to him. Since his Government have made the development and expansion of agriculture and industry their main concern, I think it is their duty to see that the necessary credit facilities for the expansion of those two important branches of our economic life should be made available.  I am told by people in business that there is a tendency in the banks to restrict credit. If that policy is directed against the interests of the nation&mdash;if the Government are satisfied that it is directed against the best interests of the nation &mdash;then it is the duty of the Government to correct and offset that policy. It is also the duty of the Government to build up the country's resources and the reserves of the country as quickly as possible to meet the needs of any world emergency.  That task is one that cannot be delayed.  Food supplies and supplies of raw materials for our industries, together with essential fuel must be accumulated.  These are urgent problems and I am sure they will have the wholehearted consideration of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be no harm if I broke away from the tenor of some of the speeches and if I try to apply myself to some specific matters of Government policy of immediate interest to the community The first one which I would like to discuss with the Taoiseach is the co-ordination and direction of the activities of various Departments with a view to securing a proper line of action, having regard to the country as whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have in mind is this, that in every Government each Minister is charged with his own particular responsibility. He has his primary interests and each individual Minister is naturally and humanly tempted and, in fact, is charged with the duty of pursuing the end for which he is there and trying to secure the maximum good for the particular element in the community's life which he represents.  That is as it should be, but it is elementary <Col N="1422" /> that if there was no co-ordinating agency, all horses would be pulling against each other and anything might happen, so that in order to make our system work there is a Government and a head of that Government, the function of the Government being the Executive Committee of this House, composed of those Ministers, a body where those Ministers can be co-ordinated and can exchange their views and their problems and arrive at a common solution under the general direction of the head of the Government.  Perhaps more than anything else, the duties of the head of the Government are to co-ordinate the activities of these Departments.</P>
    <P>One realises that the present Government is not very long in office and I wish fairly to make all allowance for that fact, but I am afraid that there are already evidences of a lack of co-ordination, evidences that the Departments in certain instances are pulling away on their own without having due regard to problems that any Minister will have, and the community is suffering from the results of that lack of co-ordination.  There is, up to the moment anyway, some evidence of lack of Governmental decisions, a lack of the taking on of responsibility of the Government so as to have a homogeneous, defined and clear line of policy with which the elements which are the Ministers can be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>These are general words, but I think that they express my ideas accurately enough.  While trying, especially as time is short, to avoid going into detail with regard to every department, I want to refer to a few specific instances of what I mean, primarily with regard to this question of co-ordination.  I want to try to focus attention on the over-all picture, because that is the picture which represents the repercussions on the man in the street and that is what we are here to look after.</P>
    <P>I will take a problem which is acutely noticeable in the City of Dublin, but which has ramifications in our industrial and agricultural life.  We have heard and read a great deal about the meat difficulty in Dublin&mdash;the shortage of meat.  That is only an aspect of a general problem and the general <Col N="1423" /> problem is this, that the agricultural community at the moment is in a position to obtain relatively high prices and it is relatively prosperous.  We have been able in the past year or so to secure adequate markets for certain of our live stock.  That is an excellent situation from the point of view of the farmer, who has got the price, and from the point of view of the Department of Agriculture, if it continues and if that trend can be maintained.  But that situation, favourable and all as it is for one section of the community, is operating unfavourably on another section.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in Dublin and other centres the prices of vegetables and meat have so risen as to place a serious burden on the ordinary man in the street.  I have on more than one occasion pleaded for the white-collar worker.  There are in certain categories people who are comfortable and well off, but there are other categories where the women of the house find it difficult to victual their families.  In that case the woman finds her menu must include more meatless days than before.  There you have something paradoxical, a prosperous situation for the farmer and a difficult one for the housekeeper.  If our farmers get a high price for their cattle across the water, naturally the cattle tend to go that way, and some positive action is necessary if you are to have cattle of comparable quality for victualling the towns at home.</P>
    <P>If there is no co-ordination between the producer and the consumer you have the position that times of prosperity for the farmer will mean times of severity for the townsman and, on the other hand, times of cheap food for the townsman will usually mean a time of depression for the farmer.  That is the situation and it is there the co-ordinating policy or function of the Government and the Taoiseach should come in.</P>
    <P>Here you have a problem, again getting back to the question of the meat situation in Dublin. It has gone beyond the limit of automatic adjustment. So long as you had the butchers <Col N="1424" /> getting a substantial profit, when they could bear the burdens of the trade without passing them on to the consumer, you had a situation which made Governmental interference unnecessary. I do not want to go into the figures mentioned last night, but it is obvious, and it has not been controverted, that the limit of endurance has come for the butchering trade.  The butchers have given their figures for profits, which at no time since 1940, except on one occasion, exceeded 5 per cent.  In 1944 their profits went to 6.5 per cent., but there is the significant fact that in 1947 they had a loss&mdash; a minus profit of 1.5&mdash;while in 1948 the minus profit was 2.8.  Without going into the merits of their case, these figures are there and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be able to prove if these figures are right and if they express a fact.  If they are wrong, let us be told that they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just taking the figures and if they are controverted I am open to correction, but that does not affect my argument.  The butchers will tell you that they would far prefer to sell meat more cheaply because they find that the decrease in sales has so much offset the increase in prices that they are losing more than if they were selling larger quantities at a cheaper price and they are very anxious that the price of meat should be kept at a reasonable level.  I have tried to study the problem impartially and I would invite Deputies to look at this question in the same spirit and to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, then, is a question of co-ordination.  The Government in many questions of that nature will be faced with the problem of striking a mean in the best interests of the community. Only a Government with accurate sources of information and complete and adequate returns, can attempt to give an accurate answer to this problem.  I would not be so presumptuous as to give an answer without accurate information, but I am making the point that the co-ordinating <Col N="1425" /> function of the Government is to deal with such a problem and not leave the people of Dublin to suffer from a meat shortage and a vegetable shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would allow me to develop my argument objectively, we would get much further in this House.  I am attempting to deal with the Taoiseach's problem fairly and squarely with due regard to the fact that he has a problem. If the Minister for Lands would cease playing politics and try to get down to the problems of the country, he would be rendering a more useful service to the people.  We all realise the problem which the Taoiseach has and we can sympathise with him in the many problems which anybody in his position will have to tackle where the solution can only be provided by finding a mean, where the solution will have to be one of balance, a solution that may not please completely either his Minister for Agriculture, his Minister for Lands or his Minister for Industry and Commerce when they look at it from their own narrow compartments, but when together they have to strike, in common agreement, a certain line of action, which is going to be the best mean solution for the whole of them.  We can all, particularly a Party which has been in office, sympathise with him in that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken a specific instance in which there is an obvious need for co-ordinated action.  There is a possible solution that jumps to my mind. You may, for instance, subsidise meat in the towns.  I know the difficulties of that.  I am not getting up like other people and saying &ldquo;Subsidise and all will be well&rdquo;, but I am suggesting that that is one avenue that might be explored.  There are, I know, the difficulties, not only of finding the money for the subsidy, but the question of the administration of the subsidy, which is an extremely difficult matter.  So far as the question of vegetables is concerned, <Col N="1426" /> the Government has my sincere sympathy in facing a problem of that nature.  Nevertheless, the fact that the problem is difficult of solution is no reason why a determined effort should not be made to solve it.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of subsidies again, the question of finding the money would be the first objection. There I would join issue on the attitude already adopted in regard to certain matters.  I am not going to cast aspersions as to motives but, to my mind, it was an improper thing to do, namely to reduce taxation on non-essentials and recreation items such as beer&mdash;not so much perhaps in the case of beer because so far as the workman's pint is concerned I make an exception &mdash;but on items such as cinemas and so forth, giving them reliefs in taxation while permitting an increase in income-tax and other items referred to in the Budget.  If it were necessary to find the money for the subsidisation of meat in the City of Dublin, to enable citizens who now find themselves obliged to face more meatless days than they should, who find themselves going without meat while the finest beef in the country is being exported to feed the foreigner&mdash; a trade from which we are getting a very necessary return in cash&mdash;why should we not try to provide that money rather than give remissions of taxation on non-essentials?  If money were the objection to subsidisation, I would have no hesitation in recommending to the Government to consider whether it would not be better to appropriate moneys to make a prime food available to our own people in the towns and to find that money by a form of essential taxation rather than to give reliefs in taxation on non-essentials. That is one suggestion that might be examined.</P>
    <P>Another is how far, in so far as the prosperity which will come to the country through the cattle trade is concerned, a fair percentage of it could not be deflected in order to make a reasonable proportion available to our people in the cities.  I am all the time admitting that there is a difficulty, but the fact that such a difficulty exists is no excuse for not tackling it.  I move from that.  It would be well, while this <Col N="1427" /> situation persists as it is, that it should be tackled.  I have said that the question of nutrition of the people in certain quarters of the city will need attention.  That is a matter of Government policy as a whole rather than a matter for the Minister for Health, because he cannot attend to it unless there is a co-ordination of the functions of other Departments.  There is no use waiting.  I presume the Government is not stalling on the meat problem in the hope that the price of cattle will fall. That is a negation in itself and I presume, having heard the Minister for Agriculture on cattle prices and on the prosperity attending the cattle trade, there is very little possibility of such a situation adjusting itself naturally. That is if the information given by the Minister for Agriculture is right.  If it will not adjust itself naturally, it cannot be left just to force an unnatural situation on the people of the city.  I have laboured that from the point of view of an example.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to stress again the need for Governmental action as a whole, the need for a definite policy, the need for decision and action on policy, apart from administrative single action on the part of individual Departments of State.  Now, similar problems arise in connection with such things as the economy drive in regard to fuel.  Suppose we admit without prejudice, as the lawyers say, for the purpose of argument, all the arguments of the Minister for Finance in regard to that&mdash;I will join issue in a moment as to how he affects Government policy&mdash;and suppose we take it that he got his way, what about the counter co-ordinating problems that arise as a result of that in the Department of Industry and Commerce? Two problems arise immediately. There is the problem of the personnel concerned and the finding of employment for them, and the sudden withdrawal of the lorries engaged and so forth.  From the point of view of a long-term policy by the Government, and considering the present unsettled world situation, where is the evidence of co-ordination in regard to that problem?  The only evidence we can find is that the Minister comes in here <Col N="1428" /> with an axe and looks at it from a certain doctrinaire financial point of view.  The man in control of the purse strings pulls the strings, but what about the other Departments?</P>
    <P>Take, again, the Government's decision to increase income-tax and to decrease the taxation on beer.  That may have been a good thing, even from the administrative point of view of the Department of Finance.  That Department may have found that in some quarters the high tax was not bringing in the same revenue, but, as against that, were two things considered from another angle?</P>
    <P>I had the honour of being elected to this House from an area in the City of Dublin, and in this city I have heard this kind of misguided talk.  I have heard workmen in the building line say what was so commonly said in England, that it was not worth their while working beyond a certain limit because if they did their earnings over and above would be taken in income-tax.  That has recently been said in Dublin City. It was commonly said across the water. It has been said by workmen, &ldquo;We would not work for the boss for less than the trade union rate and if he tried to make us work, we would strike, but here they are working for less for the Government.&rdquo;  Now, there is a factor in Government policy which, looked at from the point of view of the Department of Finance, is one thing, but looked at from the point of view of the Minister for Local Government, who has the problem of getting houses built quickly, is another.  These are pretty good examples of what I mean. The appointment of committees to survey employment may be very necessary, but if things are not to be allowed to drift, definite Government policy as a whole and definite co-ordination in these matters is essential if we are to avoid the cross-cuts of various Departments made perhaps with the best intentions in the world.  I have analysed all this as nakedly as I could with a full appreciation of the Taoiseach's problems.  The Taoiseach of the present Government has probably more problems than the Taoiseach in any other Government, and a Coalition Government is notorious for difficulties of that nature.</P>

      <P>Time is getting on, and I do not want to delay by passing words across the House.  I want to get on now to another matter.  The respect in which a Government is held by the people of a country is an important thing.  It has been customary for us, and for other countries, to treat Ministers and the representatives of other countries with respect.  From that point of view, I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to a scurrilous, degrading, insulting and altogether unworthy article or report that appeared in the <i>Daily Express</i> on June 17th.  I think it is a thing that should not be let pass in the interests of the good name and in the interests of the dignity of the Government of this country.  The heading to the article is &ldquo;Costello, Dillon to the Boys Over There.  Is it our Beef you are Wanting?&rdquo;  It reads: &ldquo;Mr. John Costello, Prime Minister of Éire.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know yet.  The Deputy has asked a question, whether Deputy de Valera, junior, is not entitled to quote something that affects the country.

      <P>If I wanted to put a dirty twist on it or misrepresent it, I could very easily do it by putting this report in another way to the Taoiseach, by asking what did he mean by saying this and by accepting this as a correct report.  I have tried to be fair in dealing with it, as I should and as everybody in the House should, from the point of view of the dignity and the good name of our Government abroad, whereas the Taoiseach is trying to stifle me with regard to this article and force me into a position which members of his own Party would not scruple to avail of, to quote it and put the onus on him to deny its truth.  The Taoiseach has put that onus on me, but I am loath to stoop to putting such words in the Taoiseach's mouth, words that I would hardly think worthy of him.  The <i>Daily Express</i>, however, puts these words in quotation into the Taoiseach's mouth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair pleases, I can ask the Taoiseach through you did he say certain things as Taoiseach of this country on a certain occasion, a certain night in England, or not.  If he did not, I am entitled to ask him for the sake of the good name of the Government, for the good name of the country at home and abroad, to take action against this scurrilous rag that reported him as saying that.  If he said it&mdash;but I do not believe that he said it as it is so much beneath any man of standing, and <Col N="1432" /> what is attributed to the Minister for Agriculture, too, would be beneath any man of standing.  The only conclusion I can draw then, is that it is gross misrepresentation of this country, and for the good name of the country for goodness' sake do something about it.  I will leave it at that. I am very sorry that I could not have dealt with that objectively as I have dealt with other matters.</P>
      <P>Either bouquet throwing or criticism will do us very little good.  Let us face our problems, see what they are and then discuss them.  Then we will get somewhere.  That has often been suggested in this House.  There is a problem with regard to general Government co-ordination that I would like to deal with.  We have undoubtedly at the present moment a time of stress and uncertainty, and I think that it is not unsober on my part to say that if the situation had been so in the years before 1939, war would have been precipitated immediately. Perhaps it is only our proximity to the last calamity and the fact that some of the participants or ex-participants are relatively exhausted preserves us from the outbreak of armed conflict.  At some time in the future, whether it be near or far, there is a virtual certainty, I am afraid, of another world calamity. Under these circumstances, it is obvious that again the co-ordinating functions of the Government must come into play.  The foresight of the Taoiseach must come into play in looking ahead, while the Ministers in their day to day activities are doing their best for the day.</P>
      <P>We can learn the lessons from the past showing that there are certain questions of co-ordination which must come in.  The Minister for Finance wants to economise, but would it not be more prudent if the Minister for Industry and Commerce looked ahead, and had we not better have adequate stocks?  That is an immediate conflict between two Departments at the present moment in embryo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a very serious decision to take as to how far we should provide for the future.  The question of fuel is a very good example.  The disastrous winter of 1946 caught us with an acute problem, <Col N="1433" /> largely a transport one.  We learned one lesson, but the danger has not materialised and because of the attempt to keep some reserves there may be a certain loss with regard to fuel.  These are only incidentals of the problem of the Government and they can only do their best with reasonable foresight.  With regard to the present situation, what co-ordinating action can they take?  You have financial restrictions on one hand and day-to-day problems on the other, but is it not desirable in such a situation to ensure that we will have adequate supplies for transport?  I referred to the turf situation. It is all right to say that we should not cut turf, but what is to happen to our supplies and to the transport question associated with them and what can be done to keep up our vehicle transport?  We were getting&mdash;to use the common phrase&mdash;very shook with regard to transport towards the end of the last emergency. What are you going to do with regard to certain stocks, particularly nonperishable stocks that experience has taught us we can run short of?  What about the wheat situation?  Is it prudent to continue our present policy? In spite of the predilections of the Minister for Agriculture, we should provide reserves of food at home. as an insurance policy, as it were, if only as that.  What can we afford to get in by way of reserves?  There are specific lessons that we might never have been taught only for the emergency.  Before the recent war, if any Deputy stood up in this House and told us: &ldquo;You had better look to your supply of matches; you will have an acute problem if war breaks out&rdquo;, what would we have thought?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had lived through the 1914-1918 war he would have known it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that with regard to the recent emergency, matches were quite a problem&mdash;it is a relatively unimportant item, I know, but when it comes to an emergency the supply of matches becomes an acute problem for the country.  In fact, at one stage, if the Army had not been able, by means of a certain plant they had which was originally designed to <Col N="1434" /> supply phosphorus chemicals, to supply us with some, I doubt very much if we would have been able to continue through 1944 and 1945.  The fact that we would be able to produce chemicals here at all would have a twofold effect. If you are able to produce chemicals here, the man who is exporting the stuff must give it to you, whereas if you are completely dependent on him he would not.  That is a factor which must also be taken into consideration. If, at that time, we could not have looked after ourselves, the English suppliers, from information which is available, would not have sent us the materials we required, but as we were, we were treated with an eye to a later market.  That, too, is a very big factor in bringing in essential supplies.  That is merely a small instance, but it is the type of thing that will occur again all round.  I would therefore strongly urge on the Government that such a possibility should be considered and the Government need fear no unfair criticism from me on the matter of prudence.</P>
      <P>On the Minister for Agriculture's Estimate, I have already talked of the question of trying to have our own source of fertiliser.  That, again, is a co-ordination problem because it ties up with three things.  The actual plant or mechanism ties up with industry and commerce, while some of its uses tie up with defence, and the rest of its uses tie up with agriculture.  No one Minister can deal with such a problem himself. For instance, the Minister for Agriculture might very well decide&mdash;he was very sympathetic during the debate on agriculture&mdash;that it would be a good idea if we were prepared to exploit our phosphorus and if we had some nitrogen plants here, whether a saving plant or a generating plant, but it is no part of the functions of the Minister for Agriculture to manufacture anything, in the industrial sense, so that it ties up with industry and commerce.  There is a problem for the Government as a whole and a problem for which the country must hold them responsible, and, in particular, if the situation worsens or if a calamity should break, it is then, above all times, that the Government would be held responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Having regard to the limited time for this debate, I hesitate to proceed further, but since probably nobody will mention another matter of co-ordination, I think I should.  Again it takes me into a little detail on the Department of Defence.  In the surveys before the last war, it is patently evident that, except for certain co-ordinating action brought in by the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce, in many regards the Department of Defence was left, so to speak, to plough its own furrow and get ready for the task when it came upon it.  It would have been very helpful if they had had more day to day information &mdash;the big information, of course, was swapped, but I am speaking of co-ordination at the lower levels, which can only flow from co-ordination at the top&mdash;and the Army authorities should have been kept completely briefed with police intelligence.  There should have been a liaison between the police and the Army on the matter of intelligence. There should have been a liaison between External Affairs and the Army on the matter of general European intelligence, and our people in our foreign legations should have been instructed to take an interest in these things.  We are too small a country to think of sending military attaches and I do not advocate that at all.</P>
    <P>On the question of swapping information, before the last Government went out as part of the post-war idea, the idea was being encouraged&mdash;and I hope and presume the same thing will be encouraged under the present Government&mdash;and now more than ever I should like to commend it to the Taoiseach's attention in order that he may check on it.  These swappings of information were very important because, first, if the Army authorities had had more day-to-day information, they might have been able to make a better estimate than they did make as to what was likely to happen, and, secondly, if they had had a proper police estimate, the Magazine Fort raid would never have happened.  The Magazine Fort raid was to a certain extent due to that.  I do not want to <Col N="1436" /> stir up anybody about the Magazine Fort&mdash;I merely refer to it.  If anybody wants to know what happened in the Magazine Fort raid, it is this, that, at a very critical time for the nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be very interesting, but it does not arise on my Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I appear to be worrying somebody on that side about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If that Magazine Fort raid had happened three months later, this country would have been tied up in the war, practically of a certainty, and the will of the people to remain neutral would have been completely defeated by a minority, so that I am mentioning the matter as indicating the need for co-ordination in the general direction, both in respect of problems at the moment, such as the meat problem and the general situation ahead, the problems which arise in relation to the general world picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to commend certain things to the attention of the Taoiseach in exactly the same spirit in which I commended them to the Minister for External Affairs, and with the full qualification in regard to the necessary tact and reticence which sometimes has to be associated with foreign relations, and, of course, in asking these questions, I am, on this occasion anyway, completely content, so far as an answer is concerned, to leave it to the discretion of the Taoiseach, but it does suggest a problem of co-ordination.  The Minister for External Affairs, in his speech, referred to isolationism.  He remarked that isolationism would be impossible in any future conflict and I couple that with remarks about a United States of Europe and the surrender of sovereignty. I think these were the words he used.  Unfortunately, the printed report has not come to hand, and I speak subject to correction.  There, obviously, the Minister is thinking of matters of the greatest and deepest import for the future of this country <Col N="1437" /> albeit they are problems which, once resolved in any particular way, may remain so resolved for ever, or, if not, for a very long time.  Therefore, these problems in regard to external affairs in that connection obviously bring up problems which intimately touch the Government and the Taoiseach in his proper capacity as such.  I would commend them, too, for scrutiny and careful co-ordination.</P>
    <P>This is no place to go into the policy of the Minister for Finance, but the Minister for Finance is something more in a way.  Financial policy is something of the Government as a whole and the general overall policy of the Government here has been a seeking for economy by a method of restrictions, a method by which heretofore, I am sorry to say, the Government have not brought very many benefits to the community beyond giving cheaper entertainment and cheaper drink.  In this, I wonder is Government policy sound.  Here is what you are doing.  You are attempting the classical remedy for inflation in a localised area here which is only a small part of a large sterling area. So long as you remain at the par level with sterling, you are only a relatively microscopic portion of the sterling domain, and any perturbation you introduce here is unlikely to affect the trend of your currency as a whole, because your currency, because of the link, is the currency of that whole living space.  Any perturbation you introduce here has its concomitant disadvantage. It is an almost invariable law of nature, or of politics, anyway, that any austerity remedy or adjustment of social matters nearly always brings some disadvantage, so that, in the long run, you are trying to choose the best means.</P>
    <P>In the case of finance, here we are trying the classical remedy, the so-called austerity or restriction remedy, for which there may be a certain amount to be said in theory, without being able, by that remedy, to affect our currency because of this, so to speak, absence of a lockgate to wall in our own territory.  Therefore, is it really wise for us to suffer all the disadvantages, when, in such a situation, <Col N="1438" /> the austerity programme is not going to give you the currency adjustment necessary to give you the relief you seek?  It would be all very well if you are adopting this or any remedy which is pushed through logically and has some rational basis in company with everybody else over the whole area. Then the different units co-operating together might get some result, but is it wise to adopt the austerity remedy here when we were so much better off relatively in fundamentals than the big area next door to us, England, when, in regard to fundamentals of food and way of living generally, we were actually better off, though we were feeling the pinch, too?  Does not the adoption of such a remedy mean voluntarily throwing ourselves from a relatively advantageous position into a general level of difficulty?  Is that good policy?  Is that good co-ordination policy? Further, read the papers to-day and you see that, whatever remedies are being adopted by the people on the other side, the cost of living is going up there.  We are throwing ourselves into the melting-pot, so to speak, with them.  We are only a small part. <i>Quo vadis</i>?</P>
    <P>It is very easy for me to throw up the problem.  I have tried to put it fairly, realising that the Taoiseach and the Government have the difficulty of solving it but, as against that, they are the Government; they are charged by the House and the people with that responsibility; and I think it is a legitimate function of a member of the Opposition to demand that that responsibility be discharged.  I think I had better leave it there.</P>
    <P>I could expand further on the economy argument, on the particular financial policy here.  It seems to me, looking at it from one point of view, that the logical thing for the Minister for Finance to do, if he wanted to carry on on the line he was carrying on, would be to go the whole way with Clann na Poblachta and put in the lockgate.  That would give him some possibility of getting some result.  That would be added to the general level of the whole sterling area.  Whether he would get a better or a just result, I am not prepared to say at the moment, <Col N="1439" /> but I realise that the problem of breaking with sterling at the moment is a very difficult one and would be a peculiarly difficult one, perhaps, at the moment.  I do not want to go into it. You have three possibilities.  If it is not at par, then it overvalues or devalues. In either case you have certain real difficulties that would have to be got over.  Again, I am not the Government.  I have not their information. I have not the facilities of staff for examining the problems and I am not going to imitate certain irresponsible people by pretending that I have the omnibus remedy to give.  I have not.  The problem is there and the Government has the information and it is the Government's duty to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, on the sterling question, I was applauded by the far side. I once propounded in public, and it was duly printed, the difficulties of that problem.  I never got an answer. However, I leave it so.  There is no use in this &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; business.  The unfortunate Government of any country at this day has its problems. We will not help with doctrinaire approaches.  We will not help with criticism that is aimed at merely criticism. We can help by examining the problems and realising them.  It is in that spirit that I recommend what I have said to the Taoiseach, but, again, I repeat, the reins are in his hands and the hands of the Government and action is needed.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions as laid down in the Constitution, on the 18th February last, the Taoiseach, having been appointed according to that Constitution, duly presented his Government for ratification to the members of this House, and the Government which he presented was a new departure in Irish politics.  I venture to think that it was a solution which this country unconsciously was seeking for and moving towards since the inception of this State.  I am glad and happy to be sitting on the benches behind an inter-Party Government because I personally have always held the view, and have on every possible occasion enunciated that view, that the only suitable <Col N="1440" /> form of government to meet the special needs and the special requirements of this State is that type of government.  I do not believe that the other system of Government which this State suffered under&mdash;and I use the expression &ldquo;suffered under&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;ever since its inception, was one that operated for the benefit of the citizens generally.</P>
      <P>I do not want, in putting forward the following argument in support of what I am saying, to be immediately met by the suggestion that on the four different occasions that I refer to the country wanted a one-Party Government. We have had 13 general elections.  This is the 13th Dáil.  What the country has been striving for unconsciously all the time was to find the type of Government that really suited it and, in 1927, in 1932, in 1937 and in 1943, on the four occasions when, under the system of proportional representation, a Government was formed here of a Party nature, which did not command the majority of the support of this House, on each of these occasions the Government found it necessary to go to the country and to say to the country: &ldquo;We cannot carry on because we were defeated in the Dáil and it is your duty now, in the interests of the country, to put us back as a Party Government.&rdquo;  It was as true in 1927, under Cumann na nGaedheal as on the three occasions under Fianna Fáil.  That was always done within a year of the previous election on those different occasions.</P>
      <P>The general election of this year was on a different basis.  The issue was put fully and fairly.  The pleading was easy to understand.  The issue was, shall this country be ruled by Party or shall it not?  That was the issue that was made by the Government who went to the country before their term of office had expired, and the country gave its answer.  It was not going to the country after one year of office saying: &ldquo;We cannot carry on.&rdquo;  It was putting the issue fairly and squarely before the people and, after 26 years of experience, the people gave an emphatic answer but, in doing so, they unconsciously followed the principles that are laid down and enshrined in the Constitution which I hold here in my hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> That Constitution precludes the people of this country from electing their representatives in any manner except by the system of proportional representation and the whole spirit of that Constitution is driven in one direction only&mdash;that the Parliament, and through Parliament, the Government, shall be truly representative of all sections.  If you want to say that there is something sacred in the words &ldquo;Party Government,&rdquo; so sacred that it is wrong for us to depart from it, well, you do not find it in the Constitution. You have to go to the source from which it comes.</P>
    <P>If the House will bear with me for a few short minutes, I propose to demonstrate the fact that, in urging upon us here a system of Party Government as necessary for the welfare of this State, we are trying to impose on our native institutions a system from outside that is not only foreign to our nature, foreign to our set up, but foreign to our Constitution.  The Party system, as known to many Parliaments of the world to-day, originated in an historical event which took place in the country which is the birthplace and the home of modern Parliaments&mdash;our neighbour Britain.  It arose as a direct result of the Williamite wars, as a direct result of the banishing of the Stewarts and the putting on the throne of England of a parliamentary-appointed King.</P>
    <P>There grew up there&mdash;under a Constitution that was not in writing but depends for every great anchor sheet that it has, upon its unwritten nature &mdash;the convention that was known as his Majesty's Government and his Majesty's Opposition&mdash;Whigs one day and Tories the next.  But by whom was that Government elected or selected?  The largest Party went into the British House of Commons and, once again, the unwritten Constitution having become the force of law, by certain conventions, the Head of the State, the King of England, sent for the Leader of the largest Party and asked him to form a Government.  When he went back to the Commons he formed his Government and that Government sat on one side&mdash;that was his Majesty's Government.  The other <Col N="1442" /> Party&mdash;the Whigs or Tories as the case might be&mdash;sat on the other side.  This was his Majesty's Opposition.  Then the other countries in Europe, imitating the English set-up, through their Heads of State, summoned their Parliaments and through the same Heads appointed their Governments, and in the same way they had their local his Majesty's Government and their local his Majesty's Opposition.</P>
    <P>With that full knowledge here, in the deliberate framing of the Constitution that we had in 1937, in that Constitution there is created a Head of the State, a President who is intended to correspond to the crowned Head of England or the President of France, the President of Italy or the king of any monarchy on the Continent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In the setting up of a head of the State here, there was deliberately left out from the functions of that head of the State the obligation, the right or the duty to send for the leader of the largest Party.  That was deliberately left out of the Constitution here and this Dáil, and this Dáil alone, by various constitutional methods, is the organ that appoints the Taoiseach and appoints its own Government.  Therefore, I say, not only the will of the people but the Constitution under which we live bearing out the will of the people, has at last brought such will to fruition in this inter-Party Government.  So much for arguments against Party Government. What about the arguments in favour of inter-Party Government?  We in Ireland, in this Christian, democratic State, should not be looking for the things that are to divide us but for those upon which we can agree.  There could have been in this House to-day a Government representative of every Party and every section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the fruits that flow from inter-Party Government?  What is the benefit that accrues from it?  It means that those who will have nothing to do with it and who still insist upon maintaining the Party system must for their <Col N="1443" /> own preservation and in their own interests&mdash;I will not say deliberately, but will use the word &ldquo;subconsciously&rdquo; invent problems upon which to differ, and if there are not any, then they must invent them.  Where does that lead you and what benefit does it bring to the country?  I am proud to sit here to-day on these benches with people with whom, in the normal course of events, in years gone by, one might disagree on many points.  I am proud to know that we have been able to resolve these points under ten major headings, and I am prouder still to know that this country, in the solution of these problems and in the leadership of that army in their solution, has been able to find a man like my colleague, Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I belong to his profession; I have worked with him at his profession for a quarter of a century.  There was no client in this country, no matter what his political views were, no matter what his occupation in life, who was not glad to retain his services at the Bar.  I say it is a proud moment when the wisdom of this House and the good luck of this House chose that man to lead this new movement in our country. That man sacrificed a big career and a big income to carry the biggest brief he ever carried; but he is carrying it in a great cause, and he has set a glorious precedent.  The cause, I hope, will endure; the precedent, I hope, will be followed&mdash;that never again will this Parliament here ever meet except to elect a Government representative of each and every section of the community.</P>

      <P>I want to turn my mind at least to the evening when the present Taoiseach assumed office and he addressed the nation over the radio.  I listened attentively to that broadcast and certain passages remain in my mind to this moment.  The most important of these was the reference the Taoiseach made to the position of Ireland in this world to-day.  He indicated that Ireland had a mission, to interpret Europe to America and America to Europe.  Now, we had almost complete machinery to put into <Col N="1444" /> effect this particular duty or mission, but immediately after the assumption of the present Government to office, the machinery was scrapped.  How can we interpret Europe to America or America to Europe, if we have not got direct contact with both those Continents? We scrapped Aerlínte, the only means we had of direct transport between this country and the American Continent.  We reduced the services of Aer Lingus, restricting the contact of this country in a direct manner with parts of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making what I believe to be fair comment.  I listened <Col N="1446" /> to the Taoiseach's broadcast to this nation immediately after his acceptance of office as head of the Government and I am relating that to what happened afterwards.  I say, further, that the abandonment for the time being at any rate, as we understand it now, of the short-wave station means the removal of the balance of the machinery which would make it possible for this nation to have direct contact with any part of the world.  I refer to that for this reason.  I think it is the general opinion that this country's struggle for freedom has been not only an example to all subject nations in all parts of the world but was actually copied by these nations, and that the leaders of the movement for Irish freedom are known throughout the length and breadth of the world. The abandonment of the short-wave station, therefore, is regretted not only by people here but by many people far away from here in addition to those of Irish blood and origin.</P>
      <P>A number of policies have been propounded by various spokesmen of the different Parties who make up the present inter-Party Government all of which are in conflict with each other. The people, therefore, want to know where we stand.  The Minister for Agriculture has stated, and he has not been repudiated, that the time has now come when the farmers are to be the rich people in this country; that the time has gone when the industrialists and the businessmen will be those who are making the money.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees that Irish industry should be kept going, that every assistance should be given to it to give employment and to manufacture commodities of good quality at a reasonable price.  In fact the most recent statement of the Minister was that, if it was necessary to get additional industrial development here and Irish citizens could not be found to comply with the Control of Manufactures Act, he was prepared to give licences to non-nationals to start certain essential industries here.  That would imply that the industrialist is to be attracted here on the only inducement which will attract industrialists, particularly non-nationals, namely the profit motive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> When you relate these two points of view to the point of view expressed in this House by Deputy Larkin, who is leader of the Labour group in the inter-Party Government, that the time has now come when not only will Labour take part in the political management of the country but will move forward to the management and control of the businesses of the country, I think these three different points of view of policies require, as Deputy de Valera said, co-ordination with a view to having some common policy which can be understood by the different sections of the community who are affected.  I ask the Taoiseach to say what these different points of view really mean, according to his understanding of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the position of this country as a result of our continued link with sterling.  I have a personal view on that matter.  It may be entirely wrong. The present Minister for Agriculture in 1947 said that by June sterling would be internationally convertible.  Again it was believed, as expressed by the Minister for Finance, that as a result of Marshall Aid and the latest international arrangements in regard to the European recovery programme sterling would shortly become internationally convertible.  I do not believe that.  I rather hold the view that in time, not too far distant, sterling will, in fact, have to be devalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether the Taoiseach has any policy with regard to our sterling position.  I know that to-day, although there is a legal rate of exchange between this country and the dollar countries whereby we get four dollars to the £, and although <Col N="1448" /> there is an official legal rate of exchange in Paris of 860 francs to the £, nevertheless, because dollar currency is free in France you can, if you are an American and have dollars, buy francs at the rate of 380 to the dollar, and then buy pounds with those francs at the rate of 860 to the £.  That means that the £ is costing the dollar-holder only 2 dollars 30 cents.  To me that is an indication of the direction in which sterling is heading.  It is well known here that on the free exchange in America sterling is bought at rates much lower than the official rates.  We may find ourselves trying to get all our eggs again into the one basket&mdash;the British market with British currency&mdash; and we may find ourselves ultimately in a situation for which we had no responsibility, but which may have very serious adverse results for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether there is anything in the news we read <Col N="1451" /> which should cause us to fear that a conflict will break out again in the near future.  One set of opinions says that war is inevitable and another set of opinions says that war will be averted at least for a number of years.  I am wondering whether the Taoiseach has in mind the advisability of loosening up some of the economy springs and of spending a certain amount of money by way of insurance so that this country can meet the situation should war break out.  The Fianna Fáil Government, shortly after assuming office, recognising that war could come, insisted&mdash;even to the extent of compulsion&mdash;that wheat growing should be indulged in in this country.  In the event of war we would, in that way, be able to have some bread for our people instead of having to sell our freedom for a loaf of bread.  In other words, we would not have to join in a war in which we had no interest, for the sake of feeding our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way I should like to know if the Government is aware of the seriousness of the world situation.  The uncertainty of the world situation is such that I want to know if the Government is satisfied that its policy of economy will ensure that in the event of the outbreak of war nobody will be able to come in here and say: &ldquo;Well, we told you.&rdquo;  Nobody wants the doubtful satisfaction of coming in here afterwards&mdash;if such a situation should arise and if our people should have greater difficulties than they might have had if certain precautions had been taken&mdash;and saying: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I am raising this matter in the hope that our minds will be eased on this point and that we will be told that we need not worry because it is being kept in mind.  There is one other point I want to put to the Taoiseach.  Under the Fianna Fáil Administration a very extensive scheme for rural electrificaton was put through this House, partly by subsidy and partly by capital expenditure on the part of the Electricity Supply Board.  The scheme was to cost something like £20,000,000, expended over a period of ten years.  I want to know if the present Government has changed the policy with regard to rural <Col N="1452" /> electrification by reducing in this financial year the amount to be spent on development under the scheme as envisaged.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair without hesitation, but I ask the Chair for a ruling on this.  I am approaching the Estimate of the Taoiseach from a general point of view. I have touched on a few items already which, strictly speaking, would have been more appropriate under the Estimates on other Departments.  It is only in connection with the policy of economy that I ask the question.  Will <Col N="1453" /> the Chair hear me and then rule?  If the Chair rules I am out of order I shall not proceed any further.  I am simply asking is it the policy now to change the plan by reducing the amount spent on rural electrification.

To have in this country men highly developed in technical matters, particularly in the condition of the world as it is to-day, was something that was of great importance.  In order to get more money, because the economies cannot go far enough, what do we find?  We find an indirect form of taxation.  £200,000 is put on the backs of people who post letters. Yesterday we were informed by the Minister for External Affairs that in order to get in a few more coppers into the Exchequer in the form of indirect taxation, passports from now on would cost £1 or £1s. 0d. instead of 12/6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that this Government, in what it calls the wisdom of its own decisions, decided to introduce a great many economies, economies which have fallen very heavily on the shoulders of almost every section of our community.  Instead of admitting that extra money is necessary and getting it in the form of direct taxation, we have these forms of indirect taxation which are again a burden on the people, but which are not referred <Col N="1456" /> to as Government expenditure.  We have no economy in departmental expenses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who spoke immediately prior to my speaking favoured us with a long technical lecture on the history of Party Governments, going right back to the Williamite wars and bringing in the Whigs and the Tories.  Not one word of that part of his speech had any relevancy whatever to the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department. Nevertheless, he was listened to without interruption by every member of this House.  As far as his references to the Constitution were concerned, I shall leave it to other speakers to deal with them.</P>
      <P>There is one item to which I wish to refer.  I wish to refer to his concluding remarks where he stated that he felt inter-Party Government was something which was of vital importance in a democracy, where one could have Government by every member of the House joined together with the complete elimination of an opposition; that oppositions were there only for the purpose of creating problems, creating troubles and looking for them.  All I can say to Deputy Sir John Esmonde is that if he&mdash;and I believe him to be quite sincere, but I believe him to be also a very simple gentleman&mdash;believes that a time can be reached when a conglomeration of mixed Parties forming a Government can meet together in one Party room to try to define policy without there being any opposition amongst themselves, or without there being certain Deputies following the example of Deputy Cowan, then he is an even simpler gentleman than I thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was not heat and bitterness over there, I do not know what to call it.  Deputies were losing all restraint and speaking in hot blood and for no apparent reason whatsoever.  I suggest it was simply and solely because Deputies on the opposite side realise that the inter-Party Government is a complete 100 per cent. success.  That is the cause of their bitterness and, so far as some of them are concerned, their viciousness. The reason for some of the methods adopted by them and by some of their organisations throughout the country to attempt to sabotage certain national activities is because it is being borne in on them that the people of this country are overwhelmingly behind the inter-Party Government and that the goodwill and support for this Government is growing every day.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite side ought to realise, after a period of five months, that the line which they have been pursuing both in their speeches in this House, in their speeches outside this House and in their Party organ, is doing no harm to the Government, is doing a certain amount of harm to aspects of our national life, and is doing very great harm to themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving Deputies opposite a few home truths.  Those Deputies know this, that in their line of conduct both in this House and outside it, in their efforts to damage this Government, they have not stopped short of actions and utterances that do damage to the country.  Deputies on <Col N="1460" /> the opposite side, and the organisation to which they belong, have done their damnedest to create unrest amongst our people, to create uneasiness amongst our people, to get some people to think that their livelihoods, their jobs, are in jeopardy, to suggest that people are losing employment because of this Government's action, and they try to twist completely what Deputy Briscoe tried to hang his speech on, what is called economy and retrenchment. We made it perfectly clear that what we meant by economy and retrenchment was cutting out wasteful and extravagant expenditure.  We made it quite clear we were not concerned about any money that might be required when it came to worth-while schemes, schemes that would benefit the country.  But we did make it very clear that a small, a comparatively poor country, could not afford to ape the ways of the greatest and the richest countries of the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe bewails the loss of the transatlantic service.  Millions of pounds for that and the same Party who started that could not find a few shillings extra for a blind pensioner or an old age pensioner.  The Deputy tells us that we had no direct line of communication between our kith and kin in America and ourselves until they put forward this scheme.  I listened to Deputy MacEntee on the same lines, speaking passionately and eloquently about the millions of Irish in America and the transatlantic air line.  The very same case could be made for a fleet of Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth liners and, mind you, it would not surprise me if Fianna Fáil made that case.  Millions for everything, so why not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  They never gave it.  Let us get down to brass tacks in this House.  Deputies opposite, although they are in opposition, have a responsibility, whether they choose to shoulder it or not, to this country, and, mind you, they got a fairly good example from the Opposition that sat on the benches over there during the 16 years they were in office &mdash;a very good example that they might follow with profit not only to themselves but to the country.  Deputies opposite spend their time in trying to drive wedges between the Parties that make up this inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>The fact that we have them is what is breaking your heart.  Deputy Briscoe tries to establish that there is something fundamentally different between what Deputy Dillon says, what I say, and what Deputy Larkin says.  That is undoubtedly strange to Deputy Briscoe because the Deputy has the good or bad fortune to belong to a Party where there is one view and one voice, where nothing else is allowed or will be allowed.  That is another of the very great differences between the Party on the opposite side and the Parties that make up the Government here.  For us, whether we sit at that side of the House or whether we sit at this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a pleasure I hope to have on some other occasion; the pleasure would be all on my side and there would not be much of it on Deputy Moran's side.  Deputy Moran is a young boy in this House.

We have all this set-up here because Deputies on the opposite side on the 18th February got the biggest shock they ever got in their lives.  There is no doubt about that.  It was quite obvious to anybody here in this House on that date and for a week afterwards that the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party did not know whether they were standing on their heads or their heels, whether they were in Leinster House or outside it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sir John Esmonde said he was proud to stand behind the inter-Party Government. He said that Government was something for which the people had been unconsciously searching since we got a Parliament of our own.  The Deputy finished by saying that the inter-Party Government was the country's solution, and in saying that I give him credit for thinking that he was saying what was true&mdash;but it is obvious that the inter-Party Government was not the country's solution.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce held the same idea, but I think he knows probably pretty well that the inter-Party Government was no solution furnished by the people of the country, but was a solution by a combination of groups whom nobody could reasonably think could come together to form a Government. I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he says that we were stunned on the day on which the present Taoiseach and the present Government were put into office.  We were.  He said that we went to sleep for a week.  I can assure him that the whole country was in that state for longer than a week, and is in that state to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost a miracle. Now, this discussion brings up probably the most serious question that we can put to ourselves as a Parliament.  What is the present Government's policy with regard to democratic representation?  I want to put that question.  In so far as a Parliament freely elected in a democratic way has any authority, that authority comes from the will and wish of the people who have elected it. Now, two of the Parties that go to make up the present Government put forward sufficient candidates to form a Government in this country, and a majority Government in this country. Fine Gael did that, and Clann na Poblachta did it, and what was the answer of the Irish people?  In the case of Fine Gael they made a fairly respectable showing, but in the case of Clann na Poblachta you had a 90 per cent. turndown of the Party and of their policy by the people of the country.  What moral authority resides in a Government of that sort?  You have the Minister for External Affairs, one of the most important Ministries in a Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think, however, and I repeat it, that it is a very wrong thing for Ministers to be selected from the Party that was almost unanimously turned down&mdash;turned down at any rate to the extent of 90 per cent. by the Irish people.  There are smaller Parties in the House than Clann na Poblachta, but remember, even if they are smaller, they did not have such a percentage turn-down by the people and they could reasonably put forward the argument that if they had put up sufficient numbers and got correspondingly large support from the people, they would have been in the position of Fine Gael, at least in point of membership.  I have no real quarrel, therefore, with <Col N="1468" /> any of the Parties that put up a small number and got a fairly good percentage of those people elected.  They would have a far better right than the Party who put up far more candidates than was necessary to supply an overall majority, the Party who went to the people, who put their policy before the people and were turned down to a 90 per cent. extent by the people.</P>

There was elected here a Minister for Health and I want to say straightaway that I think he is an earnest, well-meaning and hard-working Minister.  I believe that, but can he implement his policy? He is very interested in tuberculosis; the treatment, prevention and cure of tuberculosis are the things nearest to his heart.  I wonder did he protest against the action of the Minister for Finance in taking away the additional £25,000 set aside by the Fianna Fáil Government for the heating and cleaning of schools in this year?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan is in a sort of Limbo between this earth and a graveyard.  The people on the opposite benches have probably as good an idea as we have of what the public opinion about them is and they know the truth of the assertion which Deputy Butler was endeavouring to convey to the House, despite the many interruptions from the far side, that this Taoiseach is elected not by the majority vote of the Irish people but by the majority vote of the members of this House.</P>
      <P>I want to substantiate my view in that respect.  I claim that, reading over the speeches made during the general election, the people who voted for the National Labour Party and for the Labour Party were voting for two diametrically-opposed policies.  The people who voted for the National Labour Party certainly never believed having listened to the speeches made by the candidates and representatives of that Party in the different constituencies, that, in voting for Deputy Everett, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and other members of his Party, they were voting to make Deputy Norton, Tánaiste, and Deputy Murphy, Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> Just as that happened in the case of the National Labour Party, the same is true of the people who voted for another Party.  Deputies, if they do not take my word for it, need only go into the Library and go over the files of the <i>Irish Independent</i> for the month of January and the first few days of February, and read the speeches that were made by National Labour Party speakers and by Irish Labour Party speakers, and they will find there the truth of the assertion that I am making. Deputy Davin, speaking in his constituency, asked the people who were listening to him to create unity in the Irish Labour ranks by putting the National Labour candidate at the bottom of the poll, and Mr. S. O'Farrell, now Senator O'Farrell, secretary of the National Labour Party, speaking at a meeting in the Hotel Workers' Hall, Eden Quay, reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 21st January last, stated that National Labour was an independent Party.</P>
    <P>They had been approached in the past to agree to an arrangement by which the different groups in opposition to Fianna Fáil would not oppose each other's candidates in the event of an election.  &ldquo;That proposal was made to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by a leader of one of the opposition Parties.  The answer I gave was: &lsquo;If we cannot accept each other's policy before an election, how can we enter into a blind bargain to act together afterwards.  If you are prepared to accept another Party's candidates, what is to prevent you accepting that Party's policy.&rsquo;&rdquo; Do the members of the Government or any of the Deputies opposite mean to say that the people who gave attention to Senator O'Farrell on that occasion were voting to put representatives of other Parties into Government Benches?</P>
    <P>To deal with the National Labour Party, I think we have only to read the report of the conference that is being held in Tralee these days to know what mandate the National Labour Party had for taking part in the inter-Party Government, and to say that the supporters of National Labour, for instance. gave the National Labour candidates a mandate <Col N="1475" /> to change the Government is to say something that is untrue.  That has been borne out by the meeting of the organisation which supported the National Labour Party in their campaign.</P>

      <P>Talking about this inter-Party Government, apart from the people in the country, I wonder what respect people outside the country can have for a Government whose Ministers speak with different voices. It is a well-known fact that the majority of the Ministers of the present Government&mdash;I am sure they would not deny it&mdash;are men who are pledged to membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We have, then, a Minister for External Affairs who stated quite definitely here yesterday that we were not members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on this Vote last year, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said, in reply to an interruption by Deputy Moran, that the only difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil was that they were all members of the British Commonwealth, that he was stating it definitely that they were and Fianna <Col N="1477" /> Fáil were afraid to state it.  Deputy MacBride, Minister for External Affairs has borne out in his statement yesterday the contention that we have put forward that, since our Constitution and since the other legislation that was enacted since Fianna Fáil came into office, we are now no longer members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

      <P>Talking about mandates, I wonder what is the position of the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach in regard to the Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill?  During the election campaign Deputy Norton, as he was then, thumped the country and accused Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, of retreating from his Prices and Efficiency Bill.  He gave the electors to understand that if he was returned and had any say in the Government resulting from the election he would see that that Bill would be put into effect, would be passed into legislation. At the very same time, Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, wrote to the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and told them that if Fine Gael had any say in the formation of a new Government they would see to it that that Bill was withdrawn.</P>

I wonder what success he has obtained from the Taoiseach in that direction and whether the committee now being set up to deal with subsidies on bread has any relation to those promises made by Deputy Norton.  Are they going to fulfil the promises in that way?  If they do not increase the price of bread, will Deputy Norton persuade them to reimpose the corporation profits tax so as to subsidise bread prices?</P>
      <P>There are many extracts that could be taken from newspapers in the Library, from speeches made by the different groups on the far side.  It is a wrong and untrue assertion to make that the Parties at present backing the Taoiseach had a mandate to do so. Some of the Parties, to give them credit, Clann na Talmhan, during the whole election campaign announced to the public that they were prepared to support any Party in opposition to Fianna Fáil and, in accordance with that promise, they backed Fine Gael for Taoiseach.</P>

He spoke from a well prepared statement of the reasons that actuated that Party in supporting the inter-Party Government and he made some very astounding statements.  He told us, first of all, that we had here a non-political Taoiseach and gave the impression that the present Taoiseach was a man who had no interest before in politics.  Some of us who have been for a good number of years in this House know the present Taoiseach as a very active politician.</P>

      <P>It is not to the Taoiseach's discredit that he has been an active politician for a long number of years.  No member of the House, even those who disagree with him politically, can have any grievance against him for being an active politician, but I resent anyone trying to convey to us that the present Taoiseach has not been a very active politician. We remember him as Deputy Costello contributing to public affairs in this country at a time when there was a good deal of heat attached to politics. We remember him shortly after Fianna Fáil took office from 1933 on, speaking here and participating actively from the Opposition Benches.  We know that he was a violent opponent of Fianna Fáil policy and opposed every action Fianna Fáil took to make progress along the national road.  He opposed the removal of the Oath, he opposed the retention of the Land Annuities, he opposed the new Constitution, he opposed every national step that Fianna Fáil endeavoured to take.  I am telling the House what I have known of his activities, lest Deputy Flanagan or any of the newer deputies might be carried away by Deputy Dr. Brennan's speech this evening.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, then Deputy Costello, speaking on the 28th <Col N="1481" /> February, 1934, said, as given in column 2237:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister gave extracts from various laws on the Continent, but he carefully refrained from drawing attention to the fact that the Blackshirts were victorious in Italy and that the Hitler Shirts were victorious in Germany, as, assuredly, in spite of this Bill and in spite of the Public Safety Act, the Blueshirts will be victorious in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever you might accuse the Taoiseach of when making a statement like that, you certainly would not accuse him of being a non-politician. So far as I could understand Deputy Dr. Brennan, he was putting the mantle of Wolfe Tone around the Taoiseach and declaring that we were going to march forward to an Irish republic under the leadership and guidance of the Taoiseach, or words to that effect.  I do not know if the Deputy got any assurance from the Taoiseach that he was going to change his political line of thought and lead the Deputy along the road to an Irish republic.  If the Taoiseach does, he will belie his past and do something that those who know him well enough would not suspect him of doing.</P>

If Clann na Poblachta and others in the inter-Party Government think it will assuage their consciences or make things easier for them to have a speech like that of Deputy Dr. Brennan's published in the Press, that we are going to march into a republic under the leadership and guidance of the Taoiseach, I do not begrudge it to them.  But, knowing what the Fine Gael Party was in the past and the actions both as Ministers and Deputies of members of that Party who are now members of this inter-Party Government, I can assure Deputy Dr. Brennan and other Deputies that they will have to wait a long time before they are marched into an Irish republic through any efforts of the Fine Gael Party.  I repeat that the Parties I <Col N="1482" /> have named, particularly the National Labour Party, the Irish Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta, got no mandate whatever for the attitude they took up here and that this Government is not a Government elected by the Irish people but a Government elected by the majority of members of this House.</P>

      <P>Over 12 months ago, when those of us who are sitting on this side of the House were in the Opposition Benches, appeals were being made to the smaller groups of Parties who were then in opposition to sink their differences, forget the past, unite together for the common good of Ireland and form one sound, solid Government which would work in the best interests of our people and not in the best interests of themselves, as we have seen the previous Government do.  That was the responsibility which last February fell on every elected representative to this Parliament, because we knew that there was only one way <Col N="1483" /> in which the people could have clean, sound government and that was by the removal of Fianna Fáil from office. Every Deputy of the various Parties who form the Government had a responsibility in that way.  We considered the interests of the people. We are considering the interests of the people to-day and it is by consideration of the interests of the people that we will continue to be on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>In the past we saw the way in which the affairs of this country were administered by the previous Government. We saw the unemployed lined up in long queues outside the labour exchanges throughout the country.  We saw the cream of Irish manhood being forced to go across to the land of our traditional enemy, in order to eke out an existence in English coal mines, English maltings, English factories and English farms, because they were denied a living in their own country owing to the policy of Fianna Fáil. When we saw the cream of Irish manhood forced to leave this country, when we saw the deplorable conditions under which the poorer sections of our population were compelled to live, when we looked at our housing position, when we saw large numbers of our people suffering from tuberculosis, when we saw the plight of our farmers, who were suffering severely as a result of the unsound agricultural policy first of Deputy Dr. Ryan and then of Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture, we realised that the members of Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, the Labour Party and those who were independent Deputies, had an obligation to our country and to our people.  We knew that we could not realise the ambitions of our various Parties without removing the first obstacle&mdash;the hindrance to progress in this country&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party. We have succeeded in removing the Fianna Fáil Party from office.  We have replaced it by a Government which I can say without a boast is the best Government in every way the world has to-day.</P>

I am taking this <Col N="1485" /> opportunity to inform Deputy Lemass and this House, through the Chair, that everyone of the back benchers on this side of the House realise that we have a responsibility to the Government we helped to elect last February. We realise that it is our responsibility to keep that Government there&mdash;and that we will do.  This Government will have my full support and my wholehearted co-operation.

They realise that political jobbery is about to end in this country&mdash;and end for all time. They realise that they have an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil despite the fact that we were told that there could be no alternative to Fianna Fáil and despite the fact that we were warned that if Fianna Fáil was not returned as a Government there would be very serious consequences for our people. Fianna Fáil is now six months out of office and yet the earth has not trembled nor has the sky darkened. <Col N="1486" /> None of the extraordinary prophesies of Fianna Fáil has come to pass.  None of the horrid and terrible misfortunes that Deputy de Valera prophesied if Fianna Fáil were not returned to office has come to pass.  But what have we seen?  We have seen that the responsible members of the various Parties in this House have placed the country and the people before their Parties. They have realised their responsibilities and they have come together and offered the people the alternative Government which is functioning to-day, sound and steady, in complete unity and harmony.  That Government is functioning and will function despite whatever attempts will be made by the front benches of the Opposition to undermine the confidence of the people in it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brian Brady has spoken in this House and referred to the Taoiseach.  I would point out that, despite the fact that I am six years a Deputy in this House, I think that this is only the second occassion on which I have heard Deputy Brian Brady speak.  In his reference to the Taoiseach he said that during his membership of this Dáil he seldom heard the Taoiseach participate in the debates of this House.  We have elected a Taoiseach and I share one-seventy-fifth of that responsibility with other Deputies.  We are proud of the fact that we have a Taoiseach in this House to-day who has not on his hands or on his record any of the bitter memories of the civil war.  We can boast loudly and proudly of that fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
