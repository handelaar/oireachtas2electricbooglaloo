      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will give an assurance that on his proposed visit to Paris on March 14th next to attend the Committee on European Economic Co-operation he will not discuss thereat any political&mdash;other than economic&mdash;<Col N="332" /> matter, until (a) the partition of the country will have been solved to the complete satisfaction of the people of Ireland; (b) opportunities for freedom of speech will have been conceded to the inhabitants in the territory of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might take this opportunity to make a short statement, for the information of the Dáil, on the purpose and scope of the conference in Paris which I am about to attend.</P>
      <P>The body which will meet in Paris is the Committee on European Economic Co-operation which met in Paris last summer and drew up a programme for European economic recovery in response to the suggestion contained in the speech made by the United States Secretary of State at Harvard on the 5th of June.  Copies of the report drawn up by the committee at its session last summer are available in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>The official agenda of the forthcoming meeting is confined to matters arising out of that report.  The committee will first consider a report by the secretary general of the committee on developments in economic co-operation between the participating countries since its last meeting.  In the second place, the committee will consider the results of the examination by its technical commissions of the reports issued by the American administration within the last few months on the quantities of various classes of commodities likely to be available under the European Recovery Programme if the legislation now before Congress is enacted. Finally&mdash;and perhaps I might describe this as the principal item on the agenda &mdash;the forthcoming meeting will be called upon to set up a working party, consisting of representatives of each of the 16 participating countries, which will have two specific tasks&mdash;firstly, to frame the constitution of the joint organisation of the participating countries which is to be set up as soon as the European Recovery Programme comes into force, and, secondly, to prepare the text of a multilateral agreement on economic co-operation to be concluded between the participating countries when that stage is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> The setting up of the proposed joint organisation was specifically provided for in the report which the committee made at its session last summer.  Paragraph 113 of that report stated that, if means for carrying out the programme contemplated in the report were made available, a joint organisation to review progress achieved in the execution of the programme would be necessary. In the same paragraph, the participating countries declared themselves ready, in that event, to set up such an organisation by mutual agreement.</P>
    <P>The proposed multilateral agreement is also foreshadowed in the same report.  In paragraph 32, the 16 participating Governments pledged themselves to join together, and to invite other European countries to join with them, to ensure that the recovery programme contemplated in the report was carried out.  In execution of this pledge, each of the participating countries undertook to use all its efforts to develop its production, to make the best use of its existing productive capacity, to work for financial and economic stability, to co-operate with one another with a view to the expansion of trade, and so on.  The proposed multilateral agreement will cover this same ground and, in addition, will incorporate the arrangements for the setting up of the joint organisation to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, accordingly, that the matters to be discussed at the resumed meeting of the C.E.E.C. on March 14th appertain primarily to the economic sphere.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's question is intended to elicit the Government's attitude to the partition of our country, I should like to add that the Government regards the continuance of Partition as the most serious obstacle to the political and economic welfare of our people.  Indeed, the Government, with whose full authority I speak on this matter, finds it difficult to contemplate with enthusiasm any plan for economic recovery and development which does not envisage Ireland as one economic entity.  At a time when it is so essential that there should be complete economic co-operation among the <Col N="334" /> nations of Western Europe, the Government's most earnest desire is to secure the removal of this artificial and unnatural barrier which forms an obstacle to the integration of the economy of our island.</P>
    <P>Apart from economic measures to develop the productive capacity of Western Europe, it is essential to rally the people behind an ideal based upon a recognition of Christian principles and the right of the individual to his personal freedom in accordance with the natural law.  Such a concept must necessarily involve strict adherence to well-recognised elementary democratic rights; among these is, of course, the right of free speech.</P>
    <P>The continuance of a state of affairs wherein fundamental political and personal rights are denied to a section of our people renders it difficult to give reality to such an ideal.  In this situation, the Government earnestly hopes that the British Government will realise this and will co-operate in securing the due recognition of that ideal, and will facilitate complete economic co-operation in this island.</P>

      <P>The developments which have led to the collection of tithe rent charges in their present form are described in a very explicit statement which was made in reply to a question on the 7th December, 1937, and which the Deputy can find in the Dáil Report for that date.  Notwithstanding the many explanations made in this matter the popular misconception still seems to exist that these charges benefit the funds of a Church. That is not so and I would like to emphasise that the charges have no religious significance whatever, are similar to State revenue, and are devoted to a number of national purposes such as intermediate education, the National University, Department of Agriculture, etc.  Redemptions in Land Act proceedings or by way of cash payments made by the occupiers of lands have reduced the number of holdings liable to those charges to 4,500 and the present annual rental to approximately £8,000.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to state what the return per acre has been from any plantation until the final mature crop has been harvested.  This may be anywhere from 50 to 100 years after the initial planting of the ground. Forestry is not undertaken by the State with a view to profit.  Such income as accrues is expressed as annual increments payable throughout the life of the plantations.  It has not yet been possible to make a detailed assessment of the probable ultimate yield from the <Col N="346" /> woods and plantations in the hands of the Forestry Division, but from the available evidence, it would appear that capital values are being created which will repay all expenditure since State afforestation was first undertaken.</P>

      <P>In the selection of allottees for parcels of untenanted land to be divided, the primary object of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion.  Subject to that criterion, they consider applicants under the categories specified in Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by Section 33 of the Land Act, 1933, to which as the statutory basis I would refer the <Col N="347" /> Deputy.  There is no specified statutory order of preference, but (subject to the statutory condition that the Land Commission must be satisfied as to the competence and intention of all allottees to work the land), broadly speaking, the applicants who are considered to have the strongest claim to allotment are:&mdash;Former herds or other employees on the lands acquired; former evicted tenants or their representatives; local uneconomic landholders; migrants who give up their holdings elsewhere for the relief of congestion; trustees for communal purposes, such as sportsfields, school gardens, turbary, pasturage, etc.; local applicants for accommodation and cottage plots; local landless men.

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The information required by the Deputy is given in a written reply which, with the permission of an Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are two categories of temporary officers employed in the Dublin Postal District, viz., male temporary Post Office clerks and temporary postmen, and their maximum wage is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Temporary Post Office Clerks.</P>
      <P>(a)  Employed at any time in 1945 or 1946, £4 11s. 4d. per week.</P>
      <P>(b)  New entrants recruited since 1st January, 1947, £4 6s. per week.</P>
      <P>(c)  An allowance of 2/6 a week is paid when employed on Grade A duties.</P>
      <P>Temporary Postmen.</P>
      <P>(a)  Employed at any time in 1945 or 1946, £4 1s. 10d. per week.</P>
      <P>(b)  New entrants recruited since 1st January, 1947, £3 15s. per week.</P>
      <P>(c)  An allowance of 2/3 a week is paid when employed on Grade A duties.</P>
      <P>There is no discrimination in the matter of wages as between married and single men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> These wages scales are regarded as equitable in relation to the rates for other Departmental grades.</P>
    <P>The position of the temporary grades on the question of a weekly half-holiday is precisely the same as that of the other Departmental grades, i.e., a half-holiday can only be considered subject to the maintenance of a 44hour net working week.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Acts, no person can be appointed to any permanent situation in the Civil Service unless and until a certificate of his qualification for such situation has been issued by the Civil Service Commissioners. The Acts referred to also provide that, with certain exceptions which are unrelated to the type of posts referred to in the question, every appointment to any permanent situation in the Civil Service shall be made by means of a competitive examination conducted according to regulations to be made by the Civil Service Commissioners with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Competitive examinations for appointment to situations as established postman, confined to temporary and part-time postmen, have been held periodically.  The last such competitive examination was held in August, 1947.  The service qualification prescribed in the regulations on that occasion was two years' continuous service or four years in the aggregate. The upper age limit was 45 years, but there was provision in the regulations for an extension of the upper age limit to 50 years in the case of candidates who had rendered certain service with the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the normal practice, the age limits and service qualifications to be prescribed for any future confined competitive examinations for situations as postman will be carefully considered in my Department before the Civil Service Commissioners are approached as regards the making of the necessary regulations.  It is unlikely, however, that the required period of service prescribed in any future such competitive examinations held will be reduced to the period of <Col N="352" /> one year suggested by the Deputy, nor is it likely that any concession in the matter of age limits, additional to that already referred to, will be granted to men who have rendered service in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand that the supply of seed oats available this year is not as plentiful as in previous years, I have received no reports of a serious shortage in County Leitrim or elsewhere.  If, however, there are any growers in that county who are experiencing difficulty in securing their requirements they should communicate with the Acting Secretary to the County Leitrim Committee of Agriculture, Main Street, Carrick-on-Shannon, or with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of my Department's scheme for the distribution of seeds at reduced prices is to assist in providing a change of seed for a number of the more needy smallholders in certain parts of the congested districts.  The <Col N="354" /> funds provided for this purpose are restricted and do not permit of the supply of seeds to farmers generally throughout these districts.  I am satisfied that the quantity of seed oats allocated for distribution under this season's scheme in County Leitrim was as generous as possible having regard to the needs of other areas.  Accordingly, I regret that I cannot see my way to accede to the Deputy's request to increase the allocation to County Leitrim.</P>

      <P>My Department has received no complaints about the charging of excessive rents for newly-built houses.  In fact, the general impression is, I think, that during recent years there has been little, if any, building by private enterprise of houses for letting, the vast majority of newlybuilt houses having been disposed of by sale to intending occupiers.  In the circumstances, and apart from other considerations that would necessarily enter into the matter, I do not propose to introduce legislation to extend rent control to houses erected after, or in course of erection on, the 7th May, 1941.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the position is as suggested by the Deputy.  The maximum prices fixed for mutton in the Fresh Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, 1947, are related to the market prices realised for prime quality wethers and hoggets during the period immediately preceding the making of the Order.  The market price of sheep at this period was much in excess of the pre-war price and was considerably higher than the general level of prices during the past few years.  I am of opinion, in the circumstances, that the statutory control of <Col N="364" /> mutton prices does not operate to preclude sheep farmers from earning a reasonable rate of remuneration, and I am not prepared either to discontinue control or to authorise an increase in the retail price of mutton.</P>

The chief obstacle impeding housing is not staffing or acquisition of sites, but the inability of the building industry at present to undertake the full programme that is ready to be offered for contract. Approval has therefore been given to the establishment by the local authority of a direct labour organisation to supplement the housing output of the building industry, and the local authority has been requested to examine the possibility of further increasing output by the use of new methods of construction.  The Deputy may be assured that I shall keep under constant review the measures that will best enable the corporation to perfect an organisation capable of making the maximum contribution to the housing needs at the greatest possible speed. The results of my efforts will be made known to the Dáil from time to time, for example, when I am dealing with the Estimate for my Department.  A new formal inquiry into the position does not, therefore, appear to be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his statement in presenting this Vote on Account made it clear, however, that he accepted these Estimates as being forced upon him, and that he was having them revised with a view to effecting economies.  He further stated that his objective would be, amongst other things, to reduce the cost of living.  I think I am hardly misquoting him when I say that one of his weapons in achieving that end was to be economy in these Estimates and in the public services.  Those statements of the Minister open out practically the whole field of the present economic situation in this State.  In particular, his remarks suggest that the present position in regard to the cost of living in this country should be examined at this stage more closely, and also from the point of view of seeing whether what he proposes to do can reduce the cost of living without introducing a number of serious perturbations which might have quite undesirable results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I propose to analyse a little further the present position in regard to the cost of living with reference to the sums expended in this Estimate.  The situation in which we find ourselves developed roughly as follows: just before the war in August, 1938, the cost-of-living figure stood at 173.  From 1938 onwards the economic results of the war and the preparations for war made themselves felt in a shortage of materials, in inflationary pressures and similar phenomena which inevitably tended to put the cost of living up here as well as elsewhere.  In sympathy with these tendencies, the cost-of-living figure in this country rose from 173 in August, <Col N="374" /> 1938, to 294 in November, 1943.  Now, that was in no way a surprising result when one thinks back on the history of that period&mdash;the crisis of 1940, the difficulty of getting supplies, the peculiar problems with which this country was faced, both because of its neutrality and because of its closeness to the then centre of operations in Western Europe.  It is, therefore, all the more interesting to note that from November, 1943, to February, 1947, the cost of living in this country was stabilised at a practically static value. As compared with the figure of 294 in November, 1943, the figure stood at 295 in February, 1947.  In the intermediate period the fluctuations were such as to justify one in saying that the cost of living during that period was held steady.</P>
    <P>Now, that in itself was an achievement. That result was achieved by the methods adopted by the then Administration to control prices, to control wages and to adjust the economic fabric of this country to the then existing war-time conditions. That was the situation when the war concluded.  However, it is common knowledge that, as from February, 1947, the cost of living rose sharply and, in fact, the figure (corresponding to the figures I have given) for August, 1947, was 319.  In other words, during the first half of 1947, the cost of living rose sharply from 295 to 319 and a somewhat similar trend was to be noticed in food items alone.  During the static period from 1943 to 1947, the cost of food items rose somewhat, but only from 261 to 271.  By August, 1947, the increase in the cost of food items was represented by an increase in the indices from 271 to 300.</P>
    <P>There was the situation which led to the present situation and the causes of these changes were briefly as follows. Up to the beginning of 1947, it was possible to keep the controls effective and the influences of outside world prices for such things as wheat and tea which we imported were not sufficient to nullify the efforts which the then Minister for Supplies was making at control.  In addition, wages were stabilised by the standstill Order, but, as from the latter part of 1946, a <Col N="375" /> number of factors operated to bring about the situation I have already outlined and they can, roughly speaking, be grouped under three headings.  The three factors which sent up the cost of living in that period and which are responsible for the rise in the cost of living to-day are, firstly, the price of such commodities as wheat and tea which we had to buy outside this country, say, in America or India, rose sharply; secondly, the price of other foodstuffs particularly produced here at home rose for reasons which I shall give in a moment; and, thirdly, in September, 1946, the standstill Order was removed and it had its contributory effect in forcing up prices. Incidentally, the whole set of circumstances tended to confirm what the more orthodox of economists would have expected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first factor, the world prices which we had to pay for imported goods, imported necessaries, there was the price of wheat.  I may say, in parenthesis, that I find some difficulty in correlating some of the prices quoted, but I think I am not far wrong when I say that, in 1945, wheat was available at £21 per ton c.i.f. and it rose sharply during the spring of 1947 to the corresponding figure of £34 per ton, if I have read the returns in this regard correctly.  In any event, it is incontrovertible that, during that period, the price of wheat in America and elsewhere rose sharply because there was keen competition in the world market for that commodity. It was a natural price reaction to the demand for wheat in the world at large and I suspect also that there were such things as increased transport charges and production costs coming into the picture; but, be that as it may, this country was then faced, as to some extent it is now faced, with the problem of paying these very much enhanced prices for the wheat we must import or go without that wheat.  And going without that wheat means that the present bread and flour ration could not be maintained.</P>
    <P>In other words, with regard to the price which must be paid for the importation <Col N="376" /> of that essential commodity, no Government in this country can have any control.  All that the Government could do was, by artificial means here at home, to try to adjust the price to the consumer where it has no control over the price which the importer into this country, whether the State or private individual or State-sponsored company, must pay for that wheat.  It was inevitable, therefore, that the natural tendency of such a situation was to put up the price of the basic article of food in this country, wheat, flour and bread.  A somewhat similar situation existed in regard to tea.  The price of tea soared at about the same time and the natural tendency was to put up the cost of living.  The Government could have had no control over the primary cause for the increases under these heads.</P>
    <P>The second set of factors which influenced and caused the rise in the cost of living were concerned with production here at home, the situation being, so far as one can summarise, that our farmers found that their goods also could fetch higher prices abroad and in England particularly.  They had to face increased costs of production&mdash; fertilisers were more expensive and the removal of the standstill Order made their labour costs greater.  Factors of that sort put up the price of our farmers' produce, together with the natural tendency resulting from increased demand.  What could the Government do about that?  What could the previous Government or this Government do about such a situation as that?  No more than in the case of the foreign wheat could the Government directly keep down the prices of these commodities produced here at home.</P>
    <P>They could not keep them down by the simple direct expedient of saying: &ldquo;You cannot charge any more,&rdquo; and so keep the price down to the consumer in the cities and towns, because, in the first place, the export trade in cattle and such animal produce as we were exporting was vital to the economy of this country, and any step designed to prevent the farmer getting the benefit of the prices in England <Col N="377" /> would have been very seriously detrimental to the whole economic fabric of the State, and, if he were to be allowed to get the value of that market, be could not very well be forced to sell to people in our towns and cities at a loss&mdash;production would fall immediately&mdash;so that because of the importance of three things, our export trade, the increased cost of production which the farmer had to bear, and the need for encouraging the farmer to produce as much as he possibly could, both for home consumption and export, it was not practicable for any Government, and would not be practicable for this Government, to step in and to say to the farmer: &ldquo;You must sell at such and such a controlled price to the consumer in the city.&rdquo;  That direct line of approach was out of the question, and immediately you allowed the farmer to get the benefit of that economic situation, to get his prices, you had a price problem for the consumer, notably in the towns.  In other words, that situation, like the situation with regard to world prices, was forcing up the cost of living, and, by the very nature of the problem, the Government was restrained from adopting what some people might think would be the direct mode of attack.</P>
    <P>The other factor then contributing to this rise in prices and cost of living was the removal of the standstill Order.  I remember when I was sitting on the far side of the House a number of Deputies, before this Order was revoked, constantly crying for its removal and constantly they were given the answer that that Order was being maintained in the interest of the worker, because, if the Order were removed, wages would go up and increased wages would force production costs up, and, if production costs went up, prices to the consumer would go up, and that would mean an increase in the cost of living.  In fact, a race between prices and wages would start and the unfortunate fact, as such history as is available to us on the matter shows, is that, when that type of race starts, it is prices which win and the worker who is worse off.  For that reason, the standstill Order was held for some <Col N="378" /> time, but, unfortunately, because of the other two factors I have already mentioned, it was necessary to remove the standstill Order in September, 1946, but the very removal of that standstill Order also contributed to the inflationary trend, with the result that these three factors together put up the cost of living during the early portion of 1947 from 295 to 319.</P>
    <P>These are the plain facts of the situation and the question is: &ldquo;What possible remedy can you adopt in a situation such as that?&rdquo;  It seems to me that the remedies which can be adopted are, just as the causes, threefold. The remedies, taking them <i>vis-a-vis</i> the causes, would briefly be these.  Firstly, you may try to subsidise, but subsidy is a very limited weapon and is really only a matter of forcibly adjusting the money available, or diverting the money available into certain specific channels.  It cannot be a wholesale remedy for such social evils.  The second line of attack is price control, but that also is limited, as price control suffers from two defects.  It suffers from the difficulties of administration, which of themselves mean more cost; a very elaborate price control scheme means increased cost in administration and increased difficulty in administration; and also price control of itself tends to make black markets.  For these reasons, the remedy of price control&mdash;while, if it must be applied, it should be applied&mdash; is of limited application, just as the weapon of subsidies.  Lastly, there is the question of wage control.  It was thought at that time that it was better to get wage control for the future on a voluntary basis; and I think all sides of the House are agreed that if that can be achieved, if wages can be related to prices by the voluntary co-operation of the unions concerned and the workers, it will prove in the long run and in the short run to be the most satisfactory weapon for dealing with such a problem.</P>
    <P>In the long view, the only remedy for this situation&mdash;it is almost a physical law of nature&mdash;where we have a rising cost of living, is more production, a greater quantity of goods, particularly the necessaries of life, particularly <Col N="379" /> those items which directly affect the cost of living in its natural sense&mdash;and even in the artificial sense, of the various items that are taken for weighting and computing the index. Therefore, it seems to me that even at the present moment, no alternative is open to the present Government for dealing with it other than the devices which have been employed to date, devices which, when external circumstances permitted it, proved reasonably effective during the years 1943 to 1947, devices which since September last have shown that at least the cost of living can be stabilised where it is, if not reduced.  Those devices, in a nutshell, are a reasonable scheme of price control, as I have mentioned, coupled with a reasonable system of subsidies&mdash;but that remark must be subject to this qualification, that the aim should always be to try to get away from subsidisation if possible and that, in imposing subsidies, a long view should be taken and items likely to fall in price in the future should be selected for subsidisation rather than items likely to rise or to remain chronically dear.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is voluntary wage control, the correlation of wages with prices, which the last Administration was attempting to achieve by co-operation. I am virtually certain that the present Administration will tend to take the same course.  As things stand at the moment, I fail to see that, for an immediate or short-term remedy, any other course is open.  It seems to me that the present Administration will be charged, for the immediate future at any rate, with the task of maintaining price control and of providing subsidies, apart from the question of voluntary wage control; and that, in particular, the Minister for Finance will be faced with the problems of finding the money for the administration of a price control scheme and finding the money for subsidies.  If he continues on the basis of subsidisation&mdash;I am not dealing with how to raise the moneys for the subsidies but of the actual subsidisation of the items concerned&mdash;he can expect not only to get the cost of living down but he can expect to maintain <Col N="380" /> the stability in that situation which has existed up to the moment.  During the critical period early in 1947, 70 per cent. of the total rise in the cost of living was due to an increase in the cost of foodstuffs, mainly such things as butter, which was responsible for three points of a rise and which was a consequence of the guaranteed price for milk which was given to the farmers, this being another example of how a benefit in one direction has to be paid for in another.  The increased price of meat, due to the increased market prices, meant an increase of 7½ points.  Eggs, because of the export policy, had gone up three points.  The market situation put up potatoes by three points, sugar by one point and, owing to the world situation, tea by 7½ points, and these accounted for a total of 70 per cent. of the total rise in the cost of living in that period.  It was a very substantial one, being well over 20 points.  Clothing, however, was only a fraction.  In spite of all the talk that we heard about profiteering in the clothing business, the fact remains that clothing was responsible only for something less than 1 per cent. in the total rise in the cost of living.  Fuel, however, and other sundries of that nature accounted for 12 per cent.  There is the picture and in addition to that, because of the taxation which was necessary in order to give the social services which so many Deputies demanded, the tax on cigarettes and tobacco accounted for 10 per cent. in the cost-of-living rise.  Notwithstanding all these increases the methods adopted last autumn succeeded in bringing down the cost of living.</P>
    <P>When one approaches the problem in this way and analyses it, one sees that the present Administration is faced with a problem, and mark you, they are faced with a problem which they must deal with in a short-term way for there seems to be no other rational method of attack, no other method of attack which will not bring perturbations into the economic system, the disadvantages of which would outweigh the advantages which they seek to give and which they may in fact give.</P>
    <P>Where does this leave the present Administration?  It leaves us with <Col N="381" /> this.  The present Minister is faced with the problem of maintaining both the administration and the administrative machine for preserving the present &mdash;or at least a modified form&mdash;price control, and he is also faced with the difficulty of finding the moneys for the subsidies.  I think no matter what his or my or anybody else's general views on the matter may be, that he will be forced to maintain those subsidies, at any rate for a transitional period.  That is the immediate problem.  In the long-term view he is faced with the problem of providing, for the years during which he is responsible for the State Exchequer, the moneys for the long-term development of this State, the development which in the increased production of consumer and other goods will make living easier in this country.  In all that of course he will be forced to take into account those outside factors and influences over which he will have no direct control. What is the present position?  The last Administration faced up to the problem of finding the moneys for the subsidies. They faced up to the problem as to whether those moneys should be raised there and then, or as to whether they should be raised by some method of deficit financing.  These were, so to speak, the current living expenses and the then Minister for Finance took the view that the money would have to be raised at once, and of course that simply meant taxation, whether direct taxation or indirect taxation.  That was the genesis of what one must admit was the unpopular Budget of last autumn out of which so much capital was made by the then Opposition Parties up to the present time.  That was one method of finding money; it found the money and results were achieved in that way.</P>
    <P>My first word to the Minister for Finance in this Government is this: You are forced to find the moneys for these subsidies and for the maintenance of the administration of price control.  You are committed to abolish the taxes which were imposed in order to raise these moneys, and the question is where and how will these moneys be raised.  In asking this question I have in mind that the <Col N="382" /> Minister proposes to float a loan and, if I understood the reports which I have read aright, the Taoiseach has promised further loans.  But I am not jumping to conclusions and thinking that these loans would be applied to the purpose of supplying subsidies, because I think the Minister mentioned that certain capital expenditure would be met by these loans.  If the loans are for capital development my remarks in so far as they are critical do not apply, but if it is the Minister's intention to apply these loans for the purpose of current running expenses&mdash; because that is really what it is&mdash;then I think that we are in effect mortgaging our future.</P>

The problem is further complicated for the Minister by virtue of the fact that, as far as I can judge, his Administration will not commit themselves to reducing social services and will, at least, accept the existing social services.  Though the Minister may glibly talk about the debt of a previous Government I cannot see the Minister or some of his supporters cutting by one penny the social services which were granted in this State in recent years.</P>

      <P>When talking of the alleged extravagance of his predecessors, considerable reference was made to the tourist industry.  Suggestions were made that that tourist industry was extravagant and that excessive sums were being spent on it.  With direct reference to this Vote I see that the Irish Tourist Board itself is allocated £40,000 of which the Vote on Account is to be £12,000.  Inspection of the remainder of these figures, however, shows that that sum is not as large at all as many items such as the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce and other Votes.  In other words, the possible economies in connection with the Tourist Board itself are very, very limited and the possible beneficial results to the Minister from economies in that direction are extremely limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our balance of payments in general.  Our tourist industry is, I think, a very valuable source of dollars to this country.  It is bringing in a certain amount, anyway.  The situation in regard to dollars has been so critical up to date, and it seems to me to be critical enough at the moment, to warrant our maintaining any source of dollars on which we can lay our hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins will have ample opportunity of making his own speech, and, if he has already made it, he will have many opportunities of speaking in the future.  The net point I am making is that the tourist industry is a source of dollar revenue to us, and in so far as it is, it is extremely valuable.  During the first eight months or so of 1947 our total purchases outside the sterling area amounted to a very large sum, and of that our income in currencies other than sterling was something like five times as small&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Five times as small?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like a fifth&mdash;40,000,000 to 8,000,000.  That is a figure from memory.  However, my <Col N="386" /> point is that as a source of dollars, whether as a small or a large source, as a source under present conditions, the tourist industry was and is likely to be valuable to us for some time to come.  We may expect, in giving the Minister this Vote on Account, that when he comes to revising his Estimates or to his Budget the problems which exist there will make the same demand on him as they made on his predecessor.  It will be very interesting to see where he can make economies.</P>
      <P>I intend to deal very briefly with some of the incidents of the last few days.  There has been a commitment to reduce the air services in this country.  This point has been talked about at some length in this debate.  I merely want to add two further points to the objections to the course which the present Administration has adopted.  Briefly, my points are, first, that the problem of supplying technicians in this country has been an acute one to date.  One of the problems of developing these air services has been the supply of technicians. For the future development of the world, in which aircraft will play a large part, the supply of technicians will be of great importance.  It will, therefore, be of great importance to us for whatever air services we are maintaining.  If then the axe is to be applied to this project what is going to happen to the technicians who have now been trained or acquired and who are available&mdash;the technicians who, if they are let go, will be very difficult to replace?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our first problem, then, is that if the axe is applied to this project what is going to happen to the technicians&mdash;not only what is going to happen in regard to that personnel which is a consideration, but are those who came into the country to be forced out of it again and are our own trained technicians to be forced to seek employment elsewhere?  Is the State going to lose the benefit of the technical training of these men individually? Worse still, is the State going to lose the benefit of such technical skill as we have in the country in that line?  These are problems which require consideration. It is not enough to say that we should save money.  Alternative provisions to protect our technical development and to see that alternative employment is provided for the men so affected are as important an item for the Government as the saving of a certain amount of money.  That is item No. 1.</P>
      <P>Item No. 2 is that this is a question which is tied up with defence.  I do not intend to go into that question now further than to say that the development of our civilian aviation forces has an important bearing on our defence problem.  We find it hard enough to allocate moneys for defence in this country.  We find it extremely difficult to maintain an Army at all.  That portion of our national activities that is directly associated with defence should therefore be considered in a special way.  In this regard, the supply of technicians, ground crews, and pilots available in civil airlines is an important consideration in defence schemes or a possible defence expansion in times of emergency.  These are problems which will more properly arise on the Defence Estimate but they arise generally now.  Again, if the present Administration is going to apply the axe to the air services, what alternative provision will be made to secure the necessary development of that technically important operational arm in times of war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last, the third question is one <Col N="388" /> which affects our ex-servicemen.  After the war, a number of the boys, who answered the call in 1940 and served whole-time with the colours, were employed in our air services.  There was a serious problem at that time to reestablish them in civilian life.  Not only were some of them re-established in these services but some of the regular officers going on retirement&mdash;officers who had given very valuable service to the country since the foundation of the State&mdash;were transferred in a civilian capacity to these air services where they have given equally good service. These officers had associated with them both men of the regular forces and men of the emergency and reserve forces who, on demobilisation, were found suitable for employment in that project.  I understand, too, that some of the men who were trained as pilots were also absorbed.  There you have ex-servicemen, men who gave six years and many of them, indeed, who gave 20 years in whole-time service in the Army of this State.  These men deserved well of the community.  They certainly deserved better than to be told next morning that there was no further employment for them.</P>
    <P>If the Government decides on an economy of this nature, what provision is the Government going to make to ensure that these men are not victimised, thrown on the streets unemployed, or forced to emigrate?  It is a serious problem enough to force a technician away from his job, but to force a man who has a training, who has a tradition, on whose fate largely depends the morale of the Defence Forces of the country, because young people making a career of the Army will naturally look to the treatment their predecessors received in the end&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the three problems.  I am not for the moment even criticising the Government's decision in this matter, but I am asking &mdash;and I am entitled to ask&mdash;what is going to happen the technicians for the reasons I have given?  What is going to happen in regard to the value that these services would have, and have even at the moment, in regard to our defence problem?  What is going to happen the ex-servicemen, the officers or men who obtained employment in these projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me logically to another subject which was mentioned in this debate.  Again, I am not going into the rights or wrongs of trying to effect economy.  I am merely facing the problem that is presented by that decision, because this Minister, like any other Minister or any other Government, is going to be faced with a number of conflicting problems. That is in the nature of things.  I desire only to ascertain whether one thing has been balanced with another. The problem is this: a large number of men are going to be laid off as a result of the decision in regard to turf. In these schemes a large number of <Col N="390" /> ex-officers and men were absorbed.  I have not got the figures, but from various information at my disposal, I know that the Turf Board absorbed a number of ex-officers as supervisors. That included regulars, men who had served the full time with the Defence Forces, and a number of boys who sacrificed their careers to serve in the Army during the emergency.  What is going to happen these supervisors now?  What is going to happen the ordinary ex-servicemen employed on these schemes?  Will alternative employment be provided for them?  That is the least that should be done.  I take this opportunity to press on the Minister the claims on the community of these men in that regard.</P>
    <P>Almost inevitably, that point brings me to the question as to whether economies of this nature are in the long run going to benefit the country, in so far as economies of this nature are aimed at reducing opportunities for employment and reducing production, because on a balance sheet basis, the cost is too high.  If that is to be the policy, I fear that grave consequences in regard to unemployment will follow. Actually, the figures available have shown that unemployment decreased as opportunities for employment in this country increased.  For some years past a number of factories and industries were started and developed in this country.  These absorbed a considerable number, approximately 100,000, I think, just before the war.  To that extent, there had been an amelioration of the unemployment problem in this country. It seems to me that in the future more industries and more productive activity here at home involving a large number of people in employment are the only way in which to secure employment here and ultimately to reduce the cost of living for the country as a whole.  Since the war there has been a marked increase in certain directions over the 1938 level.  Production has certainly increased. Since the war closed there has been a steady increase in employment and last year there were about 4,000 more people in employment within the country than there were in 1939.  The substantial increases I have <Col N="391" /> already mentioned had been recorded up to 1939.  Obviously then there is a favourable trend in that particular direction at the moment.  Added to that the production trend had risen. There has been a 10 per cent. increase in production in certain specific industries mainly in relation to transportable goods.  In some instances there has undoubtedly been a decrease, such as in timber, soap, candles, grain milling industries and vehicle assembly.  That is understandable because of scarcity of imported raw materials for these particular industries.  It is an incontrovertible fact that at the moment in this country there is an upward trend in both production and employment.  That being so, it would be a definitely retrograde step to take any action now which might involve putting men out of employment in any particular sphere unless one is immediately able and ready to place men so displaced in suitable employment elsewhere.  That is not a problem which is simple of solution in the case of technicians because technicians are valuable in a particular way.</P>
    <P>These are the problems to which I wish the Minister to face up at the moment.  The Minister is faced with a problem of finding money for his subsidies and for his administration. What economies does he propose to effect?  If the economies contemplated are such as would involve the wiping out of schemes which give employment at the moment, such as the turf scheme, or the wiping out of valuable technical developments with potentialities for the future, I refrain from directly criticising the administration at the moment for doing that.  But I definitely ask the Minister to inform us as to what alternative provision is going to be made.</P>
    <P>Apparently the question of the loan and such other fiscal provision for the future must wait for another opportunity. An inspection of this Vote on Account clearly shows that the Minister is not in a position at the moment to make any major adjustments in the Estimates.  In asking for this sum on account it seems to me too that he cannot see his way at the <Col N="392" /> moment to any very marked economy on any one particular item and that he is hoping merely to effect small economies on as many items as possible.  If that is his idea I would warn him again of the dangers likely to ensue from such action as has already been taken.  I fear that it is an omen of still further retrogression in the future.  I hope, however, that that fear is without foundation.  If the Minister is anxious to persist with the development of this country we on this side of the House will appreciate to the full the problems that confront him together with the problem of finding the necessary money.  We shall be fair in our criticism at all times and we shall try to make our criticism constructively helpful.  I would ask the Minister to refrain at this stage from going back to the crippling financial policy which brought down the Government of which he was formerly a member and which brought the country into a certain state of depression in the years 1931 and 1932. None of us wishes to experience that again.</P>

      <P>There seems to me to be a certain artificiality about this debate.  We are in the position that the Minister will take no responsibility &mdash;or very little responsibility&mdash;for the Book of Estimates now presented to the House.  The Opposition are in the position of endeavouring to justify and defend those Estimates.  On this Book of Estimates, showing a figure of £70,000,000 which, with the Central Fund, would ultimately be increased to £76,000,000 with possible Supplementary Estimates later in the year, had Fianna Fáil remained in office the tax-payers of this small State would have been called upon to foot a bill of approximately £80,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Book of Estimates, prepared by the late Government and presented to this House now, is a very clear record of the rake's progress in squandermania. Big as the bill is as a whole, on looking through the items in this Vote on Account we find that, while the bill is a huge one, under the Estimate for Social Services the provision for old age pensions is £20,000 less than it was last year; Superannuation and <Col N="393" /> Retired Allowances are £53,000 less than last year; Widows' and Orphans' Pensions are £2,500 less than last year; National Health Insurance is down by £15,000; Gaeltacht Services are down by £4,000; Children's Allowances are down by £47,000; Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance are down by £2,000; and Army Pensions are down by £42,000.  All these reductions are in the Estimates prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government and they tell us here that they had plans for increased and improved social services, that these plans were ready to be introduced and, if they had not the misfortune to be defeated in the General Election, they would have put these plans into operation at an early date. This is a small country with a population of less than 3,000,000.  It is clear to me at any rate that we cannot afford this level of expenditure.  Why is the expenditure so high?  Deputy Lemass stated yesterday that 99.9 per cent. of these Estimates goes in salaries or wages.  There was some correction of that, but I am not going to worry about it now.  If one examines the Estimates, however, one will find that we are living on a scale that is unsuitable to this country; it is too high.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Justice a question yesterday with regard to one item, the use of State cars by Ministers of the previous Government and the cost to the public of that service. According to the reply of the Minister for Justice, each of these cars provided by this State for the Ministers of the former Government cost £1,369 a year to run.  That is a shocking figure, and that does not take into account the depreciation in these cars.  The capital cost of the 23 cars was £15,760.  It is taken into account in these Estimates that there was an average of £1,369 expended by the State in the provision of transport for each Minister of the last Government and each Parliamentary Secretary who was provided with a car.  That is a shocking state of affairs to contemplate.  The Minister for Justice gave me details of the mileage travelled and the petrol used during a period of 80 days from 1st December last year to the 18th February, the date on which Fianna <Col N="394" /> Fáil ceased to be the Government.  In that period those cars provided for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries travelled a distance of 127,773 miles, and they used in that short period 9,174½ gallons of petrol.  That is a shocking state of affairs&mdash;9,000 gallons of petrol used by 23 individuals in a period of 80 days&mdash;and they talk about economies.  My friend, Deputy Davin, says they did not use it successfully, but that is neither here nor there.</P>
    <P>How can we run this small country if we are going to have, as I described it, such a rake's progress; if people entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the finances of this State incur that enormous expenditure in addition to the salaries that they obtained from the State?  That is a matter that must be tackled by the present Government, and this House must tackle it when the opportunity occurs in the near future&mdash;the matter of gross waste such as that.</P>
    <P>We all know how the provision of these cars arose in the first instance. They were provided as a protection for Ministers.  They were cars in which military escorts would follow the Ministers. As I understand it, that was the position during the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. But, from the change of Government in 1932, the position completely changed and, from being cars provided by the State to convey escorts, they were gradually converted bit by bit into cars that were made available for the absolute use of Ministers.  We see in the Estimates for the Taoiseach's Department that the former Taoiseach was given an allowance of £350 a year to run a car.  That was perfectly reasonable and sensible.  It would be much better if there were some provision such as that made for Ministers and not have this absolute squandering or waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>We have lived on a very high scale and in the 16 years in which Fianna Fáil was the Government not only did they bring in on at least two occasions provisions for the increase of their own salaries but they made provision, and the House passed it, for substantial pensions for themselves when their <Col N="395" /> period of office as a Government ended.  I am sure that this country at all times will treat its public servants properly, whether they serve the civil or military side or serve in the Government.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with this Vote on Account and the waste of public funds.  I will do my best to keep within the rules of order as applicable to this debate.  Not only does this matter of waste apply in the instances I have mentioned, but it applies right through the whole country.  One section of the community, a small section, are in receipt of too much of this world's goods, and the biggest section are in receipt of too little.  That is one of the problems that we have <Col N="396" /> to face.  If this huge bill is to be out down, it can only be cut down by the elimination from it of unreasonable expenditure.  I submit that it is unreasonable to have these provisions that I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a reduction in expenditure, and that reduction can be brought about only by this House.  Several matters have been mentioned in the course of this debate, matters to which I would like to address myself for a while.  I am not to be taken as being in support of any scheme, whether it comes from the Minister or not, that will reduce employment and cause people to be unemployed.  I am not in favour of that, nor am I in favour of some of the comments I heard in this House with regard to our Defence Forces&mdash; our Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree substantially with Deputy Lemass when he said that the principle governing an Army must be its use to the State.  If we decide that we must have a Defence Force and that that force to be effective must consist of so many officers and so many men, then we must as a Parliament provide the finances necessary.  I cannot imagine that the Minister for Finance proposes to reduce the present inadequate strength of the Defence Forces; I cannot imagine that he proposes to make the Defence Forces useless, and, <Col N="397" /> having done so, to expend £2,500,000 on them.  That would be sheer waste.</P>
    <P>Following the line of argument that has been used here, it is necessary that this House should have some confidence in the Defence Forces.  I think it has that confidence.  The House has confidence in the General Staff of the Army to recommend the proper force that is necessary for the security of this State.  I was rather worried to-day when I read of a new appointment by the Government&mdash;the appointment of an A.D.C. to the Taoiseach. I read about it in the public Press to-day.  I do not know the person concerned, but, on referring to <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, I found he had been appointed to a temporary commissioned rank in the Defence Forces as from 27th February.  He was appointed to the rank of commandant, and I presume that appointment was made in that rank because the person concerned was too old to be appointed to a lower rank.</P>
    <P>I will be critical of the Government when it is necessary to be critical.  If we are to have confidence in the Defence Forces that we spend so much money on and talk so much about, we should have enough confidence in it to take out an officer and appoint him to such a post as A.D.C. to the Taoiseach. I know that in doing what has been done we have been following a precedent created by the previous Government. I hoped that we had gone beyond that.  Army service is honourable service and promotion in the Army should be the result of honourable service. I hope there will be no necessity for me in the future to criticise any such appointment as I read about in to-day's papers.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Civil Service, if we look at public appointments and if we look at the Government, we will find that the whole organisation appears to be quite wrong.  No person seems to be anxious to do any hard work himself and so he must have an assistant or a secretary and a secretary to that secretary.  The result of that is that we are completely and absolutely overloaded with a service that, as a country, we cannot afford.  We pay those <Col N="398" /> people&mdash;certain sections of them anyway&mdash;salaries larger and higher than this country can afford.  If economies are to be achieved there must be a complete examination of this whole problem of the public service.  Just as we expect the agricultural worker and the farmer to do a hard day's work, so there must be the same obligation on our public men of all kinds.</P>
    <P>Work seems to me to be one of the essential preliminaries for the salvation of this country, but there is not the encouragement to work that there should be, nor is there the provision for work.  If we go down to Talbot Street even to-day we will find there probably 50, 100, 150 or 200 of the finest of our young boys being labelled there for export to Great Britain.  That has been going on for years, bleeding this country white.  This new Government must face that problem.  If it does not face it and deal with it, then I can see no future or no hope for this nation.  If work is to be carried out, particularly in our rural areas, the people who do it must be paid.  Our primary producers who have been mentioned here&mdash;our farmers&mdash;must be paid for their work. The great difficulty there seems to be &mdash;to some people anyway it seems to be impossible of solution&mdash;to be able to give our agricultural and rural workers enough wages, at the same time guaranteeing to the farmers a decent livelihood and keeping the cost of living within bounds.  That seems to be the problem and people do not seem to be able to see a solution for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy had it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will just permit me I shall enlighten him. As I say, some people do not seem to be able to see a solution to that problem.  I suggest that the solution is a simple one, and that if these problems are to be dealt with that solution must be put into operation. We must start on this basis that the worker is entitled as of right to a living wage.  If the worker on a farm is guaranteed a living wage, the farmer must be put in a position to be able to pay it to him.  That will involve and necessitate increased prices for the farmers.  It will also involve and <Col N="399" /> necessitate increased production.  That can be brought about if machinery is made available to the farmers of the country in the quantities required.  If we are able to bring to the aid of our farmers some type of co-operative organisation, if the State can make available to them all the machinery that they need, there will be an increase in production.  By guaranteeing an economic price for his produce to the farmer he will be enabled to pay a living wage to his workers and at the same time make a decent livelihood for himself.</P>
      <P>There are many ancillary problems which arise out of that.  There is the problem of finance.  If there is one thing that I am very pleased to see in this new Government it is that Deputy McGilligan is the Minister for Finance. It will be necessary to have a complete change in our financial outlook here and to give to our own Central Bank the power and authority to create whatever credit we need for full employment and full production.  I am quite certain that in this House Deputy MacEntee would not suggest that that would be raiding the savings of the farmers.  But that is the answer he would probably give in another place to it.  These problems which face us must be dealt with.  They must be approached first and foremost in a competent and sensible way, and, secondly, they must be dealt with in a comprehensive way.  I am quite certain that, if the new Government approach these problems with the determination to solve them, they will solve them, but side by side with the application of the solution there must be, as I said at the beginning, a pruning, a cutting down of this unnecessary and this gross expenditure.  As a nation we should all endeavour to try to make conditions bearable for the great majority rather than, as we have been doing, making them luxurious for a small minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, air development has been mentioned.  I must say that I have considerable sympathy with the arguments advanced by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Vivion de Valera.  I cannot imagine that it is the intention of the Government or of the Minister to wipe <Col N="400" /> out this whole air service.  I am quite certain that is not the intention.  I cannot believe it would be the intention. What the Government has done, as I understand it, is to halt expenditure until such time as they have an opportunity of investigating and examining into the problem, and no one can object to the Government acting in that way, because they have the responsibility of ensuring that any concern run by or with public funds is being run in the best and most economical way.  I am quite sure that when the Government and the Minister have had an opportunity of fully examining this matter of air development, they will be able to put, on one side, the national advantages, and, on the other, the financial expenditure and that it is more than likely that that air service will be continued and developed on sensible lines.  Where you had a Government like the Fianna Fáil Government, which was only concerned with one thing, lavish, gross and unnecessary expenditure, there is no doubt that the position had got completely, absolutely and entirely out of hand, and, when a new Government comes into power, it is reasonable to expect they will examine at the earliest possible date every aspect of every scheme that such a lavish Government initiated or put into operation.</P>
    <P>The biggest single item in this Book of Estimates seems to be the amount, approximately £12,000,000, which is provided for food subsidies.  That represents a huge problem, a problem which will have to be faced and faced very soon.  Is there any substantial reduction in the cost of living&mdash;and in this respect I am asking a question rather than criticising&mdash;where you reduce certain items in cost, and, at the same time, raise by taxation the moneys to make good those reductions? I have not examined this problem.  I intend to do so.  I intend to examine it in so far as I can bring it down to the individual, to what the individual saves by the reduction in the cost of living due to the subsidy and what the individual has to pay in taxation to provide the subsidy which enables the reduction to be brought about.  I do not know if any figures are available on that point, but I <Col N="401" /> certainly would like to examine it right down to the very end.  It may be that, when it is worked out, we will find that a substantial portion of this sum of £12,000,000, or a substantial portion of the money raised by taxation for subsidies, goes in administrative expenses in collecting the tax and paying the subsidy.</P>
    <P>There are many other factors which I think must be considered by the Government.  There is waste, undoubted waste, here in the City of Dublin. There is waste in respect of two items which I will mention, bread and milk. In any street in this city every morning, one will see vehicles, either motor lorries or horse-drawn vehicles, the property of different milk concerns, one of them driving up to one house, another to another house and a third to a third house&mdash;five or six delivering milk in the one street.</P>

That brings me to my concluding remark, that it is going to be very difficult to solve these problems within this system of capitalism, as we understand it.  This system is, in my view, unsuited to this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no intention of taking up the time of the House any longer on this matter.  This Government must get some little time to examine these problems and they should have the complete and absolute co-operation and assistance of every person in this House.  The problems to be faced are enormous.  After 16 years of high expenditure, 16 years in which the Government were not concerned, as they should have been, with the interests of the ordinary person, 16 years during which the very best of our young people were forced out of the country, this new Government, endeavouring to create new employment and put an end to the drain of emigration, endeavouring <Col N="403" /> to improve conditions for the ordinary person, must get a chance in this House.  That does not mean that this Government can sit down for a long period with the idea that they are not to be criticised from one side or the other.  As far as I am concerned, I intend to be critical of the Government, whilst supporting them generally. If their solution of these financial problems involves the unemployment of big numbers of people, throwing them out on the dole without any alternative occupation, then I must say very clearly that I could not give the Government support in any such policy.</P>

      <P>I am aware that 80,136 workers were compelled to sign on at our labour exchanges last week.  That problem should be faced.  Hearing Deputies from some of the counties I have some knowledge of, one would imagine that those whom they represent here were living in some frugal comfort.  I admit that some of our people in Cork and Kerry are living at a standard not worthy of a Christian country, yet we have the time here wasted in discussing the possible unemployment of men who are not yet out of employment.  The comfort in which we sit here and the carpets and luxury of this House are mainly due to the men and women who work in the field and factory and it is about time we came down to earth and dealt with those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> Deputy Sheehan yesterday told us that if the Labour leaders only advised workers not to go on strike we would be a very happy country.  For the last 30 or 32 years I have been getting advice from employers and criticism and advice from those I represent as being too conservative, and I am afraid that what is wrong is that we are not prepared to face the change that it is necessary to make in this country.  Let me say, in passing, to the Minister for Finance, regarding the new loan about to be floated&mdash;as I said before and now repeat&mdash;that we cannot borrow ourselves into prosperity.  We are already taxing our people over £4,000,000 a year to service our national debt and very nearly the same amount for our municipal debts.  Now we are going to tax them for further borrowing.  I submit that our credit is based on our resources and the capacity of our people to produce goods and services. The people who should be in control of that credit are the Government of this country, and the sooner we face that problem the better for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Kissane yesterday talking about increasing the price of milk.  I am by no means opposed to that.  The hardest worked people are the farmers and farm labourers and their wives and daughters.  The farmer should be paid a proper price for producing milk.  There is very little use in having £1 in your pocket if you cannot buy sufficient milk and butter for the week.  During the past week one of my constituents met me going to the station and said: &ldquo;I am off.&rdquo; I asked where, and he replied: &ldquo;I am going to Somerset.&rdquo;  He was a man very advanced in years and told me he was going over as an agricultural labourer.  I asked him his age and he said: &ldquo;I was 57 last June.&rdquo;  He was going across to England to give his labour to produce the food off the land at £4 10s. 0d. for a 48-hour week.  Is it possible that in this country we could not pay the people on the land at least £4 or £4 10s. 0d. to produce the things we want?  What are we afraid of?  Are we afraid because someone said a while ago: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from&rdquo;?  Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke for about an <Col N="405" /> hour, and I was looking forward every minute to see if he would offer some solution, to relieve the Minister for Finance, as to how to get the amount of money required.  He sat down leaving us as dull about it after his hour's speech as we were before he started. The sooner we face the problems of our people, the sooner there will be some recognition for the work of this House. Deputy Sheehan, who is Lord Mayor of Cork, said that he would solve the problem.  I happened to be in Deputy Sheehan's place a few years ago and we wanted to get a loan of £250,000 at 4 per cent., but we were boycotted.  Not a bank in Cork, not a bank in all Ireland would give us a shilling for that loan.  To-day we are told that there is £373,000,000 in our banks.  In one bank alone there is £23,000,000 more on deposit this year than last year.  I submit that money is not the real criterion of wealth and prosperity while people are living in hovels, while people are without sufficient butter and milk and while people are compelled to live in houses in Cork City and elsewhere which are unworthy of a Christian country or of a Christian Government which has been legislating for the country for the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>I submit that the first thing to tackle is to try to feed our people.  Let us not be afraid to spend money on our land.  We took over £3,000,000 or £3,500,000 recently from those who were making excess profits from the emergency in the country, and if that £3,500,000 were given to the men on the land to pay wages and to produce food for the nation, that would be something like government.  I was really surprised by some of the speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies and by their attitude.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say this.  I suggest that you should show that you are in earnest about social justice and social changes.  Experience of life has convinced me that truth, honesty and goodwill ultimately prevail, and we must always remember and believe that the commonsense of the average man and woman will always assert itself. If men or principles or institutions fail to serve the human need they must be <Col N="406" /> replaced by men, principles and institutions which do serve that need.</P>
    <P>While I realise that the problem before us is a serious and a very grave one, if we are true and faithful to our ideals and have faith in our ability to serve the nation, then I am satisfied that we can face the future with confidence.</P>

      <P>I do not think that that could be done.  Anyway, it will have to be admitted that we got through the ordeals of the last six years with very considerable success. It is true that there was unemployment, and because of the dislocation and shortage of materials produced by the war it was inevitable that there would be, but we got through reasonably well.  According to Mr. Dillon, who is in charge of the larder now, Deputy Lemass and Deputy Smith had provided us with food for the next three years at least and I think that it will be admitted that that is very important. The Minister for Finance told us yesterday that our credit was good and it being good, he proposes to make some use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the construction of this House at present, I feel that it is my duty and the duty of many Fianna Fáil Deputies, almost all of whom represent rural areas, to see that the agricultural industry gets something refunded to it from this country.  For the past six years the farmer and his worker have stood in the gap; when famine threatened they did their utmost to stave it off and they succeeded.  I do not think <Col N="407" /> that the solutions proposed by Deputy Hickey and Deputy Cowan are going to be put into practice and I believe that the Minister for Finance will use the only method that can be used, and that is increased production.  We cannot have that unless we pay back the debt to the farmers that is due by the country.  We have taken the thing which is most important to them and that is fertility For six long years that has been extracted for the benefit of the city and town populations.  Therefore, I think that whatever money can be made available should be used by the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture to try to restore that fertility.  But not at £11 10s. 0d. per ton for superphosphates. The British farmer and the Northern Ireland farmer have fertilisers at £4 10s. 0d.  I think that the House will agree with me that that is a handicap that our farmers cannot stand and consequently Deputy Byrne's plea last night was altogether a plea to the gallery. He knows as well as I do what the position is.  What difference does it make to the farmer what wages he pays, if the communities in the cities and towns refund it?  They cannot do that and the only remedy therefore is to increase production and I am sure that the Minister for Finance will try to earmark as much money as possible in order to restore fertility.  If that is done the farmer will supply all the stock that it is possible to supply to Great Britain, and in case any accident happens to the wheat which the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have guaranteed to us and it does not reach our shores, the farmer will still be able to stand in the breach.</P>
    <P>It is true that the agricultural worker had a bad time, and it is true that the farmers had a bad time and have a bad time.  It is quite true that outside the Fianna Fáil Party no Party here represents the rural areas or the farmers. I suppose that instead of calling this a Coalition Government I should call it a Fine Gael Government, but remember that there are nine constituencies in which they are not represented at all.  As regards Clann <Col N="408" /> na Poblachta, they are purely a city Party, having merely three seats from rural areas, and, therefore, because the position is so unbalanced, I believe that the Fianna Fáil Party should emphasise the necessity of giving support to the agricultural industry because without it every other industry collapses.  If that industry is not functioning well the Minister for Finance will find that he has considerable difficulties, those difficulties which we had to face up to during the long period of the late war.  It was an enormous task to have to face up to and farmers had to be asked to do things that if you had to ask modern manufacturers who are highly protected to do, they would not dream of doing.  If they had not the most modern machinery and factories they would not produce anything as they are so accustomed to protection.  Farmers in this country were not accustomed to produce what we had to ask them to produce and they did so at enormous expense to themselves.  Therefore I would urge the Minister for Finance to do all he can to help the Minister for Agriculture.  I mentioned this fact to the Minister for Agriculture at a conference the other day and he very politely told me to refer to the Minister for Finance, which is what I am doing now.  I believe that if that is done most of our financial difficulties, and many of our social difficulties, will be solved.  I hope that the world confusion has somewhat abated although I am doubtful about it.  If it has not we shall have to go back again to the farmers and to ask them to feed and support us for dear knows how many years.  I see no definite indication that we are on the eve of peace.</P>
    <P>On the contrary there seems to be very great confusion across the water. I see industrial confusion and the cutting of wages and salaries to the bone. That will have its reactions in this country.  I must say that, looking forward and being able more or less to guess the condition of the world in the next three or four years, all I can do is to offer my sincere sympathy to the Minister for Finance.  Not alone that, but, as far as we are concerned, I am sure we will give every possible assistance to him.  Certainly, as far as the <Col N="409" /> agricultural community&mdash;the worker and the farmer&mdash;is concerned, I believe we will do all we can for him.</P>
    <P>I well remember, at the conclusion of the last war, on many occasions I heard such men as Deputy Dunne speaking to agricultural workers.  As the older Deputies will remember, the storm came about 1921.  There was a complete collapse and the unfortunate agricultural worker had not a bob to give, and the moment he had no bob to give there was no more organisation. He was left derelict until in 1933 or 1934 Fianna Fáil came to his relief.  I did not notice any union or labour organisation bothering about him.  He had no money&mdash;about 7/- a week when he could get it.  Most of the older members of this House remember that well and we do not want to see it happening again.  My view is that the farmer is quite honest.  Let us give him a fair chance and he will give a fair chance to his workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one part of Deputy Cowan's speech with which I was in absolute and complete agreement. That was his statement that these Estimates brought about a certain air of unreality.  It is difficult to discuss matters for which the present Government are not completely responsible&mdash;they are, in fact, responsible for them only to a very small degree.  However, I, in common with others, hope that when the main Estimates for the year come along some, at any rate, of the policies of the present Government will have had time to mature and we will then be in perhaps what I might call a more real financial atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as these Estimates represent the estimated expenditure for the coming year they are very, very high. This country already has a very crushing burden of taxation and the increases are a very big proportion of the total expenditure.  However, as I have said, the present Government is not responsible for that.  Some of the Deputies on the other side of the House seem to be afraid that, in the drive and the anxiety to reduce expenditure, the question of employment <Col N="410" /> may be forgotten.  I think I can assure those Deputies that nothing will be more present to the Government's mind than the question of employment. It is a poor saving to take men out of gainful employment by virtue of a financial Act and to put them on outdoor or unemployment relief.  That is a question which will be very much in the mind of the present Government and the Opposition may rest assured that that will not be done unless it is in the widest interests of the community that any unemployment whatsoever should be caused.  I think I can say that the Government will not, by virtue of financial savings, cause unemployment. They certainly do not want to do so.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of discussion on the proposed savings in connection with the airlines.  Nobody knows just what is proposed because the Government very wisely have halted further expenditure until they have had time to look into the matter and to see where it all leads.  I take it that this relates only to the transatlantic service.  From inquiries I have made I understand that the present transatlantic aircraft which we have purchased will very shortly be superseded by a newer, faster and what is at any rate considered a more efficient type of transatlantic plane. That shows the wisdom of the Government in calling a halt until they can completely examine the proposed scheme.  I do not think that we in this small country have the money to embark on expensive transatlantic airliners which are in a very short space of time liable to become redundant. Furthermore, I do not think that Irishowned transatlantic airlines are necessary for the development of our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>The tourists who come to this country and who will spend dollars in this country will come in American airliners or in airliners of any other nationality which are run efficiently and safely and, at the same time, cheaply from the point of view of the fare.  I think those are the main considerations before tourists and I do not see why we, in this country, should think that the whole American nation is going to <Col N="411" /> patronise exclusively Irish transatlantic airlines.  I do not think for a moment that they are, and the only way in which this whole scheme can be judged is on its merits as a revenue-producing matter.  We have heard talk about prestige in this connection.  Our national prestige rests on more important and more solid matters than on questions of transatlantic airlines.  In the past, we have never been able to afford atlantic liners.  We have not any <i>Queen Marys</i> in this country and yet, before the airlines came along, we did a good American tourist trade&mdash;tourists carried in the ships of other nations. Exactly the same thing can happen in connection with transatlantic air services. I want to emphasise that I am talking now about transatlantic air services and not about other air lines which are operating over short distances. The lines which operate between Dublin and London, Belfast, Liverpool or say, Paris, Brussels and various other European centres to which our liners go at present, are quite capable of being a paying proposition and I think they are quite sufficient to keep the trained personnel in employment.  Deputy de Valera referred to the necessity of keeping our technicians working.  I think that the several airlines operating over short distances will keep all the technicians that this country can afford to keep, looking after every individual branch of our airlines.  In connection with the question of having technicians in this country there is one factor to which I would like to refer.  I do not know whether some Deputies realise that there is a very early retiring age for pilots.  It is one of the great tragedies of air-service that when a man reaches the early forties he must retire.  He then cannot pass the very stringent tests which are necessary for civil air pilots.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely mentioning that the early retiring age would mean that any country that was overloaded, as regards airlines, would inevitably have a large number of men retiring at what we would regard as an <Col N="412" /> early age and looking for employment in the ordinary commercial world.  A country of the size of Ireland would undoubtedly find it difficult to absorb persons of that age in suitable employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera also mentioned the question of fuel.  There is undoubtedly a big problem confronting the country and the Government in connection with the employment which was given in the past in cutting and hauling turf.  Nobody on this side of the House, just as nobody on the Opposition side, wishes to see any hardship caused to individuals but there is the unfortunate fact that turf is a fuel which is not capable of very much handling at an economic price.  It is a nice question as to how far the taxpayers' money can be expended in subsidising a commodity for the cities when a cheaper one can be found.  I have no doubt that the Government will go into this question very sympathetically and will take into account the question of employment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make a long speech as a number of Deputies have spoken at great length in this debate, but I would say that the Government will certainly keep in the forefront the question of employment and try to ensure that no cuts in expenditure will be undertaken which would have serious repercussions on the very important question of employment because what we are suffering from in this country is under-employment and under-production of all sorts.  I believe that our new Government is going to face this problem in a serious way, in a way in which these problems have not been faced in the past.  Out of their deliberations I believe, and hope, will come more employment for all our citizens and thereby greater prosperity for the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many speakers in this debate have talked about higher production, particularly higher production in agriculture.  In deference to Deputy Cowan, I am assuming that we are going to carry on with private enterprise.  If we do, I think that the principal inducement to agriculturists would be price&mdash;that is, that prices <Col N="413" /> should be high enough, not only to pay all the expenses of agriculturists but to leave them something by way of profit. That profit can be secured either by giving them better prices or by lowering their costs.  I take it that as far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned, he does not intend to give any further inducement, at least in the present circumstances, in the way of price because he has answered questions yesterday and to-day with regard to the price of wheat, beet and milk.  The price of milk, for instance, was fixed about 12 months ago.  Since then there has been an increase, at least once, in wages and there has been, as many Deputies have pointed out, a very steep increase in rates so that the farmers' expenses have increased while the price of milk has remained static.  The same applies to some extent to wheat, beet and barley, the prices of which were fixed last autumn.  Since that time, wages have gone up and rates will also be higher for the coming year than last year.</P>
      <P>We must, therefore, I take it, turn our minds more to the other side and see if anything can be done in the way of reducing costs to the farmer.  The biggest cost to the farmer&mdash;I am talking of big farmers and in a way the same thing applies to small farmers&mdash; is wages.  The bigger farmer employs men and wages represent his big cost. In the case of the small farmer who does his own work, his own time is his big cost, so really it amounts to the same thing&mdash;the payment of a man for his own time.  That is a thing that no Deputy will suggest should be reduced so we have to go further.  In fact, I think that Deputies from all sides of the House have expressed the desire to see agricultural wages higher. Undoubtedly when his wages and earnings are compared with the wages and incomes of other classes of the community, the agricultural worker does not stand in a very favourable position so that we should, if at all possible, make every effort to see that his wages are increased, as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After wages, which are by far the heaviest item on a farm, you have rent and rates.  In practically all farms now rents are fixed under the Land Commission; <Col N="414" /> but rates are steadily increasing and, judging from an answer given by the Minister for Local Government here yesterday, the Government does not at the moment look with favour on &ldquo;shifting the burden&rdquo;, as he put it, from the ratepayer to the taxpayer. We are faced, then, with the fact that rates are going up and that the farmer must meet them.</P>
    <P>The farmer, like every other producer, has to purchase a large quantity of his raw materials.  Probably the biggest item under that heading is fertilisers or artificial manures.  The amount of artificial manures available during the last six or seven years was comparatively small.  It has increased during the last year and this year it will increase considerably.  The possibility is that this year the farmer will be able to purchase all the artificial manures he likes, taking into account price and everything else.  In my opinion, there will be no necessity for any system of rationing; during the last six or seven years a system of unofficial rationing was in operation because of scarcity of supply.  There is, of course, a subsidy on artificial manures.  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned that the price of phosphates is very high compared with the price in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where it is purchased by farmers who are for the most part in competition with the farmers here.  He gave us some figures. Here we pay about £10 10s. 0d. or £11 per ton, according to the distance over which the manure travels.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland the price is £4 10s. per ton.  That, naturally, makes a substantial difference on even the average-sized holding.  A farmer who holds 50 or 60 acres would probably purchase up to three tons of phosphates in the year.  That would be by no means an excessive quantity. To a certain extent he might be said to be cheeseparing in keeping his order down to three tons.  The difference there is about £18.  That is a substantial difference.  The only remedy would be if the Department of Finance could see its way to increasing the subsidy. Any increase would have an advantageous effect from the point of view of the farmer and from the point of view of agriculture as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> The second raw material that the farmer has to purchase is seeds.  Some difficulty may exist about a reduction in the price of seed because in most cases the transaction is merely one between farmer and farmer.  The bulk of the seeds used in this country are produced within the country.  We are importing more seed this year than we have for the last six or seven years, but we are still not importing as much as we did pre-war.  Even going back to pre-war the figure would be a small percentage of the total amount used in the country.  Many farmers have their own seed potatoes.  A large number of them have their own seed oats.  A certain number have their own seed barley, seed wheat, and grass seed.  Where seeds are purchased the bulk of such purchases come from other farmers within the country and it is rather difficult to see how the price could be reduced because the farmerproducer will naturally not accept less than he is getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>Feeding was a bigger item pre-war than it is now because it is not possible at the moment to import any great quantity of feeding stuffs.  A certain amount of wheat offals is available at the moment.  A certain amount of maize is coming in which is ground and sold to the farmers.  The price of wheat offals is quite a reasonable one and I do not think the farmer has any cause for complaint in that regard.  His main difficulty is that he cannot get enough. It is selling at about £12 per ton and that is a reasonable figure at the present time.  Maize, which is in short supply, is very much higher and runs to about 27/- a hundredweight.  Maize is not quoted by the ton because no farmer is lucky enough to get a ton of it.  It is extremely dear and it is questionable whether a farmer could make feeding pay at that price.</P>
    <P>What happens is that the farmer has a certain amount of feeding stuff of his own&mdash;his own oats and a certain amount of inferior barley&mdash;and he purchases a small amount of maize to mix with his own grain in order to have a palatable mixture for his animals.  In that way he can afford to pay a high <Col N="416" /> price for a small percentage of his feeding stuffs.  I have no good suggestion to offer in regard to maize feeding. Naturally, it would be a good thing if the farmer could get it at a lower price. From an administrative point of view it would be difficult to subsidise it.  We all hope that the position will improve in the future with regard to the quantity of maize available and, when such improvement comes about, the Government can then consider the question as to whether it can be sold in larger quantities to the farmer at a more reasonable price.</P>
    <P>These are the principal recurring costs that the farmer is called upon to meet every year.  Another fairly big item would be capital costs used in the maintenance of housing for animals and the purchase and maintenance of machinery plus the upkeep of horses and small repairs to harness, etc. These capital costs are high for a farmer who tries to keep his place in the best order.  Many farmers do not involve themselves in any capital costs because they are too high an incidence in their farming economy.  The Fianna Fáil Government introduced a scheme to help the farmers to repair their farm buildings.  I take it that the present Government will continue that scheme for the construction, maintenance and repair of out-offices and so on.  Such a scheme has a two-fold effect.  It enables the farmer to keep his animals in better condition during the winter and, if a farmer has good housing accommodation, the ordinary work of the farm can be done more economically and in a shorter period of time.  It may also have the result of encouraging the young people towards a better contentment with farming life as a whole.</P>
    <P>Where farms are badly kept and where housing is unsuitable it is hard to expect the young people to face the life of hardship involved, in the same way as their fathers and mothers did before them, when they know that conditions are infinitely better in the towns and cities.  If we can make these farms more attractive we will have done something at least in the way of encouraging the young people to remain on the land.  Therefore, I assume the Government will continue <Col N="417" /> the farm buildings scheme.  I would appeal to the Government even to improve on that scheme, if they can afford it.  The farm improvements scheme was on similar lines, but that dealt more with the improvement of the land itself, that is to drain and reclaim the land, to improve the fences and to make the work out in the fields more economic for the farmer and more attractive for himself and his sons and employees.  These combined will do something to help the progressive farmer to reduce his costs.</P>
    <P>There is one other item which was considered when I was in the Department of Agriculture, and which I know was considered by my successor.  The present Minister for Agriculture has often mentioned the matter and therefore I take it for granted he will pursue the inquiries to see what can be done, and that is, to bring equipment within the reach of the farmer.  The big farmer is all right as he can afford economically to keep machinery like tractors, reapers and binders and even, if you like, a combined reaper and thresher.  There are facilities for the purchase of these.  They can get a loan to purchase them&mdash;not a grant.  If the big farmer is a good farmer, it is an economic proposition for him to purchase this machinery.  Therefore, we can dismiss him by saying that the facilities are there and it is up to him to get the necessary machines and to see that they are used as they should be and that he brings his system of farming up to what modern conditions demand.</P>
    <P>When we come to the medium farm, however, farms between 40 and 60 acres, or even between 30 and 70 acres, unless the farm is an extremely good one which can all be tilled in rotation and in that way enable the farmer to keep 35 or 40 acres in tillage practically all the time, I do not think you can make the case that it would be economic for that farmer to buy these big machines himself.  The thing I had in mind and which I know my successor had in mind and which the present Minister had often advocated from this side of the House was that we should try to facilitate co-operative societies or even private individuals to get the <Col N="418" /> machines which could be put at such a man's disposal.  If it is a co-operative society, of course the members would own the machines and would have the use of the reaper and binder or the tractor and plough or even the thresher, as the case may be.  But co-operation is not possible everywhere. Co-operation has been a success undoubtedly, particularly in the south, in the counties Limerick, Tipperary and Cork, and to some extent in Kerry. But then, in the areas where we have smaller farms, like the West of Ireland and the Ulster counties which are in this State, co-operation has never been a great success and, therefore, I am not sure if a scheme like this can ever be carried out on a co-operative basis.  What I should like the Minister for Agriculture to consider is whether some means could be found for the provision of machines for those small farmers in those areas where co-operation is not possible.</P>
    <P>You may have to go very much lower down the scale in connection with some of these smaller farms than what might be regarded as mechanisation, such as power tractors, reapers and binders, etc.  You may have to provide for their use such machines as horse-drawn corn drills, horse-drawn mowing machines and other machines of that kind because on these small farms it is not possible to expect the farmer to have more than a plough and a harrow of his own and he would need to have the use of these other machines if they could be provided.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking principally of increasing the production of crops in advocating that we should try to help farmers in reducing their costs by providing them with more machinery.  I had in mind, if you like, the tillage farmer.  I do not want to go through other types of farming in detail, but I think some consideration might be given, and I presume will be given, to the production of grass.  Now that artificial manures are again available in bigger quantities, I presume it will be possible to increase the yield of grass and, indeed, not only to increase the yield, but to increase the quality, because the quality of the grass is very important in feeding animals.  The <Col N="419" /> object in feeding animals in most cases is to produce meat, but in other cases, as in the case of the cow, to produce milk.  Quality is very important as well as yield and quantity.</P>
    <P>Yesterday there was also some discussion with regard to a social welfare scheme.  Deputy Lemass stated that the scheme was ready.  I should like to say that it is ready in this sense: that the Department has done the greater part of the actuarial work and is in a position to say to the Minister what the cost would be per week or per year of, let us say, giving 26/- per week to every person over 65 years of age.  I am taking that figure because it is the figure that was provided for in what is known as the Beveridge Plan in the United Kingdom and the North of Ireland.  The Department can go further.  They can tell the Minister, if he wants this on a contributory basis or part of it on a contributory basis, what a weekly contribution will bring in, let us say, for every penny from those employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, therefore, in this position, that he can make up his mind, if he wants to, fairly rapidly.  I do not say that we expect him to make up his mind rapidly, because these things require some consideration.  But he can make up his mind fairly rapidly as to what is the cost of giving old age pensions at whatever rate he likes when he sees what he can afford&mdash;whether it is to be 26/- or more or less.</P>
    <P>If then he goes further and thinks that it should be on a contributory basis, or partly on a contributory basis, which will probably be the result in the end, he will be told, if he asks for the information, how much 6d. a week between employers and employees brings in and he can multiply that in order to get the amount required to give a pension at the rate of 26/- a week.  Actuarial data will enable his Department to tell him what it will cost to give 26/- a week in sickness benefit or 26/- a week in unemployment benefit.  All these things have been worked out.  He can also be informed what it will cost to give the same benefits as people have under the Beveridge Plan.  I think it is 14/- to a man's wife if he is drawing <Col N="420" /> sickness benefit or unemployment benefit, and 7/6 a week each for the first two children.  All these things are ready.</P>

      <P>Yes, the statistics are ready.  They took a considerable time to prepare.  The Minister is, therefore, in a position to say to his Government: &ldquo;If we adopt such a scheme it will cost so many millions.  If we put a contribution of so much a week between employer and employee, that will bring in so many millions and the State will have so much left.&rdquo;  All that information is ready.  I do not want to be unreasonable, but I was at the stage when I was hoping I could put a scheme to the Government and tell them what it would cost.  I have no idea whether the Government would stand over the cost or not, but it had reached the stage where it could be put up for consideration.</P>

      <P>When I took over the Department my first job was to take in all the services and amalgamate them&mdash; services such as old age pensions, unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance and national health&mdash;and then I commenced to get the data ready.  It took nine or ten months to prepare and we were on the point of drafting what might be regarded as the basis for a White Paper.  That was in the first draft in the Department.  I did not give it any consideration; indeed, I had hardly read it, but the point had been reached when certain proposals could be prepared for the Departments and for the Government. It is a slow procedure and it takes some months to get through it, but that stage had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also had asked the Department to get us the cost of benefits that they <Col N="421" /> have not got in England.  One is the marriage benefit, and I am glad to inform the House that it would not cost a lot of money to give a marriage bounty to every insured person.  It is a scheme that the Minister will be rather favourable to when he comes to consider it.  They have such things as maternity and death benefits in the Beveridge scheme and the figures for these would also be prepared.  The statistical data are there now, but a very big task remains, the task of making up your mind as to what you can do.  The Government will have to make their minds up to do whatever they think the country can afford, going as far as possible to meet the needs of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There are certain difficulties in this country that perhaps they have not got in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I would urge on the Minister that, if it is at all possible, he should cut out the differentiation in some of our schemes as between rural and urban areas and he should try to give the same rate all round.  That may be difficult in some ways, if there is a high contribution fixed for the employee and the employer. For instance, the agricultural labourer has not a very big wage and it would be hard to expect him to contribute liberally to a scheme of this kind.  But his employer is equally hard hit because the farmer, if he has to put a few shillings a week on stamps for each employee, must bear it out of his profits, whatever they are.  He is not in a position to increase his price to make up for the increased cost, as certain other employers are.  There are difficulties of that kind that will require considerable thought and ingenuity to surmount.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to minimise the difficulties that the Government will have in implementing a new social scheme.  If this country were to adopt the same rates of benefit as are given under the Beveridge scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland we would probably have to find another £15,000,000 along with what is contributed by the employer, the employee and the State.  That gives one an idea of the magnitude of this job of drawing up an ideal social scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> There will be many suggestions made, but this is not the time to make them.  We had better wait until the scheme is ready because our conditions here are not at all on a par with the conditions in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  One big difficulty is that what are called the self-employed classes are very much lower in Great Britain and Northern Ireland than here.  I was never satisfied that I could suggest any scheme that would be satisfactory for the self-employed classes.  I do not know how the Department of Social Welfare will collect contributions from them, if there are contributions.  Again, it will be a difficult matter to check up on sickness and unemployment among the self-employed classes.  There are many difficulties and I would not expect the Minister to be able to produce a scheme within a week or two.  I had hoped to be able to produce a White Paper outlining the statistical data and giving examples of what contributions of so much would mean in the way of benefits and giving that so that members of the various Parties could make up their own calculations as to what would be possible for a country like this.</P>
    <P>One side of this question is what those who are working can afford to contribute to the unfortunates who are sick or unemployed, to the widows and to inevitable old age.  On the other side we want to find out to what extent people with low incomes here require assistance.  Everybody will agree that they require some further assistance. We want to find out to what extent they require it.  I would like to say to the Minister for Health that there was a nutritional survey&mdash;the work went on for a couple of years&mdash;carried out under the direction of the Medical Research Council.  The work was done according to international standards.  The survey was first taken in Dublin and afterwards the staff worked in the country. Dublin was completed.  In fact, I saw a draft of the summary of the results of the survey in Dublin before I left the Department.  I think that would be an extremely useful thing for any Deputy to study.  He would get a very good idea from the survey as to how <Col N="423" /> people in the City of Dublin live.  It deals, of course, altogether with food, but one would get a good idea from it of the living conditions of people in all strata in the City of Dublin&mdash;of the people in the lower income groups, of people with higher incomes and of people with very high incomes.  The survey gives the food intake of the people in these various categories.  A study of it would be very informative for members of the House.  It would help them to make up their minds as to what additional amount would be required by way of social welfare for people who are not in a position to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Health to look into that matter and see if it would be possible to issue a summary of the results of the survey in Dublin.  It was taken, I think, in 1946.  It took a long time to do all the various calculations and to make a summary of the results.  The longer we go on the more out of date it becomes so that from that point of view also I think it should be published if possible.  It would be useful not only to the Minister himself but also in considering this matter of social welfare.</P>

      <P>This Vote on Account is to provide the necessary finances for the new Government during the next few months.  We are handing over this money to it with a feeling of confidence, with a feeling that the new Ministers who have been appointed to the high posts which they now hold are taking their duties very seriously, and are prepared to discharge them conscientiously. The new Government carries with it into power a very large measure of goodwill from the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of personal regret to me, and also I think to a good number of other people, that the Government that we have in this 13th Dáil is not proportionately representative of all Parties in the State.  It is, however, representative of a good number of Parties.  The statements made by the Taoiseach and other Ministers since they took up office have inspired amongst the general body of the people <Col N="424" /> a considerable amount of confidence. The fact that the Taoiseach has nominated to the important position of Minister for Health a very young man, a new man in the public life of this country, has struck a favourable note amongst the people generally.  There is a feeling that this new Minister will bring the energy and enthusiasm of youth to the solution of the problems entrusted to him.  He certainly carries with him into his high office the prayers and the gratitude of the hundreds of people who passed through his hands in his professional capacity.  I know&mdash; he had charge of an institution in my constituency&mdash;the high esteem in which he is held by everyone who came in contact with him&mdash;patients and others.</P>
    <P>We have in the Department of Education a man who, though not young in years, is young in vitality, in enthusiasm and in zeal.  Deputy Mulcahy has passed through a long, tough and hard political and military life, and yet he has preserved more than any other man in public life the ideals and the idealism of youth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely emphasising the fact that we are handing over a considerable sum of money to men who, we trust, will use it to the best national advantage.  I did not come here, and I was not sent here, to express compliments to Deputies on any side of this House.  I have never during the ten years that I have been <Col N="425" /> a member licked the boots of any Minister, and I am not going to begin now.  While I am here as an Independent Deputy, I shall uphold my right to criticise the Government as I think necessary, and to compliment it as I think necessary, to vote for it when I think necessary, and to vote against it when I think it desirable.</P>
      <P>The Government on taking office announced a ten-point programme covering many of the most important aspects of the national policy.  First in that ten-point programme they declared that it was their intention to promote increased agricultural and industrial production.  I am inclined to regret that, while many Deputies have taken part in this debate, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not intervened to tell us what are the plans of the Government for the promotion of industrial production.  It is desirable that the country should be told that it is the Government's intention to do anything and everything possible to increase the output of our secondary industries, to increase the output of our factories and other industrial concerns, and, if possible, to increase the number of such industrial enterprises.  We are also entitled to be told the particular lines of industrial development about which the Government is most concerned at present.  Twenty years ago, a young man named McGilligan went out one day and harnessed the Shannon.  That man is now a member of the Government, and I am sure he still possesses the same spirit of initiative and enterprise as he possessed 20 years ago. We are anxious to hear that there will be an intensive effort to develop particularly those key-industries such as the production of hydro-electric power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have declared that they propose to increase agricultural production.  That is fundamentally the most important function which any Government in this country could undertake at present.  We know that, after 25 years of self-government, the volume of agricultural production has not increased in the slightest.  That is a sad admission for any Irishman to have to make&mdash;a period of 25 years of self-government has not produced any <Col N="426" /> real development in the agricultural industry, and we cannot afford to wait longer.  This work must be tackled at once and it must be tackled with energy and with vigour.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Health talked for a considerable length of time on the subject of agriculture and Deputy O'Reilly also spoke on the same subject.  There seems to be competition amongst the new Opposition to qualify for the position of agricultural representatives.  They will have to administer, if they wish to succeed in attaining to that position, some sort of drug to the farmers to make them forget the agricultural policy they pursued during their 16 years of office.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Health told us there was a considerable amount of fertilisers available.  I want the House to get a clear grasp of this problem.  Every expert in the Department of Agriculture, every practical farmer, knows that to treat land properly, from the point of view of getting the utmost production, you have to use at least five cwts. of fertiliser per year on every acre of land under cultivation and under pasture.  That means, in effect, that we would require to use at least 2,000,000 tons of fertiliser per year, if we are to develop our agriculture to the maximum.  When we are told about the enormous increase in the output of agriculture in Great Britain and other countries, we are never told about the extremely large quantities of fertilisers put into the land.  I understand from statistics that we imported last year 119,000 tons of fertilisers&mdash;119,000 tons when we require at least 2,000,000 tons in order to make the land as productive as it could be!  And Deputy Ryan says we have quite sufficient supplies of fertilisers for our farmers.  If the Government are very serious in their desire to increase agricultural production, they must get down to this question of getting hold of all the fertilisers that can be secured from whatever source. That is an urgent matter of national policy.  We do not know how long the uneasy peace which prevails in Europe at present will last, and, while it lasts, it is the first duty of the State to put into the land the utmost fertility possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> In addition there is urgent need, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, for increased capitalisation of agriculture, for increasing the capital resources of the farmer, so that he can get the utmost production from his land.  A very conservative estimate was made by Dr. Henry Kennedy some years ago, as a member of the Commission on PostEmergency Agricultural Policy.  He gave an estimate of the capital requirements of agriculture.  He pointed out that to restore the land to a proper condition of fertility and to have it properly drained and fenced would require £58,000,000, that to provide the necessary housing for live stock and the necessary out-buildings on agricultural holdings would require a capital of £98,000,000, that £23,000,000 would be required for the equipment of our farms in respect of implements and modern equipment, that £22,000,000 would be required to provide suitable stock on our farms, and £15,000,000 to provide decent water supplies.  In all, he estimated that it would require £217,000,000 to finance the agricultural industry and put it on a really productive basis.  That was not the estimate of some dreamer or faddist but that of a hard-headed expert who had learned by practical experience what agriculture requires.  I mention that figure just to show the immense problem facing our nation and our Government in increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I do not quite agree with those Deputies who have advocated the co-operative ownership of farm implements. I believe that the problem of providing farm implements for the small farmer can be solved in more effective and more efficient ways.  I do not think that co-operation or co-operative societies would be a success in that respect.  I believe that, as we have found by practical experience, if a young man in a rural area is given an opportunity to purchase farm implements and work them for hire amongst his neighbours, he will give good and satisfactory service and keep those implements in proper repair and use them efficiently.</P>
    <P>No amount of capital put into the agricultural industry, no amount of planning in regard to agriculture, will <Col N="428" /> have any useful effect unless the farmer is absolutely secure in regard to market and to price for his produce. I appreciate the course taken by the Minister for Agriculture in guaranteeing the price of wheat over a period of five years.  I think he has taken the proper stand in that matter. The farmer is entitled to a long-term price for his produce, but since that price was first fixed his costs have been substantially increased and I doubt very much whether that price will be sufficient inducement to him, for the present year, at any rate.  Perhaps the cost of production will be decreased substantially before the next sowing season begins, but for the present season the price will not offer any margin of profit.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Governments over such a long period have resisted the demand for an independent and impartial tribunal of inquiry into farmers' costs.  I believe such a tribunal should be set up, to find out what it costs to produce wheat, beet and other produce, a tribunal which would publish the figures, which could not be disputed by the farmer, the consumer or any other section of the community. That is an urgent national need and until that need is met we will have these eternal wrangles in regard to price.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday if he was prepared to guarantee fair prices for the chief produce of agriculture, including dairy produce, bacon pigs, barley and oats.  The Minister said he could not undertake to give such a guarantee without knowing what the production costings would be over the coming years.  He challenged me to make some suggestion on the matter. The suggestion I have to make is that a price be fixed, a long-term price subject to revision if the findings of an impartial tribunal show that the costs of production have either risen or fallen during the next five years.  That is the only reasonable approach and the only reasonable solution of this problem. I am satisfied that you will get increased agricultural production provided the farmer is given a reasonable inducement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The Minister for Agriculture has boldly said that it is the policy of the Government to keep outside the farmer's fence.  I would like to be sure that that is a clear-cut statement of policy and not merely a deluding phrase.  We would like to be assured that the officials of the Department of Lands will not go in upon any farm to acquire it compulsorily.  Security of ownership and fixity of tenure are principles which must be firmly upheld and I hope the Minister for Agriculture will see that his principle of keeping the Government outside the farmer's fence will be adhered to.  For the past ten years, it has been the policy of the Government to go inside the farmer's fence and fix the minimum wage he must pay to his workers.  If that policy is continued, there is no use in any member of the Government pretending that the Government is keeping outside the farmer's fence.  If you go inside to fix the wage he has to pay to his workers on the farm, you carry on your shoulders the responsibility of seeing that the farmer is in a position to pay that wage.  That is a fundamental obligation you cannot escape.</P>
    <P>Given justice and fair treatment in the matter of price and a reasonable attempt, an all-out effort, on the part of the Government to increase the supplies of fertilisers available, I can assure the Minister that the farming community will do their part to increase agricultural production.  The Government announced that it was their intention to embark upon an all-out drive to provide houses for our working people.  If there is anything next in urgency to increasing our agricultural production, it is the necessity of ensuring that our people will be decently housed.  What are the obstacles standing in the way of decent housing at the present time?  We are told that it is the shortage of materials. We are told, moreover&mdash;and it is, perhaps, even more serious, than the shortage of materials&mdash;that it is a shortage. of skilled workers.</P>
    <P>What are the Government going to do about that shortage of skilled workers?  How are they going to tackle that problem, and I want to ask also why is there a shortage of skilled <Col N="430" /> workers?  We are spending tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds every year on technical and vocational education and why are not our technical and vocational schools turning out tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of skilled workers capable of taking their place in the building trade?  Is it not true that there are certain organisations, certain cliques and certain societies which prevent the entry into the building trade of skilled workers?  If there are, those organisations and societies must not be allowed to stand in the way of a drive, an effective drive, for increased housing.  Whether they are organisations of contractors who are hoping to keep up the prices of building or of workers who wish to restrict entry into that business, they must not be allowed to stand in the people's way when they want housing and want it urgently.</P>
    <P>There has been, I think, over the last 16 years too much exploitation of the people's urgent need for housing accommodation and of the Government's willingness and anxiety to provide that accommodation and also of the willingness and anxiety of the local authorities.  There has been too much exploitation and too much profiteering and it is the duty of the Government in justice to the ordinary people of the country to see that houses are provided and that they are provided as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one problem which has not been referred to in the Government's ten-point programme.  It is an urgent national problem and it has not been referred to to any great extent in the course of this debate, but I intend to refer to it.  It is the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>I hold that it is the duty of the Government to do everything that is possible to keep our people at home in Ireland and to provide a living for them here in Ireland.  A Minister of State has said that he is not alarmed or worried about emigration.  I do not think that that Minister can be expressing governmental policy or if he is it is bad governmental policy; it is an un-Irish and an un-national policy.  A nation can afford to be complacent about emigration if it has an excess in population. <Col N="431" /> A man who weighs over 16 or 17 stone does not mind losing a little weight but a man who weighs less than a hundredweight must be worried about losing a few pounds' weight.  In the same way a nation like ours with a population of less than 3,000,000 cannot be complacent in regard to emigration.</P>
    <P>I happened to read an article written by a staff reporter of the <i>Standard</i> in a recent issue.  He spoke of conditions in a place called Auchtermuchty.  The place is in Scotland and he described the conditions of our emigrants, our Irish people, and I think that those conditions can only be described as appalling and reflecting discredit on our nation and on ourselves.  He said that at one place in Fifeshire&mdash;he was referring to a statement made to him by a local priest who was working among our emigrants in Scotland&mdash; when he answered a sick call late one night, he found Irish boys and girls in an old shed.  &ldquo;They slept on straw and there was no privacy between the sexes save a few old pieces of sacking draped across a rope.&rdquo;  Those are the conditions which Irish people are forced to live in in other lands, those are the conditions which they are subjected to. When ex-Ministers and others talk about raising the prestige of our country I would like to ask them what kind of boost it gives to the prestige of our nation to see Irish people having to take the most lowly-paid and degrading work in Great Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have got to realise that until we build up a population in this country capable of developing the nation's resources fully, a population capable of strengthening this nation physically and economically, until we can do that, we cannot be complacent about emigration.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister at the conclusion of this debate a clear and definite statement that he will take strong, active and bold measures to hold our people in Ireland and for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I have said, commands a large measure of popular support in this country; they command <Col N="432" /> the support of all sections of the people; they command the goodwill of all sections of the people.  They have a great and difficult task to perform; they are entrusted with Government at the most difficult period of the nation's history; they have handed over to the people a bill for running this country so enormous as to be staggering.  They have got to get down to the task with vigour, with sincerity and with determination, and, as far as possible, they must enforce economy in every Government Department.  They must see that there is no waste, no overlapping, no officials who have no useful function to serve; they must see that extravagance and extreme generosity to friends is not permitted in any Government Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Government will be foolish enough, in their desire for economy or in their desire to make changes, to cut off any useful work that was initiated or undertaken by their predecessors.  On the contrary, I think they will err rather on the side of giving every scheme that was promoted by their predecessors a fair trial.  Any measure which has within it the seeds of ultimate success even if it may not succeed in the present year or in the next year should be given a fair trial. That applies to air transport, turf development and to other branches of national development.  All those matters must be judged fairly and wisely. I am sure that no hasty decisions will be taken and that whatever changes it is found necessary to make will be made only after the most careful investigation. So many things in the entire administration of the outgoing Government have been extravagant and rotten and require to be reformed immediately that the Government have a big task before them.  They have just the same task as that of a householder going into a house that has been mismanaged over a long period of years.  There is a great deal of work to be done, clearing up and cleaning out.  I am sure that that work will be undertaken.  I think we can rely upon the prudence of experienced and patriotic men to see that no scheme is discarded which may have some ultimate use.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to find out what the social policy of the present Government is likely to be if we are to judge by the actions and the pronouncements to which we have been treated so far. I was very interested in the speeches which were made here to-day by some of the people who support the Government. Deputy Cowan, Deputy Hickey and even Deputy Cogan seemed to make speeches that would indicate that they are on the wrong side of the House.  It is puzzling that they, holding the views which their speeches seem to indicate, should support the present Government.  Deputy Cogan's last remark was that the present Government has a big job of clearing up to do. Well, as far as the western seaboard is concerned, the clearing out will commence now.  Men who hitherto found good employment at home will now have to seek it elsewhere because there is no alternative employment in the offing for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While everybody recognises that the <Col N="435" /> turf industry was not all that was to be desired from the national point of view, in any event it provided a very good safeguard.  It was the sheet-anchor for the country during the worst period of the war.  The stopping of it now at one fell stroke reminds me of the mistake the British Government made with regard to their own miners in the depressed period before the war.  I think it is a case of throwing out the dirty water before the clean has been got in.  I think that in this matter the Government, in spite of the necessity which it sees to retrench financially, should hasten slowly.  I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Hickey and Deputy Cowan when they state that finance should not be the yardstick by which everything is to be judged and that so-called economy should not be the objective or the end of the Government. The present Government seems to be dominated by Fine Gael.  Fine Gael made a reduction in the cost of government the main plank in its programme at the election.  But there was this note, in any event, in all the speeches of all the Parties and there was one thing about which the electorate who did not support Fianna Fáil were agreed.  That was that all the Parties were satisfied that the same services could be given and that the cost of government could be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is now painfully obvious that the people have been deceived in that belief and that the cost of government, if it is to come down, can only be brought down at the sacrifice of services of the first importance to the people.  I know that as far as the west is concerned, the indication so far given by the attack on two industries&mdash;one the glasshouse industry and another of far greater importance, the turf industry&mdash;can produce nothing but black despair along the western seaboard. As a result of the decision announced&mdash;I do not know whether it is official or not but there was information in to-day's paper to indicate that it is to be the official policy of the Government to cut out the handwon turf industry at one stroke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the people in Dublin and other places like it suffered very severely, last year particularly, but who will not agree that last year was a most exceptional year? We had, I suppose almost up to the end of May, snow and rain and a continuance of very inclement weather almost up to the harvest.  We do know that people, even in the turf areas, paid as much as £30 for a lorry load of turf last spring because of the exceptional weather conditions.  That, in my opinion, should not be made an excuse for finishing this industry now. As I say, it is something which enabled us to carry on during the war. If we did not have native fuel we might not have been able to get sufficient fuel from abroad and we know the price we would have to pay if we did succeed in getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody was pleased, irrespective of Party, when the war, great curse that it was, brought good to parts of the country which it failed almost all Governments, native and foreign, heretofore to help.  It brought money and a comfortable living into the poorest parts of the country and these <Col N="437" /> poor areas supplied our people with a product which it was impossible to get elsewhere.  I think that we are not so far removed from the war that we should forget that fact so soon.  As I say, this decision has produced black despair amongst the people affected by it and, if it is not too late, I would appeal to the Minister and to the Government to change their hand in this respect.</P>
    <P>As an offset, I understand that the unemployment assistance service is to be altered.  In to-day's news, there is an intimation that the upper limit of valuation which qualifies a person to receive unemployment assistance during the period from now until October is to be raised from £2 to £4.  That is something of which I approve myself.  The interesting thing about that intimation is that the change is supposed to have been brought about by the intervention of three Fine Gael Deputies.  I do not know whether the Clann na Poblachta and Labour Deputies backing the Government would be quite satisfied with that aspect of the announcement. In any event, the remark I wish to make about it is that of the three Fine Gael Deputies, my particular opposite number is one who organised the parish councils in my constituency against this very demoralising &ldquo;dole&rdquo;, as it was dubbed.  The local paper covered on one occasion practically the whole of its news pages with a denunciation of the evils which the dole was supposed to be producing amongst the people of West Galway.  We denounced that castigation of the unemployment assistance because we knew it to be generally untrue.  It may have been true to a very small extent, as there is nothing perfect in this world.  Very possibly some few people were getting the dole who would not work but the work shy were to be found in every town long before Lloyd George's insurance scheme of 1920 was introduced.  The vast majority prefer work to any form of benefit provided for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Taking it by and large, the unemployment assistance did not demoralise the people of the constituency I represent. It is a very good social service, and taken in conjunction with a number <Col N="438" /> of other social services inaugurated by Fianna Fáil&mdash;children's allowances and things of that kind&mdash;it has raised the standard of living of the people of the Gaeltacht and has not demoralised them in any way.  I do know that in a great many cases, I will say in the majority of cases, it has made the people more enterprising because they now have some guarantee of security. I do know that some of the families to whom these benefits have been given have even been able to give a secondary education to some of their children. In my opinion, the people who were able to utilise their resources in that way were certainly entitled to get these benefits.</P>
    <P>The people whom I represent are bewildered by the financial policy of the present Government.  We were beaten because we tried to subsidise the cost of essential commodities by taxing other less essential commodities.  Now that policy is to be changed.  Because all the Parties backing the Government agreed on this one point these duties have been repealed and we are back to the <i>status quo</i>, as far as the price of tobacco and beer is concerned.  The job now is to find the money in some alternative way, through a loan to be raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave an interview in which he said that while it was not the policy of the Government to use the loan for the purpose of household expenses, so to speak, at the same time they had taken over certain liabilities which had to be discharged. The average man down the country reading the paper can hardly be blamed if he interprets that statement as meaning that one of the liabilities is the necessity to find money to finance the subsidisation of flour, tea and sugar.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to loans.  I think our Government could <Col N="439" /> have done a little more in that respect. Possibly the financial policy of the Government and its advisers was a bit too conservative in the matter of loans. We had a statement by the late Minister for Finance that the national debt of this country during the seven years of the war increased by only £20,000,000.  In view of that I think we could have had a little more financial freedom than we did.  We are now to have retrenchment at any cost.</P>

      <P>The cost so far seems to be in the reduction of employment. Some of the speakers here this evening&mdash;I refer particularly to Deputy Cowan and Deputy Hickey&mdash;indicated that financial retrenchment should not be an end in itself.  We should not be so timorous about the size of the bill which the people are asked to foot. The national income has increased and the natural consequence is that the cost of Government must increase simultaneously.  Apparently there are two extremes in the Government.  On the one hand, there are those who would go to any lengths to finance extravagance in order to achieve their aims; on the other hand there are those who want to see the cost of government reduced no matter what sacrifice the community is called upon to bear as a result of that reduction. It so happens that that section of the community in the West of Ireland is one of the poorest and yet they are going to be the first sufferers.  I object very strongly to the Government's policy because of that.  I believe that when the present course of events takes a more definite shape Labour, Clann na Poblachta and National Labour will come over to us in a year or so.</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be the irony of fate that the justification for the imposition of these colossal taxes on this country should now be laid upon the shoulders of the Opposition.

So, too, do we now refuse to accept responsibility for the colossal sum that will be imposed upon the people of this country under the forthcoming Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of political capital has been made out of the turf scheme.  I come from an area where the turf scheme was introduced on a large scale along the western seaboard of County Kerry.  I would like to tell those Deputies who come from non-turf areas that in no sense was the turf scheme introduced for the welfare of the people as a whole in these particular areas. <Col N="441" /> When the emergency arose supporters of Fianna Fáil endeavoured to make it appear in the minds of the people that it was Deputy de Valera who introduced this scheme for the purpose of giving employment.  It was, of course, pure necessity that gave birth to the scheme.  If any man is to be held responsible for it it should be laid to the credit of Herr Hitler, the man who started the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area from which I come, when the scheme was first introduced nobody would be given employment under it unless he joined a Fianna Fáil club.  Up to the present time no man could become a charge-hand, or ganger, or an engineer unless he was a supporter of Fianna Fáil. The turf scheme seems to me to have been merely a vote-catching device for Fianna Fáil.  It gave a certain sort of employment of a temporary nature.  In the course of time vast numbers of our people emigrated and eventually force of circumstances compelled them to take in people with other affiliations under the scheme.  But at all times the men in key positions were the followers of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to boast about in connection with this scheme.  The men were not well paid and the conditions of employment were not very pleasant. The men had to come long distances to work in these bogs because it was impossible to get sufficient local labour. <Col N="442" /> There was no provision made for giving those men a midday meal.  If the scheme were carried out in a proper way, there would have been some kind of huts or temporary shelters erected in the bogs for the comfort of the workers when having their lunch or when the weather was very severe.  Provision could also have been made to supply some warm meals.  Then, again, the hours were long.  Anybody working in a turf area knows how very unpleasant it is to work in an open bleak place.</P>
    <P>It is a pity, of course, that this employment should cease or partly cease. There is, however, one section of the people for whom I have great sympathy and I hope the Ministers responsible will look after their welfare before they come to a final decision in connection with this turf scheme.  I refer to the private turf producers.  With their families, those people went out into the bogs on their own land or they took banks of turf elsewhere.  I know several people in South Kerry who employed up to 25 men to produce turf privately.  I should like that to be continued as far as possible.  I take it that with the development of arterial drainage and afforestation which may take place in future those who have been employed in this turf scheme will be absorbed into those schemes.  In fact this turf scheme up to the present had become a sort of racket.  Various people got into it and made huge profits and the people who suffered most were those who worked under miserable conditions in the bogs.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite profess a great deal of consideration for the Gaeltacht, and we heard the outbursts here in connection with the announcement about the Connemara glasshouses. There is an old proverb in connection with glasshouses and it would be well for Deputies opposite to remember it. For instance, when the grants for housing were increased there was no increase made in the grants to be given in the Gaeltacht; they forgot that.  At a certain stage the people in the Gaeltacht, on holdings up to £4 valuation, were entitled to unemployment assistance. The previous Government cut that down to £2 valuation.  It has now been increased again to £4 valuation. <Col N="443" /> It does not matter who brought about that change which is for the welfare of the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Then again in County Kerry we have fishermen who live solely by sea fishing.  Prior to the Fianna Fáil regime, these fishermen were able to purchase boats and gear, at first without any deposit, then with 5 per cent. deposit, and later on with 10 per cent. deposit.  But, under the Fianna Fáil Government, it has come to be a 50 per cent. deposit.  That meant that once these men lost their boats or their gear they never again could purchase boats or gear.  I hope that the Minister responsible will take this matter into consideration and that in the near future we shall come back to the old system of giving the fishermen loans for boats and gear for a 10 per cent. deposit to be paid back out of the proceeds of their fishing.  I am proud to say that, so far as I know, in all the areas in my constituency where fishing is carried on along the coast all the moneys advanced on loan for the purchase of boats and gear have been fully repaid by the fishermen concerned. That should be an incentive to the Government to give them better terms so that they may be able to carry on their fishing under proper conditions.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht, and especially in the constituency I represent, there is a good deal of coast erosion.  I know one area, extending from Milltown to Glenbeg, a distance of 20 odd miles, where in 1914, under the Congested Districts Board, earthen embankments were erected to prevent the inflow of the tide.  That is a long time ago, and these embankments were not erected in a very satisfactory way.  Several breaches have been made in these embankments. Only a few days ago I saw some of these and no attempt had been made by the last Government to repair these breaches.  When the breaches were first made it would have taken only a small sum to repair them.  Engineers were sent down to the district, especially before the general election. I know one particular place where there was a breach of about 100 yards.  Engineers have gone there several times. A few days before the election three <Col N="444" /> car loads of them arrived in order to make the people believe that everything would be made all right.  Poor people living in these districts who have grass only for three or four cows have their lands flooded by the tide. In all about 100 families are affected in the area to which I refer.  That is how the last Government treated those districts along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>The way that the bodies concerned with education were treated by the last Government is known to all Deputies.  The shocking way in which the former Minister for Education treated the demands of the teachers will always be remembered by the members of the I.N.T.O. and the parents of the Dublin children.  Money was spent in every way and yet, when it came to education, which is so important for the welfare of the children of the nation, there was no consideration for those who carried on that work.  The Minister for Finance for the last Government boasted here in this House that the longer the teachers remained on strike the better, because his Department were saving a sum of £300,000 by not having to pay the teachers.  That was a very mean attitude for the then Minister to take up. The Minister for Education, who should have supported the attitude of the teachers, sat silent all the time. He will always be remembered by the members of the I.N.T.O. as one of the most stubborn, pig-headed and highly inefficient Ministers for Education that this country has ever had or ever will have.</P>
    <P>Nothing is being done with regard to schools.  There are numbers of them quite uninhabitable.  It is shocking to see their condition.  I never knew how bad they were until, during the election campaign, I had occasion to visit them in various parts of Kerry.  In the same old way engineers go along and inspect these old schools.  Time after time representations have been made by managers, teachers and local bodies, yet nothing has been done.  Some new schools have been erected.  Perhaps they have been erected in areas where supporters of Fianna Fáil were in the majority.</P>

      <P>I know that vocational schools have been built&mdash;palatial buildings.  They seem to have got all the consideration.  If you look up the numbers attending them, it is really strange that they should have received such consideration, whereas the primary schools have not been considered at all.  These vocational schools have not been built in the proper areas.  Instead of building them in cities and towns they should have been built in the wide open spaces and provision should have been made to acquire a certain amount of land so that agricultural subjects could be taught to the pupils who would attend these schools.  At a time when the flight from the land is so serious, that might form some inducement to our young people to come to love nature and to settle down on the land, to till it and produce the crops that we require for the welfare of our people.</P>
      <P>It should be realised that children in rural areas have not many opportunities for a higher education and it would be well to consider that there should be some type of higher primary school with teachers who would teach special subjects until the children would reach 16 years of age.  After that they could pass on to vocational or technical schools, one of which should be in every parish.  In that way you will educate our people fully. If you want to secure the revival of Irish, of which the last Taoiseach was so much in favour and about which he spoke so frequently when people would expect him to speak about material things, there would be a wonderful opportunity of reviving it and making it the spoken language of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made to airlines to America, and other airlines, too.  The question has been asked, why the new line to America was not opened up with, I suppose, all the pomp and splendour that would satisfy the vanity of the last Taoiseach.  Evidently he meant to open up the line to coincide with the celebrations in America on St. Patrick's day.  He has gone to America, but not at the expense of the over-taxed people of this country.  He had to pay his own fare, though at any time we would be quite willing to give <Col N="446" /> him a single fare across to the United States.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been mentioned here. Last year there was a loss of something like £132,000 on that company.  All that money had to be met by our taxpayers. There are other airlines which are being run at a great loss, but the late Government, if they had had the opportunity, were prepared to open up a further service and incur vastly greater losses than have been incurred by the lines in operation.  One wonders what we can do.  Five big Constellation passenger planes were purchased by the last Government.  That meant an immense loss to our taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I was thinking the other day, when I was walking through the park and I saw vast mounds in front of me, that I was walking towards the pyramids of Egypt.  I discovered that the mounds were composed of the dust of turf and of American coal&mdash;all the rotten turf that was dumped in the park and not protected from the weather.  It was again the result of inefficiency on the part of the last Government.  Indeed, I was thinking that some of the Constellations might be used to carry away that dust and dump it into the Atlantic. I would place the Ministers of the last Government as pilots and get them to shovel the dust in and out as some punishment for their inefficiency.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about agriculture and as to what should be done to bring about prosperity for the farmers.  The farmers were very prosperous when the last Government took over control.  I heard Deputies opposite stating that when Fianna Fáil took office there were very few of our present social services.  That is quite true, and the reason is that at that time they were not required.  I remember the farmers in 1931; they were prosperous and there was scarcely any unemployment.  The farmers were then able to sell their cattle at a profitable price and they could support their families in comfort.  It was only when Fianna Fáil came into power and started the economic war that agriculture went down and our young men and women began to fly from the country. During the past 16 years 250,000 of our young people have left our country. It is rather remarkable that it <Col N="447" /> was under a Fianna Fáil Government all that emigration took place.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about agricultural production.  I will suggest something in connection with agriculture and perhaps the Minister will consider it.  I read an article recently about farming in Canada.  It has been suggested that a great deal has been done for the prosperity of the farmers in the wheat-producing, barley-producing and beet-producing areas.  Where I come from there are mountain farms. The people live by rearing cattle and sheep in the mountains.  They are really industrious farmers and they are the farmers who suffer most during severe winters.</P>
    <P>In Canada, where they have severe frosts and snow during the winter, they have a system of insurance for farmers against losses.  I am not going to go into details, but I think that system would be worth looking into. It would be better, I think, than the issuing of loans free of interest to farmers to recoup them for their losses. It would be well, I think, if we had some kind of State insurance through which farmers, especially our mountain farmers, for whom I speak, would be recompensed for the losses they may suffer during severe weather, or through disease afflicting their flocks and herds.</P>
    <P>I think I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy say that in order to reduce the cost of living we would have to increase taxation.  Any ordinary man should know that every time you increase taxation you increase the cost of living.  We on this side of the House hope to reduce taxation by wise economy and at the same time not to cut down any of our social services.  In fact, it is our object to increase them. I am not speaking officially, but the desire of the members of our Party is to increase the social services.  I would recommend the Minister responsible to stop the system in operation whereby the old age pensioners get the extra half-crown through the home assistance officer.  That would seem to create the idea that they are being treated as paupers and is entirely wrong.  I cannot see why the payment of this extra <Col N="448" /> half-crown should be left in the hands of the home assistance officers.  Why not pay the full amount at the post office?  In all these cases there was a sort of political tinge.  Old age pensioners who did not vote as the late Government wanted them were very often refused that extra half-crown.  I know that.  On the whole, we have nothing to fear from anything that has been said by the Minister here in our endeavour to bring down taxation.  I hope that by wise legislation in the future and good government we shall make these Twenty-Six Counties such a happy country as to entice our brothers in the North to come in here. I hope that before we pass away we shall see all our people, North and South, happy and prosperous in a free and united Ireland.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that all the Deputies on the opposite side of the House are just making a feeble effort, more or less, to elaborate the statement that they dare not share any responsibility for the particular Estimates we are discussing.  I understood from the speeches that I listened to from each Party during the election that they had a plan in their pocket, and that immediately the Dáil met they would produce it and reduce expenditure straight away.  It does not seem to be forthcoming.  As I listened to Deputy Palmer, I formed a very poor opinion of the mentality of the people of Kerry&mdash;that they should elect a Deputy who is capable of making such untruthful statements as he <Col N="449" /> has made.  First of all, he criticised turf production.  He opened his statement by referring to the Taoiseach in the last Government in starting peat production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is not so, as everybody in this House who is prepared to look up the facts in connection with peat production fully realises.  The peat societies were started by the previous Government many years before the war started.  I am sure that happened in Kerry as well as in Galway and in other counties where turf was to be had.  Not only were the peat societies started but turf-cutting competitions were in existence in Kildare and elsewhere prior to the outbreak of war in an honest effort by the past Government to try to prepare for what they saw was coming.</P>
      <P>The past Government had to fight against many things in this House. They had to fight against elements sitting on the benches at the opposite side now.  Fine Gael with a lot of the back benchers that they have got behind them tried to kill our wheat policy, our beet policy, and our turf policy. Now they come along, because these schemes were successful in providing the people with the necessities of life, and try to cast slurs on the men who had the foresight to see that provision would be made for any emergency that might arise if war broke out.</P>

      <P>If we paid the same price we would have got them too but we would not pay it.  One of the things that the last speaker said was that on that side of the House they were going to effect economy by wise spending. The first result of the economy that I see in the House is that arising out of the bargain made by Fine Gael we have two extra Ministers.  They could easily have been done without.  I did not hear any speaker on the other side say that we could have done without them. We know the kind of economy that we will get from that side of the House. We had experience of it before.  We have people shedding crocodile tears for the old age pensioners, but I remember, when they wanted to balance their Budget, how they did it. It was the poor old age pensioner who was asked to come to the rescue and perhaps he will again be asked to come to the rescue, when things settle down.</P>

      <Col N="451" /> I am interested in this question of drainage and I was very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance making a speech in Tuam on last Saturday evening in which he said that the drainage which had been so completely neglected by the previous Government would be put into operation immediately.  I was also delighted to hear him say that the West of Ireland, and particularly Galway, would get a preference, so far as he was concerned.  I hope he gives effect to that statement in the very near future, because there are a number of drainage schemes in which he, as well as I, has been interested for a number of years on the Galway County Council and other places, and which are urgently required.  I hope he will give effect to that statement and will not deny that such a statement was made at some later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is his policy I want to speak about and I prefaced my remarks by referring to the efforts he made to-day to answer questions regarding his policy.  This is one of the biggest problems we have in the West of Ireland and, he being a West of Ireland man, one would think that he would be prepared immediately to step into the breach, and, as he said himself on many occasions, burst up all the land that remained to be burst up and divide it in the way he has so often indicated.  If he is to do these things and if he intends to go ahead with the policy of land division, he will have to make a better effort than the effort I saw him making here to-day.  However, I do not want to go too far into that matter at this stage, because I am prepared to give him a chance, to give him a reasonable length of time in which to make up his mind as to what he intends to do; but I do not think it is very wise to have Deputy Commons and the Parliamentary Secretary coming to his assistance every day in the week as they had to in regard to land division to-day, because it is his policy and not theirs we look forward to.  It is from him we expect the policy, not from Deputy Commons, because Deputy Commons has nothing to do with land division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer spoke of the failure of the previous Government to make provision for new schools.  So far as I understand the position, it is that there is what is known as a manager in charge of each school, and, if a new school is required, the first step is that the manager makes it known to the Department that he wants a new school erected.  That is the procedure which has been followed for a long time past and, whatever Deputy Palmer thinks, an enormous number of new schools were erected by the last Government during their term of office. Dublin Deputies are aware that, in Crumlin, there is one of the finest schools in Europe which was erected by the previous Government, and any Deputy can travel over my constituency and see the amount of work done there.  However, I am not interested in following that Deputy because his statements indicated such a low mentality that one would only be making <Col N="453" /> oneself worse than he is if one were to do so.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest last night to Deputy McQuillan who spoke about the last Government not being prepared to insist on Irish coal being used in Irish factories.  I think he actually referred to the beet factories.  I happen to have intimate knowledge of this matter because I was one of those who went on a deputation to the manager of the Tuam factory in an effort to get them to take Arigna coal.  What I found was that the people in Arigna, instead of sending in coal, had been pushing in stones, with the result that the factory last year had to close down for two hours.  If it had had to remain closed for another two hours it would have been very serious for that industry.</P>
    <P>There are coal miners from Arigna&mdash; if that is the correct term to apply to them&mdash;who have been supplying coal all the time and are still contractors to the factories, but these people are supplying coal with from 20 to 25 per cent. ash and the people who were cut off from supplying coal are people who were supplying stuff which contained from 45 to 65 per cent. ash.  It was stuff which would not burn at all.  Why did it contain so much ash?  Because the good coal was picked out and blackmarketed, and the remainder dumped into the factories, and now we have people who know nothing about the position trying to throw blame on members of the previous Government and trying to blacken them as they have been trying to blacken them&mdash;it is downright blackguardism &mdash; for something for which they are not responsible. Before Deputy McQuillan or any other Deputy decides to refer to these things, he should find out exactly what the position is.  We can then discuss it on that basis.</P>
    <P>We are all anxiously awaiting the fulfilment of the number of promises made by this Fine Gael Government which we now have.  I will be interested and highly delighted if they are able to do away with the means test for old age pensions and if they can bring in their 27/6 old age pension and widows' pension and all the rest.  Everybody on this side of the House will take off their hats to them, if they are able to do <Col N="454" /> that and at the same time reduce taxation by £10,000,000, as promised by the Minister sitting opposite.  I regret that the smiling Deputy in the Clann na Poblachta seats was not allowed to develop his argument on capitalism.</P>

      <P>I want to add a word of protest at any effort that is to be made to cut out hand-won peat.  Deputy Palmer referred to this and I suppose he was just giving us a bit of the speeches he made during the election, when he said you could not get employment on these peat schemes unless you were a member of a Fianna Fáil cumann.  That, of course, is a deliberate and barefaced falsehood and a terrible reflection on the county council engineers throughout the country, who had the job of producing turf and who faced up to a heavy responsibility and made a first-class job of it.</P>

      <P>The last speaker, in accusing us of falsehoods, suggested that we of the Labour Party had been bought by certain promises.  In my first speech in this House this evening, I am anxious to state that we owe no allegiance to anybody but the ordinary working people of this country.  We will accept from Fianna Fáil, from Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan or Independents, any scheme that is in the interest of the ordinary plain people.  In the Estimates, if money is to be provided for the old age pensions, for the blind or the ill, we are in agreement with it, no matter how hard the taxation comes upon the people.  We will do what Deputy Lemass suggested yesterday we would not have the courage to do: when we find in the Civil Service that there are people paid for doing nothing, we in the Labour Party will be quite agreeable that those people be dismissed. We are not afraid to accept the responsibility that comes with taking part in the Government.  If the Minister for Finance can establish economies and, while doing so, run this country in a good and fair way, we of the Labour <Col N="456" /> Party will be proud to be part of that Government.</P>
      <P>I would say this, for the benefit of the people on my left, that in my constituency of Waterford there is a dump of fuel, 23,000 tons of bad turf and 20,000 tons of timber, that would not even be taken away by the people if it were given for nothing.  The State will also have to provide the finances to cart it to the homes of the people.  We in my Party do not believe in spending money to keep people employed in useless employment.  There is work for all the workers of this country&mdash;useful and productive work.  That is all I wish to say this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into this House, I received a few shocks.  My first was when the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;who many years ago had the audacity to state publicly that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed&mdash;became Minister for Finance.  Apparently, his political mission of revenge on those who opposed him then, falls on the men and women of Connemara first and then on the bog workers and on the miners and poor people of this country.  That is a nice state of affairs for my friends on the right to be associated with.  No more turf schemes!  Let us ask the Minister what is going to happen to the 15,000 people who were employed on the turf schemes.  They are the poorest of the poor just as are the people of the Gaeltacht who are denied, or who are going to be denied in the future, a further glass-house scheme to provide them with a meagre existence.  What is going to happen to the people who are producing turf in this country?  It is strange indeed that the first act of political revenge must be against the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps sanity on the part of those who contribute to the Fine Gael Government which is in office now might urge them in their charity perhaps to refrain from voting for this terrible act of vengeance.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not the duty of a Government to provide work for the unemployed.&rdquo; Is that going to be the dictum of the present Government?  It appears to me to be very like it.</P>

      <Col N="457" /> Again, we hear that the men who manned the Bearna Baoil in the dangerous days that are past are now going to be thrown away on the scrap heap.  Is that another act of vengeance on the part of the members of this Fine Gael Government?  Why?  Perhaps, in the words of one of the leaders of Clann na Poblachta, they would like to see the Army scrapped, as then the way would be clear for a dictatorship.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Deputies here who propose to vote for retrenchment in the Army Vote of what the officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Army have been responsible for?  During the troubled period they worked for as long as 20 hours a day to make sure that this country would be safe from invasion.</P>

      <P>Now may I appeal to the Deputies that the victims of this act of vengeance, as I believe it to be, will not be the men who worked on the bog, the men who produced fuel for us when we were in need of it when the country was faced with a fuel famine, nor the men who worked for us when the country was faced with invasion.  Surely it is not the desire of this House that the men who stood in the Bearna Baoil should be the first to be put on the scrap heap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose, a Chinn Chomhairle, to follow Deputies Davern and Killilea up the bypaths of personal criticism which seem to appeal to them so much.  I am not going to take up the time of the House, a Chinn Chomhairle, by a desultory journey from the top to the bottom of these Estimates.  I will be brief, but I would like to make one appeal to the Government.  It is this, that in their policy with regard to the spending of public money a spirit should inform their every act which will take cognisance of the necessity for having regard to the principle that the first duty of a Government is the care of those who are least able to take care of themselves.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that throughout the course of this long debate there was nothing but a passing reference made to an emergency which confronts this country and which confronts in particular the people living in the urban areas to-day.  I refer to the housing conditions under which so many of our people are living.  I represent a constituency in which almost 20,000 human beings are living in conditions unfit for human habitation.  That, I submit, a Chinn Chomhairle, is an emergency and I would make as urgent an appeal as I can to the Government to regard it as an emergency and to approach it as one would an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess to a slight, though perhaps unjustifiable, feeling of disappointment when I heard replies delivered by the responsible Minister to questions on housing couched in the language of officialdom.  I know that it is necessary that replies should be <Col N="459" /> so couched, but those of us who know the situation as it exists in parts of Dublin City, and particularly we on these benches here, feel that there should be a more urgent approach to it and a realisation of the imperativeness of doing something, and doing something immediately, to house the people who are living in condemned tenements in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would appeal as earnestly and as urgently as in me lies to the Government not to overlook that aspect of policy in their expenditure of public money.</P>
    <P>I feel, a Chinn Chomhairle, that if there had been in this discussion a less acrimonious note, a less critical note and less desire displayed than was displayed by Deputies on those benches opposite to score petty debating points, we might perhaps have better served the interests of those who sent us here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that these Estimates were treated with much more interest and speculation than any previous Estimates which were brought before this House.  The people of the various groups that go to form what may possibly be called the Government Party reiterated throughout the whole of the election campaign that they were going drastically to cut down the Budget&mdash;they were going to cut down the cost of living and, at the same time, they were going to improve social and other services.  If these statements had been made by only one or two or perhaps ten people, well, knowing what election speeches are, very much attention would not have been paid to them.  However, every single group now sitting on the opposite benches right throughout the whole election campaign insisted upon and reiterated over and over again that taxation would be cut down, that the cost of living would be cut down, and that social and other services throughout the country would be immensely improved.  In saying that it was possible to do so and that they had a solution to the problem, they were claiming something as difficult as squaring the circle.  Unfortunately, a great number of our people were, apparently, taken in by these statements. They were made so positively, insisted upon so constantly, and repeated so often that very many of the people were deceived into thinking that, after all, there was probably some way of solving that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that some of the Deputies here who are humble enough to admit that they cannot grasp such things as Einstein Theory, quaternions and difficult philosophical or mathematical problems of one sort or another, <Col N="461" /> thought that the people on the opposite benches had some solution for cutting down the cost of living and at the same time improving social services throughout the country.  Now, so far as has been revealed in the debates here, they have no solution whatsoever for that. There is nothing but a complete debunking of the rubbish that was talked from Opposition platforms during the election campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>You have given no indication to the contrary.  Nothing has transpired so far but a complete debunking of all that you claimed during the election period.  The only solution I see put forward by the people on the opposite benches is the Fianna Fáil solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said of the AngloIrish that they became more Irish than the Irish themselves and any Minister of the present Government who has so far spoken has tried to prove himself more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil themselves.  At the end of everything the solution that the people opposite have in their pockets for the problem of cutting down taxation, cutting down the cost of living and at the same time increasing social services throughout the country is the Fianna Fáil solution. To put it mildly I think it is rather mean to disclaim responsibility for the magnitude of the Budget with which we are to be presented.</P>

      <P>After all, there is no compulsion on the Government to carry out what has been planned up to now if they know of a better way of doing things or if they know of any other solution.  I think it is rather mean to hide behind the statement that these things have been imposed upon the present Government.  Remember <Col N="462" /> that the public voted on the assurance that the people opposite had an immediate solution for the difficulties of this country at the present time.  I am not quarrelling with the magnitude of the Estimates presented to us because I do not think that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is any measure at all of the prosperity of the country and I do not think it is any measure of the standard of living in the country. I consider that the comparisons which were made in this House between the size of the Estimates this year and what they were in 1931 or 1932 are merely a waste of time.  What really matters is how the people stand now throughout the country by comparison with how they stood in 1931 and 1932. I maintain that you could have a Budget half the magnitude of the one with which we are to be presented and, at the same time, that the country could be in a state of misery and destitution. That would be quite possible. The real value of the comparison lies between the staple condition of the various classes in this country at the present time and their staple condition in, say, 1931.  That is how to form a judgment.  I was absolutely amazed when I heard Deputy Palmer saying that the farmers were in a prosperous condition during the regime of the Fine Gael Government.  He must have had in mind one of the 100 or 200 big ranchers in this country.  He certainly could not have had in mind, if he knows anything about them at all, just the ordinary mixed farmers of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>When these farmers read the remarks that were passed here, if they appear in print, they certainly will smile.  They will remember the difficulties which they experienced under the first Fine Gael Government. They will remember perfectly well that the great majority of them were indebted to their shopkeepers, that many of them were head over heels in debt and that these shopkeepers were in <Col N="463" /> turn indebted to the banks over several years.  The state of affairs at the end of the Fianna Fáil régime is that most of the farmers are reasonably prosperous. The great majority of them have comfortable bank balances and are no longer in the debt, the difficulty and the danger in which they were placed in the days of the Fine Gael Government.  The same can be said of the shopkeeping section of the community. Indeed amongst all sections, one by one, the comparison is equally striking.  That is the real truth of the matter and shopkeepers, farmers and every class in the community recognise that.</P>
      <P>It was announced yesterday that the Government intends to float a loan.  I wish that loan success, as I am sure all Deputies on this side of the House do, but the chief claim made for success of that loan is that the country is in a sound position.  That came strangely from the lips of a Minister who tried to convince this House, and the country, during debates in this House in recent months, that the country was in a state of ruin by reason of the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Day after day in this House statements tantamount to that were made by the very Minister who stood up here yesterday and said that this loan is being floated and who gave as the principal reason for hopes of its success that the country was in a sound condition.  It is in a sound condition and I only hope it will remain in a sound condition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins, speaking last night, referred to the difficulties confronting the present Government and said that they were great.  So they are.  The first difficulty will be to maintain as good government in this country as was maintained by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>He further stated that the difficulties with which the present Government are confronted arose through the actions of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I do admit that is a problem to a large extent.  If the Fianna Fáil Government had done as <Col N="464" /> little for the various sections of this country as the previous Fine Gael Government had done, things certainly would be easier now for the new Government. If you compare what has been done for the children of the City of Dublin, under the Fianna Fáil regime, with what had previously been done for them in the matter of school accommodation and, above all, in the matter of school meals, you will see at once that the new Government is confronted with a difficulty to keep up that good work and to improve upon it according to their promises throughout the election period.  If we had not given help through home assistance, the provision of free milk, the provision of cheap turf; if we had not set the pace in housing, which we did, and which is certainly a big problem for the new Government to improve upon, things would be easier for the present Government because, if they did anything at all, it would be a step forward&mdash;that is, if we had left things as we found them.  If we had left widows and orphans totally unprovided for, a little help extended in that direction would be an advance.  But remember you are going to cut down taxation, according to your own promises, and at the same time improve on these services.  I hope you will. Nobody in this House would be gladder than I if you can improve on those services rendered by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>Any person who has occupied the position in which the Minister for Finance now finds himself must have a certain sympathy with him in his present plight.  The Minister has to face up to the hard fact that he and those who support him have given to the people who have sent them into <Col N="469" /> this House promises and undertakings which are incompatible with each other, and which it would be impossible for the Government of which he is a member, or any other administration, to fulfil.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who is, I think, the only member of the Administration to intervene in this debate, following the Minister for Finance, pleaded yesterday for time in order that the Fine Gael Government might concoct a policy.  Surely the Party opposite, which was proclaiming that it could, as has already been indicated, reduce taxation, reduce the cost of living and increase the social services, must have outlined in their own minds some procedure whereby all these very desirable objectives were to be attained and should have been able to come to this House, now that they are in office and can do things, and tell us what <Col N="470" /> they propose to do and how they propose to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us, for instance, what they were going to do about the means test; tell us how they were going to give effect, to the Clann na Poblachta policy of providing full employment; tell us how they were going to fulfil the pledge which the Minister for External Affairs had given that they were going to abolish doles and substitute for doles and for subsidies in one form or another useful productive work.  So far from being able to divulge to the country how they were going to do that, they have in fact revealed a policy which is the antithesis of it, a policy which is diametrically opposed to it.  The productive employment which has been given to 15,000 people of this country at the cutting and harvesting of hand-won peat is going to be abolished and, as a substitute for it, we have been told that it is going to become easier to draw the dole.  The qualifying limit for drawing unemployment assistance during the summer months has been raised from a valuation of £2 to a valuation of £4.  How does the Minister for External Affairs who, as a member of the Government, carries collective responsibility with the Minister for Industry and Commerce for that policy, reconcile that with the undertakings which he gave to the people during the course of the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, and those associated with him in this House and whose votes keep him and the Fine Gael Government in office, was one of those who deplored, and I must assume, sincerely deplored, the fact that a very large number of our people, particularly during the period of the war and the emergency, had to emigrate from this country in order to find a livelihood.  How does he sit down at the same council table, sit in the same Cabinet, with the Minister for Agriculture who proclaims that emigration is not such a bad thing after all; that all we have got to do in this country is to encourage parents to produce large families in order that <Col N="471" /> all but one member of them may emigrate?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Speaking at a supper given by the Irish Grassland Association&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;an appropriate society for the Minister for Agriculture to address&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister for Agriculture said: &lsquo;Thanks be to God we have some families of 21 and it is a good farm which maintains a family of 21.  I would rather see the eldest of them marry and produce another 21 children and let the other 20 fare forth into the world wherever their fancy brings them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot abuse the procedure of the House by repeating at length the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  After all, even the Deputies who sit on the Fine Gael Government Benches have to endure him in person often enough and I do not propose to inflict him on the House at secondhand.  I am, however, more concerned&mdash;particularly concerned&mdash;with the Minister for Finance, because I have a great deal of sympathy with a Minister who has to put Estimates before the House, who has no policy to sustain them and who will eventually have to reconcile the irreconcilables and make good the pledges which were given to the people by those Deputies who constitute the majority in this House and who now support him in his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, made a very bad beginning when he issued with the <Col N="473" /> volume of Estimates this intimation, that he cannot accept any responsibility for them.  I think that the Minister in doing that is endeavouring, like many of his colleagues, to delude the people into the belief that he had no other option except to submit these Estimates in their present form to the Dáil.  The Minister knows as well as I do that he could have, even though the volume were with the printers, deleted from it those Estimates, or any one of them with the precise form of which he did not agree.</P>
    <P>The Government took office on the 18th February.  It would have been quite possible at that date to have revised that volume of Estimates and to have deleted from it any single service in respect of which he felt there had been needless extravagance. He could have substituted for the Estimate relating to that service an amended Estimate in whatever form he himself desired.  The Minister is seeking to evade his constitutional responsibilities and I think one of the things we have to fear as the result of the very peculiar manner in which the present Government has been constituted is that we are in for an era of irresponsible government.</P>

We have had the Taoiseach saying that they proposed to take the Dáil into consultation, and he suggested that the policy of the open vote was henceforth going to rule the deliberations of this House.

I suppose it will be under the policy of the open vote that we shall have Deputy Cowan, who is a member, I understand, and was, I think, Minister for Defence designate in the Clann na Poblachta Government which failed to materialise, going into-the Division Lobby in oppositon to his leader, the Minister for External Affairs.

      <P>I asked the permission of the Chair to-day to raise this question on the adjournment in view of the failure of the Minister for Lands to give an answer either on Question No. 18 or the previous question.  I would be prepared to give the Minister plenty of time to announce his policy, if he has a policy, for a migration scheme from the West to the Midlands and generally in connection with the problems that exist in the congested areas, except for some peculiar decisions that we have seen during the last few days from this new Government.  What I and the people from the congested <Col N="477" /> areas are concerned about is that we may find that the Minister has now got to go back on all his previous statements on land policy in this country and that he is simply another leg of the Fine Gael octopus and, as Minister for Lands, cannot give his own views on the land question.</P>

      <P>It is clear, at all events, in view of the decisions of this new Government during the last few days that the people in the West and particularly in the Gaeltacht have reason to watch what is happening.  I noticed with some concern to-day the failure and the refusal of the Minister to reply to Question No. 18.  It was a simple question to answer particularly in view of the various statements the Minister had made both in this House and through the country during the last 18 months. When the Estimate for the Department of Lands was under discussion here in 1945 the Minister who was then in Opposition spoke of the conditions in his own constituency, and said that in Mayo this land question was very serious.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I spoke last year on this Estimate of conditions in Mayo.  I do not want to ask the Minister or the Land Commission to do impossible things, but, at the very least, a much greater effort by the Land Commission is needed than we have seen hitherto. At present it seems that things are no nearer a solution in this respect than ever.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is now the Minister for Lands himself and there is nothing to stop him from giving effect to the <Col N="478" /> views that he expressed both inside and outside this House on a solution for the congestion problem in the West. There is nothing to stop him from indicating to the House and particularly to the people in his own constituency, the amount of land that is available for the relief of congestion in the West, as well as the number of migrants that he can migrate from the West this year unless he is tied by the various bargains that have been entered into behind the scenes between himself and his colleagues, unless his hands and his outlook are tied.  What concerns me about the Minister's failure to answer my question to-day is that, as far as the position of the migrants in the West is concerned, we may find ourselves in the same position. as we are in with the turf scheme.</P>

If the Minister had stated to-day that he did propose to migrate a certain number, however small, from the West I would have been satisfied.  I would not have so much uneasiness if the Minister had given an answer to the question that I put to him to-day as to whether, in <Col N="479" /> order to relieve congestion he was prepared to go ahead with the view that he had expressed to acquire more land in the open market in the West&mdash;to buy land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was prepared to acquire more land in the congested areas of the West the necessity would not then arise to migrate people from the land slums in the West to the Midlands.  The Minister refused to answer either question.  Is there some further bargain to throw the people in the land slums in the West to one side, or, to use a more popular expression heard in this House, to put the land policy, in connection with land slums in the West, in abeyance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister stated in this House that there was no reason why his predecessor should not go ahead full blast with the relief of the congestion problem in the West.  He said that should be done, and that the conditions that obtained during the war did not apply at the time he was speaking.  The position has much improved since then, because I understand all the staff on loan from the Land Commission are now back. Therefore the Minister has got staff and, presumably, he has got plans.  As a matter of fact the Minister, speaking here in the last debate on the Vote for the Department for Lands, said there was sufficient land in Mayo to solve the congestion there.  He further stated that he himself would be able to solve it in one year.  He is now in the saddle, he has the power and the staff, and there is no war to disturb him, but, with all that, he could not tell me to-day, and particularly he could not tell his own constituents, the number of migrants that he proposes to take out <Col N="480" /> of the land slums in the West during this present year.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister if there is any reason for his being so shy in replying to this question.  I want to know whether he wants to leave this question of migration in abeyance.  I also want to know whether he has abandoned his policy of relieving congestion in the West by way of the purchase of land in the open market.  Are there any powers which the Minister requires, if he does want an excuse for going back on his previous solutions of the congestion problem in the West?</P>
    <P>If the Minister was frank, if he would tell me his difficulties, if there are in fact any difficulties, he would be deserving of a certain amount of sympathy. If he finds himself in the position, due to the new line-up, that he is not allowed to go ahead with the policy formerly enunciated by him, I would have a certain amount of sympathy with him.  If he would indicate the limits that have been placed upon him in the Land Commission, if such limits have been so placed, the House and the country would understand the Minister's difficulty; but he assured us previously that it only required an energetic Minister in the Land Commission to remove the dust from the files and that he could solve the whole western problem in one year.</P>
    <P>I want to know, as I am sure the people of Mayo want to know, before the year goes much further, what the Minister proposes to do now that he has power.  There is not much use in the Minister occupying the position of all-powerful Minister for Lands if he is not prepared to indicate, and to indicate now, that he proposes to come to the relief of the congested tenants on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it will be much too late for the people down the West to start saying anything about this matter if they find that the whole policy in connection with the relief of congestion, which has been consistently pursued as a matter of State policy over a number of years, has been reversed, and that the Minister is in the position of being merely the tail of the Fine Gael dog and that in this case it is the dog that wags the tail.  It will be too late <Col N="481" /> for us in the West if we find that this vital problem, which has always been a problem, has been put on the long finger or left in abeyance by the new Government.</P>
    <P>The problem of taking the people from the West is a simple enough problem for the Minister, particularly in view of his statement that it only requires energy to solve it.  I was surprised that the Minister would not say to-day what lands in the Midlands he will earmark for the congested areas of Mayo.  The Minister is personally aware, and has pointed out on many occasions, the great hardship and suffering there are in the congested areas due to that congestion.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more familiar with that problem in the West than the Minister, and, being familiar with that problem and living amongst the people down there, he must surely realise the urgency of dealing with the problem and must realise the uneasiness that will be felt by the people in the West in connection with changes of policy affecting this question of land to which we have heard expression given during the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I know that some of the people now supporting the Minister's Government are against that policy.  I know that there is a very strong element amongst those behind the Minister who do not believe in that policy and who have always opposed it.  That was always so, and I know that the Minister's former colleague, Deputy Cogan, has always fought it in this House, and, as recently as within the last fortnight, asked the new Minister for Agriculture for an assurance that land will not be further interfered with.  It was, therefore, with feelings of further apprehension that I found the Minister to-day not alone refusing to commit himself on this question of migration but refusing to state what steps would be taken in connection with the further acquisition of land in the Midlands.  The Minister was very voluble on this question when he was in Opposition, and, to give him due credit, I think he was sincere in his view that drastic steps should be taken to put an end to the land slum <Col N="482" /> problem, and I want to know now why he is shirking the issue and why he cannot even indicate the very beginnings of a small scheme for taking these unfortunate people from the West.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether he is going to be swayed by the views of his former colleague in Clann na Talmhan, Deputy Cogan, and whether he is to be taken over, lock, stock and barrel, by the conservative element in the Fine Gael Party which now rules him.  If we are to go back to the position which obtained before 1932, when migration was unheard of, we are getting back to a position in which the ranchers of this country, irrespective of the national need, are to be allowed to hold on, without any regard whatever to the desperate state of the congested districts in the West, and the quicker the country realises that the better and the quicker the people in South Mayo in particular realise it the better.  I ask the Minister, having considered the matter now and having considered the implications of his failure to answer these vital questions in regard to migration from the West which I put to him today, to make some statement which will reassure the people in the congested areas in the West that they too have not been sold out by the new coalition Government, of which the Minister is now a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We will hear a little more about the migration policy before we finish, if the Deputy will stay quiet.  The Deputy seems to be very concerned about migration from the West of Ireland now.  If he had exerted half the pressure or given half the <Col N="483" /> assistance to my predecessor in office which he now seems to be devoting to the land question, the problem of congestion, in our constituency particularly and along the western seaboard, would, perhaps, not be as bad as it is to-day.  I wonder what explanation Deputy Moran has to offer for the position, after 16 years in office, in which, out of 2,860 migrants since 1935, only 451 came from the West to the East.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy put a sufficient number of questions while on his feet.  The time is long and he will get plenty of time to put down any questions still troubling him.  I have been Minister for Lands for 16 or 20 days at the outside, yet Deputy Moran wants me to relieve immediately the whole land problem of South Mayo.  The first thing I might draw the Deputy's attention to is that I have other congested counties to consider and congests in any other county must get the same consideration from me as those in my constituency.  Heretofore, I could speak for the constituency of South Mayo.  Now the responsibility of the congests in all other constituencies <Col N="484" /> is mine to take care of, and it is my duty to do my best for them, whether my period in office is long or short.  That is the first thing the Deputy should realise.</P>
      <P>Secondly, during the course of his speech the Deputy asked what the position is now.  I wonder if he will plead ignorance of the fact that there has been a complete close down on land acquisition for a number of years past, particularly in the eastern counties, where there is more suitable land available than in any other part of the country.  The position in the acquisition of land is now that there are only one or two holdings suitable for occupation in the Midlands.  After 16 days' office, does Deputy Moran blame me for that&mdash;or does he blame my predecessor and the Fianna Fáil Government? As a result of the complete and total failure of the last Government to deal with the land problem and their hostility to this question, the Land Commission now has to start anew. Deputy Moran, being a solicitor and having the carriage of sale of land, knows exactly what it is to acquire land, to change over and take possession of it, to build suitable houses on it, to fence it, and finally to choose the correct type of migrant or other person to take over that holding.  There are only two holdings east of the Shannon to-day available, after Fianna Fáil's term of office, yet the Deputy stands up here and expects me to wave a magic wand in the air and provide a solution to the whole thing, after my predecessor in office, and particularly the Fianna Fáil Government, left me an empty bank and an empty shell.</P>
      <P>I want it to sink into Deputy Moran's head that, since 1935, of 2,860 migrants, only 451 came from the most congested areas in this country.  Did Deputy Moran ever use his influence with my predecessor in office to settle this land question?</P>

      <P>Very good, Sir.  I know of no bargaining, but Deputy Moran might be better used to bargaining than I am.  On the Order Paper are two questions &mdash; one from Deputy Hilliard and one from Deputy Moran.

      <P>No matter what Deputy puts down a question to me or asks me to stop migration, or a question that carries that implication, he is not going to get any heed.  The question of congests will receive my first consideration and while I am Minister for Lands I will do all I possibly can to relieve the terrible congestion, which Deputy Moran knows as much about as I do and which I considered in the past and still consider to be a blot on our country.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, 11th March, 1948.</P>
