      <P Just="Center">Period from 1st April, 1922 to 31st March, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Number of schools erected, 182; number of major improvement schemes <Col N="621" /> completed, 315.  Total expenditure by the State on grants for the erection, enlarging and improving of schools, £689,330.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Period from 1st April, 1932 to 31st March, 1947.</P>
    <P>Number of schools erected, 483; number of major improvement schemes completed, 902.  Total expenditure by the State on grants for the erection, enlarging and improvement of schools, £2,649,017.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure given for each of these periods includes not alone the cost of the erection of new schools and of major improvement schemes for existing schools, but also the cost of minor grant works.  I am not in a position to state the cost of new schools and of major improvement schemes only.  The ascertainment of this information would involve a considerable amount of work and expenditure of official time which, I feel, would not be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the position in regard to the application of this State for membership of the United Nations Organisation and what exactly the Government will be committed to, if the application for membership is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to apply for membership of the United Nations Organisation was taken by this House on the 25th July, 1946; this decision was unanimous.  This application is at present awaiting reconsideration by the Security Council in accordance with the terms of a resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 17th November last. This resolution determined that, in the judgment of the assembly, Ireland possesses the qualifications for membership laid down by Article 4 of the United Nations Charter and should, therefore, be admitted to membership; it further requested the Security Council to reconsider Ireland's application in the light of that determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same date the assembly adopted a further resolution requesting the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion as to whether a member of the United Nations is entitled to make its consent to the admission of an applicant State dependent on conditions not laid down in the <Col N="623" /> charter.  I understand that the court hearings in connection with this matter are about to begin.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, the Deputy is, of course, aware that membership of the organisation involves acceptance of the obligations contained in the charter of the United Nations.  Copies of the charter were circulated to all Deputies in November, 1945.  The most far-reaching of these obligations are those obliging members to carry out the decisions of the Security Council with respect to threats to, or breaches of, the international peace which have not been settled by peaceful methods.  It is important to note, however, that such decisions require the concurrence of all the permanent members of the Security Council, namely, the United States, Great Britain, Russia, France and China.  In this connection, I should point out that lack of unanimity amongst the permanent members has, so far, prevented the implementation of Article 43 of the charter, that is, the article requiring each member to conclude an agreement with the council specifying the armed forces and other facilities to be made available to the council for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If Communist Russia and her allies declare war on anti-Communist Spain, will Éire soldiers have to fight and take sides, and, if so, on what side will we be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The time is not opportune for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation, by virtue of Ireland's application for membership of the United Nations Organisation, to take any sides in that eventuality.  The question of what Ireland's attitude would be in the event of a war would be a matter for this House to decide.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state whether an order was placed with a London firm of printers for the supply to his Department of certain postage stamps, and if so the date on which the order was placed, the series and quantity of stamps ordered, the sum involved in the contract and the proportion of the order already executed; further, whether he will state if this is the first instance in a period of 25 years that a foreign firm was commissioned to print Irish postage stamps and also indicate the grounds for this serious departure from the established practice of having all our stamps printed in Dublin, and if he will now consider the cancellation of that portion of the order not already executed.</P>

      <P>An order was placed with a London firm of printers on the 7th November, 1947, for a supply of 3,000,000 3d. and 3,000,000 6d. air mail stamps at a cost of £850 10s. 0d., plus <Col N="628" /> carriage, the Department supplying the paper.  The order has been fully executed.</P>
      <P>This was the first occasion on which a contract for the printing of Irish postage stamps was placed outside this country.  The stamps in question were the first Irish air mail stamps and the decision to have them printed in London was taken, I am informed, so as to ensure that the series would be done by the direct plate process, otherwise known as the &ldquo;Recess&rdquo; process, which was considered capable of giving results beyond the capacity of any plant within the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary business for which the Dairy Disposal Company was established was to acquire creamery premises owned by private individuals or firms and in some instances by co-operative societies, to reorganise the acquired premises into economic units of central creamery and separating stations, and to transfer them at a fair price to the milk suppliers.  The company was also entrusted with the task of providing creameries in districts <Col N="630" /> where there were good milk supplies for the disposal of which existing facilities were inadequate.</P>
      <P>As to when the main part of the Dairy Disposal Company's work will be completed, all I can say at the moment is that I am anxious that transfer of established groups to co-operative societies should take place as soon as possible.  If a majority of the milk suppliers to any particular group forms a satisfactory co-operative society to acquire and operate that group, I hope that a sale could be effected on reasonable terms without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that two Howth fishing crews cannot get a boat from the Sea Fisheries Association while the association has given possession of the <i>Boy Alex,</i> formerly of Kilkeel, to a member of the British Air Force; if he is further aware that this boat will not be used for fishing off the coast of this country, but, while bearing the Dublin identification mark, it is registered to fish from Kilkeel, Ardglass and Isle of Man with a crew of Scotsmen, and if he will have this matter examined with a view to providing a boat and employment for Howth fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Sea Fisheries Association has a considerable waiting list of applicants for fishing boats, including some residents of Howth, the delay in clearing which is due mainly to the difficulty of procuring marine motor engines.  Every effort is being made to solve the supply problem.  I am informed that a boat named <i>Boy Alex</i> has become the subject of a hire purchase agreement between the association and a citizen of the State who proposes to participate personally in fishing operations. This hire purchaser succeeded himself <Col N="631" /> in locating a suitable second-hand vessel at a place outside the State and he provided the substantial sum of £2,000 in cash towards the cost of acquisition. Some delay arose in connection with the transfer of registry as well as in obtaining an allocation of fuel oil, and in the interval no change occurred in the personnel of crew or the port used as a base of operations.  There seems no reason to suppose that this vessel will not henceforth be based on one of our own ports and manned by citizens, but naturally the association has neither the power nor the inclination to interfere with any skipper's discretion in the selection of his own crew.</P>

      <P>Under the existing procedure for the rural improvements scheme, a grant can be made for the repair of any road which connects two county roads, without requiring a contribution from the adjoining landholders, provided that:</P>
      <P>(1) The link is of sufficient importance as a public road; (2) the cost is not excessive in relation to its utility; (3) the work is not one which the county council would otherwise have done out of their own funds; and (4) the county council, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, undertake to maintain the road on completion.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925, prescribes that a road connecting two public roads can only be taken over for maintenance by a county council if it is not less than 11 feet wide in the clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Generally speaking, there is a strong objection to increasing the mileage of roads to be maintained by county councils, for the reason that the amount available from the rates is already barely sufficient, and in many cases less than sufficient, to keep the existing county council roads in a sound condition; and any additions to the mileage to be maintained out of the rates would reduce still further the average level of public road efficiency in the county.</P>

In pursuance of that Act, certain catchment areas have been surveyed with a view to the preparation of comprehensive drainage schemes for the entire catchments and it is expected that works on the first of these schemes to be confirmed under the Act, namely, the Brosna, will commence in June, 1948.  The Act of 1945 does not provide, as did the previous drainage codes, for the initiation of schemes by persons whose lands are affected by flooding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only variation in the price of a commodity having a bearing on the Cost-of-Living Index Number which I authorised during the quarter to the 31st March last was in respect of beef. The increase in that case was equivalent on an average to slightly more than 1d. per lb. above the prices fixed by an Order made on the 8th November, 1947, and the effect on the Cost-of-Living Index Figure was to cause an advance of approximately three-fourths of one point.  In approving of this increase in meat prices, I had regard to a promise made by Deputy Lemass to a deputation representative of victuallers which he received as Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 12th November, 1947.  On that occasion in November, the deputation were informed that, if cattle costs increased, the revision of beef prices would be considered and when I met a similarly constituted deputation on the 15th March last I was reminded of the previous promise as a reason, amongst others, for bringing beef prices into line with the seasonal advance which had occurred in the market price of cattle.  The average price for prime cattle on the Dublin Cattle Market during 1947 was 77/- a cwt. in the first quarter, 102/6 a cwt. in the second quarter, 85/6 a cwt. in the third quarter, and 83/- in the fourth <Col N="654" /> quarter.  The average price during the first quarter of 1948 was 90/3 a cwt. and on the 7th April, 1948, was 106/6 a cwt.</P>
    <P>The average controlled price of beef in the Dublin area at present is 1/10½d. per lb. and, in the rest of the country, is 1/9½d. per lb.  The average price in the Dublin area in February, 1947, was 1/7 per lb., but there is no information about the February, 1947, price in the rest of the country as there was then no price control for meat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I am informed by Aer Lingus that they leased premises in Paris in October, 1946.  The sum of £17,000 was paid in consideration of the granting of the lease.  In addition, an annual rental of £858 is payable.  Furniture and equipment already in the premises were acquired by Aer Lingus <Col N="660" /> for £7,000.  Approximately £5,000 has since been spent on the renovation and conversion of the premises.</P>
      <P>The company had the advice of a Paris estate agent and of others who had experience of conditions in Paris, including another airline which had previously acquired premises there.</P>
      <P>The number of tickets sold in the Paris office to date amounts to 28.  The office is primarily intended for information and publicity purposes and tickets have been sold there only since 1st December, 1947.  Up to the present, the office is granted only a limited allocation of tickets, the bulk of ticket sales in France being effected through Air France, who act as Aer Lingus general agents in that country, and local travel agents.  The local Aer Lingus office assists the various travel agents and supervises the carrying out of the agency agreement by Air France.</P>

      <P>Mr. R. Briscoe, T.D., was informed on 27th February, 1947, <Col N="661" /> that there was no objection to the importation of South African coal. Three cargoes aggregating 26,708 tons of bituminous coal were later imported in the name of Connolly Shaw (Ireland) Ltd.  The total c.i.f. value was about £140,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Order for the consideration of the Seanad amendments to the Local Elections Bill, 1947, be discharged.</P>
      <P>We are advised that this is in accordance with parliamentary procedure. The Local Elections Bill of 1947 is a Bill which has come with two amendments from the Seanad.  The Minister for Local Government has intimated his intention to the House just now of introducing another Bill to supersede the Bill which is the subject of this particular motion.  We are advised that the practice has been, in that state of facts, where there is a Bill pending before the Oireachtas which has not yet become law and where it is intended to pass legislation in any way connected with it, to discharge the Order for dealing with the prior Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perhaps right that I should draw attention to difficulties that would in any event exist and which would probably necessitate the action which has been taken by the Minister for Local <Col N="668" /> Government.  This Local Elections Bill of 1947 was sent by Dáil Éireann to Seanad Éireann on the 4th December, 1947.  From that date, the stated period of 90 days, which is referred to in Article 23 of the Constitution, began to run.  That period of 90 days expired on the 2nd March, 1948.  The Dáil was dissolved on the 12th January of this year and the Bill, with amendments, was passed by Seanad Éireann on the 18th December, 1947.  The reassembly of Dáil Éireann was on the 18th February, 1948, and there was an Order on the 9th March, 1948, that the Seanad amendments be set down for consideration to-day.  On that state of facts, serious difficulties in connection with the interpretation of the Constitution arise.  There are different views held as to the interpretation and as to the effect of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann on the facts to which I have adverted.  I do not think it necessary for me to refer to those differences of opinion but everyone knows, at all events, that the period of 90 days having expired on 2nd March, 1948, the Bill could be automatically killed&mdash;I suppose that would be the expression to use&mdash;or, alternatively, put into limbo.  At all events it would be difficult to know precisely what should be done in the circumstances, having regard to the difficulties of interpretation of the Constitution.  Accordingly, the course was adopted of bringing in another Bill, the First Reading of which has now been granted, and of moving that this Order should be discharged. That will meet the situation far better than trying to square the facts with the constitutional position and the difficulties of interpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government action in regard to this matter seems to be based on the fact that more than 90 days have elapsed without the Bill having been considered by Dáil Éireann.  The only basis for assuming that the Bill has automatically lapsed is that the words &ldquo;within the stated period&rdquo; qualify &ldquo;passed by Seanad Éireann&rdquo; as well as the words &ldquo;with amendments to which Dáil Éireann does not agree&rdquo;.  It seems to me that Article 23 of the Constitution must be <Col N="669" /> construed as providing that all cases that could arise should be dealt with and that a construction, which would mean an omission, should not be favoured.</P>
      <P>The relevant sub-section of Article 23 is sub-section (1) and that sub-section deals with, I think, three cases (a) Bill rejected by the Seanad within the stated period, (b) Bill amended by the Seanad within the stated period in a manner of which the Dáil later disapproves, and (c) Bill in respect of which the Seanad takes no conclusive action&mdash;a Bill which is neither passed nor rejected within the stated period. Surely the Bill which we are now considering falls within that category.  It seems to me that the Dáil is competent to consider a Bill which has come back from the Seanad and to determine whether it is going to agree or disagree with the Seanad in the amendments which have been inserted in the Bill in the other House.  That, it seems to me, would be a more reasonable way to approach this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill went through Dáil Éireann practically without opposition. I think there was only a minor amendment introduced on the Committee Stage, or rather on the Report Stage, to meet a point which had been raised by Deputy Alfred Byrne on the Committee Stage.  The Bill received the unanimous approval of the last Dáil.  In the Seanad the principle of the measure was not challenged.  Two minor amendments were inserted there, neither of them of any substance, amendments which, because they were not of any great substance, did not touch on the principle of the Bill and amendments which it seemed reasonable to accept. These amendments have now come back to Dáil Éireann.  I think it is implicit in the constitutional relationship which exists between the two Houses that a Bill which was passed by this House, and amended in good faith by the Seanad, should be considered by this House in the light of the amendments which have been made by the Seanad.  What is proposed here is to overthrow the whole principle of the Bill, to repeal the Bill really by a sidewind. The measure is a continuing <Col N="670" /> measure and is still in existence and this House is competent to consider it. The amendments are not of substance. The principle of the Bill has been approved by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The motion of the Taoiseach is not, of course, <i>ultra rires</i>, but I am submitting that it is quite outside the general spirit of the Constitution and is not, if I might put it that way, in the temper in which a matter of this sort should be considered by the House. We have had virtual unanimity in both Houses in regard to the Bill.  Why, then, is the Government proposing to kill the Bill in the manner in which it has been suggested we should kill it to-day?  When the Taoiseach was on the Opposition Benches he did not oppose the principle of the measure. None of his Party voted against it.  It was acceptable to them then.  What is the reason for the change?</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is a motion now to the effect that the Order should be discharged, I think I am competent and within the limits of order in discussing the principles of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill was to secure better representation of the people on local authorities, to ensure a closer connection between the representatives of the ratepayers and the districts which they represented.  If the Bill becomes law, as I submit it should, it will adjust the electoral areas, upon which local representation is based, to the resources of the ordinary ratepayer who is ambitious to represent the interests of himself and his neighbours on the local authority. It proposes to replace the existing system&mdash;under which representation on the local authorities is based upon constituencies, some of them even larger than many of the constituencies upon which representation in this House is based&mdash;by areas more suited to the resources of the ordinary individual who seeks election.  Under the existing system it is quite clear that very few people could hope to represent their constituencies on their local authorities unless they are backed by large, powerful and wealthy organisations, or are themselves wealthy men who can undertake the expense of contesting a <Col N="671" /> local election over areas covering in some cases as much as 2,000 square miles of territory.  It is because these electoral areas are much too large, it is because the demands which are now being made upon local representatives are much too exacting that we have witnessed a decline in the standard of representation upon the local authorities, that we have experienced a grave diminution of interest in the activities of these local authorities, and, particularly, a grave diminution of desire to participate in the work of these local authorities and to secure election to them.</P>
    <P>We all of us have had experience here in this House and we have heard it stated from time to time that local government is not what it was.  I believe that one of the reasons why it is not what it was is that unless a person is prepared to devote virtually the whole of his time to looking after the large scattered electoral areas upon which local representation is based to-day, you will not get a representative ratepayer to sit on or to seek election to these local authorities.  If you do, as it was proposed to do in the Bill which is now before the House for consideration again, if you reduce the electoral areas so that they would be convenient in size, so that the man of standing in any particular neighbourhood will not be called upon to devote his special attention to much more than the concerns of his immediate neighbours, while, of course, having regard to the concerns of the county as a whole, then I think you will get a better type of representative in general.  I am not saying that about them all, but you would get a better type of representative in general and a much livelier interest in the affairs of the county council.  Moreover, the people who are ratepayers in the several districts would have a feeling that there was one man who was elected to represent that district to whom they could have resort if they wanted to have the particular interest and concerns of the district attended to and to whom they could appeal and hold responsible for making representations in relation to the particular district in which they reside. <Col N="672" /> Under the present system, you have five, six, seven, and, in some cases, as many as nine people representing very large areas.  Very often you find that these local representatives are concentrated in one particular portion of the area which they represent and that there are people living 20, 30, 40 and, in some cases, even as many as 50 miles away from the nearest county councillor. How can you expect to have any active or intense interest in the election of a local authority so long as that position exists?</P>
    <P>This was the condition of affairs which the Local Elections Bill of 1947 was intended to remedy.  I am not going to say we had found a perfect remedy, but I believe that in the proposals in the Bill we had something which at least was worth a trial.  We have endured and suffered the other system here since 1918, I think&mdash;almost 30 years&mdash; and it has not produced any improvement in the existing local representatives. This Bill was an attempt to deal with that situation.  I put it to the House that, after 30 years of disappointing results under the existing system of election, it would be worth while giving this a trial.  That is all that was involved.  That seemed to be the view of virtually every Party in this House prior to the year 1948.  It was the view of virtually every Party in this House when the Bill, which it is now proposed to drop, was before this House and, as I mentioned, there was only one minor amendment proposed. That was an amendment proposed by me in response to representations made by Deputy Alfred Byrne.  But upon the large principle of the Bill there appeared to be no difference of opinion. There was no difference of opinion in the Seanad either in relation to the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What, therefore, is the explanation for the change?  What is the reason why this Bill is not allowed to pursue what would be the usual course?  When a Bill has been enacted by Dáil Éireann and goes to Seanad Éireann, if it is amended there this House has always done the Seanad the courtesy at least of considering the amendments, either accepting or rejecting them.  When the principle of a Bill has <Col N="673" /> been accepted in both Houses, by the Seanad as well as by this House, never before has it happened that the Second House of the Oireachtas has been so rebuffed as is proposed in this case.  In every case we have said: &ldquo;The Seanad has concurred with Dáil Éireann in the principle of the Bill, the Seanad has accepted the principle of the Bill, and we will do the Seanad at least the courtesy of considering its amendments and asking Dáil Éireann either to accept or reject them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken an unprecedented course in relation to this Bill, a course which I think is contrary to the public interest, a course which I do not believe, bearing in mind the previous history of this Bill in this House, has been willingly adopted by him or by those who support him as members of his own Party.  I do not believe that that course has been willingly adopted by many of the members of the other Parties in this House who support this Government.  Before we proceed to accept the motion which the Taoiseach has proposed to the House I think we are entitled to have from him a categorical justification for the course which he is asking the House to adopt.  As I have said, I think it is contrary to precedent.  I am certain it is contrary to the public interest and I will draw this deduction from the previous history of the Bill in this House: that the Taoiseach and those who are associated with him in the Fine Gael Party are taking this course under coercion.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the principle of the Bill, because that is what is at stake here?  If, in fact, the Taoiseach is not being coerced and those who are associated more particularly with him and his own Party are not being coerced into the course they adopted, then why did they not oppose the principle of the Bill in this House? <Col N="674" /> Why did not those associated with the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad oppose the principle of the Bill there?  They did not do so.  Neither did the members of Clann na Talmhan and neither did the Independents oppose it.  Why are they going to be led into the Lobby to-day to kill this Bill, the principle of which they approved of prior to the year 1948, the principle of which they approved of when it was last before this House?</P>
      <P>I submit that it is contrary, as I have said already, to all precedent.  I think it is not in the public interest.  I think that the principle of this Bill was one which was worth a trial in view of the fact that we all wish, if we can, to revivify the interest of the local people in the operations and activities of their local authorities.  I think this is a measure that, at least, ought to have been given a trial.  The two amendments that were put down in the Seanad were not amendments of any great substance.  If they had been resisted there very strenuously, no doubt they would not have been made. Nobody wants to try to undo now what was done then.  At least we can do the Seanad the courtesy of considering its amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that we should consider the amendments, and should allow the Bill to become law.  It may be, of course, that those people who want to see the local authorities made, if you like, the monopoly of the big political machines will want to oppose this Bill, will want to kill this Bill.  But those who would like to see in the local authorities men of independent views, men who might represent more specifically the interests of their neighbours and of their neighbourhood rather than any political party or principle, will stand for the Bill of 1947, because under that Bill the man who has limited resources, the man who has very little perhaps to commend him to the electorate except the respect of his neighbours, the man who will not have at his disposal the political propaganda which large political organisations have, will have some chance of election. Of course, those who want to continue to have local affairs made the sport and the plaything of Party politics, <Col N="675" /> those who want to see the servants of county councils a dominant factor in local elections, those who want to see the officers of county councils playing a substantial part in local politics, those who want to see machines like the Labour Party machine and others dominate the elections, will, of course, try to kill this Bill; but the people who want to get the local authorities out of politics, the people who want to ensure that the local authorities will concentrate upon what were formerly described as parish-pump politics, which are all important and of abiding concern to the local authorities, will try to carry the Bill of 1947.</P>

      <P>I would like to get a little more information from the Taoiseach concerning the motion which he has submitted to the Dáil.  As I understand it, he is moving to discharge the order of the Dáil for the consideration of the amendments submitted by the Seanad.  What the effect of that motion is, is not clear.  The position, as I understand it, is that the Bill is alive, but that the Government want to kill it.  It is, however, alive at this moment, and it is competent for the Dáil to consider the amendments which were proposed to that Bill in the Seanad.  The Government's difficulty, as I understand it, is that if the Dáil accepts the amendments to the Bill it automatically becomes law.  They want to kill the Bill.  If they reject or refuse to consider the amendments to the Bill, then the Bill remains alive for a period of 180 days after the expiration of the original period of 90 days and then lapses.  If that interpretation of the constitutional position is correct, I think it would be a better device to reject the amendments and refuse to pass the resolution which would bring the Bill into force&mdash;allowing the period of 180 days to pass and the Bill to lapse &mdash;rather than refuse to consider the amendments passed by the Seanad. The refusal to consider the amendments appears to me to be establishing an undesirable precedent, whereas <Col N="676" /> the rejection of the amendments for the stated reason of killing the Bill would not have quite the same consequences.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I understood the Taoiseach's motion correctly, but if I did it is that this Bill should remain in a state of suspended animation, and that after 180 days it would automatically die because of the refusal of the Dáil to consider the Seanad amendments. I think it would be much better to deal with the matter in a positive way, even if that means rejecting the amendments, and then allow the 180 days' period to operate.  I do not think that there is much use in pleading with the Government for the life of the Bill. When the Taoiseach allowed it to pass last year he did not then visualise himself as the leader of a five-Party coalition. We know the Bill has to be killed because it is not possible to work a five-Party coalition arrangement in single member constituencies, and no doubt none of the Parties in the Coalition would agree to an arrangement for the contesting of local elections by coalition candidates as such. Even the holding of local elections at all would put a bit of a strain upon the solidarity of the Coalition and they are therefore being postponed for two years.  These party considerations have decided the fate of the Bill so that there is not much point in putting forward arguments based on its merits.  I rise merely to question the method of execution.  I think a decenter method of execution would be to proceed, as I have said, by formally rejecting the amendments, and then to decline, for the reasons stated by the Taoiseach, to pass the resolution contemplated by Article 23 of the Constitution, thus to let the Bill die.  A refusal to consider the Seanad's amendments would be an undesirable precedent to establish.</P>

      <P>The ex-Minister for Local Government has seized upon this opportunity of making an impassioned, or an artificially impassioned, speech in reference to certain principles dealing with local administration and the amelioration of conditions under Local Government.  Deputy Lemass appears to be more interested in the machinery of executing this particular Bill than he was in the principles embodied in the Local Elections Bill of 1947. Both these ex-Ministers wasted public time&mdash;valuable time&mdash;that we could have had at our disposal in doing far more constructive work for the people than speaking of Party considerations, of the Coalition, of a five-Party Government and all the rest.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, I am speaking for all groups in the House who are supporting me, and no amount of insinuation or the sort of malicious propaganda that these two ex-Ministers indulged in can affect us in the path that we intend to walk.</P>
      <P>The ex-Minister for Local Government made an impassioned speech about the relations between the two Houses and of the rebuff that the Seanad has got from this House.  Both these ex-Ministers appear to have forgotten that there has been a dissolution brought about by the precipitate decision of the last Government, and they are now having the results of that precipitate decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had that precipitate decision not been taken, or had it been postponed for a short time, Deputy MacEntee, as the then Minister for Local Government, would have been enabled to listen to and consider in the last Dáil the amendments sent down from the Seanad.  If there has been any rebuff to the Seanad, that rebuff was given by the previous Government in not taking notice of the situation as it presented itself last Christmas and shortly before the dissolution.  Why, if these principles which are supposed to be embodied in the Bill of 1947 were so sacred and so urgently required in the interests of democracy and the amelioration of the local government machine, did the previous Government not wait, postpone their decision to dissolve the Parliament for a week or two, <Col N="678" /> in order to bring this measure into effective law?  It is difficult to resist any other conclusion than that the time of this House was used and the words of these ex-Minister utilised for the purpose merely of Party propaganda on their own side.  We have no use for that at present.</P>

      <P>This motion was put down after consultation with the experienced officials of the Dáil and Seanad and it is following their advice that this particular method has been adopted.  While I occupy this position, I cannot, in spite of the position I have occupied for some 35 years, give a legal opinion on the Constitution.  I speak, therefore, of what I am advised.  Both the ex-Ministers who have spoken have overlooked the fact that there has been a dissolution and that it is not yet authoritatively known what the effect of a dissolution is on pending legislation in both Houses.  It would appear to be a reasonable inference to be drawn from a dissolution that any Bills or measures which had not been enacted into law before the dissolution die with the Parliament which has been dissolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that this is a view of the position under the Constitution.  I do not know whether it is the correct view or not. There is another view, that, if these amendments had been considered and rejected because of the fact that the 90 days have elapsed, the Seanad <Col N="679" /> cannot again consider the position.  I do not know what is going to happen as regards the President giving his signature.  I do not know where the power is to meet that situation.  These are two of the difficulties, and there are others, that faced us after the dissolution brought about by the previous Government.  In that set of facts, we had to decide what we were to do.  It would not appear clear that the road is open to us to let this measure be brought into law and then, if we wanted to, to repeal it again by a separate measure.  I do not know what the constitutional position is.  Nobody has stated it authoritatively, and, in the absence of any authoritative decision, in the absence of any precedent, this course was adopted in consultation with the expert officials of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee has stated that this course we are adopting is contrary to precedent.  That was an entirely inaccurate statement.  The course we are adopting is without precedent because there is no precedent for the situation with which we found ourselves faced. If Deputy MacEntee wishes to convince the House that this course is contrary to precedent, I ask him to produce the precedent.  We have not been able to find it.  There is no precedent for the position we found ourselves in in connection with this Bill, and we had to adopt whatever course appeared to us to be in the best interests of parliamentary practice and procedure.  This is the course we have adopted.  I do not intend to give any opinion as to whether either of these two views is correct.  Deputy Lemass has produced another view that may or may not be arguable, but, if it is a view which is arguable, it is a third view.  Which of these courses are we to adopt with any security that we are adopting the correct constitutional practice?  This is the course which we have adopted, at all events, and which we recommend to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of any principle embodied in the Bill of 1947.  Both these ex-Ministers have stated that we on this <Col N="680" /> side, or some of us, did not oppose the Bill, and, according to Deputy MacEntee, the Bill went through all stages without opposition and the principle, this wonderful principle he is so eloquent about to-day, was accepted by the previous Dáil.  I think it is a principle which has been well established that subsequent Dáil are in no way bound by any decision of their predecessors; but, leaving that aside, Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee conveniently overlooked entirely the fact that when this Bill came before the previous Dáil on 26th November, 1947, it was then known that there was going to be a dissolution.  So far as I personally was concerned, from that on I took no interest in the Bills that came tumbling down on top of us from November until Christmas.  It was utterly impossible to read these Bills, not to speak of giving them any consideration. That is the reason there was no discussion and no amendments were put down, and, for whatever use he may make of it, the Deputy may have a present of that.  So far as this principle is concerned, if it is such a wonderful principle as the ex-Minister says, I repeat that if he wanted it put on the Statute Book of this country, the previous Government could have waited another week or ten days before fixing the date of the dissolution and have it passed into law.  I ask the House to adopt the procedure outlined here which has been devised as the best course to adopt in a difficult constitutional situation.</P>

It seems to me that there are two cases to be considered, one in which there might be a genuine difficulty.  But, when the intention of a majority is to kill the Bill, it seems to me a much better precedent to establish if the amendments which come from the Seanad be considered by the new Dáil.

The Government can kill the Bill anyhow.  If that is their main purpose, it can be done in the manner I have suggested; but, if we accept the theory that we are entitled to consider the amendments, it will be the better precedent to establish. Without raising controversial issues, may I say that the previous Government was entitled to assume from the manner in which the Local Elections Bill, 1947, was considered in the Dáil that it was a non-controversial measure and that its consideration by the Dáil would not be prejudiced no matter what the outcome of the general election might be?  It may be that other occasions will arise where non-controversial Bills will be with the Seanad during a dissolution and it would be a better plan that these Bills should be completed by the new Government if <Col N="682" /> they wanted to complete them rather than to assume that the Constitution debars that consideration by the new Dáil and to put the obligation on the Government to re-enact them completely if they want to put them into force.  I suggest that if that is a precedent it is a wrong one and that the Government could get the same result and establish a better precedent by formally rejecting the amendments and then declining to pass the resolution contemplated by Article 23 of the Constitution.</P>

    <Title>Summer Time Order, 1948&mdash;Motion for Approval.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Justice (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that Dáil Éireann approves of the Summer Time Order, 1948, made by me under the Summer Time Act, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of summer time, which is <Col N="685" /> at present fixed by the Summer Time Order, 1926, is due to expire on Sunday, the 3rd October.  The new Order proposes that the period should be extended this year to Sunday, the 31st of October.  In accordance with Section 3 of the Summer Time Act, 1925, the Order will not come into operation unless it is approved by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, an Order was made in February of this year providing for the introduction of summer time in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 14th March and its extension to the 31st October. When this became known, I considered the position, and I recommended to the Government that a similar Order should not be made here.  As a result, however, of representations made to me subsequently by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Great Northern Railway Company and other bodies, I decided to make an Order providing for the extension to the 31st of October and I now put the Order to the House for consideration.</P>
    <P>It will, I think, be obvious to everyone that there is an advantage in our time being synchronised with the time observed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  When the Summer Time Act, 1925, was passed, power was given to the Minister for Justice to vary the period of summer time, for the sole purpose of enabling our period of summer time to be synchronised with the British period, which had not been definitely settled at the time of the passing of our 1925 Act.  The Summer Time Order, 1926, was made for this purpose, and up to the war our period of summer time was always the same as in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The post office, transport organisations and the public generally benefit from synchronisation.  The Great Northern Railway Company, whose lines cross the Border at several points, find it very difficult to provide adequate local connections when there is a difference between the times observed here and in Northern Ireland. There is also, of course, the necessity for special time-tables for a short period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> I expect, however, that there will be differences of opinion in regard to the desirability of the extension, and I consider that the question is one on which every Deputy should act on his own responsibility.  Accordingly, with the approval of the Government, I propose that the matter should be left to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to do the Minister for Justice any injustice but I am not quite certain that I heard him correctly or, if I heard him correctly, that I quite apprehended the meaning which he intended to convey. I gather from his remarks that, having considered this matter, he was definitely of opinion that it was not in the general interest that an Order should be made making our time conform to the British summer time.  For that reason, he recommended to the Government that an Order, which hitherto it had been usual to make, should not be made this year.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking&mdash;I want to be quite fair to him and want to be fair also to myself and I do not want to be charged with misrepresenting him&mdash;there was quite a din coming from the lobbies and therefore I had some difficulty in hearing quite clearly what the Minister said.  I have stated what I understood him to say, that in his considered opinion prior to the 14th March of this year, it was not in the general interest of this State that the Order which it had been customary to make in regard to summer time should be made; but that, subsequently, representations were made to him, either by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce or by the Associated Chambers of Commerce&mdash;I did not quite catch what he said&mdash;and by the Great Northern Railway Company and, as a result of those representations, he changed his views, or at least the Government, having considered the representations made to him and made, perhaps, through him to the Government, decided that the policy which the Government had adopted should be reconsidered and reversed and that an Order assimilating our time here to British summer time should be made in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> I think that puts the Dáil in a rather extraordinary position, for two reasons. First of all, we have the Minister for Justice saying that he is making this Order against his better judgment, but in deference to the wishes of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and of a railway system a very large part of which operates outside the territory now under the jurisdiction of this State.  I think that no Minister should come to the House and submit anything to it which is contrary to his good judgment.  It is essential to our constitutional position that no Minister should present to the House anything which he himself does not firmly believe to be in the public interest.  I do not want to be personal to the present Minister.  I assume that he did not realise what was implicit in what he said.  I think that the first requirement of a Minister under our Constitution is that, when he comes to the House with a proposal, the mere fact that he introduces it is a guarantee that, in his considered wisdom and opinion, it is the best course for the Government and the State to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not in the same position which some Deputies have thought themselves able to take up in this House, of saying that because of Party Whips and one thing and another they were compelled to vote against their convictions.  The Minister must be firmly convinced that the course which he proposes or submits to the House is a proposal which is in the public interest. If he is faced with a proposal which he thinks is not in the public interest then I think he ought not submit it.  I do not want to be unfair to the Minister and do not want to take advantage of him, but this constitutional point should be stated very firmly.  I do not think he should remain a member of an administration which imposes upon him an obligation of submitting to Dáil Éireann some proposal in which he does not believe.</P>
    <P>A Minister who is in the Government and who is not immediately and personally responsible to Dáil Éireann for a proposal which he puts before that body is in a rather different position, <Col N="688" /> because he need not have brought, and perhaps he is not called upon to bring, to the consideration of proposals submitted by his colleagues the same careful judgment and detailed consideration as he is bound to bring to those proposals which he submits to the Dáil and for which he makes himself in a particular way personally responsible. A Minister can acquiesce in proposals of his colleagues which he has not fully sifted for himself, but it is a very different matter when a Minister is presumed to have considered proposals and to have come to a certain conclusion about them&mdash;an adverse conclusion in regard to them&mdash;it is a very different matter for that Minister to submit them to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The next point we ought to consider is this.  It has been urged here in this House several times that proposals to synchronise our time here, during particular periods of the year, with the British time are not in the best interests of the agricultural community.  I have never myself been convinced that there is very much in that.  Perhaps that is because I have a city man's point of view.  I approach this problem of summer-time very largely from the point of view of those who have to dwell in the cities and who, because of that, have not the same opportunities for fresh air and out-door relaxation as people who dwell in rural areas have.  Therefore, like most city people, I am predisposed to regard the introduction of the expedient of making us all get up an hour earlier during the summer months, from the city and urban dwellers' point of view, as being a beneficial one and to support it generally.</P>
    <P>I make no concealment of the fact that I am not opposing in principle the proposal which the Minister has introduced, but my position is not the position of many members on both sides of this House.  There are members of the Farmers' Party, there are Deputies who claim to represent the farmers and the rural population, and they will probably approach this from the point of view of their own particular peculiar interest as agriculturists.  If they do so, what is going to be the position? <Col N="689" /> Surely the Government, in deciding that this matter should be submitted to the House, must have come to a corporate decision in relation to it? After all, if the Government have decided that the Minister's previous recommendation should be overthrown and that Dáil Éireann should be asked to approve of the Order which he has made, they must have come to that decision on the basis that it was in the public interest, that it was in the interests of the community as a whole that this particular step should be taken.  Surely every member of the Government must share in the responsibility for that decision.  Otherwise, what happens to the doctrine of collective responsibility?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this matter is going to be left to a free vote of the House.  Does that mean that the Government is not going to vote on this matter as a unit?  Is the Minister for Lands, say, going to go into a different Lobby from that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education? If so, then I think the Constitution is in a fair way of being violated. The Constitution prescribes that the Government shall be bound by this principle of collective responsibility. That means that the Government must act in unison and concord in public and in private.  There cannot be any evasion of that constitutional principle. There would be that evasion if the Minister for Lands and, say, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is a colleague of his in the Clann na Talmhan Party, were to go into a different Lobby from that which would be entered by the Minister for Justice, who is putting this proposal before the House.</P>
    <P>I am assuming in that connection that, since the Minister for Justice has submitted the proposal and has signed the Order, he will vote to uphold his own signature.  If, however, the Minister for Lands votes for the Minister for Justice, are we to assume that the Minister for Lands now believes&mdash; because he did not always&mdash;that it is in the interests of the rural population that our time should be assimilated to <Col N="690" /> British summer time?  If so, it would be interesting to know what argument the Minister for Justice adduced or, since it was not the Minister for Justice, as he was convinced of a contrary course, what arguments other members of the Government adduced in order to convert the Minister for Lands to the point of view which is expressed in the Order which the Minister for Justice has made.</P>
    <P>We are told this whole Government is an experiment.  I hope the experiment of what is euphoniously known as an inter-Party Government will not result in a violation of what is a fundamental principle of the Constitution. Whether this will be left to a free vote of the House or not, one assumes that at least the Government will go into the Division Lobby as a unit, as a corporate authority, responsible collectively for the general administration of the affairs of this State.</P>
    <P>But perhaps another consideration arises here in this connection.  Whips are put on not to coerce men to vote against their will, but to indicate to the members of Dáil Éireann, and particularly those who are accustomed to support the Government Party, what the Government's considered view is in relation to any proposal.  The reason, of course, for that is perfectly obvious. The Minister for Agriculture seems to find this somewhat laughable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption is that where matters affecting the general population are submitted to this House, the Government has, first of all, carefully considered those matters in all their implications and, by reason of the careful, deep and searching consideration which they have given to them the Government are presumed to be in a position to give leadership and guidance to the other members of Dáil Éireann who have not had the opportunities for consideration which members of the Government have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are presumed to have examined these matters fully and <Col N="691" /> in great detail and to have come to decisions which are well founded.  It is also well known that members of various Parties who are not in the Government, whether they be in the Opposition or in the Government benches, are not in the same position as are members of the Government to examine these things fully.  They have to be content to take their views and their opinions upon these matters at second hand if they are to come to sound decisions, because they have not had the opportunity and the facilities which are available to the Government in order to weigh these issues.  It is for that reason we have this institution of Party Whips.</P>
    <P>When the Party Whips are put on it is a clear indication to every member that the matter has been carefully considered by the Government.  That is why the Party Whip is there&mdash;not to drive people into the Division Lobbies against their better judgment, but to indicate to members that the matter has been carefully considered by the Government and the Government are satisfied that the decision they have taken is one which should be adopted in the public interest by every Deputy.</P>
    <P>Our approach, however, to this question of whether the Whips will be put on or not will be conditioned by the confidence we have in the Government of the day.</P>

The Minister ought at least to say that the Government has carefully considered all the implications of the proposal and has come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the people and the State.  Having come to that conclusion and, being firmly rooted in that faith, the Government should stand or fall by that decision and should not try, as the Minister for Justice does on this occasion, to shuffle out of his responsibilities.  That is why I think the decision taken by the Minister in this regard is a wrong decision.

      <P>I understand I am not entitled to discuss this matter in general terms under your ruling.  I think, however, I am entitled to submit that this is a motion which some people would accept with reluctance. Some will vote for it, others may vote against it.  Some, as I have said, will accept it with reluctance.  Surely, I am entitled to say that in a matter of this comprehensive character where a Minister submits such a far-reaching proposal to the House the Government and the Minister ought to stand or fall by it and, whatever else they do, they should not leave it to a free vote.  They should say: &ldquo;The Whips are on; we have raised our standard in this matter; we feel it is in the best interests of the people that this Order should be made and confirmed by Dáil Éireann and if Dáil Éireann in its wisdom wishes to differ from the conclusion to which we have come, we will not accept that decision because we do not think that it is in the interests of the people; therefore, we will put ourselves unreservedly in the hands either of Dáil Éireann or of the country&rdquo;.

      <P>That was a silly and disedifying timewasting performance, but I subscribe to the doctrine laid down by Deputy MacEntee.  So long as he is a Deputy of this House, it does not matter how silly he is, he has a right to be heard, and it is no matter for derision that any person should be an ex-Minister of State in this country.  I would sooner be an ex-Minister in Ireland than a Minister in any other Government in the world.  In so far as he is that, he is entitled to the respect of his fellow-countrymen as any man who has attained that distinction in this country is so entitled.  But when I hear Deputy MacEntee throwing cartwheels up and down Dáil Éireann along the lines he chose to follow to-day, instead of becoming annoyed I become amused. He has always been a silly man, and, thank God, he has the right and always will have, please God, so long as he is in this House, to be just as silly as he wants to be.  He has always been a brazen man, but he continually amazes me by the grades of brazenness that he can reveal.</P>

We are told that the matter of extending summer time from the 3rd to the 31st October is a proposal comprehensive and far-reaching down to the very foundations of the Constitution. As compared with that, membership of Dáil Éireann does not matter a straw because our free division shortly before the last Parliament ended related to the question of what group of our people would elect a Deputy to this House.  The highest privilege that citizens of this country could have was what was to be determined&mdash;was it to be voters in Wexford or voters in Mayo&mdash;and Deputy MacEntee was the Minister responsible for the whole process of our distribution.  He had spent months with the best experts in the country re-casting the constituencies all over Ireland to preserve the fundamental principle in any sound democracy, namely, that parliamentary representation would be proportionate to the numbers of voters in that constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame him.  In his position I also would want a cup of tea.  I am often told that one of the most distressing features of the post civil war period in the United States of America, in the 1860's, was that the coloured people after they had been released from slavery not infrequently were the first to protest if they were witness to a master saying &ldquo;please&rdquo; to his servant, and would cry out against the scandal that the master <Col N="699" /> should say &ldquo;please&rdquo; to his servant and not follow his usual course of reaching for the whip.  To me there is something pathetic in Deputy MacEntee's exhortation to the Minister for Justice to reach for his whip. &ldquo;Flog them into the Lobby as we used to do.  What is this new doctrine of asking men to vote according to their consciences?  Tut tut, tut tut.&rdquo;  Is this a deliberative assembly?  Is it criminal or unconstitutional to ask the Deputies of this House to determine any question?  Is there anything disedifying in saying that the material difference that it can make to anybody in this State as to whether summer time ends on the 3rd October or the 31st October is not fundamental?  Certain sections of the community may feel very strongly about it owing to their peculiar and special interests.  Others may feel strongly about it in another sense, and, in all probability, in the middle stand the vast majority of the citizens who do not take any strong view one way or another.  Well, here are their representatives.  The Minister for Justice, I think with commendable prudence and setting what I dare to describe as a most desirable example, comes to Dáil Éireann.  We have nearly forgotten that such a thing was impossible because, if I may use the new title of the distinguished Leader of the Opposition, &ldquo;the boy from Manhattan&rdquo; that made good abroad, he did not believe in that kind of thing.  If you were a member of his Party, you did what he liked and liked it.</P>

They will not be sent for and interviewed by our hierarchy, growing more and more terrifying as they go up.  Nothing will happen at <Col N="700" /> all.

      <P>We are trying to reeducate the Deputy back into that approach.  It will take time but we will be patient.  Therefore, I strongly press my associates on this side of the House to be a little patient with members of the Party opposite.  Freedom is heady wine for those who have been long immured in the prison of Fianna Fáil.  It intrigues me how infectious the follies of Fianna Fáil can become.  It was none the less pleasantly nostalgic to hear Deputy MacEntee, drawing himself up to the full height of his capacity, saying: &ldquo;We are menaced by doom if we have a free vote in this matter&rdquo;.  Is it unparliamentary, Sir, to make the same reply to that threat in this House as it was my privilege to make in the country: &ldquo;Doom be damned&rdquo;.  There is no danger in acting as free men in this country, thanks be to God.  And let us at least conclude on this co-operative note&mdash;that whatever the remote past history of this country may have to tell, the fact that it is possible to say to-day that this is a free country and we are free men and free to vote the way we think we ought to vote is a proud claim for which no individual Deputy in this House can claim the credit but for which all of us who have taken some part in the public life of Ireland for the past 25 years can claim some credit, however small the individual share may be.  It is the exercise of that freedom which should exhilarate us now rather than make us tremble as Deputy MacEntee appeared to tremble under the awful doom of being free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  I have only to add a few words then.  Thank God the day has arrived in this assembly when the vicious system that prevailed here, practically since the inception of the Oireachtas, has been abolished.  We come here as the elected representatives of the people and we are entitled, by virtue of the confidence reposed in us, to do what we think is best in the interests of our constituents.  I am sure everybody will appreciate the gesture of the Minister for Justice in allowing a free vote of the House.  In a way, that is only in keeping with the statement of the Taoiseach that, as far as the Whips were concerned, for the future everybody would be entitled to his own opinion and to express his own views on any Bills brought before this assembly.  He said that every Deputy could vote according to the dictates of his own conscience.  I hope, Sir, that we shall have many more votes of that kind in this House.  If we have, we shall have better administration and less victimisation and the people will be delighted with the revolutionary change that has come about in the procedure of this House.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would advise the Deputy to examine his own conscience with regard to what is the free right of the Irish people.  He was one man who deprived them of it and now he is concerned that if the Whips are taken off, the Constitution will be violated. The Constitution of this country is there, established by the free vote of the people, and we shall carry on and arrive at whatever decision we think best by a free vote in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion we are discussing the awful subject of time but the awfulness of that subject did not deter the ex-Minister for Local Government <Col N="702" /> from wasting a considerable amount of the time of this House in denouncing the principle of a free vote. I am glad that that principle is now accepted by the Government, that it will be a guiding principle in this, the Thirteenth Dáil, and that this Dáil will be what its predecessors have not been in reality.  It will be a deliberative assembly in which each member of the House will exercise his freedom to make his decisions on questions of importance as they arise.  That is a question which has hardly been touched upon up to the present.</P>
      <P>I have never been able to accept the suggestion that it is absolutely essential that our time here should coincide with the time kept in the neighbouring State.  In other years, as we all know, there was a differentiation between the time observed here and in Great Britain and everything went on quite normally, notwithstanding that differentiation.  Even for the last couple of years, there was a difference of an hour between the time observed here and in Great Britain and yet that did not in any way interfere with rail services, shipping services or air services. The question we have now to decide is whether this adoption of summer time is a benefit to our people or not.  I am of the opinion that it is no benefit whatever. We are mainly an agricultural country.  We are mainly a people who depend for our existence upon nature, upon the time the sun rises and the time the sun sets.  Because of that, I think we should keep as close to nature as possible and as close to the time dictated to us by the rising and the setting of the sun.  We all know that there is very little that farmers can do with hay in the early hours of the morning or in the late hours of the evening. These are facts which no legislation and no Government Orders can alter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know in addition, and it is a very important matter, that the rural community do not recognise official time to any great extent.  They ignore it to a very great extent but this ignoring of official time creates a difficulty and hardship which is that in many rural areas children are compelled to attend school according to the legal time, notwithstanding the fact that it is ignored <Col N="703" /> in their homes.  That means that the children have got to rise an hour earlier than they should be expected to rise having regard to the hours kept in their houses.  That constitutes a hardship in rural areas, an unnecessary hardship. There are very many other difficulties created by co-ordinating our time with that of Great Britain.  I think we should stand in this matter on our own and that we should accept the time dictated by the rising and the setting of the sun.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has established a new precedent in giving Deputies an opportunity to decide the matter for themselves according to their own wishes.  I raised this matter on several occasions while Deputy MacEntee was a member of the Government without receiving any favourable hearing.  We have now, however, a Government that is prepared to give a favourable and a reasonable hearing to every matter that is raised in a reasonable way.  It is a pity that Deputy MacEntee should have intervened in what could have been an interesting and constructive discussion like a cracked gramophone record, and repeat over and over again the awful calamities that would befall this country if the Party Whips were not put on for every matter that came before the House.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies who succeeded in getting elected to this House have at least come to the use of reason and are capable of making decisions for themselves. They do not require to be shepherded into the Division Lobby as Fianna Fáil Deputies were shepherded when that Party was in power by nurses in the shape of Party Whips. Therefore, I recommend that Deputies should not favour this motion.  This is an agricultural country.  Then let us give agriculture priority in settling matters of this kind.  If we do, we will adhere to the laws of nature and to the time set for us by the rising and setting of the sun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised a point here that may have far-reaching consequences.  If the Government from time to time are not prepared to stand over something that they <Col N="704" /> do, all they have to do is to have a free vote of the House.  I submit that that is a very nice way out for the inter-Party Government to take.  I submit that every good solid Government, whether in this country or in any other country, when it takes a decision should be backed by the Party that is supporting it.  A free vote of the House may be all right in small cases like this, but it may have far-reaching consequences when other legislation comes up from time to time.  I should like to say in answer to the last speaker that the Fianna Fáil Party were never pushed into the Division Lobby at any time. We are a democratic Party and each Deputy could express his views how and when he wished.  We discussed matters before we came in.  We had to support our Ministers and we were loyal enough to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to Deputy de Valera as &ldquo;the boy from Manhattan.&rdquo;  It would have been a very bad day for this country if that boy from Manhattan had not come to this country.  At least he has contributed more to this country than the Minister for Agriculture will ever contribute or can ever hope to contribute. When the Minister for Agriculture wanted to involve this country in the war the boy from Manhattan was there to answer on behalf of the Irish people together with the other Parties in this House.  I am sorry to have to deal with personalities but, when these things are referred to, we have to answer them.  When the Fianna Fáil Government was in office and a decision was taken by any of the Ministers, they were manly enough to suggest to us, after debating the matter in our own private counsels, that we should support them.  As I say, this is a very fine way out for this inter-Party Government.  It is going to give them a wonderful opportunity at all times of saving themselves from a critical position.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple matter.  It is a question as to whether we will extend summer time in this country beyond the existing legal period.  Summer time will come into force in a few days and, ordinarily, would end on the 3rd of October. This Order simply extends that time from the 3rd to the 31st day of October.  The Minister for Justice is satisfied, after having heard representations from various people, that it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was exactly five days in office.  If the ex-Minister had given me the opportunity a few months earlier I would have been able to give the matter further consideration, but, unfortunately, the ex-Minister and the country chose the time to put us in and I had to do the best I could.  I sympathise with the ex-Minister in his difficulties.  I have them now anyhow. As I say, this is a very simple matter. I shall be quite candid.  The situation was this: Deputy MacEoin, as a country Deputy, was opposed to summer time, but as Minister for Justice he had to correct his views and to take the public interest as the supreme test.  I am asking Deputies to accept my view.  The Government subscribe to that view without any question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,021,640 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of <Col N="709" /> payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; for certain expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>In moving this Vote, I think that, at the very earliest point, it is necessary to explain to the Dáil that that sum is the balance of the amount contained in the Book of Estimates.  The Book of Estimates contained a figure for the proposed Army expenditure for this year of some £4,600,000.  I do not propose to spend that amount of money. The Estimates have been gone through very thoroughly and exhaustively, and have been revised, and I propose to reduce that sum by a figure of approximately three-quarters of a million pounds&mdash;by £744,282.  For the benefit of Deputies, I propose to read out after each sub-head in the Estimate the amount of reduction proposed or decided on, and I have circulated some sheets with the figures on them for the convenience of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head A&mdash;Pay of Members of the Defence Forces&mdash;the reduction proposed is £71,522; under sub-head C &mdash;Pay of Civilians&mdash;£50,000; under sub-head D&mdash;Chaplains&mdash;£876; under sub-head E&mdash;Medical Corps&mdash;£2,000; under sub-head F&mdash;Medicines&mdash;£946; under sub-head H&mdash;Transport of Troops&mdash;£3,000; under sub-head J&mdash; Transport generally&mdash;£38,000; under sub-head K&mdash;Allowances in lieu&mdash; £68,015; under sub-head L&mdash;Petrol, Oil, etc.&mdash;£3,400; under sub-head M&mdash; Clothing and Equipment&mdash;£11,260; under sub-head N&mdash;Animals&mdash;£3,000; under sub-head O&mdash;General Stores&mdash; £35,993; under sub-head P&mdash;Warlike Stores&mdash;£63,641; under sub-head P (2) &mdash;Navy&mdash;£44,620; under sub-head Q&mdash;<Col N="710" /> Engineers' Stores&mdash;£7,750; under sub-head R&mdash;Fuel, Light, etc.&mdash;£16,513; under sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Works and Maintenance&mdash;£6,680; under sub-head S (2)&mdash;Construction Corps&mdash;£23,518; under sub-head V&mdash;Barrack Services&mdash; £13,000; under sub-head W&mdash;Insurance, £4,494; under sub-head Y&mdash; Minister's Office, £17,110; under sub-head Y (2)&mdash;the Reserve&mdash;£200,228; under sub-head Y (3)&mdash;Second Line Reserve&mdash;£3,226&mdash;making a total saving of £744,282.</P>
    <P>To put that more briefly, for the assistance of Deputies who may not have the Book of Estimates with them, those savings, amounting to £744,282, fall under six headings.  Under the heading of Allowances and Maintenance of the Permanent Forces, there is a saving of £186,316; under the heading Pay Allowances, Maintenance Grants to Reserve and Construction, the saving will be £226,972; under the heading, Pay and Allowances of Civilians, the saving is £67,110; under the heading of Warlike Stores the saving is £94,141; under the heading of Ordinary Stores the saving is £167,945, and under the heading of Incidentals the saving is £1,800, making a total of £744,282.</P>
    <P>It would have suited me as Minister in charge of the Defence Forces not to have taken this Estimate so very early in the year, but in the interests of the members of the Defence Forces and of the general stability of those forces, I have found that my hand has been forced to a very considerable and entirely undesirable extent by the prevalence of rumours&mdash;of a vastly disturbing kind of rumour&mdash;appearing in a number of English papers, rumours circulating through some Irish papers. The Department of Defence in peace time is not an organisation controlled by any secret society.  Any information that it is in the public interest to give will always be, and is always, freely given to the public by that Department. Many responsible newspapers circulating in this country on hearing the rumours that were going round, communicated with the Minister or with the Department in order to find out to what extent, if any, there was <Col N="711" /> any truth in them, and they were told without any evasion exactly what the position was, what decisions have been taken and what things were under consideration. Others did not behave with the same degree of responsibility and rumours circulated and were taken up by one and carried to another with the result that there was a serious wave of uneasiness, anxiety and unrest in very, very many units of the Defence Forces in this country.  I think that most Deputies would agree with me that in normal times, but particularly in abnormal times, it is very far from being in the national interest to create anything in the way of uneasiness or unrest in the minds of members of the Defence Forces.  We must remember that the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, as the case may be, is the career of those officers, N.C.O.s and men, that to a great extent their wives and families are dependent on the successful career of the husband or father and that these rumours create a degree of undesirable uneasiness and anxiety in very, very many homes up and down the country.  It was because of that that I have asked permission to take the Army Estimate at this early date.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies throw their minds back over the types of rumours that have been circulating within the past two months they will find that there was scarcely a unit in the Army that was not to be completely wiped out and liquidated because of the new Government taking up its position on these benches&mdash;the Army School of Equitation, the Construction Corps, the Navy, the body compiling the history of the period, et cetera, et cetera.  As I said, anybody who made the inquiry got an answer and a truthful answer. There is not, and there never was any intention of disturbing the position of any officer, or any non-commissioned officer or of any single member of the Defence Force through the change of Government or through a change of policy.  Everybody from the Chief of Staff down to the youngest recruit on the uniformed side of the Army and everybody from the secretary down to the youngest clerk on the civilian side occupies exactly the same position to-day <Col N="712" /> as he did before the change of Government.  I think that was a wise decision because if people trained in the services cannot be trusted, then nobody can be trusted and I am prepared to trust everybody, whether in uniform or out of uniform who has given service within those forces or that Department to my predecessor.</P>
    <P>I know that the proposed reductions will be criticised on the grounds that this is not the time to reduce the strength of the Army, that there are war clouds still in Europe and that we should maintain our fighting efficiency at the very highest pitch.  I can understand that point of view, but I am also entitled to adopt the attitude that we can suffer from an overdose of jitters or war nerves.  There are too many people, in this country and elsewhere, that read, as it were, a shower into every shadow, a cloudburst into every cloud.  Modern war has become a matter of total war.  If a small island country such as ours is to make ample provision in advance for a possible war in the near or distant future, we must bear in mind that the military front is only one front in modern war.  The other fronts are the economic front and the supply front.  Industrial and agricultural production in advance of war are just as important as men and armaments. The wisest course, if we are to have anything in the nature of an outbreak that may in time involve or affect this country, is to have in the interval the maximum degree of production.  We have to remember that every man knocking sparks out of a barrack square is one less man in production and a thousand extra men marching and counter-marching in any barrack square in this or any other country is the productivity of a thousand men lost to the people.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter. Military outlook has become, and must become, an outlook ranging far and beyond the four walls of every barrack. Every Chief of Staff in every threatened country is as anxious about the health of the people in that country as he is about the number of soldiers that he counts any morning in the barrack square.  Anti-tuberculosis <Col N="713" /> campaigns elsewhere, school medical inspection elsewhere&mdash;how did they originate?  Did they originate with the health authorities, either in Europe or Britain?  The whole scheme of anti-tuberculosis and the whole scheme of school medical inspection emanated from the general staffs of countries that were perturbed by the low standard of the people going into their army and the high percentage of those who had to be rejected on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>When we apply that standard to our own people, we have a higher percentage, unfortunately, of medically unfit for Army life than most other countries. We have a people more extensively ravaged by tuberculosis than most and we have appalling housing conditions. We have such a scale of social services that barely keep the people above the destitution level.  In the light of that set of circumstances we have a demand on the cover page of this Book of Estimates for £16,000,000 more than was asked for this time last year.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the problems that really matter militarily, we have to get a sound health foundation.  If anything like that sum is to be found, we must, as far as possible, save money in one direction so as to spend it in another.  We must spend every £ collected from the people in the spirit of people determined to get 20/- worth of value for every £ spent and to ensure that every £ spent is spent in an essential direction, that it is necessary to spend that £ and that it is spent in a businesslike manner, after sound and thorough investigation of all the circumstances demanding its expenditure.</P>
    <P>It was in that particular spirit that the reduction in the Army Estimates was effected and I am glad to say that the proposed reductions which I have outlined in the Dáil were the proposals of the general staff and there is not a single reduction there imposed on them by me.  What was put to them by me was the general picture of the national situation and the desire and determination of the Government to effect sound economies everywhere that economies could be effected and then <Col N="714" /> I asked for their proposals.  Their proposals are the proposals I have read out in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general policy of the Army, there is no change in the general policy.  There is no change in the general organisation.  There is no change in the paper establishment.  The only change with regard to the internal policy of the Army is the abandonment of recruiting for the Construction Corps.  I think most Deputies will agree that the Army Construction Corps was not fulfilling any defence purpose.  In so far as it was fulfilling any purpose, it was fulfilling a purpose that would be best described as a social service.  It was a kind of organisation unsuited to the Army.  The Army officers, N.C.O.s and men who had anything to do with that particular unit made a very successful hand of a very difficult job of work but it was about the most cumbersome and the most expensive way by which that problem could have been dealt with. There was no decision taken to disband the Construction Corps.  The only decision taken with regard to the Construction Corps is that we will not continue to recruit into that corps and that any boy or man who wants his discharge can get it.</P>
    <P>In the beginning the Construction Corps was taken up heartily and, I am told, was fulfilling quite a useful function. Recently, recruiting has dwindled. It is really the type of immature young boy who, perhaps, was in difficult economic circumstances or who, perhaps, was attracted by a poster and foresaw a glamorous life, that came into the unit.  But recruiting had dwindled and the whole strength of the corps was dwindling and those that we had in it, to a very, very great extent, could be regarded as unwilling, discontented, semi-conscripts, people that were never meant for the rigid discipline of Army life, people completely unsuited for that kind of life&mdash;discontented, unsettled.  I think most Deputies will support me in the view that it was wise to take a decision to let go any of those who wanted to go, to give them their full gratuity as if they had served their full period of office.  With regard to the Construction <Col N="715" /> Corps, that is the decision taken, that any of them who want to go will be allowed to go, any of them who want to pass into the permanent Army and who are up to standard will be entirely welcome there, and there will be no obstacle put to their entering the Army; but there is to be no further recruiting to that particular unit.  That is one decision that could be regarded as a departure from policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed strength of the Army, I think it is true to say that the general policy, passed down along the line from one Minister to another, with regard to our defence arrangement was to a very great extent a continuous policy.  The policy generally accepted was that of a small, very highly-trained regular Army and the maximum possible number of reserves of different types outside that barrack wall&mdash;a small Army where the officers would be so highly trained that any one of them or every one of them in time of war would be capable of filling a position at least two ranks higher than the one he held, and the same would apply to N.C.O.s, and where every individual private soldier would be so highly trained that he would be capable and qualified to fill the position of an N.C.O. in a larger Army.  That was, I think, a continuous policy.  In addition to that, the policy was to keep the headquarters or paper establishment of bigger formations, so that, if at any time it was necessary to recruit rapidly, you had the overhead organisation and the new recruits had merely to roll in under that umbrella, as it were.</P>
    <P>That means in practice a small Army which would appear on a mathematical basis to be top heavy in the way of officers and non-commissioned officers, because the units underneath would not in peace time be anything up to strength.  These establishments are being retained.  The officer number is approximately the same as estimated for in the larger Estimate; the N.C.O.s are approximately the same as that estimated for in the Book of Estimates; the number over all of all ranks is the number we have at the moment <Col N="716" /> and the number we have had for the last 12 months.  It is approximately 1,000 less than is provided for in the Book of Estimates, excluding the Construction Corps.  If any Deputy looks at the Book of Estimates he will see at the top of the page the total establishment and then the words &ldquo;Deduct for over-estimation&rdquo; and you substract one-third from that for over-estimation. The peace establishment is 15,500.  The number estimated is 10,570.  Subtract the Construction Corps from that.  The number in the bigger Estimate was 9,600; the actual strength in January and February last was 8,672.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The strength I am budgeting for is approximately 8,500, without any Construction Corps, or 100 Construction Corps, taken into account.  On examination, Deputies will agree that there is nothing very drastic or startling in suggesting that we should carry approximately 1,000 less than was estimated for at a time when the Minister and his Department may not have been aware that such huge financial demands were going to be made as appeared subsequently in this particular book.</P>
      <P>On this point that will be raised, of war or impending war, I would submit with absolute conviction that, if we are to budget for a war position or a situation in which we may be involved in war, this Estimate can have no relation whatsoever to that war situation. Neither would the figures in the Book of Estimates, for £750,000 more than I am asking, have any real meaning in a war situation.  The only kind of Estimate which would have any real meaning then would be one four, five or six times larger than is contained either in that Estimate or in the figure I am asking the Dáil to approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recruiting drive which was in being last month has been called off. No matter what strength of an Army we were aiming at this year, I do not think the early spring was the time for recruiting in this country.  The early spring is a time of sowing and if we are to make an effort to make ourselves a little bit independent of world conditions in the event of any outbreak, it <Col N="717" /> was highly essential that the last grain of corn should be sown and the last &ldquo;spud&rdquo; be put into the ground.  To make that effort, it was desirable to have the maximum number of men employed in the field at the time when they would be best employed.</P>
    <P>Even if we are to accept a war coming, they would be better employed, in those early spring months, in the field or in the factory than undergoing training in any of our military barracks.  I took that decision in the light of the encouraging knowledge that, through our Army, through our Volunteers, through our various reserve organisations, we have a very high percentage of at least semi-trained men.  Their response to the calls that went out from many platforms over the last ten years was very gratifying and young men of military age enrolled in the various forces freely, generously and enthusiastically. That was one side of the picture.  The other side of the picture was that we were not involved in that war, that we did not have casualties and that we still, thanks be to God, have available the services of all those highly-trained or semi-trained men.  The position is that a large army could be very rapidly recruited in this country.  We have the N.C.O. establishment and the officer establishment highly trained and ready for the job.</P>
    <P>A large economy in these proposals, a very big figure, is covered by not calling up the first-line reserve and not calling up the whole of the second-line reserve.  That is bound to be a decision that will lead to a certain amount of discussion and of comment.  I consider it absolutely reasonable that there would be different points of view on a question such as that.</P>
    <P>The reason is not one purely of economy.  The real reason is that I firmly believe, and the General Staff also believe, that any sound defence policy in this country must, and will, always have to be based on getting the maximum number of highly-trained reservists of different categories outside of the regular Army; that we will never be able to afford a big standing <Col N="718" /> Army.  The cost of soldiers is going up by leaps and bounds every year. Our wealth, unfortunately, is not increasing with the cost of armies.  A thousand soldiers at the present moment, of any type, would cost something like £250,000 a year.  We could never afford to rely for our defence system on a regular Army because we would never be able to maintain a regular Army big enough for the job. That being so, hard facts, tight finance, and common sense direct that we must keep our eyes on having the maximum reserve strength carrying the greatest number of effectives trained as highly as possible, and in a very intense manner.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of energy and attention on the part of Army officers will be given during this year to a complete investigation and overhaul of the reserve position.  The first line reserve, as you all know, is composed of men who are as highly trained in modern weapons as the soldiers in our barracks.  They are a very efficient and highly trained force.  I do not think we are losing anything in the way of effectiveness by not calling them up this year.  There is not any type of modern arms in our possession that that first line reserve is not completely familiar with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second line reserve, there is where we have the very big numbers.  On paper the number is something like 48,000 men.  That is the particular force that we are concentrating on investigating and overhauling with the object of arriving at the best plan of training the maximum number of that very big reserve.  The calling up of the second line reserve last year was practically a failure.  At all events, the response was thoroughly disappointing. I think approximately 12 per cent. of the second line reserve reported for training&mdash;one man in ten.</P>

Of course, we have to be conscious of the fact that those men have their occupations and they do not want to get too far away from their bases. <Col N="719" /> I think the only policy for more effective training with regard to the F.C.A. is to follow the moral to be drawn from Mahomet and the mountain.  It is along that line that matters are being investigated at the moment.  For this year, so far as the F.C.A. goes, it is proposed to call up for training the officers, the N.C.O.s and a body that is classed as potential officers, and not to call up the main body.  During this year 35 halls of the larger type will be constructed, or will be under construction, in different parts of the country with the object of giving training more in the local sense to members of the F.C.A.  The Dáil may accept it from me that I regard that body as an invaluable organisation and I think time will show that it is wise to rely to a very great extent on such a large body of volunteer troops coming to the assistance of a highly trained regular Army.  No labour should be spared in the direction of making their training more and more effective so as to have those large numbers of men more and more efficient.  That is as far as the reserves go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as any Deputy may have a genuine anxiety with regard to maintaining the strength of the Army for the time being just at the figure at which it has been for the past 12 months, I think that would be an unwise policy.  In view of the possibility of an outbreak in Europe which might in time affect or involve us, I would ask Deputies to think of the particular type of outbreak and to cast their minds on the particular menace that will be there.  Let them ask themselves would there be any difficulty in getting all, and, indeed, more than the recruits we would want overnight, if a call were sent out.  If a particular outbreak of that kind did take place the people of this country would look upon it as something in the nature of a &ldquo;holy war&rdquo; and the problem would be to stem the tide of recruits rather than the problem of going out to look for them.  There can be no doubt as to numbers coming forward in such an eventuality.  We are keeping the holding-machine to take them in.  The headquarters establishments will be <Col N="720" /> there.  The N.C.O.s to handle them will be there.  The barracks are there. The equipment is there.  The only difference is that for the time being the potential recruits are engaged in valuable productive work&mdash;a production invaluable to our people should there be any interference with our supply lines or communications.</P>
    <P>One last word with regard to the Navy.  That was one of the forces that was to be abolished.  The Navy is there.  I think that any Minister, in a world situation such as we find ourselves in at the present time, would be overstepping the bounds of his responsibility if he disbanded, liquidated or abolished any particular arm, unit or branch of our defence organisation which was doing its work honestly and efficiently and which had a particular part to play and a particular function to fulfil.  Even from this side of the House&mdash;I might not in the past have subscribed to the setting up of a navy because of our limited funds and all the other drawbacks&mdash;I would certainly not subscribe now to the abolition of the Navy which is already there manned by personnel keenly interested in their profession and serving a useful purpose even in time of peace with the possibility of serving a still more useful purpose in time of danger.  There will be no interference whatsoever with the organisation or strength of that particular force.</P>
    <P>On the question of stores, a substantial economy is shown in the figures I read out with regard to warlike stores and war material.  All these figures are very much of an estimate.  As Deputies on all sides of this House know, each year we have had a figure for war stores.  It is easy enough to put down a figure in the Book of Estimates, ask the Dáil to approve of it, and then tax the people for its equivalent in money.  That is only the first step.  The next step is to get the supplies.  To-day supplies are as difficult to get as they ever were in the past.  The War Office at the present moment will take our order.  Perhaps in 12 months' time they will notify us to turn that order into a firm order and they will then supply.  We will <Col N="721" /> always get a free supply of obsolete armaments&mdash;that is, armaments which become obsolete because of military development and day to day experiment. I do not believe for one moment that, if one checks back over the Estimates, the figure I have provided for warlike stores is going to be touched or reached within the particular year with which we are dealing here.  It is merely a matter of firmer estimation in view of the knowledge obtained since the material for that Book of Estimates was first put together. I believe that if at the present moment my predecessor was speaking from this particular bench and he was asked about this particular sub-head, in the light of the knowledge to hand since that Book was prepared, he would make just as big a reduction in that particular sub-head as I have made.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this Estimate in a rather rambling way.  I am anxious to take the entire House into my complete confidence in regard to defence matters.  If there are any particular points that I have overlooked dealt with in subsequent discussion I will give the maximum amount of information asked when I reply.  If there is any particular point raised upon which at the moment I am not competent to give a reply through lack of knowledge or experience, as soon as I obtain the information I will communicate privately with the Deputy seeking it.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which I have addressed the Dáil as Minister for Defence.  I think it is only due to the officers, N.C.O.s and men that I should take this opportunity of saying publicly how gratified I was to find such a surprisingly high standard of efficiency and enthusiasm.  With regard to the officers and N.C.O.s who have, of course, longer service than the privates, I think the training and knowledge acquired by our Army would compare favourably with that of most armies.  The only thing we lack &mdash;and it is a fortunate lack for us&mdash;is actual war experience.  That is a blessing rather than a curse.  I did expect, because of oldtime association and oldtime experience, a high standard of <Col N="722" /> training and enthusiasm; even with that expectation, I was agreeably surprised to find how much higher it was than I had anticipated.</P>

      <P>The Minister by his speech this evening has proved that he can accommodate himself to almost any situation.  I throw my mind back to the utterances made by him from this side of the House and I find it difficult to identify the speaker this evening as one and the same person. In his opening statement this evening the Minister complained of the volume of rumour abroad.  If the Minister wants to find the source of these rumours I would suggest that he should read his own speech last year in Volume 105, No. 1 of the Dáil Debates.  He will find in that speech all the information responsible in the main for the rumours about which he complains this evening.  For instance, one statement which he made in the course of his speech on that occasion was to the effect that practically every sub-head in the Estimate was a demand for so much nonsense.  That is a statement that can very easily be made by a Deputy who has little or no responsibility for what he states but I am glad and I congratulate the Minister on the fact that he is now assuming the mantle of ministerial responsibility and that he is now talking in a manner which is quite suitable to his high office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Army is not to some extent being reduced, and being reduced deliberately and in a rather insidious manner.  I refer to the stopping of the recruiting advertisements and, I presume, the stopping of recruitment generally to the forces follows.  That is a haemorrhage which <Col N="723" /> in due course, if it is allowed to continue, will bleed the Army to an extent to which it will become almost useless. We know that the Minister on the occasion of the debate on the last Estimate for the Department of Defence stated that the figures for the peace-time Army, which were contained in that Book of Estimates, were too big by half.  I do not know whether the Minister still holds that idea or not. Several of those who are now his colleagues spoke in a similar manner.  The Minister himself at that time suggested that we only require an Army to stand behind the civil power.  In other words, all he required was an Army to stand behind the civil power on any occasion on which it might be called for, and he also suggested that it could be used on ceremonial occasions.  That is a rather belittling situation for the men in the Army.  If members of the Army feel that they are merely an auxiliary to a police force or that they are there merely for the purpose of appearing on ceremonial occasions no one can complain if the morale is at a low ebb. I do not believe it is at a low ebb but I do believe that statements of the kind that were made on this Estimate last year would seriously affect the minds of a number of men who had at least feelings that they were doing work of useful importance.  For instance, the Minister for Local Government, who is now a colleague of the Minister, speaking in this House on this Estimate last year said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my opinion this Estimate, in the main, is one that ought to disappear from the financial provisions made by this House.  To some extent, any money provided for this service should be spent on something in the nature of an expanded national police force rather than on an Army.  The Army should be pruned down to that extent and the money spent on it might be utilised for some more useful and productive service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such a statement is not going to create a high morale amongst the members of the Army.  Another colleague of the Minister's, the Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick as he was then, speaking <Col N="724" /> on the same occasion, disagreed with the Minister in his belief that the Army should be only used as a police force.  He stated in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree with some of the speakers who spoke about an armed police force, because that is pure humbug.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we could save £2,500,000 of this sum of £4,500,000 and that the money could be devoted to other useful work...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These statements were, in my opinion, sufficient to start all the rumours that have been complained of in this House this evening.  The Minister, in the course of his statement, mentioned the fact that the defence policy was to have a small force, highly trained, capable of taking the next rank or the rank above that in the event of an emergency. That was the policy of the Government which we succeeded.  It was approved by the Government which we succeeded and it was adopted by this Government as a useful policy also.  That was the policy we followed but I regret to have to say that neither in the time of the first Government nor in the time of the second Government did that policy ever become operative. We should ask ourselves why it did not become operative.  What were the reasons why it did not become operative?</P>
    <P>The reasons are simple.  The Army consisted then of 6,000 men.  These 6,000 men had to carry out guard duties of a most onerous type.  A man went on at 9 o'clock, say on a Monday morning, and he was not relieved until 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning.  He then was given a rest; he slept throughout the day on Tuesday and rested again during the night.  On Wednesday morning he was free to get whatever tuition or training it was possible to give him in that very brief period.  The training which these men could receive in that very limited time was merely a type of close foot drill, perhaps a little ceremonial drill, a lecture worked in if possible, and perhaps a little target practice but nothing of a nature that <Col N="725" /> would fit these men for the task which was visualised by the Army authorities. The men were overworked; the officers were overworked and the morale was low.  What was the result when the emergency came on the nation?  The result was that it took more than two years to train the army of recruits who offered themselves for service in the nation's emergency.  We were indeed very fortunate to have been given that amount of time but at the end of two years, it could not even then be said that they had reached the standard which the Army staff had visualised or which the Government had been hoping for, because when the great manoeuvres of 1942 took place, it was found that while the men were capable of marching and of drilling in a simple fashion, they were not capable of accepting orders given right down from the headquarters through the various units to the company units.  The result, of course, was that the manoeuvres were not as successful as they should have been.  The staff again concentrated their efforts on these men with a view to having a repeat of these manoeuvres in the hope that in due course the standard which was aimed at would be reached.  It was not necessary to have the second manoeuvres and we do not know what the results would have been, but we are certain that, with an Army of 6,000 men, it is quite impossible&mdash; and we should all realise this fact&mdash;to carry out the dual work which is required, that of providing necessary guards for the barrack posts, equipment and so on and at the same time producing a highly trained and efficient Defence Force capable of achieving the things for which we were looking.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the only solution to that difficulty is the peace-time Army which was strongly recommended by the Army staff after very careful examination and which was accepted and approved of by the Government. Even in these circumstances, Deputies have got to realise that an Army of 12,500 men does not necessarily mean that you have got 12,500 men at your disposal.  There are very large administrative staffs: there are medical units in the field; there are the mechanics, the ordnance staffs, the cooks and numerous other personnel of that type <Col N="726" /> which will of necessity reduce that figure of 12,500 to probably 10,000 effectives&mdash;that is 10,000 men who can be given that type of training which will render them capable in an emergency of handling an inflow of recruits such as we had in 1939 and 1940.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the world situation at the present time is of such a character that he should not gamble with it.  We should have the Army estimated for in this Book of Estimates&mdash;an Army of 12,500 men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If you get that number &mdash;excluding the Construction Corps&mdash; it will be possible, at least I believe it will be possible, to produce a trained personnel capable of handling the inflow of recruits that might be likely to come along in an emergency.  I should like to deal with the suggestion of the Minister for Lands when he was in Opposition and when he told us that he would be prepared to reduce this Estimate by £2,500,000.  He is now a member of the Government and I am sure his voice is heard in the Council Chamber and is taken note of.  He recommended that the expenditure on the Army be, reduced by £2,500,000.  A reduction of the Estimate by such a sum would leave £1,919,000 approximately at the disposal of the Minister for Defence.  The Army Vote in 1931-32 was £1,437,000 odd.  For that sum, you had an Army of 500 officers and 6,000 men odd, but if we take into account the increased cost, to which the Minister himself referred, of equipment and rations and the increase in the pay of soldiers, we shall find that £1,900,000 would cover only an Army of something like 250 officers and about 2,250 men now.  I am pretty certain that the Minister is not going seriously to consider that suggestion, however he may feel about reducing the Army to the figure in which he himself believes and which, I am afraid, would not be very much short of Deputy Blowick's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see the Minister taking his courage in his hands and let the Army recruit, as it was recruiting at the time he withdrew the advertisements.  There was a certain amount of difficulty in securing recruits.  There was a continuous outflow which was not made up by the influx of recruits and hence it was necessary to undertake the great recruiting campaign which was undertaken, not in the spring-time, but at the end of 1947, and which was carried on into the spring-time if you like, and from which we were getting reasonably favourable results, results which were at least up to the average standard of former years.  With the stopping of recruiting, of course, the Minister can, without interfering, good, bad or indifferent, with the Army, let the Army drift down to any figure which he desires to let it reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the present is not the time when we should be taking any chances. I naturally hope, as I am sure every other Deputy hopes, that there will not be another world conflict, but we are not entitled to assume that there will not be another world conflict.  We are not entitled to assume, as the Minister assumed on the Estimate, that never again in any circumstances will England lay a finger on this country. I cannot understand why a man of his intelligence should make such a prophecy and make it seriously; nor can I understand why he should say that the second mightiest navy in the world is our best defence.  Surely it was not for that fact that the men of 1916 went out and sacrificed themselves; it was not for that that the men of the Black and Tan period fought for and won independence&mdash;to have the second mightiest navy in the world defend us.  If there is to be any defence of this nation, let it be defended by the Irish people.  We got ample proof of their readiness and of their desire to defend this nation during the recent emergency.  We were prepared then to defend our integrity on two fronts if necessary.  It may be true, as the Minister stated on that occasion, that we could only put up a token resistance, but that is all to the good.  It is our resistance anyhow and <Col N="728" /> we do not want to be defended by foreigners.  We will defend the liberties we have to the best of our ability and, having done that, we can do little more.</P>
    <P>The Minister must by now realise that not only had we got a defence policy but that we had also a defence plan.  He is now in control of the Department of Defence and of the Army, and he can put his hand at any moment he so desires on the plans for the defence of this country, plans which were made by the Army staff, by men who worked into the small hours of the morning unremittingly for weeks and months to perfect these plans.  He must also know by this that we were menaced, not by one belligerent but by both belligerents, and that the Army was quite prepared to meet any circumstances likely to arise.  It is quite true to say that, if we had been menaced by the German Army, we would have been at war with Germany there and then.  It may be just as true to say that, by reason of that fact, we would have been involved in the war on England's side.  But the reverse might easily have happened also.  We maintained our neutrality and we maintained it mainly by reason of the fact that we had the forces which were there.  We had an Army of well over 40,000 and we had a citizen army made up of the personnel of the Local Defence Force ready to defend every town and village and every street in every town and village at least to the best of their ability.  These were the things that counted when it came to the question of deciding whether this nation should be menaced by invasion or whether it should not be menaced. A similar loyalty in the future will, I believe, ensure a smilar safety for this nation.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is concerned mainly with the cost of the Defence Forces, but he, like everyone of us, must realise that the cost of the Defence Forces is the premium that we have to pay for the insurance against attack.  If we have not got defence forces of one kind or another, then surely we are inviting an enemy to come in and occupy this country.  It is only by reason of the fact that we have, <Col N="729" /> visible to those who want to see it, an Army that will put up even a token resistance that will make the invasion of this country a costly affair and make it necessary for an invader to maintain very strong forces to keep our people suppressed.</P>
    <P>I feel that the fact that we are not calling up the first line reserve is an injustice to the men of that body.  The calling up of the first line reserve means providing what might be described as a refresher course for these officers once a year.  The Minister is not saving a whole lot of money by his refusal to call up the reserve because, so far as I can remember, the Minister will have to pay out something like £74,000 in grants to the members of the reserve who are not called up and, from the Book of Estimates, I estimate that the saving will only amount to something like £51,000.  Surely it cannot be the amount of money he is saving that he is after in that particular instance.  What then is his aim in taking this extraordinary step of not calling up the reserve for their usual annual training?  There are numerous reasons why this year, above all years, the first line reserve should be called out and should get this refresher course which is so absolutely necessary to keep it up to par.</P>
    <P>I have very little to say with regard to the Construction Corps, and the virtual disbandment of it.  Its establishment served a very useful purpose. It was intended to take young fellows off the streets, young fellows who since they left school had failed to find employment and to engage them on some type of useful work within that corps. Quite a number of young fellows received an amount of skilled training in it.  As a result of their membership of the corps, they were prepared to go out into the world and become reasonably good citizens with at least semi-skilled knowledge of the crafts in which they were trained during their period of service.  I regret its passing, but I do admit that it did not get the support that it should have got.  I agree with the Minister that it was not a job for Army officers, but the Army took it on at the time when it was very <Col N="730" /> necessary that somebody should take it on.  In doing so the Army did a very useful social work.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Estimate I want to make a very sincere appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration at the present time to the retention of the larger Army for the purpose for which that Army was designed: the purpose of producing the greatest possible number of highly skilled soldiers and the greatest possible number of highly skilled officers who would be ready at the shortest possible notice to undertake the task of drilling and making ready for the Army those whom it might be found necessary to recruit in a time of emergency.</P>

      <P>I should say at the outset that I feel this general problem of defence should be removed as far as possible from ordinary petty Party considerations.

      <P>It may be nice to hear it and it may be good Party politics, but I do not think very much of it.  I feel that defence is one of those things that should be taken completely out of the arena of Party politics.  I feel that, in this House, we ought to have a committee representative of all Parties that would consider defence problems in a responsible way and make recommendations now and again to the Minister for Defence. I think that if we had something on those lines we could all unite to ensure that the best defence force that could be made available would be available for the country.  I am quite sure that if I were to go back over the debates that took place in this House in a period of 20 years or more I could find expressions of serious criticism of having an Army at all and expressions of absolute support by the same persons for a bigger Army than we have, those expressions being determined by the side of the House on which the <Col N="731" /> speakers happened to be at a particular time.</P>
      <P>One of the problems that worries me is this&mdash;it has worried me for many years&mdash;have we a defence policy at all? I do not think we have, and I do not think we ever had a defence policy, a policy seriously considered by the General Staff of the Army and by the Government and made available in the Department of Defence for the guidance of the officers who have the responsibility of organising, training, drilling and adminstering a Defence Force.  I do not think there is any such policy in existence now, or that any such policy has ever been in existence. We had what one may term a hand-to-mouth policy with regard to defence. In other words, if things were serious we recruited, but when the danger seemed to pass we just discharged or retired or fired out the personnel that we did not want.  That is a regrettable state of affairs.  Even now, I feel that it is the duty of the Minister and of the Government to decide on some line of defence policy, on the nature of the force that would be necessary, and to implement that policy with due regard to our financial limitations&mdash;to organise a type of force that would fit into that scheme of things.  Unless that is done we are only tinkering with this whole problem of defence.</P>
      <P>Defence is much more than a land force.  We have a land force, we have a sea force and we have an air force, and although these are three separate and distinct forms of combat, requiring different kinds of organisation and knowledge, we have the peculiar position that these three forces are controlled by what I may term the land force staff.  That is an absurd position &mdash;that all directions with regard to the training, the administration and the organisation of our Navy should be given by officers who are trained only in regard to land forces.  The Minister shakes his head, but I will develop the point.  The same thing applies with regard to our air force, although the same serious problem does not arise there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the statutes in force, we provide for a Defence Council and that <Col N="732" /> Defence Council takes account of things as they were probably 20 or 25 years ago.  It is the supreme governing authority, with the Minister, of our Defence Forces and it consists of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General.  There is no provision at all in relation to that Defence Council, the supreme governing authority, for any direct representation on matters naval to advise the Minister, and what advice he gets may come second or third hand and may come through minds that are unsympathetic to the Navy, and the same thing applies to the Air Force.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the history of the Free State, when serious matters occurred here, this Parliament decided that there was a great danger of a spirit of proprietorship growing up in certain leading Army officers, if they were allowed to remain in their posts of responsibility for too long a period. They fixed a period of three years for membership of that Defence Council and from the day that Act was passed until there was a change of Government in 1932, there was a change pursuant to that Act regularly every three years in the membership of the Defence Council.  The result was that we had fresh minds brought to bear on the problems of defence.  Every three years, a new person came in, a person who had been away from headquarters, gaining real experience in the command of troops or with the troops somewhere, to fill one of these important positions; but, for some extraordinary reason which I could never comprehend, the previous Government seemed to think that unwise.</P>
    <P>When they came into office, they found three officers there and they carried on with these three officers in these responsible positions until they died or retired.  They then appointed others to succeed them and, having appointed them, unless they died or retired, they continued them in office. Every three years they made an Order extending the period of membership, with the result that for many years the Minister has not had the benefit of the fresh advice he ought to have, the fresh advice which was contemplated when that statutory enactment was <Col N="733" /> passed by this Dáil.  It was a wise provision but, for some reason or other, in all the changing circumstances of the times, the Minister was quite content to keep in office the people who were there or who were appointed by him, some of them for ten years or more.</P>
    <P>I think that was a serious mistake. I sincerely hope the new Minister will examine that problem and that both the Minister and the Government will have at their disposal the advice of fresh minds, because when you have minds directed to the same problems for a long period of years, they become stale and you do not make the progress you ought to make.  Perhaps that explains some part of the very serious grievances which have existed in the Defence Forces over a long number of years.  The Army is not a big Army. It is a small Army and always has been a small Army.  Even during the emergency, it was a small Army and, being a small Army, everybody knows everybody else.  That was always the position&mdash;everybody knew everybody else and they were like one family.  That spirit of familiarity to some extent was good and, in other directions, not so good.</P>
    <P>If we are to be serious, and we ought to be serious, about this matter of defence, this idea of an all-Party committee might be considered.  Defence policy ought in so far as it is possible to be withdrawn from acrimonious debates in this House, and if we are to have a new policy in accord with the serious times through which we are passing, I suggest to the Minister that he should implement and put into force the provisions of the statutes with regard to the Defence Council to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>All these Defence Forces, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, are operated under an Army Act of 1923. It was introduced in this House as a temporary measure in 1923.  At that time the then Government said to the Opposition that they wanted it as a matter of urgency and that there could be no time for discussion, that it was vitally essential that the powers asked for should be given to them, but they made a promise to this House that they would only operate the powers for one year and that they would come back to <Col N="734" /> the House, put a Defence Forces Bill before the House and have a debate by all members so that each and every Deputy in this Dáil might contribute something to the passing of a Defence Forces Act that would be suitable for our own forces.  As I said, that Act has never been discussed in the House and its principles have never been adopted by the House.  It was passed by this House without debate and without discussion for the purpose of easing a temporary situation, and every year since that&mdash;a period of a quarter of a century&mdash;an amending or a continuing Bill has been brought in here by the Minister who happened to be Minister for Defence for the time being, and on almost every occasion a promise was made to the House that a permanent Bill would be introduced at a later date.  Many of the difficulties that face the present Minister and many of the grievances that affect so many serving and discharged members of the Defence Forces have their roots in that unfortunate history.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Traynor, had the honour of being Minister for Defence for many years.  He knew as a Deputy in Opposition before he became a Minister how necessary it was to have this position clarified by Parliament, and I regret very much that he did not avail of the opportunities that he had during those years to put the Defence Forces Act on a proper basis in this House.  I feel that he could have done it, and I think that this House would have agreed with him in making the provision that was necessary.  I regret that he did not do that, and I regret that his predecessors in the Fianna Fáil and the FineGael Parties did not do it.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about recruiting. It is all very well to talk about stopping recruiting but the position, as I understand it, was that notwithstanding a very expensive campaign of recruiting there were more soldiers discharged than were being recruited under that very expensive scheme of propaganda.  Why was that? Why will young men not join up in our Defence Forces&mdash;young men who are quite ready to cross the Border, who are quite ready to take the boat across to England in order to join the military <Col N="735" /> service of another country&mdash;why will they not join up in our own Defence Forces?</P>

      <P>When the emergency was over why were so many young men anxious to get out of the Defence Forces and glad to shake the dust of the Defence Forces off their feet?  I wonder whether that problem has been considered by the Minister for Defence.  I wonder was it considered by the last Minister or is it being considered by the present Minister. Young men have left the Army because they were&mdash;to use a military expression and a very fitting expression&mdash;absolutely &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; with the conditions there.  They came home in that &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; state and talked all over their localities, painting a picture of Army life that prevented their young friends and comrades from having anything to do with the Army. Somebody is responsible for that state of affairs and until we have examined the question and find out where that responsibility lies it is useless for Deputy Traynor or for anybody else in the House to suggest that the Minister should build up the forces to 12,000 men.  If we have got to get those numbers, in the present state of affairs it would be necessary for us to pass compulsory regulations as young men will not join the Army under present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Temporary Provision Act, 1923, which I have already referred to, was largely responsible as it was never suitable for our Defence Forces. Under it we had and we have a system of discipline that upsets, annoys and pinpricks the ordinary soldier.  How often have we not seen here in the City of Dublin a young soldier out talking to his girl friend and a military policeman in full regimentals stopping him and demanding number and name?  If there was any consideration for the ordinary soldier that would never have been permitted.  During the years of the emergency some genius had the bright idea of issuing an order that no soldier could move around with his <Col N="736" /> overcoat on unless it were buttoned up to the throat and that regulation was enforced very strictly.  Then they ask us why can we not get soldiers, where are they going, why are they going to another country and why are they leaving our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>These were simple problems that would not involve the Government or the Army in finance of any kind.  All that was involved was an ordinary human approach to any of these problems. I am glad to see that the new Minister for Defence moves about to military establishments.  I am very pleased to see him get in touch with officers, N.C.O.s and men and talk about their grievances for that is the duty of the Minister for Defence.  This &ldquo;brass hat&rdquo; idea of living apart entirely from our Army except to pay compliments to them in the Dáil has not helped our military force nor has it helped our defence policy.</P>
    <P>I have had considerable experience in defending soldiers who have been charged with offences or breaches of the military code and I have been upset very often by the conditions. Any code of law must be based on justice and as somebody well said on one occasion, &ldquo;justice must not only be done but it must appear to be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is our system of courtsmartial under this old Temporary Provisions Act which I have mentioned?  We have this system: a soldier, N.C.O. or officer is charged with an offence and is returned for courtsmartial. The summary of evidence and the charge sheet are sent to a legal officer. That legal officer examines them and settles the charge sheet on which the particular member of the Defence Forces should be tried.  Having done that, and being well aware of the evidence against the officer or soldier, having directed, as he often has had to do, that additional evidence be brought forward to sustain the charge, he then, under our very peculiar code, sits on the courtmartial as the judge advocate, supposed to be the impartial person to advise the three or five officers that constitute the courtmartial. It is the highest tribute I can pay to these legal officers, and I would especially mention in that connection some of <Col N="737" /> the legal officers who were commissioned during the emergency, that they have done their best at these courtsmartial to try to give justice to the soldiers.  The machinery is unjust; it is unfair; and if this House had an opportunity of discussing it on a Defence Forces Bill it would not tolerate the system.</P>
    <P>There is in the Defence Forces Act the famous section that every soldier knows, Section 68.</P>

      <P>May it please you, a Chinn Comhairle.  It is a pity that I cannot refer to that famous section. I will not deal with it on the section. I will deal with it in relation to what happens, which prevents soldiers remaining in the Army and in fact prevents young people joining the Army. There is a system of discipline that is pinpricking, that regards the soldier as something there to obey orders and to do what he is told, that does not regard him as a human being.  If he cannot be caught on a section under the disciplinary code, there is a general omnibus method of dealing with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no settled policy on anything.  At one stage, when provision was being made for age limits for retirement, special provision was made for officers occupying certain posts of responsibility, quartermasters and people of that kind who were somewhat different from the ordinary officer.  They had got into <Col N="738" /> the type of post in which there were not many opportunities for promotion and it was decided that in their cases they should have ten years longer to serve.  That seemed to me and, I think, to most people, to be a contract between these officers and the State. After these men had spent many years in the particular posts and having lost all opportunity of promotion, by a switch in policy, the Minister for Defence cancelled the arrangement whereby they would get ten years additional service and these officers had to retire at the normal age.  One would expect, if the matter had been considered fully, that there would not be such a switch in policy that affected so many officers.  However, that was done and it was the sort of thing that was being done from day to day.  One thing would be decided to-day.  The reverse would be decided to-morrow. All that arises from the fact that we have had no policy on defence up to date.  I have referred to officers.  I could in this debate refer to many grievances but I do not propose to do so.  I shall take other opportunities to raise them with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to see an efficient defence force in this country.  As I said at the beginning, I want to see matters of defence policy removed from the acrimonious discussions of Party politicians.  At the moment we seem to have what the Minister for Defence calls a regular Army, a First Line, the F.C.A. and a Navy.  I am not worried very much about what the particular strengths may be at the moment.  That is not the important thing.  The important thing is that the organisation is such that it will fit into a well thought out and constructive plan.  We are alleged to have 48,000 in the F.C.A.  I would be happy to think that we have.  It is quite possible that we have that paper strength, that nominally there are 48,000 in the F.C.A. I do not think that the Government or the Minister could consider that 48,000 men are available in that particular force to take their place in the event of an emergency.  I do not blame the Minister with regard to that, nor do I blame the previous Minister.  I appreciate the difficulty of trying to build up something in the nature of a citizen <Col N="739" /> army, particularly after an emergency situation, when there will not be the same desire to take part in parades, in training or in manoeuvres.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any check on that membership, whether those people who are alleged to belong to that force are existing at all, whether they are in the country or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am not worried very much about the strengths; it is the policy that counts.  What do we want a defence force for?  Is it to defend this country from any invader, Britain included?  I do not agree with what Deputy Traynor said, that we were menaced during the last war situation by Britain.  I do not believe it, and I think it is an unfair statement to make.  It was a very peculiar way of being menaced when our troops in uniform went across the Border to posts on the far side of the Border, to bring down here rifles and military equipment from the British Forces in occupation.  That is a queer way to menace us.</P>

      <P>All this nonsense and codology&mdash;if I may use an expression that has been made famous in this House&mdash;with regard to attacks on this country by Britain, were nothing more or less than petty Party politics, in the middle of the emergency.  There was never any danger of Britain invading this country.  Nevertheless, we went to the expense and the trouble of building up all kinds of defence blocks right along the Border.  I do not know whether it was the Minister for Defence or the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures who was responsible but, however it was done, it was unjust and unfair, because there was never any likelihood of the British forces invading this country during the last emergency.  When the true story is told of the last war, it will be admitted that our neutrality in the <Col N="740" /> dark days after Dunkirk was of great advantage to Britain.  That will be admitted by any person who has given any study at all to the problem.</P>
      <P>It is well that we should be able to develop our defence without this fear of being invaded by Great Britain.  It makes the defence position easier.  If we can be sure we are not going to be attacked by Britain, then we have to consider our defence policy and defence measures on that basis.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to talk about what happened on the 4th June, 1940, he will have an opportunity to do so.  Our defence policy must be based on the protection of this country from invasion and if it is clear that we are not going to be invaded by Britain it makes the position somewhat easier.  Within our constitutional position, I could not see any attack or invasion from Britain.  Our constitutional position is somewhat similar to that of Canada, Australia or South Africa and no person in his senses could imagine British forces invading or entering any of those countries without the consent of the Government of that country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to touch on this alleged republican Constitution we have, but it has some bearing on our defence.  If we are an independent republic, it is quite possible that we might be invaded by Britain; but while the constitutional position remains as it is, that we are a part&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash;of the British Commonwealth of Nations, there is no danger of our being invaded by Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Training has been referred to here. <Col N="741" /> When the Defence Forces were mobilised in the early days of the emergency, one section of those forces which deserved great credit was that then known as the Old Reserves.  That section did its part in building up the new Army that was created.  Those men filled administrative positions, positions as training officers and leaders of troops.</P>
    <P>That reserve had an interesting history.  It was established under the Defence Forces Act of 1923.  That Act provided for an army and a reserve and the reserve consisted of people who had retired from the Army.  They were of different sections.  That reserve was called up year after year. It had been organised in battalions and it contributed a great deal to training, administering and building up the Defence Force that was formed in the early days of the emergency.</P>
    <P>What happened when the emergency was over?  It was decided that that particular reserve, to which this country owed so much, should be wiped out.  Every officer who reached the age limit that applied to the regular Army was dismissed and those who did not reach the age limit were removed by Order of the Government, on the Minister's advice.  How can we, in the future, build up any defence organisation if the persons who carry responsibility treat soldiers and reservists in the way the officers, N.C.O.s and men of that old reserve were treated?  Every captain who reached the age of 48 was &ldquo;axed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There seemed to be a policy in the Department of Defence within the past few years&mdash;whoever was responsible for it, I do not know&mdash;of getting rid of the old officers, the old N.C.O.s and the old men, who had built up and handed over to the last Government a very efficient and capable military machine.  In America at the moment, because of the world situation, age limits are going by the board.  When an appeal was made in this House last year and the year before, and when an appeal was made through the columns of the Press to the Minister not to wipe out these forces, he turned a deaf ear and he proceeded with his plan&mdash;I was almost going to say of <Col N="742" /> victimisation&mdash;of wiping out that old force to which in the days of the emergency he paid many flowery compliments in this House and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I regret there was not a little more time taken to consider this problem. I regret very much the then Minister would not be advised by people who had as deep an interest in this country as he had.  It is a sad reflection that when the emergency was over those people were marched out of the Army. I have seen the testimonials given to some of the finest officers they had. These set out the period they began service and the date on which they ended and, in the column dealing with comments, was the simple three letter word &ldquo;nil&rdquo;.  That was the tribute paid to officers who had rendered such good service&mdash;that three letter word in the column headed &ldquo;comments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope there will be nobody on the opposite benches who will have the nerve to attack or criticise the Minister for Defence because on paper there appears to be a reduction in the number of soldiers.  I hope every Deputy on the opposite benches who participates in this debate will do so with a sense of responsibility and a feeling of regret that the last Minister for Defence made it so difficult for us to build up the personnel of an army now.  Those officers and soldiers to whom I have referred set out to train the Defence Forces during the emergency and they made a fine job of it. It may have been on the directions of the Minister.  I do not know.  Every year during the emergency&mdash;or almost every year&mdash;they had what was known as a General Headquarter's inspection. That inspection staff went around every unit in the Army and every year they were back again to the elements of recruit training and the tests of elementary training.  There are many people in this House who know something about rifles.  There are many people in this House who know that once you learn to use a rifle you forget all about the tests and the elementary training.  You know how to shoot. You know how to hit your target.  Year after year that inspection staff went out with full ceremonial to put the unfortunate soldiers through these gruelling tests of elementary training.</P>

      <P>I say to the Minister and to the Government that we cannot afford to have these jack-in-the-box discussions on defence, one's attitude to defence depending upon whichever side of the House one sits. We cannot continue in that fashion. The only way in which we can have a sensible approach to the problem is by bringing into existence some machinery under which we can have an agreed defence policy and through which we can organise within our financial limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Traynor referred to the position as he found it prior to the emergency when the Army was entirely engaged on guard duties.  I agree with Deputy Traynor that guard duty is a soul-destroying duty.  Guard duty should not be imposed upon a soldier except where it cannot be avoided. Possibly the bulk of these guard duties could be abolished by substituting for them military police or police patrols for posts now controlled by sentries.  In that way the soldiers could be made available for training and in that way the bulk of the training could be given before the soldiers are released from actual recruit training.  There are many grievances affecting N.C.O.s and men. I thought I might have raised them on this debate but I want to limit myself to the broad aspect of defence policy. I again appeal to all sides of the House to take defence out of Party politics and deal with it on a national basis. <Col N="746" /> We should all contribute whatever we can to the building up of an adequate Defence Force in which every element will receive humane treatment under a system of administration and control which will give us a happy and contented Defence Force.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement made by the Minister.  It should go a long way to allay the uneasiness felt by many of my former colleagues as a result of what the Minister very fairly described as malicious rumours sponsored by certain alleged national newspapers in this country.  I admire the courage with which the Minister faced the problem of cutting out some of the trimmings of our Defence Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pitiful to find Deputy Traynor now belly-aching about the stopping of recruiting when, in fact, the sequel to the manner in which he disbanded and demobbed and refused to fulfil promises to men who had served him loyally, as the then Minister for Defence, and his Government during the period of the emergency is that we find to-day throughout the length and breath of this country young men eminently suitable in type, form and background to be soldiers of this State flying far from any recruiting office having heard the bitter experience of brother or relative during the period of serving in an emergency Army in this State. I welcome this opportunity of being able to talk in a straightforward way to the new Minister for Defence.  I hope to give him in some limited way the benefit of what was my experience under the conditions of an emergency Army.  The sooner this country realises that all the promises and all the grandiose speeches made by Deputy Traynor while he was Minister for Defence about all that would be done for the ex-soldier, for the man who had served in the emergency, were so much arrant nonsense and that most of those men to-day find themselves in the British coal-mines or in the British forces the better for us all.  I feel sorry for the new Minister for Defence when he envisages his first line reserve and an F.C.A. that are fully trained as a result of emergency activity.  He is <Col N="747" /> going to get a rude and sorry awakening, one which was indicated by the short and very small response to second line training last year.  He is going to get ruder and ruder awakenings as time goes on which will show him exactly what the morale and what the criterion of the morale in what is left of this Defence Force is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>All the pomp, nonsense and complete indifference of little potentates is how best might be described the attitude of the late Minister for Defence towards defence. He knows as much about a soldier as, to use a popular expression, a pig does about a holiday.  A soldier is a man of blood and brawn, a human person.  I appeal to the new Minister that, when he is considering the problem of building up a defence force against the odds that he will have to build it up, he will build it up on the basis of humanity and understanding and not on the basis of glitter and buttons. There is a lot of talk to the effect that now is not the hour to retrench in defence.  Red herrings are thrown across the trail by statements in regard to our being menaced by this person or that person.  The only serious menace the Army ever suffers from is the menace of red tape and stupid regulations.  Such a menace has it become that the problem of recruitment which the new Minister has stopped had virtually stopped itself. One would think that we were back in the old days when one army was going to face another in the field.  One would think that, facing the future and the possibility of a future war, we were going to face conditions in which a standing army or any type of army was going to be a guarantee of defence. I do not think that Deputy Traynor is in earnest when he talks about the difference between 8,500 and 9,000 men. He knows, as well as anybody with any reasonable perspective, that the future war will not be a war in which any armed force will be the first line of attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Traynor that he can allay his fears in regard to this <Col N="748" /> country because never was there an emergency in this country, never was there a national situation to be met but the Irish people had the courage to meet it, and that goes back to an experience that the ex-Minister should well remember himself.  I say to the new Minister that it is unfortunate for him that the commitment of this State by way of defence is so large and that he cannot retrench more so as to enable this country to get down to first jobs first.  Deputy Traynor, in talking about the Army, described the length of time it took to train a soldier but then he was talking about the red tape copy-book soldier and it was never that type of soldier who stood in Ireland's gap before.  We are envisaging dangers that are fantastic. Deputy Traynor should realise, having spent a long period in the office of the Ministry of Defence, that there is a sound hard core of resistance in this country that needs neither tests of elementary training nor any other type of test to bring it manfully to the front in our hour of need.  I think that the new Minister is being realistic.  We have too much paper nonsense in our Defence Forces.  I am quite sure that nobody is going to welcome more readily than the Army itself the fact that the new Minister is going to deal with personnel in existence and not with personnel in embryo.  A lot of criticism and a lot of petty politics are made out of this drive to retrench in the Army.  I think that what the Minister is trying to do is something that the late administration conceived in no Department.  He is trying to make an efficient force out of the existing Defence Force, trying to make them realise that they are the Army of a small country, to do a job on behalf of a small country, and he is not buildnig it up on grandiose schemes such as were envisaged by the last Government.</P>
    <P>I have a few suggestions which I would like to make to the Minister. There are certain areas throughout the country in which military posts are now unoccupied.  I hope he will be able to recoup his Department and the Exchequer to some extent by either letting or selling barracks or buildings <Col N="749" /> that are no longer in use by the Defence Forces.  I hope he will be able to make available in places where there is urgent need, some of the former huts or barracks of the Army to relieve acute housing crises and at the same time reduce expenditure on the Army itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor spoke about guard duties and how onerous they were. They were not only onerous; they were stupid as well, for the reason that whatever kind of scheme of defence the late Minister had, troops sprawled all over the country in small pokey posts. As a result of that dispersal of forces, the duties were all the more onerous. I hope the new Minister will address his mind to the possibility of getting the Army into compact groups for training and thereby obviate the waste arising from sprawling isolated groups around the country thus making the fulfilment of their duties by some sections of the Army almost impossible. It is indeed fortunate that the Ceann Comhairle has indicated that one cannot go very far outside last year's administration of the Army in this debate because there were things simmering in my mind which took five years to accumulate to which I should like to give expression.  I want to say to the new Minister for Defence that I, for one, unhesitatingly support the steps he is taking in a direct way to help the people by the retrenchment he is seeking in the Army, without in any way interfering with any existing officer, N.C.O. or man.  The retrenchment he is seeking in the Army represents the difference between the megalomania of the last Administration and the sanity of the new one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has asked that this debate on Defence should be above Party politics.  I think that Defence should be above Party politics but while the House remains constituted as it is, that is something which we cannot hope to achieve.  I am satisfied, despite what Deputy Traynor may think, that the nucleus Army suggested by the Minister will achieve in full the object of our defence plan.  I cannot conceive, particularly after the statement of Deputy Traynor that in the emergency we once had an Army of <Col N="750" /> over 40,000, how a standing force of officers, N.C.O.s and men to the number of 8,000, could not enlarge itself at any stage to train as big an Army again.  The only difficulty that faces the new Minister is the trail of broken promises, of spurned soldiers and of emigrant soldiers whose services to this country were rewarded in the contumelious way represented by Deputy Traynor's dismissal of all of them.  We built up in this State during the period of the emergency a grand force.  Go to any man who served in the then L.S.F. and try to encourage him to-day to serve in the new F.C.A. and you will be told in a realistic and sensible way of the thanks he got from the then Minister for Defence for his six years of service.  When it was proposed that they might be given a few shillings to enable them to have a disbanding reunion, it was turned down.  The Minister did not think it worth his while even to parade the officers or men of that corps at any centre and say to them: &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;  That is the heritage that faces the new Minister.</P>

      <P>Do not talk arrant rot. The problem the new Minister is facing is that of making an efficient Army out of a toy one.  He is facing the job of undoing all the stupid arrogance of the late Administration, all the pomp and ceremony that, in the return the soldier got, signified nothing.  It is unfortunate for the new Minister to have foisted on him the toy creation of the late lunatic Administration, the puppet Navy.  I can appreciate his difficulty in not being able to abolish it because the officers, the N.C.O.s and the men have given their lives to that service and we must honour to that extent the stupidity of the last Government.  I hope that the Minister will consider the complete inadequacy of our alleged naval strength and that when he ultimately comes to consider the other purpose which the Navy is alleged to serve, that the corvettes will disappear and that proper fishery protection <Col N="751" /> boats will appear.  I am very glad to find the Minister paying a tribute to the officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Army to-day and I feel that there will be a reciprocal warmth in the Army when the officers and men realise that what the new Minister is facing is the difficult task of undoing what one might best describe as the complete killing by insidious, invidious means of any morale that might have existed amongst people formerly serving in the Army, some of whom may now be in the first line reserve or the second line reserve.  I am sure they will feel that under the new Minister and the new Government they are going to be given a chance to do a soldier's work without the stupidity of the invasion of hordes of General Staff testing out cooks, etc.  The Government will proceed without having all the glitter, the pomp and the ceremony that the late junior potentates wanted.  I hope that the courage and the straightforwardness of the new Minister will in some way serve in a salutary fashion, at the very beginning of the period of office of this Government, to offset what I will describe in no uncertain way as the betrayal of the men who served this country in an emergency, the betrayal of the promises made to them by the late Administration as to their resettlement in civilian life in the country.</P>

      <P>The various voices, which we are now becoming accustomed to hear from the Government Benches, were very evident in the debate to-day.  The Minister wound up his statement by paying a tribute to the efficiency of the Army.  Deputy Collins has just told us that the Minister's job is to make an efficient Army out of a toy one.  We have had impatience displayed by Deputies on the Government Benches when their statements, made without any supporting evidence were contradicted.  In the case of Deputy Collins, Deputy Traynor had to contradict him.  Deputy Cowan, referring to the statement that this country was menaced by England in 1940, said he did not believe that statement, although it was made by the man who was then Minister for Defence. <Col N="752" /> The Deputy set himself up as an authority who knew all about the inner history of that period as against the then Minister for Defence and refused to believe his statement.  Then, in the next breath, we are asked to put this debate above Party politics.</P>
      <P>Last year, when the present Minister for Defence was on these benches, his statements on Army policy, if carried to a logical conclusion, undoubtedly meant that we did not need an Army in this country at all.  At first sight, his statement to-day appeared to contradict that.  But, when one gets down to examine what he did tell us, it is quite apparent that the Government are trying to arrive at the same point by a little longer road than mere abolition of the Army.  It is quite certain that, if we stop recruiting, the Army is going to diminish.  It will not be long until it is down to its pre-emergency strength and the whole experience of the emergency showed that that was not sufficient for the expansion such as had to be undertaken in 1940.</P>
      <P>We have also here a huge reduction under the heading of maintenance. Does that mean that the various barracks are to be allowed to go back into the desperate state of repair in which they were found to be in 1940? We all know the state that Mullingar barracks was in when the Volunteers had to be called up.  We all know that it was outrageous to bring respectable young patriots, who had volunteered to help the country in such a period, into the conditions in which they had to exist there until they put them into order themselves.  It is at least the duty of the Government to provide that, if an emergency occurs again, some sort of decent conditions will be provided for these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also told that the reserve is not being called up this year on the ground of economy.  But surely there is a contract with the reserve that they will not alone get their annual pay, but that they will be called up for a month per year on Army pay. <Col N="753" /> We all know that a number of these men spent their holidays at this training. I say that the contract with those men is being broken in so far as they will not now get that month's Army pay.  We have been charged from the opposite benches with breaking contracts. That is one point, at any rate, in which I say a definite State contract has been broken.</P>
      <P>Our policy in regard to defence surely ought to be that which the Swedish Premier announced yesterday for his country&mdash;&ldquo;We must make our defence so strong that it will deter bigger Powers from throwing part of our territory into a theatre of war.&rdquo; Surely that would be a fair summary of what we would all like to see as the defence policy in this country.  If we allow our big neighbours, who may be our enemies, to think that we have not sufficient trained man power which can be got ready at very short notice, then there is always the danger that our territory will be a theatre of war and very likely the excuse that would be made by these Powers is that we were unable to defend ourselves.  Does anyone think that that factor did not count in the last war?  Deputy Cowan told us that there never was any danger of an invasion from England. I wonder does he recall the broadcast made by Mr. Winston Churchill at the end of the war and what he stated about his temptations to invade this country?  Does the Deputy think that it was for love of us that he did not do so?  Was it because he knew that the cost was going to be so much if he attempted it that it was not carried out?  That was his mind even after the war.  One can guess what his mind was during the war.  Yet Deputy Cowan wants us to believe that there never would be any danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see the policy of the new Minister, he is going to depend in future on a large number of what I think he called semi-trained men.  I doubt if they will be even semi-trained.  If we are not going to maintain a sufficient army to keep the F.C.A. up to scratch, well then the men in it will not be even semi-trained.  Of course, we know that the Minister told us last year that <Col N="754" /> armies nowadays could be turned out like sausages.  I will quote what he said from the Dáil debates for the 28th January, 1947, column 450.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recent war and the previous war have shown us that soldiers can be turned out when they are wanted as quickly as sausages can be turned out through a sausage machine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the view of the present Minister for Defence a year ago.  Is there anybody here with any knowledge of military affairs, or who thinks seriously about them, who is prepared to take the responsibility deliberately in peace time of asking our young men to be shoved out into a war as sausages are turned out of a machine&mdash;to be turned out with insufficient training? I say it is murder for us to do it: it is absolute murder if we have not regard for those young lives by giving them every possible training and protection that they can get.  It is our duty to do that for them.  Yet the policy announced to-day on the grounds of economy and retrenchment is just that &mdash;that we are going to depend on the young men of the country, on their good patriotic spirit, to be turned out to meet anything that may happen with insufficient training.  That is the position, because we are not going to leave them the facilities for that training. That is all to be done on the grounds of economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the more responsible members of the House will think more of the lives of our young men than they will of the saving of £750,000.  I do not think that even the taxpayers who want the greatest economy want it at the expense of the lives of our young people.  I hope that the members on the Government Benches who, we are told, have such freedom of speech, thought and action, will exercise it on this Estimate, and that they will justify the possible losing of hundreds or thousands of lives for the sake of saving £750,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go into the question of military training. I am inclined to believe that it will suffer as a result of the discussion that has taken place here.  I am anxious <Col N="755" /> to get some information about the £46,000 which is earmarked in the Estimate for the Red Cross Society.  I take it that this sum is to be paid to some group of people for organising the Red Cross Society and for giving service in the Society.  I have some knowledge of the work done by the Red Cross Society in Cork City.  Since it was formed there, I know that the group of men and women in it have never received one penny remuneration for their work.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister how this money is going to be spent.  I suggest that it should be sent to different parts of the country with a view to encouraging those voluntary workers to continue to do the good work that they have been doing. I feel that if we are going to pay people for working in the Red Cross the true spirit of Red Cross work is going to suffer as a result.  It is interesting to know that in Cork City, and indeed throughout the county where there are branches of the Red Cross, marvellous work has been done by the Red Cross Society, both nationally and internationally.  Yet not one penny has been paid to the people in it for the work they have done.</P>
      <P>If it is the desire of the Minister for Defence that any group of people should be paid an annual salary, or part of a salary, for Red Cross work, I do not think that would be in the best interests of the Red Cross Society.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of appointing anybody to a paid position of a permanent character for Red Cross work, this money should, as I have suggested, be distributed in different parts of the country to help to supplement the work that the present members are doing for the Red Cross Society.  During the course of his recent visit to Cork City the Minister was shown all the work that is being done by the members of the Red Cross Society and, as I have said, they have not received as much as one penny remuneration for that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day at Question Time, I asked the Minister about the wages paid to civilians attached to military barracks in different areas.  The answer that I <Col N="756" /> received from him was that as far as Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Galway are concerned the rates were those paid to employees recruited under the special scheme for Old I.R.A. men.  I am at a loss to understand why there should be a special rate for Old I.R.A. men that is not equal to the rate paid to the ordinary workers in the district.  I think it is a poor tribute to the I.R.A. men that civilians attached to barracks should be paid at a lower rate than that paid to workers in a district.  That is not a proper recognition of the work that was done by the Old I.R.A. men. I am suggesting to the Minister that these men should at least be paid the rate that prevails for unskilled workers in the area in which they are employed. It may be said that they are not doing the work of builders' labourers.  At times they are doing work of a very unpleasant character, and they are a necessary element in the Army in the particular areas in which they are employed.  These men should, at least, be paid the minimum rates paid to unskilled workers&mdash;apart altogether from the question of the rate paid to builders' labourers.  I do not think that this rate for Old I.R.A. men should be so much below the rate paid to unskilled workers in Cork City.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.  A rate of £3 15s. a week cannot be related to what is being paid to unskilled men in Cork City at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this question of the Army discussed without any kind of Party feeling.  I think that a great debt of gratitude is due to our military men for what they did during the emergency. I would like to see that spirit kept alive.  I have read complaints from some of those men who were put off.  I am inclined to believe that both the outgoing Minister for Defence as well as the present Minister are prepared to give them a decent show.  I hope the Minister will give a reasonable explanation about this sum of £46,000.  I want to see the spirit of the Red Cross Society being maintained throughout the country as it has been in Cork County and Cork City since the formation of the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing <Col N="757" /> with this Estimate in the way in which I intend to deal with it, I should like to refer to the matter raised by Deputy Cowan.  It is possibly, strictly speaking, outside the Estimate, but it is of some importance&mdash;the question of the procedure at courtsmartial.  From personal experience I can endorse the objection to a system in which the officer who settles the proceedings also sits as judge advocate.  This is not perhaps the best time to go into that matter, but some of us who have seen the system working and who have seen it from a legal point of view as well as from the military have tried to bring it to the attention of authority.  Since it has been mentioned here, I think it would be a matter of importance to remedy it.  It is a system which apparently has been in the Army from the very beginning, but that should not prevent its being adjusted now.</P>
      <P>Coming to the Estimate, I am rather sorry to find that Deputy Collins attempted to misrepresent the whole situation with regard to the history of the Army.  I should not have thought that he would have done so, because, as the Minister pointed out in the beginning, the general policy for the Army has been practically accepted and unchanged from the days when the Army was re-organised after the civil war.  The difficulties which have arisen have arisen in regard to the implementation of the policy laid down, rather than in regard to the actual defence policy to be followed.  The policy to be followed has been pretty clearly defined, as I have said.</P>
      <P>The earliest statement of policy I can find, looking back over the reports, is to be found on 6th May, 1926, when a statement in regard to the general task of the Defence Forces was made by the then Minister for Defence.  That statement accords with practically every statement of policy made from the Government Benches since, and briefly it is this: in order to cater for the defence of this country, the objectives should be, first, to garrison our own territory and to maintain so far as possible neutrality and to be able to prevent, or at least very seriously to deter, any other Power from trying to occupy the country by force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of neutrality in that <Col N="758" /> sense involves, first, the provision, in time of emergency or war, of an adequate garrison for the territory of the State and, in addition to the mere duty of garrisoning, there must be available sufficient forces to repel diversionary attacks or light attacks, and in any event an ability to offer a resistance sufficient to deter an enemy, having regard to the factors of time and cost in man-power and material. In other words, though one would freely concede that, for a small country such as this, the question of absolute defence against any aggressor might be beyond our powers, it should be within the power of this State to equip and field forces which would be able to compel an intending aggressor to deploy against the country large forces, which would mean a big commitment for him and which would also mean a fairly substantial time factor for him so that he could not occupy us with lightning speed and the cost in time would obviate any advantage of surprise which might accrue to him by occupying us, and, then, that the cost of men and material would be so great for him that he would be deterred from all but the most serious motives from attempting to occupy us.  That, I think, must be the basis of our defence policy, and if our forces, such as we can have, are organised with that end in view, it is a relatively simple step to provide for any other commitment in the line of active participation in hostilities or co-operation with any particular Power or adjusting to any particular and given situation. In fact, that general line of policy seems to have been in the long run justified by our experience in the emergency.</P>
    <P>If one looks back over the debates during the years since the war terminated, we find that this matter has cropped up again and again.  I think that twice last year the tenor of the debate here led me to stress these questions to the people who occupied these benches: are you serious about defence?  Do you require an Army, a Defence Force in that sense, to play the rôle which the defence policy agreed upon demands?  Do you need an Army <Col N="759" /> for that purpose or do you need merely a police force for the maintenance of internal order?  The difference between the two situations was gone into and I merely mention it again now.  It now apparently does not arise.  We are apparently agreed on the necessity for having an Army here, an Army to implement the defence policy which has been agreed now by three successive Governments.  That makes the debate rather more unified than it was on previous occasions and it is on that basis that I shall try to deal with the remainder of the matters in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Firstly this comment might be made. We have had the same policy for well over 20 years prior to the last war. We have had an Army allegedly organised with a view to implementing that policy.  We have got safely through the emergency of the last war. It is obvious then that, since we are to continue the same policy for the future, the lessons of the years from 1924 to 1940 should be studied carefully and that, in particular, the sources of weakness which showed themselves when it came to mobilisation in 1939 and 1940 should be eradicated for the future.</P>
    <P>During those years prior to the emergency there was room for differences of opinion but now many of these differences will have been solved by the experience of these years.  In dealing, therefore, with the defence policy and particularly in approaching the Estimate submitted by the Minister to-day, it is useful to find the lessons of that period and to apply them to the future.  In seeking those lessons we shall have to look to the practical steps that were taken and to details of administration rather than to policy. There has been a large amount of talk at various periods in the history of the State regarding an alleged lack of definition of the defence policy.  I would like to point out that right from the beginning there has always been a definite statement of policy and that weaknesses in the past have come rather from obstructions in the development of the forces necessary to implement that policy and from difficulties of administration <Col N="760" /> and of providing finance. I think that it is necessary to stress that here to-night because we hear so often this question of a lack of a definite policy.  The general policy has been sufficiently defined and it has been a question of implementing it.</P>
    <P>For that reason let us have a short review of the figures available in previous years which are of interest. Going back to the year 1925-26 the total strength of the Army was 13,261 and it came down in 1926-27 to 10,535. From that time until the year 1938-39 the strength of the Defence Forces for the purpose of the Estimates&mdash;I am taking the figures in the published Estimates for those years&mdash;was in the region of 5,000 to 6,000 all ranks.  In fact, however, the strength of the regular Army in those years was never, I think, much more than 5,000 and we will say for the sake of argument that it was somewhere around 5,000.</P>
    <P>Over the years from 1925 to 1939 the defence of this country was catered for by a regular or permanent force of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 and superimposed upon that force was the reserve.  When the reserve was started in 1926-27 the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve as it was called was initiated and developed.  It was mainly composed of N.C.O.s and men&mdash;I will treat the officers' reserve separately&mdash;who had served for a considerable period in the regular Army and who could therefore be considered as practically completely trained and whose efficiency was kept up by a system of reporting every year for one month's training.  That branch of the reserve was militarily the most efficient and in its attendance at the annual training in the years up to the emergency it gave the highest percentage, a percentage, if my memory serves me, of approximately 80 per cent.  That force, again if my memory serves me, never amounted to more than approximately the same strength as the regular Army.  You had that reserve on top of a regular Army of somewhere around 5,000 men.  These two categories together comprising about 10,000 men were what you might call the trained force.  After that you had to rely on reserves of a voluntary type.</P>
    <P>The first attempt to raise a supplementary <Col N="761" /> reserve to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve was known as the &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve and it was organised on the lines of the militia.  The recruits served for three months with the Colours and thereafter were treated in much the same way as the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve.  Some thousands of men were initially recruited into that portion of the reserve.  This was discontinued, however, at a later stage owing to the development of another type of voluntary reserve, it being felt in military quarters that it was not calculated to give the material for leaders, although the reserve were first-class men.  I had the honour to command some of them myself in my own unit and can testify to their efficiency so when I say that the scheme was dropped I do not want to make any reflections on that type of force.  It suffices to say that recruiting for that reserve was stopped and the &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve was merged in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve. For annual whole-time training they were treated in practically the same way as the regular reserve and considered to be in the same category. Based on the regular Army of 5,000 men during those years the first line reserve&mdash;&ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash;which was kindred in nature to the regular Army, was something over 5,000 during the years just before the war.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments apparently came to the conclusion that that force of less than 12,000 men which was available on those figures would not be sufficient for defence in accordance with the policy envisaged by the Government of the day and attempts were made to raise a Volunteer reserve.  The first attempt was made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in raising a Volunteer reserve together with the O.T.C.  The second attempt was made in 1934 in raising the Volunteer force. In those experiments will be found a number of very valuable lessons in regard to the potentialities and practicability of maintaining a reserve of a voluntary nature grafted on to the regular Defence Forces.  I would like to anticipate my argument and say that the lesson of those days is this: there is a limit to the size of the voluntary or Volunteer reserve which you can maintain and that limit is imposed by the size of the permanent force which has <Col N="762" /> to provide the cadres and the training personnel for these units.  In other words, the lesson of those days is that for every unit of your Volunteer reserve, no matter how perfectly you can train them or how enthusiastic the members are, a certain nucleus of regular personnel is required, and if you set the limit to the numbers of your permanent force you automatically set a limit to the size of the Army you can maintain.  It is practically time to report progress, and there is one point which I would make at this stage.</P>
    <P>If before the war, it was found practically impossible to maintain efficiently a Volunteer reserve force of only about 10,000 on that cadre of regulars which was there, how do the figures that we are now contemplating stand in regard to the maintenance of what we are told are a second line reserve&mdash;which is really equivalent to our old Volunteer reserve&mdash;of 48,000?  It is the first figure that hits me here to-night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to raise on the Adjournment the circumstances surrounding the decision of the Government not to send a delegation to the annual International Labour Organisation Conference this year.  That decision, I think, has shocked many people, even amongst supporters of the Government, who are familiar with its implications, and I think it is desirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have the opportunity of giving, or attempting to give, some adequate explanation to the Dáil.  I <Col N="763" /> presume that Deputies are familiar with the character and work of the International Labour Organisation.  It was set up by the Treaty of Versaillcs. It is almost the only thing left that was established by that Treaty.  It was created very largely on the initiative of President Wilson of the United States, who thought that the arrangements for the creation of a system of world peace which the negotiators at Versailles had in mind would be incomplete unless there was associated with them some permanent organisation for securing social justice.</P>
      <P>President Wilson urged upon his fellow negotiators that the main cause of international strife was the divergence of social conditions amongst nations and urged that the interests of peace would be fostered if an international Parliament of Labour was established which would discuss all matters bearing upon the welfare of workers in all countries and endeavour to advance their conditions throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The idea was accepted.  Its acceptance was perhaps influenced by the belief that it was undesirable that nations should seek to secure competitive advantage over one another in international trade by unequal conditions of employment for workers.  It has functioned since then.  This State became associated with the International Labour Organisation simultaneously with accepting membership of the League of Nations and at every international conference since then, excepting two provisional conferences held during the war, this State was represented by a delegation constituted in accordance with the rules of the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year the organisation holds a conference.  That conference is equivalent to a Parliament of Labour, a world Parliament whose concern is the welfare of the workers in all countries, which seeks to secure that there will be established an international code to which all countries shall conform and which would prescribe a minimum of reasonable social conditions and working arrangements for workers.  The annual conference <Col N="764" /> discusses conventions and resolutions and every year a number of new conventions is added to the code of the International Labour Organisation.  These conventions, it is true, are not binding upon Governments unless ratified by them but I think it is true to say that with the passage of years the influence of the International Labour Organisation has grown enormously, grown so greatly that there is in fact a moral compulsion upon domestic governments to accept its conventions and to keep their domestic legislation in accordance with its conventions.</P>
    <P>The growth of the influence of the organisation has been marked by the fact that Ministers of Labour have attended the annual conferences in increasing numbers.  At the first full conference held after the conclusion of the war, the director of the organisation, who, incidentally, is an Irishman, said, and said rightly, that probably little social legislation in the world in the last quarter of a century was not affected by the activities of the International Labour Organisation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had a high reputation with the International Labour Organisation. We have, as I have said, been represented by a full delegation on every occasion.  I cannot remember any year when, for any cause, a full delegation failed to attend, except during the war.  Our delegates have played an important part in the discussions of the conferences.  I think it is true to say that we acquired there an influence far out of proportion to our size.  The delegates of Ireland, despite our relatively small size, with remarkable frequency have been chosen as chairmen and vice-chairmen of the committees of the conferences, and on one occasion an Irish delegate was chosen as president of the conference. We have also, I think, ratified here a very large number of the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and at all times have conscientiously endeavoured to keep our legislation in conformity with the provisions of these conventions.</P>
    <P>This year's conference is being held in San Francisco.  I have been unable to find in the Library any papers relating to its agenda, but my recollection <Col N="765" /> is that the agenda includes a number of matters of importance, including one matter in regard to which I would have thought the trade union organisations of this country would be particularly concerned, that is, the proposal to draft an international convention concerning collective agreements.</P>
    <P>Deputies are perhaps aware that national delegations to the International Labour Conference are composed on a tripartite basis.  A Government is entitled to two delegates subject only to there being sent along with these two Government delegates one delegate representing the organised employers and one delegate representing the organised workers of the country.  The delegates can be, and usually are, accompanied by advisers.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the aims of the International Labour Organisation, to its remarkable record of successful achievement in a sphere in which I would have thought we are all interested, having regard to our long association with it and our high reputation with it, I find the Government's decision not to send a delegation this year to be completely inexplicable.  I could understand it if the Government was hostile to the aims of the organisation and wished to make its hostility clear by refusing to sanction the sending of a delegation.  I could understand it if the Government was dissatisfied with the activities or the method of operation of the organisation.  I do not know if that is so.  If one or other of those reasons has not operated, the decision is completely inexplicable.  It is desirable that any doubt as to the motives which prompted the Government to take this strange decision should be removed by a clear statement by the Minister here to-night.</P>
    <P>I inquired, in the course of a number of Parliamentary Questions to-day, as to what those motives were, without getting any satisfactory reply.  I thought that perhaps the decision not to send a delegation this year was due to the fact that the conference was being held in the United States and that the sending of a delegation there would involve some expenditure of dollars. I have been assured by the <Col N="766" /> Minister that that is not the reason. He stated specifically, in reply to my question as to whether the decision not to send a delegation was due to the fact that the conference was being held in the United States, that the answer to that question was in the negative.</P>
    <P>This decision of the Government, this extraordinary attitude towards the International Labour Organisation Conference, is completely retrograde. I hope that there will exist amongst the Deputies supporting the Government a sufficient number of them who understand its significance, to ensure a revision of the decision.  It is almost inevitable that the position of this country will be misunderstood by the other States, members of the organisation.  It is possible that our position will be misrepresented. The fact that the decision should be taken this year is particularly deplorable, because the International Labour Organisation had to fight for its existence in the years which immediately followed the conclusion of the war.  There was a movement developed to argue that the International Labour Organisation was no longer necessary, that the work it had been doing could be done equally well by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It was only after some thought that the existence of the International Labour Organisation was maintained through the first post-war Conference held in Paris, the first International Conference at which a delegation from this country attended after the conclusion of hostilities.  It was attended by the Minister of Labour from Great Britain, Mr. Isaacs; the Minister for Labour in the United States, Miss Perkins; the Minister for Labour in France and Ministers from other States.  They assured the International Labour Organisation of their determination to maintain support for it and to prevent and defeat any effort to have it replaced by any subordinate organisation of the United Nations.  That movement of hostility, if I may so describe it, to the International Labour Organisation has not yet ended and it is possible that the decision of the Government here not to send a delegation may be <Col N="767" /> interpreted as conveying some support for it in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me that the Director of the International Labour Organisation is being informed by letter that there is no change in outlook here towards the organisation or its activities. Is he going to be given any explanation as to the reasons for this decision and, if so, should not the Dáil be given the reasons?  No satisfactory explanation has yet been offered through the Press or to the Dáil as to the origins of the decision.</P>
    <P>I inquired whether the Minister had consulted with the organisations which normally have the selection of delegates to accompany the Government delegate to the conference, and I was told that no such consultation took place.  The Minister said that that was according to precedent.  I do not know what he had in mind in that reply.  I would like to say, <i>en passant,</i> that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has shown persistent tendencies since he took office to attribute every decision of his to somebody else&mdash;usually to me.  It is about time he began to take decisions on his own responsibility and defend them himself.  In this case, presumably he had some good reason for not sending a delegation, a reason which had nothing to do with precedent.  The decision should have been preceded by consultations with the trade union organisations and the Federation of Employers.  I have endeavoured, in my time in office, to develop the practice of proceeding in all matters affecting the welfare of workers in consultation with trade union organisations. That system of consultation was, perhaps, less easy to maintain because of the division in the trade union movement; and in this matter of selecting delegates to attend the International Labour Conferences, it was not possible to devise any system which would be agreeable to both sections of the trade union movement. I think, however, there should have been consultation and that it was obviously desirable that the views of those organisations should have been before the Government before they <Col N="768" /> arrived at this decision.  If there was a precedent, that need not have bound the Government.  Clearly, they must have considered the advisability of consulting with those organisations before arriving at their decision, and decided against it.  If there was a precedent, the precedent did not let them out of the obligation for consultation. I cannot remember any such precedent.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, a delegation from this country attended the International Labour Organisation conferences in every year except during the war. There were two provisional conferences held during the war, if my memory serves me aright&mdash;one in 1941 and the other in 1944.  We did not send a delegation to these conferences, mainly because of the physical impossibility of getting delegates to them, but also because these conferences were very largely confined to representatives of the Allied States and devoted their attention very largely to preparing plans for post-war recovery, at the request of the Allied Governments. Even so, at the second of these conferences&mdash;that held in Philadelphia in 1944&mdash;we maintained our contact with the organisation by having a partial delegation there&mdash;the Irish Minister at Washington and another official from his office attended the conference.  We could not have a full delegation there, as there was no means of transporting them, but we signified our adherence to the organisation and its aims by having that token representation, if I may so describe it.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Congress of Irish Unions has protested against the Government decision.  I do not know whether the Irish Trade Union Congress or the Federation of Manufacturers have expressed any view on the matter.  I should think it is highly unlikely that, if they were given the opportunity to express a view, they consented to the decision not to send a delegation.  I would be interested to know if they did, in fact, convey a view to the Government, even though the Government did not invite their opinion.  The decision was so obviously wrong&mdash;perhaps taken hastily, perhaps taken with some mistaken opinion as <Col N="769" /> to the importance of the organisation&mdash; that it should be revised and altered. There is still time to do it.  It is still possible to get delegates selected and sent to the conference and I think that it would be a far wiser course for the Government to take its courage in its hands and reverse its decision, rather than break our long association with that conference or risk the possibility of misrepresentation arising from its decision.</P>

      <P>I am sure we are all obliged to Deputy Lemass for giving us so much information about the International Labour Organisation and all it has achieved and has sought to achieve. If one did not know Deputy Lemass, one would, having listened to him for the last 20 minutes, come to the conclusion that in raising this matter he was concerned only with the prestige of the International Labour Organisation and with the welfare of the trade unions here at home in Ireland.  But we know Deputy Lemass too long and too well to accept that.  Twice during the course of his speech the Deputy expressed a fear that our position in relation to this matter might be misrepresented. The only ground that could exist for that fear would be that our position will be misrepresented by the people sitting opposite to us, and particularly by Deputy Lemass himself. I do not fear that there will be any misrepresentation from any other quarter in this country or outside the country.</P>
      <P>This matter has been raised by Deputy Lemass as part of the campaign of mischief.  Deputy Lemass is not one bit concerned whether we send delegates to the International Labour Organisation Conference or not, but he is very concerned in furthering the Fianna Fáil conspiracy of creating industrial unrest in this country.  I would like to ask the Deputy when he and his colleagues and the organ which he now controls propose to put an end to those fifth column tactics.</P>

It was always well able to look after itself before ever Deputy Lemass came into this House or became a Minister. It was only when he started interfering with it that the trouble started.  For the sake of the trade union movement he ought to leave it alone, instead of trying to widen the cleavage.  If he left it alone, then perhaps we might be able to bring about a reunification. The second reason is that we cannot afford to spend thousands of dollars in sending a delegation to San Francisco.</P>

There was no delegation sent in 1944 and there was no prior consultation with the unions.

      <P>The matter is under consideration. Superannuation allowances granted to employees of local authorities can be adjusted in certain cases in which service ceased after the 1st July, 1940, and the remuneration on which the allowances were based was affected by the standstill Orders.  There is, however, no provision for the adjustment of pensions of local employees generally and any proposals for such adjustment would have to be examined as part of the larger question of the adjustment of pensions of superannuated employees of public authorities including State employees.</P>
