      <P>Do réir mar adubhras i mí na Bealtaine seo caithte le linn do mheastacháin mo Roinne-se do bheith ós cóir na Dála, cuireadh ceathrar cigirí thart ar roinnt de na bunscoileanna chun eolas áirithe a bhailiú dhom i dtaobh teagaisg na Gaedhilge.  hIarradh ar na cigirí fiosrú a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi a raibh an rialúchán i dtaobh úsáide na Gaedhilge ins na rannga naoínán ag oibriú amach agus le n-a chois sin taighdeadh a dhéanamh ar theagasg tré Ghaedhilge i límistéir mar a bhfuil an Béarla ina theangain teaghlaigh agus coidrimh ag na daoine uile.</P>
      <P>Thug na cigirí cuairt ar scoileanna i gCathair Átha Cliath agus i gCathair Luimnigh, agus ar scoileanna ins na condaethe seo&mdash;Áth Cliath, Lughbhaidh, Muineachán, Cábhan, Midhe, Sligeach, Roscomán, Gaillimh, Uí Fháilghe, Tiobrad Árann, Clár, Laoighis, Cill Chainnigh&mdash;naoi scoileanna ar fhichid ar fad.  Chuireadar ábhar an fhiosruithe tré chéile leis na múinteoirí i ngach scoil acu sin agus thugadar deis do na múinteoirí a chur in iúl cé na constaicí atá san tslí orthu agus cé mar atá ag éirghe leo duanghaois na Roinne i dtaobh na Gaedhilge do thabhairt chun críche ins na scoileanna.</P>

Dá bhrí sin, rinneadh athrú beag ins na Nótaí atá ag gabháil le Clár na Naoínán.  Sé bhí ins na sean-nótaí &ldquo;Is i nGaedhilge a déanfar an obair go léir i mbuidheanta na Naoínán má's leor chuige cáilíocht na Múinteoirí&rdquo;.  Sé tá ins na nótaí nua &ldquo;I ngach scoil ina bhfuil dóthain cáilíochta chuige acu, sé an aidhm is ceart a bheith ag na múinteoirí an pointe a shroisint, chomh luath agus is féidir é, ina bhféadfaí an Ghaedhilge amháin a úsáid san naí-scoil mar theangain choidrimh agus theagaisg&rdquo;. De thoradh an athruithe sin beidh rialúchán na Roinne agus an rud a thárluíonn dárírí ins na scoltacha ag teacht le chéile thar mar bhíodh roimhe seo.  Le cois an athruithe bhig sin, tá cead anois Béarla do bheith ar siúl ar feadh leath-uaire a' chluig sa ló i scoil ar bith ina dteastuíonn ón mBainisteoir an scéal do bheith amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>I gcás an teagaisg tré Ghaedhilge ins na rannga eile, thug na cigirí eolas antábhachtach dom ina dtuarascáil, ach ní mheasaim gur gá éinní a dhéanamh faoi'n taobh sin den obair go fóill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the land allotted to the tenants on the Meredith estate, Dicksgrove, County Kerry, in 1938 was not properly drained by the Land Commission; that these tenants cannot utilise the turf banks on the estate owing to the lack of drainage facilities and are compelled to purchase turbary five miles distant; and, if so, whether he will take steps to have the lands properly drained at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Meredith estate comprises 220 acres, of which only 11 acres are bog.  It was divided in 1938, and the greater part of it has been revested in the allottees.  In 1938, the Land Commission drained the bog and they carried out additional drainage works in 1941.  The Land Commission do not propose to drain this bog again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the drainage work to which he has referred was not a success?  It was not completed, and there is no hope of any relief from whatever drainage was carried through at that particular time.  Is the Minister aware that these tenants have to travel from five to seven miles for turbary on another estate?  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the matter in view of these <Col N="1372" /> facts?  I visited this place, and I am aware that 11 tenants cannot utilise the turf banks because of lack of drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Once turbary or land is vested in an allottee, our responsibility to those to whom we allot the land or bog ceases, and from then on it is a matter for the Special Employment Schemes Office.  We spent money in this area in 1938 on the occasion of the allotment, and again in 1941.  After that the bog was vested in the 11 tenants.  The Deputy should take the matter up with the Special Employment Schemes Office now, because our responsibility is finished.</P>

(Minister for Agriculture), to purchase on behalf of his Department unlimited quantities of oats, while other appointed buyers in the constituency of East Donegal advertised that they had been appointed to buy on behalf of Grain Importers (Éire), Limited; whether, in fact, the advertisement was issued under his authority or that of Grain Importers (Éire), Limited; and, if so, if he will explain the reasons for this departure from precedent in the use of the Minister's personal name in this advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only agent so far appointed for the purchase of oats from growers in County Galway is Messrs.  Garvey, Limited, The Mills, Tuam.</P>
      <P>Applications from other firms are, however, being considered with a view to appointment if they have proper storage and other facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that only one agent has been appointed, and that Galway is such a very large county, does the Minister not think that there has been undue delay in appointing <Col N="1374" /> others?  Mr. Garvey was appointed three weeks ago, and I would like to know if it was intended that growers from areas such as Gort, Portumna and Ballinasloe should deliver their oats a distance of 40 to 60 miles?  Will the Minister assure me that other agents will be appointed?  I can guarantee that there are men in the county who have been in the corn trade for a considerable number of years, and have sufficient storage accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to reassure the Deputy (1) that the quantity of oats now buyable for 28/- in County Galway is mighty small because the people are coming to realise that they would be much better advised to use them themselves; and I am further happy to reassure the Deputy (2) that under this Government there will be no monopolies, and that every oats dealer in Galway and every other part of the country who has the minimum requirements for the safe conservation of oats will be licensed on application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference I draw from the Minister's reply to my supplementary question is that the appointment of one agent in Galway was for the purpose of facilitating dealers who bought oats cheaply rather than farmers who have oats on hands to dispose of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will undertake to have a thorough investigation made of the <Col N="1375" /> cost of production in the pig raising and fattening industry, such investigation to include (1) pigs fed entirely on meal mixture, and (2) pigs fed on a mixture of meals, separated milk and potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The relative values of meals, separated milk and potatoes for pig feeding have already been fully investigated by my Department.  I would refer the Deputy to the many articles on this subject in my Department's journal.  Costing for pig rearing under the infinitely various conditions obtaining on the various types of farm in Ireland are not ascertainable with any degree of accuracy, but there can be no doubt that at present the production and feeding of pigs is a very satisfactory business undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when last week a Deputy on these benches comprehensively and conscientiously prepared the costings of pig production, according to the figures available to him, the Minister ridiculed these figures?  Is there any reason why the Minister should not produce his own official figures prepared by his own Department which nobody could dispute?  That is all this question asked for&mdash;and it is a reasonable request&mdash;that the Department will produce its own figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sorry if I gave anybody the impression that I was concerned to ridicule any costings prepared by a Deputy or by anybody else.  The Deputy is mistaken if he thinks I ridiculed them, but I rejected them because I did not believe they were correct.  If the Deputy will look at the journal of my Department in Volume 35, No. 1; Volume 14, No. 3; Volume 13, No. 3, and Volume 9, No. 3, he will find the most exhaustive experiments described in the feeding of pigs with every sort of combination of feeding-stuffs.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me if the Department would produce costings over which they could stand. That is our precise difficulty.  I do not think it would be possible to produce costings over which the Department could stand as reliable for every farm, owing to the various conditions under which pigs are reared on the various types of farms in the country.</P>

      <P>The payment of the claim mentioned and a number of other similar claims has been delayed because of great pressure of work in my Department during recent months.  It is hoped to have all these outstanding claims paid within the next few weeks.  As of April 1st, 1948, there were outstanding from the previous year's scheme 32,000 applications.  All these arrears had to be cleared up at the same time as applications under the 1948/49 Scheme were being examined and sent to the outdoor staff for execution.  These immense arrears are now under control and it is hoped that no delays of this character will recur.</P>

      <P>The question raised by the Deputy is entirely a military one.  We have a very small Army Survey Unit.  The officer commanding this unit has recently undergone a military survey course in England, but both he and his unit lack practical experience of the particular aspect of military survey on which they are at present engaged.</P>
      <P>Once our military survey personnel have completed the present task, they will have had sufficient experience to enable them to undertake similar duties in future.</P>

      <P>I have read the report referred to.  Two officers, whose ranks are commandant and captain, attended a training exercise in Northern Ireland recently.  The invitation was received from the British military <Col N="1391" /> authorities.

      <P>The selection of areas for rural or other development is a matter for the board, but in this case I have ascertained from the board that the area was considered in July last, but was not selected owing to the low ratio of estimated total fixed charge revenue in the area to the estimated total capital cost of the necessary network. A re-canvass has, I am informed, since been carried out, and the area redesigned and costed, but the new ratio is not sufficiently good to justify the selection at present of the area for rural development.</P>

      <P>The distribution of sugar manufactured from the 1947 beet crop commenced in January, 1948.  In the intervening period to date the average price received by the company for all sugar imported as well as manufactured from the 1947 beet crop was 56/10 a cwt.  It is not practicable to state separately the price received by the company for sugar manufactured from the 1947 beet crop.  It is too early yet to say what price will be received for sugar distributed when the manufacture of the 1948 crop has been completed.</P>

      <P>A special price of 7½d. a lb. for sugar was first charged to manufacturers who use that commodity as a raw material as from the 1st June, 1947, and indefinite continuance of this arrangement was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in Dáil Éireann in May last.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is ambiguous.  The Order under which a special price for sugar is charged to jam manufacturers was made in June, 1947.  The Orders made this year in July and September covered the provision of sugar to private individuals for jam making and harvesting and did not apply to jam manufacturers.  If the Deputy will indicate more precisely the information he wishes to obtain I will endeavour to give it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1948 season 213,584 cwts. of sugar were sold for jam-making to private individuals and 4,374 cwts. were sold for harvesting operations.  This sugar was invoiced by the company at 65/4 a cwt. and of this amount 12/10 a cwt. will be paid into the Exchequer as an Extra Receipt on the account of the Vote for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I am unable to give the information sought by the Deputy in the case of catering establishments because no period has been specified in the question, and, even if the period had been indicated in the case of the condensed milk company, I would not have been prepared to give the information as it is not the practice to supply such details in respect of an individual concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of the market value of a house for the purpose of determining the amount of the loan which may be advanced therefor under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts is a function of the responsible housing authority and is not subject to any statutory review by me.  No complaints of the nature referred to have been made officially to the Department but I understand that some such representations have been made to the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council and are at present being considered.</P>
      <P>The local housing authorities are obliged to take all reasonable and necessary measures to safeguard the funds which they have to provide for this service.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that owing to the method adopted by the valuers, one valuer has valued a house at £1,850 and another valuer the same house at £1,600, which means that persons wanting to avail of the Act to build houses which the Minister is so eager about have to find a difference of £200 and cannot do it?  Will the Minister consider the advisability of getting the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; withdrawn from the regulations because if only 80 per cent. of the market value is advanced the scheme will fail?  It cannot continue in Dublin unless a change is made.  I appeal to the Minister to make further inquiries so as to see that something will be done to allow these houses to be completed.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil adjourned on Friday I was dealing with the proposal to extend the provisions of the Defence Forces Act to 31st March, 1950.  I expressed my objection to this continuing series of Bills being introduced for the purpose of continuing an Act which, in its nature, was temporary when introduced 25 years ago.  This 1923 Act is responsible to a large extent for the fact that the Army is under strength at the moment and that it is incapable of performing any of the functions that, in the ordinary way, should be assigned to it.  I just glanced over this 1923 Act, introduced, as I say, in a rush, and I looked at the 5th Schedule of that Act which makes provision for the billeting of officers and soldiers.  Introduced as it was in 1923, that particular Schedule made provision for the meals that would be given to officers and soldiers billeted on the populace.  It provided that for breakfast five ounces of bread, one pint of tea with milk and sugar and four ounces of bacon would be provided for every officer or soldier and it contained this very extraordinary provision: when an officer or soldier is not entitled to be furnished with a meal the keeper of a victualling house shall furnish the officer or soldier with candles, vinegar and salt and allow him the use of a fire and the necessary utensils for dressing and eating a meal.  That in itself is an indication of that particular Act, which was the British Army Act dressed up in a hurry to provide for the government and administration of our Defence Forces.  As I have said, and has been said in this House many times over the past quarter of a century, that Act is unsuitable.  That Act should be revised and this House should have an opportunity of bringing into force an up-to-date Defence Forces Act that would govern and provide for the government of the Army, justly and fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> When I spoke on this matter before I dealt with court martial procedure, and I am glad to say that the Minister since that has made arrangements for its improvement and some of the very objectionable features to which I referred have been removed, but still there are provisions in this Act that are unjust and unfair.  For example, if damage should be done in a barrack and if no person can be found to have done that damage, the Act provides that every soldier in the unit must put his hand in his pocket and pay for it. There is no question of his having any say in the matter; the amount he is required to contribute towards compensation for barrack damages must be paid by him.  The Act did provide that that damage should be occasioned by the wilful act or negligence of a person or persons who cannot be identified, but that particular provision that it is wilful damage seems to have been forgotten and the result is that quite extensive maintenance works are done from time to time at the expense of units in occupation.</P>
    <P>The Act also contains another very objectionable provision, a provision whereby the Minister can, by Order, provide for the deduction from the pay of an officer or soldier of specific amounts for particular purposes.  My experience is that something like this happens: There is an accident, maybe an ordinary collision, in which a military vehicle is involved.  That matter may be dealt with in the ordinary courts, but there is an inquiry into it afterwards.  Evidence is taken and a letter is generally sent out by the secretarial end of the Department to the particular officer or soldier, telling him that unless he agrees to pay a particular sum the Minister will make an Order deducting that sum from his pay.  I consider that a very objectionable provision.  I consider that if we had an opportunity of going through this Act, section by section, we would not give to the Minister such power. The actual decision is taken in every case by a civil servant, who threatens the officer or soldier with the powers the Minister will exercise, and when it is sent to the Minister it appears to be an automatic action on his part <Col N="1407" /> to sign this decision of some civilian member of the Department of Defence. In all the cases I know of, once it reached the Minister the Order was made as a matter of course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an objectionable feature of this Act and if I were to take the time to go through that Act, as I might do, I would surprise this House with the number of instances where injustice can be done to officers and soldiers under its provisions. I make the case that the disgruntled state of the Army, the disgruntled state of officers, N.C.O.s and men, is due in a large measure to this unsatisfactory Act which should have been changed long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides for disciplinary punishment of a summary nature.  It provides maximum penalties, detention up to 28 days, and detention for a period of 28 days means the loss of pay during the period of detention.  I remember lectures being given to officers who had the responsibility of imposing these punishments pointing out that the penalties laid down in the Act were maximum penalties, but the general practice, the substantial practice, was to impose the maximum penalties rather than some lesser penalties in the same scale.  The punitive provisions the provisions in relation to stoppages from pay and the fines which could be imposed&mdash;all these things have helped to sour the Army, with the result that, when the emergency was over, there was a rush on the part of everybody who could get away from the Army.  That has this detrimental effect, that the thousands of men who served in the emergency went home dissatisfied.  They spoke about these conditions in their homes, in publichouses and in various places where they met together and the result is that, on the part of the young men <Col N="1408" /> of the country, there is now no desire to join the Army or to have anything to do with the Army.  These provisions I have mentioned in the old Act have helped substantially to cause that spirit of dissatisfaction in the Army which has made recruiting an impossibility.</P>
    <P>There are in the old Act provisions relating to promotions, and the Act authorises regulations to be made in that regard.  There has been great dissatisfaction, particularly in the commissioned ranks, in regard to promotions. During the emergency period certain promotions were made from the Reserve and Volunteer forces, but the surprising thing was that the few high promotions that were made were not at all welcomed by the defence forces as a whole.  There was a feeling, and I am sorry that it should have arisen, that a man's political viewpoint was of considerable importance in getting him promoted to a very high rank.  That is one thing which must not be allowed to happen in the defence forces.  It would be much better for the country as a whole and for the defences forces if promotions could be made in such a way that everybody would be satisfied that the promotion was due to military efficiency and ability.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keane completely misunderstands me.  If I should say anything anywhere in regard to the officer he has mentioned, it would be <Col N="1409" /> to pay him the highest possible tributes as a very efficient officer and I think that would be the viewpoint of everybody who had the good fortune to serve with him at any time during the past quarter of a century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely essential that the matter of promotions should be based on military knowledge and efficiency and it would be wrong if the feeling got abroad&mdash;whether it was correct or not&mdash;that promotion was dependent on a person's political views or the influence of his political friends. If we had a Bill going through dealing entirely with the Defence Forces, and if we had an opportunity of revising this old Act of 1923, I think we would be able to put in provisions which would make it impossible for any complaint to be made or any misunderstanding to arise on these lines.</P>
      <P>I spoke here on the previous day with regard to the military members of the Council of Defence and Deputy Vivion de Valera interjected that the Minister would have an opportunity of defending them.  The suggestion which may arise from that interjection was that I was making some unfair attack on these officers.  I want to disabuse the Deputy's mind on that point and to make my own position with regard to it perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, provision is made for a three years' period of office for the military members of the Council of Defence.  This House passed that Act in 1923 and it was put into force and kept in force from 1923 until after the <Col N="1410" /> change of Government in 1932.  For some unexplainable reason, the new Government did not adhere to the provisions of that Act, except in this regard, that, when the period of three years had expired, they reappointed the particular officer for a further period of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy gave us that at some length already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want just to deal with the particular point now.  It was necessary to refer to it in that way. As far as the particular members of the Council of Defence are concerned at the moment&mdash;the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General&mdash;I would say this, for myself, that when these officers were appointed and at the time they were appointed, I was perfectly satisfied that they were the best appointments that could be made at the time.  I hope Deputy Major de Valera will not consider that as an attack on these particular officers. That was my view, from my own particular knowledge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor here mentioned certain matters on which he had been advised by the Army Headquarters Staff.  The present Minister for Defence, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, said he had been advised on matters which appeared, on the face of it, to be in conflict.  There are quite a number of other matters that I could refer to in which different advice was given to different Ministers.  One was in regard to the age limits of officers.  Prior to the change of Government an age limit was put into operation and was enforced, and I take it that that age limit was recommended to the Minister by the Army Staff in the best interests of the Defence Forces.  Since the change of Government the present Minister has, very wisely and very properly, amended the age-limit provisions and extended the period of service of certain officers.  I think we can accept it that the Minister did not do that on his own, that the Army Headquarters agreed with him that it was the correct thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the position in regard to Captain Curran, of the Magazine Fort <Col N="1411" /> case, dismissed ignominiously by one Minister and one Government&mdash;I take it, with the approval of the Army Staff at the time&mdash;and, after a change of Government, reinstated with all the honours that could be given to him, and properly given to him&mdash;and very likely, at least I assume so, that was done by the Minister on his own authority but with the approval and with the advice of the Army Staff. These things establish, one point of view conclusively, that the Vice-President of the Executive Council in 1923 was perfectly right when he provided a period of three years' office for these particular officers.</P>
    <P>Now, the Bill that we are discussing at the moment makes provision for the extension of service beyond 21 years in the, case of non-commissioned officers and men, it makes provision for the extension of service for a period of 10 years beyond 21 years, that is, it makes provision for an extension to cover a total period of Army service of 31 years in the case of a soldier.  I would like to know whether such a scheme was recommended by the Army Council to the previous Minister.  I take it that, when it is here before us, it is the recommendation of the present Army Council to the present Minister.  But where are the ideas we had, the ideas expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, that the new Army in this country was to be a young man's Army?  I am not taking any objection to this amendment.  I know that there are very sound reasons why certain soldiers should have the period extended to 31 years, in certain cases. The whole trouble is that there has been so much toying with the ideas of the Army over all these years.  A civilian Minister, a Government, can control the Army to a large extent from the point of view of the public purse; but beyond that, the Army should be governed and controlled by its own Army Staff, subject to the law laid down by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I said on a previous occasion that it ought to be our aim and ambition to prevent the Army being the plaything, the toy, of political Parties and political ideas.  I do not see that we can do that <Col N="1412" /> if, every few years, with every change of Minister, we have completely new views in regard to matters that can be considered policy.</P>
    <P>We have several Reserve forces at the moment.  The original Army Act provided that no person would be on the Reserve unless that person served for a period in Army service, and was transferred to the reserve as a trained soldier.  That was the original conception. But then, about 20 years ago, we began to monkey with the Act, and we made provision whereby you enlisted a man for a day in the Army, and you transferred him to the reserve then.  That was only monkeying with the Act then.  It was in pursuance of that monkeying that attempts were made to build up an officers' training corps in the different universities.  It was not welcome at the time to some individuals, that formation of an officers' training corps; but, nevertheless, there have been developments and amendments of the Act dealing with this question of the Reserve, and now we have different classes of the reserve.  What their numbers are I do not know at the moment, but as to whether that Reserve is an officient force, an effective force, whether it is capable of doing the work that it is supposed to do, these are matters that are of importance to us as a Parliament.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that when these new Reserves, or Local Defence Force, or Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, were being built up, there would be available to assist them in their training and in their administration all those officers and soldiers who had served with distinction in the Army for a great number of years.  Across in Britain, even in America, with its present ideas in regard to world conflict, they are quite pleased and anxious to have the assistance of every person who is trained as a soldier and an officer. But what did we do with them?  The moment a soldier or officer had completed his period of Army service, we gave him a pension, we put him out, and we made no provision whereby he would be liable for military service in the future.  I say to the Minister that <Col N="1413" /> there is a great waste of public time in the training of these men and a great waste of public moneys if those officers and soldiers are not to be made available for the defence of the State until they reach, say, 65 years of age.  Up to that age they can render valuable service as administrative officers in charge of depôts, as police officers, stores officers and can fill a hundred and one important posts that can be filled successfully only by steady officers and soldiers of their experience. I am to make this recommendation to the Minister, that he should introduce provisions whereby these officers and soldiers would be made available for service in those defence reserve organisations until such time as they have helped to build up an effective and efficient reserve.</P>
    <P>It has been said here hundreds of times that we cannot afford a large standing army.  That is perfectly clear. We cannot do it.  We must do the next best things, which is to build up a citizen force.  The only way that can be done is to have available all the trained material that, very fortunately, there is in the country.  I know quite a number of officers who served in the Old Reserve, as it was called.  There are roughly about 100 of them now.  The great majority of them had been Old I.R.A. officers.  They had served for a period of seven or eight years in the Regular Army.  They had served a period of ten years on the Reserve, doing a month's excellent training every year.  They came up at the commencement of the emergency and served with distinction during it.  At that time the idea was that on retirement from the regular forces you went on the Reserve and remained on the Reserve until you reached a certain prescribed age limit.  Completely out of the blue, the late Government provided that the age limits for the Reserve would be the same as for the Regular Army.  The services of these officers, after all those years, were lost. I would appeal to the Minister not to follow that short-sighted policy, but to go back to the original conception and make use of all those officers and soldiers until they reach the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> That brings me to the matter of defence policy&mdash;something that we never had, as far as I know, except during the last war when the policy of this State was a policy of neutrality. That was a clear, well-defined policy and there was built up here a magnificent force to preserve that neutrality at all costs.  What is our policy at the moment?  What is the policy of the Government in regard to the Army? What is their policy in regard to another war?  Is our defence policy a policy of neutrality?  If it is, we must build up the forces to maintain that neutrality.  The only way in which we can do that is by making available all that splendid, trained material that is there only waiting to be harnessed and organised.  Will it be the policy of our defence forces that we must reintegrate our national territory by military force?  Is that the policy of the defence forces?  Is it to be built and organised for that purpose?  Is the Department of Defence to take no official notice of that particular position? We can be insulted, we have been insulted, by the Ministers of the Six County Government.  Are we to take those insults lying down?  I would ask the Minister to consider that it is unfair to an Army Headquarters Staff not to have a specific policy for the armed forces of the State.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that at the present juncture in our history, provision should be made by the Minister and by the Government that arms would be available in every house in this country, that our young men, through rifle competitions and otherwise, would be trained in the use of arms, that in the event of an invasion of this country, our young men would fight on every hill, at every cross-roads.  We know we cannot build up a defence force that will go out and meet the invaders here or there, but we must make it costly for them to land anywhere, to move anywhere. We can only do that by having every young man in the country armed and available to fight under local leaders.  Any other defence policy, in my view, is a wasteful policy.  Any other defence policy, in my view, would be a failure.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that in introducing this <Col N="1415" /> Bill the Minister would have told us how many men are serving in the Army at the moment, how many officers, how many N.C.O.s and how many soldiers are in it; and whether they are able to carry out any course of training whatsoever.  I hope that, in replying, he will give that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  However, as regards the particular Bill, I would have liked to have had readily available information as to the present strength in ranks of the Army.  The Minister did tell us that there were approximately 4,000 deserters from the Defence Forces during the emergency.</P>
      <P>By accident, I came across a copy of the <i>Irish Times</i> published in 1943 &mdash; I just found it in my Defence Forces Act, and how it got in there I do not know.  This copy of the <i>Irish Times</i> is dated October 29th, 1943, and it reports proceedings here when the Minister for Defence was introducing the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  This question of desertion was being discussed.  According to the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Mr. Traynor said the impression seemed to be that there were large-scale desertions in the Army.  I was surprised to be informed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it represents I per cent. of the total strength, and is something that we need not have to worry about.&rdquo;  Let us calculate.  Four thousand deserters, calculated as 1 per cent., represent a defence force of 400,000 men.  Now, obviously the information given to Deputy Traynor at that time, and which he gave to the House, was inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Four thousand men&mdash;that represents the total desertion from the beginning to the end of the emergency, and 1943 was in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say 1943 was sufficiently near the end.  Four thousand deserters, calculated as 1 per cent., would represent an army of 400,000.  I have yet to learn that we <Col N="1416" /> had that many armed men in our services during the emergency.  There is a very useful heading in that paper to that report.  It says, &ldquo;No Backdoor Promotions in the Army.&rdquo;  I have commented on the matter of promotions and I will not comment on that heading.</P>
      <P>The Minister is getting this Bill&mdash;at least, I expect he will get it&mdash;from the House.  It will bring this Temporary Provisions Act to the 31st March, 1950. No man knows better than the Minister the defects of this Army Act.  Nobody knows better than the Minister how necessary it is to have this Army Act revised.  I ask the Minister to press on the Headquarters Staff to provide a draft for him of this new Defence Forces Bill as early as possible.  I do not know whether I will be in this House in 1950, but if I am, I hope sincerely that it will not be my duty to spend another hour criticising this Defence Forces Act.  Deputy Traynor at one time told us the draft was ready and from my own knowledge I am aware that it was ready some 20 years ago.  Why there is this objection to bringing in a Bill that will remove so many anomalies, do away with so many injustices, and make provision for a contented Defence Force, I cannot understand.  I make a special appeal to the Minister, as one who is very sincerely interested in the welfare of the Defence Forces and who is anxious to give the Minister every assistance, to make up his mind that this is the last time when a Temporary Provisions Bill will be introduced here by him as Minister, or by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with some of the matters raised by Deputy Cowan, I should like to comment on the Bill more narrowly than he did.  Generally speaking, it simply continues Army legislation for another year and introduces some relatively minor amendments, but Section 8, although in its nature it is a relatively minor amendment, nevertheless perturbs a number of Deputies here, and for this reason.  Apparently in introducing this section, the Minister has some definite purpose in mind.  I take it that he and the Department did not <Col N="1417" /> go to the trouble of incorporating a provision or pardon merely from general compassionate motives without having a particular contingency in mind.  From that alone, I am inclined to conclude that there must have been some particular cases or general situation that the Minister thought it desirable to meet; in other words, it seems to me to imply that there are other people in the barred categories already in State employment, or there are people in these categories seeking employment now whom the Minister would like to facilitate.</P>
      <P>The events of the war have passed and I would not recommend anything savouring of vindictiveness to anybody in this House; but it is not from that point of view that I object to the provision. I object to it from this angle. A number of soldiers, reservists and emergency, and discharged regular soldiers, have given loyal and faithful service to the State from the time they joined the Army until they left it. These men who served during the emergency and did not leave, these men particularly of the Reserve or emergency who reported for training and service and who served until they were duly discharged, have a claim on us.  To my knowledge, many of these ex-soldiers are in need of employment. If my first deduction is right, there are vacancies which they would be entitled to in priority to people who deserted or failed to answer the call.  For that reason, I do not so much oppose this measure as think it unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, if we have appointments in the State service or where the State has influence or some control, and if these appointments are available to men who deserted or failed to answer the calling-up notices, then these appointments are equally available to ex-soldiers who served and discharged the liability which they incurred by volunteering and serving during the emergency.  These men have a prior claim, and, on their behalf, now, I put it to the Minister that, whatever may be said for granting pardons or removing the disabilities of people in a certain category, our first duty is to put such appointments as are available at <Col N="1418" /> the disposal of ex-soldiers who have served.  There are certain organisations of these ex-soldiers recognised by the Minister's Department&mdash;more than one, I understand.  The Minister, or anyone interested in the State service, can easily get the necessary personnel, whether they be technicians or common labourers, from amongst those who served during the emergency.  In dealing with this section, the first thing I want to stress is the prior claim of these men who served loyally, and who have a claim prior to anybody who did not serve, particularly against those who broke their contract of service, whether by desertion or by failing to answer the calling-up notice.  The Minister mentioned at one stage&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong in this&mdash;that we did not know whether all these people got their calling-up notices or not.  The Minister will pardon the expression, but that does not wash, for the simple reason if a man joins the Army&mdash;and he could not get a calling-up notice until he joined the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying that.  What I am saying is that to become a reservist in any category, he must have joined the Army.  If he joined the Army, we must assume that he did so with his eyes open, knowing what he was doing, understanding the liability which he was incurring, and, presumably, most of these men actually did a certain amount of training.  I think people who did not do certain training were not called up in many instances, but from the mere fact that he joined in the first instance, we must take it that a man knew what he was doing.  He voluntarily undertook this duty.  Very well; he did not require any special notice in 1939 and 1940 to know that there was a general call-up. I would say, whatever the law of the <Col N="1419" /> situation has been, the equity of the situation was that anyone who had previously joined had a duty, at least, to find out whether he was to report or not.  Therefore, it is hardly an excuse to say that because a man did not get, as an individual, a calling-up notice in 1940 he could not be expected to offer himself for service.  He must have known.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with that but what I am saying is that there is hardly much ground for distinguishing between the man who failed to answer the call and who deserted <i>ab initio</i> and the other man who answered for a period and then cleared off.  Personally I do not want to face the section on the single issue of excusing or relieving certain penalties that have been imposed.  In principle, I have some doubts as to its wisdom, having regard to the fact that one must hold that military service is the responsibility of anybody who incurs liability to serve and that we cannot countenance the failure of a person who repudiates that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of principle, I have grave doubts as to whether we should pass this section but, for the moment, I am waiving these doubts and granting to the Minister that there is something in the point that it is equitable to remove that particular liability.  Supposing I go so far as to say: &ldquo;All right we shall pass this section,&rdquo; what I really want to insist upon is that apparently there is State employment available, if not direct State employment in the narrow sense, State employment within the contemplation of the section, and the Orders in question.  That employment has <Col N="1420" /> already, in fact, been secured by people in these categories.  If such employment is still available, I strongly recommend to the Minister that it should be confined to people who have served loyally for the period they were held to the colours, that, in other words, a good discharge should be a prerequisite to secure these appointments. If, on the other hand, there are people in this category already in that type of employment, then obviously there has been to date a serious breach of the conditions laid down by the Government of the day; there has been something wrong in the administrative machine if certain people who were not entitled to them, in fact procured appointments to which other people were entitled.</P>
    <P>People who have served have a prior claim.  I would go practically so far as to say that there should be positions for people who served.  Further, if it can be brought home to any official or administrative body that such persons were knowingly employed, in breach of the said provisions, then I suggest it is time for disciplinary action.  It is not merely a problem of the past; it is a problem that the Minister's Government or other future Governments may have to face.  If we are not loyal to people who gave loyal service to us, then we can hardly expect the return which we will need in times of emergency.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, would press the Minister, in dealing with this section, to consider the point which I have raised, the question of ex-soldiers.  There are organisations available who will give particulars of these men and there should be no trouble in getting suitable candidates, whether technicians or otherwise.  Unless it can be positively shown that nobody except a certain individual, because of some particular personal qualification of a technical nature, is suitable for a particular post, the provisions of this section should not be fully availed of, if passed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very much left in the Bill before us for special comment except perhaps one matter.  The provision for transferring an officer of one <Col N="1421" /> type of reserve to another is, I think, a wise one.  It is no harm to have it at the Minister's discretion to transfer an officer from one category of the reserve to another.  However, it perturbs me a little to feel that perhaps this section has come into the Bill because the Minister is so pressed for reserve officers that he is going to have to call on the L.D.F., both for regular and first-line units.  If that is the situation, it is a serious one.  The local defence officer will normally be of a good type.  He will possibly have greater potentialities than officers in other categories, but even admitting that, he suffers from the defect of time &mdash;the time he will have for training&mdash; and the fact that he is so much absorbed in civilian employment while training.</P>
    <P>There is also the tactical consideration that nowadays there is definite room for L.D.F., apart from first-line troops, who require their own officers and their own standards.  You cannot sacrifice one category for the other.  In these circumstances, if this provision really represents a weakness in our first-line officers, if it is a stop-gap measure to transfer officers, who have secured commissions through local training in the L.D.F., to the first-line reserve, then, I think, we have a serious problem to consider and we shall have to raise the whole question as to how the first-line reserve of officers is to be built up.  It may be&mdash; I am not throwing my weight on one side or other of the argument&mdash;that initially it would be a good thing to take officers from the L.D.F., transfer them to the first-line reserve and then train them further, or it may be a good thing to select officers, say on a short-term service in the regular Army. The point that I would like to make is this: that, first, if that is the reason why the section has crept into this Bill, then, obviously, it is high time to consider how we are to have a first-line reserve of officers.  That first-line reserve must be energetically organised and trained to be, in fact, a first-line reserve, in other words, to provide officers who can officer first-line units alongside regular Army officers with a <Col N="1422" /> minimum period of delay after mobilisation to take the field in all mobile operations as first-line troops. Secondly, if then you are to take L.D.F., officers and transfer them to the first-line reserve in order to fill deficiencies in numbers, I would suggest to the Minister that he must go a little bit further.  It will not be sufficient simply to effect a transfer on paper without certain specific further training in order to make these officers capable of fulfilling their rôle with first-line troops rather than with Local Defence troops.  That specific training should be provided for.  I hope I am wrong in thinking that there is some reason like that impelling the Minister to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am.  In any event, I think it is a good thing to provide that the Minister should have the power of exchange.  I will confine myself to the last recommendation that, if it is necessary to transfer L.D.F. officers to the first-line reserve, the necessary further training should be given to them in circumstances that will enable them to profit by it, having regard to their previous employment, and that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the Bill does not call for very much comment.  The extension of service has already been dealt with by others.  The strength of the Defence Forces has given many people cause for worry, particularly the strength of the Reserve, but these are matters that probably had better be gone into on the Estimate for the Department rather than in this debate. On last year's Estimate, I dealt with them to some extent.  I shall reserve what I have to say on them until the Estimate for the Department is before us next year.  I would ask the Minister if, before the Estimate comes up for discussion, we could have the available data upon which to discuss constructively the question of the strength and composition of our Defence Forces, and of their equipment.  Strictly speaking, I suppose that is all that really arises on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, other speakers, and particularly <Col N="1423" /> the last speaker, dealt with matters of broader import.  The Council of Defence has been mentioned. It was mentioned more than once by the Deputy.  A number of insinuations have been made.  This should be realised: that the Council of Defence is a body which really is composed of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, and, I think, the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. Generally speaking, it is a body for making representations on the military side to the Minister and the Government, and for dealing with general questions affecting the Army.  Now that body has been of the same composition practically since the Defence Council was founded.  The appointments thereto were automatic, once appointments to senior staff positions were made.  The Deputy takes exception to the length of time which certain officers were left in these appointments.  It must, however, be realised that the efficiency of a man and the question of keeping continuity in a particular task during an emergency period was involved in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any other country in the world that had the same continuity of staff?  Not another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me, I shall deal with this in my own way.  Another trouble that arises in a country such as this is that if you get the best people into these positions they may not necessarily be the people who are just up against their retiring age limit, and it would involve demotion, in effect, after a promotion in our case if you were to make frequent changes in these appointments which is a thing, generally speaking, to be avoided.  Unfortunately, our Army is small.  There are not a number of appointments of comparable value there.  In fact, the trouble with the Council of Defence is that it embraces the three top appointments really, and no other.  A man gets to a top appointment and it practically means demotion to put him out of that.  The other course for him would be to go out on retirement.  That would be very poor recompense for a man who had been <Col N="1424" /> selected for an onerous job because of his efficiency and ability.  If he had to move into another category it would virtually mean demotion since there would be no equivalent appointment for him.  What has been suggested might be a good thing in peace-time, but you must have reservations if you are dealing with an emergency situation. In peace-time it may be a good thing to have a change.  Actually, during peace-time there were some changes in the Defence Council.</P>

      <P>In any event, there were very good reasons why changes in appointments should not be made during the years before the war. Officers had already been placed in a number of appointments, and, unless they could be put in comparable appointments, there were very good reasons for not removing them into appointments that would, in effect, involve demotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, in his speech, has commented a lot on this Act.  I, for one, would have liked if he had been more specific.  It is not enough to come along hinting, and so I would like if he had been more specific.  He said that injustices have arisen under the Act, and that last year he mentioned the courtsmartial procedure.  I thoroughly agreed with him on that.  In fact, I supported him on that specific point.  I would like to see some provision made for independent advice for soldiers.  The Deputy is doing a service if he points <Col N="1425" /> out a thing like that, but he is doing a disservice if he comes along hinting, and will not tell us what precisely he has in his mind.  He spoke about political appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Promotions.  If anyone looks back at the history of the Army he will find that in 1932 a Government went into office practically every member of which had been in arms against the Army that they took over.  To the credit of that Army, as I have said, they showed themselves to be loyal and faithful servants of this State.  The Government appreciated that and no violent changes were made. The senior officers of the Army in 1939 were the same senior officers who were taken over in 1932 and who, in fact, had been in the opposite camp to the Government which took over in 1932. When the war broke out&mdash;or at any period during that time&mdash;certain changes in the staffs were made as between the senior officer personnel of that Army.  In regard to political appointments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or promotions &mdash;take promotion to Chief of Staff, to Adjutant-General, to Quartermaster General, to any Chief Staff Officer, to any brigade, to any command, take any promotion to the rank of colonel and you will find that in each and every case, without a single exception, the officers so promoted were officers who had been serving in the Army in 1932 whether as reservists or regulars.  The officers, without exception, in these appointments and in these senior ranks, were officers who had served in the old Army Reserve.  That really meant that they had served in the Regular Army at some period or that they were already serving in the Regular Army. If the Deputy can in any way show political preference in that he will display considerable ingenuity.</P>

    <Col N="1426" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-permanent forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the permanent force.  I think that prior to the war there were practically no promotions to senior rank.  In fact, a number of officers even in the regular forces were still second-lieutenants or lieutenants.  Certain promotions, mostly in the Regular Army, were made before the war.  There were some promotions to senior ranks before the war which again were all in the Regular Army. Then the war broke out.  What happened?  A large number of senior officer appointments immediately became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all you had, for instance, the filling of brigade staffs and battalion commanders on mobilisation. If my recollection serves me, and I think I am accurate because I have good personal knowledge of the matter, in every case, the officer who commanded a battalion or who held a higher appointment when the war broke out was appointed in 1939 or 1940.  Every senior officer appointed to a senior officer's position was either a regular officer, with pre-1932 service or a Reserve officer of similar service.  I recollect that at that time most of the units were commanded by regulars but I know of one battalion, anyhow, which was commanded by a Reserve commander or commander who later was promoted, and certain other appointments in depôts were filled by Reserve colonels of that pre-1932 service.  In 1941 the final organisation of the Army was reached and a number of promotions to senior rank were then made. If anyone takes the list&mdash;and the Deputy can very easily get the list and analyse it&mdash;he will find that the bulk of these promotions were made from the Regular Army and the Old Reserve. A number of emergency and volunteer officers were also promoted at that time but only in the proportion, as one will find, that one would expect.  If the Deputy makes any allegations of that nature I invite him to call for the information in respect of any particular officers about whom he has a question. I am sure the Minister will facilitate him by having the circumstances of <Col N="1427" /> promotion, and the Army recommendations, made available to him.</P>
    <P>Let me take the second division staff I am relying on my memory, but I think that on that staff there was one Reserve officer, at the time I was there, who was a senior officer.  He was the medical officer, an old reservist, who was well entitled to his rank.  The rest of the officers were regular senior, and there was one volunteer Reserve officer on that staff, senior rank.  In the brigade you will find the same.  On the division, there was one senior Reserve officer.  There was also a colonel.  He was an old reservist, and nobody can complain of a political appointment in his case.  I invite the Deputy, since he has made an insinuation, to have the matter investigated.  He will find that, as I have proved by facts and figures, that insinuation is completely unjustified. The circumstances of promotion were as follows.  Appointments were available.  The Army people themselves, under the stress of the emergency&mdash;when, I can tell you, they were not very much worried about a man's outside qualifications&mdash;put in the best men they could find, without promotion. Generally speaking, the promotion followed afterwards on that man's unit, and on a recommendation that he should be promoted to fill the particular appointment that he was already filling.  That was the usual procedure&mdash;practically invariably so in the case of senior ranks.  Afterwards, that recommendation went to the higher authorities and was there sifted.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, no promotions were made to higher senior rank unless the individual had undergone the proper courses and had passed them.  Having done that, the matter then went to the Council of Defence and was submitted by the military authorities to the Minister concerned.  As in the case of calling up retiring officers&mdash;taking them for service and promotion&mdash;all these things were dealt with by the Council of Defence on the recommendation of the military authorities and were then forwarded to where the final decision for promotions was made.  Those promotions were invariably made on these lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The reason why I have gone into this matter in such detail is simply that I think it is a mistake for us here to bring such considerations to bear on the Army when there is no foundation for them.  The Army in this country, from 1925 onwards, has had no contact with politics, and has not been the subject of political influence.  It has been as far removed, perhaps further, from political influence than the Civil Service.  It is a vital service for the State, and it must, therefore, continue to remain in that particular category. I think we should be doing a disservice to the Army and to the country if we were to make suggestions that the Army is a toy for politics.  I think we should be doing a disservice to the Army and to the country if we were to make suggestions of political influence in regard to the defence forces.  It is for that reason that I have dealt with the points raised by Deputy Captain Cowan.  The difficulties in relation to the Army are of a totally different kind.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Captain Cowan that at various times there has been a certain element of dissatisfaction in the Army.  It is inevitable that that should be so.  Many officers felt that conditions in regard to pay, for instance, were not comparable with other branches of the State service.  Most of the dissatisfaction in the Army is related to such things as scales of pay. Efforts have now been made to remedy that and I hope that as time goes on these matters will continue to be adjusted satisfactorily.  A certain dissatisfaction was felt with regard to administration, particularly from the point of view of control of expenditure on warlike stores and so on.  Deputy Captain Cowan and I have commented on these things in the past.  The control of expenditure has given rise to a feeling of frustration on the part of officers and men who are really interested in the job.  I admit that these things do exist but we should not try to pretend that the dissatisfaction is due to other causes.  It is not.  To go too deeply into these matters would entail a review of the entire field of administration, figures, numbers, finance and so forth.  I think <Col N="1429" /> it would be better to deal with such matters on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Army one must appreciate that any dissatisfaction which does exist is due in large measure to the internal causes I have mentioned rather than for the reasons which Deputy Captain Cowan has mentioned.  It may be that I am somewhat unfair to him in drawing such conclusions from his remarks; but that certainly was the impression he created on me.  I do not think a contribution along those lines is helpful.  It is bad for the Defence Forces as a whole.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly now with the problem of retired officers.  I have often thought that officers of the Regular Army who have retired should be considered as available for further service. That is done in other armies.  There are appointments for which they might be eminently suitable.  A captain who retires at 48 might well fill a post in an emergency.  Officers on the retired list should be available for recall. Whether that should be extended to the Reserve is a question upon which I do not care to express an opinion here. It would depend on how the Reserve was formed.  If the Reserve consisted virtually of officers with all the experience of regular officers a strong case might be made.  If it were merely a reserve of officers trained for a particular task, but without any administrative experience, the same case could not be made.  I think the retired list might usefully be one from which available officers could be recalled should the necessity arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Captain Cowan used the phrase that the Army was &ldquo;the toy of political ideas.&rdquo;  The Army has never been the toy of any political ideas either under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or under the last Government.  At the present moment, I am pretty certain that the Army is not subjected to political influence.  In a particular sense, the Army is, of course, the toy of current political ideas.  Governmental policy will inevitably have a reaction on the Army.  But that is the only sense in <Col N="1430" /> which political ideas influence the Army.  The sooner Deputies disabuse their minds of erroneous impressions along those lines the better.  From 1925 onwards there has been very little political influence in the Army.</P>
      <P>Deputy Captain Cowan has also suggested that the Army was never given a definite statement of policy. Having full personal knowledge of the Army I join issue with the Deputy on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some knowledge too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In these matters I have at least equal knowledge.  I do not wish to enter into competition with the Deputy on this.  I merely mention the fact to lend weight to what I am about to say.  In 1926 the then Government gave a very reasonable direction to the Army on policy having regard to the general circumstances.  Reasonable directions were given by successive Governments at various times since then.  As far as general policy is concerned the Army has never been under any illusions as to what is required. What is required is that the Army should be prepared, as a first task, to account for itself here; in other words, to protect as far as possible the neutrality of the State if a decision were taken in any set of circumstances to maintain neutrality and, thereafter, to have the Defence Forces available for whatever rôle the Government of the day might indicate.  Regard must always be had to the fact that in any event this country must be protected by the troops of this State.  There are any amount of protection jobs to be done.  There are installations and guards and so on.  Whether one adopts a policy of neutrality or not, the Army must always supply a certain mobile force which must be immediately available to take the first shock of action. All subsequent considerations flow from that.  I shall not go into details on that since another occasion will arise on which these matters can be dealt with more fully.  It is, perhaps, desirable that I should confine myself within the limits of the debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army has always had a definite <Col N="1431" /> indication as to what was required of it.  Any difficulties that arise are largely difficulties of implementation. For instance, there was a definition of policy without at the same time giving the Army adequate means of implementing that policy.  Difficulty of implementation was the main difficulty rather than difficulty of definition.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable at the present time that we should ignore our Defence Forces, but our Defence Forces are really only part of the general problem that has to be considered.  That is the problem this country might have to face if another major crisis were to break.  That problem involves the coordination of economic activity, industry and supplies with the more narrow aspects of defence.  These things must be looked to and organised.  Our fear at the moment is that, in our anxiety to try to provide for the problems of the present, we shall overlook the necessity for providing against any such emergency.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary at this stage, as so much work has to be done along that line, exactly to define the hypothesis upon which you are going to meet the crisis.  But, whatever hypothesis you adopt, the preparation up to a certain stage is the same and, having regard to the fact that other countries are doing it and that nobody feels very happy about the peace, we should make these preparations and the most effective way of having such preparations made is with the unanimous co-operation of all Parties in the House.  It is perhaps for that reason more than anything else that I should like us all to leave politics, in the sense that Deputy Cowan insinuated, out of consideration in dealing either with the Army or with the defence problem generally.</P>
    <P>We shall have other opportunities of discussing these matters.  I am of two minds as to whether or not general discussions on defence policy are a good thing.  It might be helpful, however, if the Minister would give us the information some time and give us an opportunity of discussing the concrete problems which arise in that regard&mdash; because any Government charged with these matters has problems, notably <Col N="1432" /> problems of finance, supply and all those things&mdash;to see how best we can provide that essential assurance against the next crisis if and when it comes.  One would like to think it was not coming, but the trend of affairs in the world is not so bright as to make one unduly optimistic.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think I have dealt with the matters which Deputy Cowan raised.  This is going to turn up again on the Estimate, and I would ask him in future to be just a little bit more specific.  I can appreciate, perhaps more than others, certain things that he has been pointing to, and I do realise that, in the past, the Army has suffered from that stifling sense of being unable to get the facilities for fulfilling its rôle.  There are a number of points that can be debated intelligently and perhaps with profit.  That can only be done if the thing is brought down to earth, to specific concrete examples, and general talk about it is not helpful.  The Deputy perhaps more than anybody else, certainly more than anybody in this House, would have a particular knowledge of the purely legal end of the Army.  He has had that knowledge from a large practice in connection with courtsmartial, and he would be qualified to speak particularly about the legal effects of the repercussions on the soldier personally. Frankly, I invite him to give us the benefit of his experience there.  On these other matters I join issue with him, as I have already, in particular where such allegations were made in general terms.  I think it is due to everybody concerned that they should be specified to the extent that they can be directly nailed and the allegations supported, or else an opportunity given for concrete demolition of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points.  I intend to cover have been covered already.  I would make an appeal, however, to the Minister, as most of us are anxious to help him to build up a happy and contented Army&mdash;I am sure that is the wish of every Deputy &mdash;to give consideration to the regulations applying to marriage and marriage allowances.  Within the last couple of years a very large number <Col N="1433" /> of young boys joined the Army at ages ranging from 18 to 21 years.  To my knowledge, a number of them got married before they reached the age of 22.  They must wait until they are 22 before they can get the marriage allowances.  As I say, a number of these young boys got married and the young wife and her baby are living on a single man's pay.  I am sure the Minister would not like to see a young Army man, who possibly would make the Army his means of livelihood, hoping to complete from 21 to 28 years' service, starting under the conditions I have mentioned, namely, that a boy of 20 years of age or a girl of 17 or 18 in the City of Dublin after getting married should have to live on a single man's pay.  I put it to the Minister that we ought to show the way as regards encouraging young people to get married.  There should be no handicap to a young soldier taking unto himself a wife.  The Minister should amend the regulations, if there are regulations, so as to permit of a young soldier of 20 or 21 not having to wait until he is 22 to get the marriage allowance.  In fact, I will go further and say that once soldiers get married they should be put immediately on the marriage allowance and not have young wives suffering hardship because their husbands are on a single man's pay while serving the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a lot of other points which I wished to make but I will rather confine myself to this one special point and make an earnest appeal, which I am sure other Deputies will support, that once a young soldier in the National Army gets married he should get the marriage allowances and, if possible also, be provided with a house.  I would be happy if the Minister was able to cope with that problem, but I know he has difficulty already about the housing conditions of married soldiers.  I am not specially emphasising that, because I know what the problem is.  There are 30,000 people in Dublin at present looking for houses or even a one-room or two-room flat and they cannot get even a single room, not to say a cottage.  I know the Minister's difficulty in regard to that matter.  I ask for the support <Col N="1434" /> of the whole House, however, for my appeal that a young Irish boy with a young wife ought not to be kept on a single man's pay because the couple cannot exist on it and it means appealing to some other authority to keep that man who is serving his country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As there will be a further opportunity of discussing this defence problem on the Army Estimate, I do not intend to detain the House very long.  There were, however, a few points mentioned, particularly by Deputy Traynor, and it is only right that I personally should reply to them.  I happen to be an ex-member of the Defence Forces who served for six years at the bottom end, not at the top end near the &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo; and I, therefore, can speak very authoritatively on behalf of the under-dog, as you might call him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism was offered by Deputy Traynor regarding the estimated standing Army required&mdash;the number, I think, he said was 12,500&mdash;and he was greatly worried because there was no recruiting and no method of joining the forces.  I want to be completely non-political on this matter and to approach it as fairly as I can, but the present Government cannot be blamed under any circumstances for the lack of recruits now in the Army.  We can trace that back a lot further than the last 12 months.  The emergency years started in 1939 and went on up to 1945 or 1946.  Up to 1942 we had an Army here which was unquestionably first class; the morale was perfect and the type of recruits in it were 100 per cent.  From round 1943 on the morale of the Army, as far as I knew it personally, deteriorated.  There were several reasons for that.  For example, around 1943 G.H.Q. inspections were started.  Soldiers will always say that inspections are unpopular, but in this case for three months before the inspection the unfortunate soldiers were going day and night in the barracks and they were kept out on exercises.  I do not want to go into this at the moment but I can say that they were often kept up at night preparing for it.  When the big test was over and the brass hats had left things went very slack for the <Col N="1435" /> next nine months.  The following year the same test was repeated.  It was repeated <i>ad nauseam,</i> repeated year after year.  In other words, one of the main things contributing to the &ldquo;browned-off&rdquo; condition was the accursed monotony that existed, the complete lack of imagination with regard to pastimes or training.</P>
    <P>The second thing that contributed, to my mind, was the type of discipline imposed on this Army.  It cannot be questioned or denied that the type of discipline we have in this Army is taken directly from the British Army.  The idea in the Army was that the commissioned officer was a being completely above the N.C.O. or private.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy has travelled very much into administration.  I know that the debate has been very wide, but this is surely administration which would be quite relevant on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make the point regarding the strength of the Army and the cause that has made it so small, and I am coming to that by reference to the reason for the lack of recruits in the Army.  Deputy Traynor mentioned the matter and that is what put me on to it.  I would not have discussed it otherwise.  I will not pursue the question of our type of discipline too far except to give an example. Paddy and Johnny out of the one village join the Army.  Paddy is a cadet and is commissioned, but Johnny becomes a private, although he is probably just as brilliant as Paddy. Since one is commissioned and the other is an N.C.O. they live in two different worlds.  A commissioned officer cannot mix even after duty hours with privates, and if a private wants an interview with an officer he must get an N.C.O. to introduce him to that officer.  This country is too small for that kind of petty discipline. To prove the truth of my words anyone who is interested can look at conditions in the American Army, the Australian Army or the New Zealand Army and see the type of discipline that is maintained in those three first-class <Col N="1436" /> armies.  They will find that there is no comparison between it and the type we have here in this country.  I can give examples from colonels right down along the line that privates and N.C.O.s do not exist except for the use and benefit of the commissioned ranks.</P>
      <P>Our cadet school is constituted to my mind along the wrong lines.  The debate, however, is limited to some extent and I do not propose to go deeply into that.  There will be, I know, plenty of opposition from the conservative element of the Army. Men who have had power in their hands for 10, 15 or 20 years are bound to be opposed to the idea that the type of discipline should be changed, but that is for the Government to decide and they should have the last word.</P>
      <P>In general, the main thing we are all concerned with here, apart from politics, is the defence of the country.  One man wants a standing Army of 12,500 men, while others are opposed to having a standing Army at all.  My personal belief in the matter is that we do not need a large standing professional Army.  We were always looked upon as a nation in arms and every man in the country should be a soldier. Why should we have 12,500 or 20,000 soldiers paid in non-productive work to twiddle away their lives in barracks and lead a morale-degrading, dodge-the-column existence, for that is what it is?  They are all waiting for something to happen or for us to be invaded.  We will never have in this country an Army for attack, an Army to make war on another country.  Our sole aim is the defence of our own country so why not turn round now and make use of a citizen army.  You have the nucleus or form of it already in the F.C.A.  The F.C.A. is in a deplorable condition at the moment, that is the only way to describe it.  I meet members of the F.C.A. every day of the week and it has practically no life at all as a defence force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On paper we have, I suppose, 50,000 members of it, but in actual fact where you have a club of 30 members, only five or seven turn up to meetings.  The rest only come when there is a pair of boots or a set of tyres to be given out. There is no use in blaming that on the <Col N="1437" /> way it is administered, because the officers and N.C.O.s who are administering the F.C.A. are actually as fed-up as the men.  We want a citizen army here on the same lines as the F.C.A. where every able-bodied man would have an opportunity of learning how to use the most modern weapons, and not alone the men but in the country areas the young women should be given an opportunity of learning first-aid.  That should be part and parcel of the F.C.A. &mdash;call it what you like.  The business of giving an F.C.A. man a rifle to sling on his back and for him to appear out of nowhere at night with no ammunition, is a bit of a joke.</P>
    <P>If you are to look on the F.C.A. as a citizen army, it will have to get a complete overhaul.  The position at the moment is that meetings are badly attended and some of the members attend them as social functions, more than anything else.  The training material available is negligible.  Take, for instance, the matter of demolitions in which the L.D.F. should receive training. In the west of Ireland I know the L.D.F. particularly well, and if tomorrow I wanted to get a bridge blown, trees knocked across a road or a road blown up, I think I would have to do it myself.  There is no use in training these men from the theoretical angle. Bring down your gelignite, or whatever type of explosive you intend to use, and give them practical experience of the job&mdash;show then how it is done and let them handle the stuff.  This theoretical training on which the Army worked when I was in it is no use.  I remember being in charge of a demolition squad during a big manæuvre and the demolition materials available to me were about 40 pieces of a tree sawn in the shape of anti-tank mines.  I dished these out in the defence areas and that was our complete demolition outfit.  It is a matter of playing at soldiers, so far as I can see.</P>
    <P>Our Army should be based on the countryside.  The units should live in their own localities, because, if you have a battalion stationed in a particular area, the men will know the people and the terrain and will be able to support themselves in that area. They must have at their disposal the most up-to-date weapons.  If it is <Col N="1438" /> machine guns and rifles, give them these and give them demolition material.  Teach them how to use these materials and teach them methods of communication.  I now make a practical suggestion with regard to the meetings.  If there is an L.D.F. meeting once a month, the men should get some little remuneration.  If a man attends 12 meetings in the year, give him some small remuneration and you will have a good attendance.  When you give him his month's training, no matter where he is brought, pay him well for it and you will get good results.  That will be a cheaper Army in the long run than a big standing professional Army.</P>
    <P>I regard the L.D.F. halls now being built as very useful and the Minister should go ahead with the building of the particular halls which I have heard are about to be erected.  They will be an inducement to the boys to join the force.  I should like the Minister to consider my point&mdash;I think a lot of people in the House are thinking on the same lines&mdash;that a citizen army is the proper type of army for us and not a large standing professional army, which is non-productive, the men twiddling their thumbs for 24 hours a day for a number of years which is bound to get them down.</P>
    <P>In the case of boys in the country who are working on the bogs and on farms, and, in the cities, in the factories and shops, if you give them the proper inducement and get them interested in a citizen army, and give them a month of the year during which they can be properly trained, when they go back, they are productive for the other 11 months of the year and you have a cheaper army in the long run.  All the talk we have about defence and so on amounts to this, that we should first give them something worth defending here.  I do not want to go too deeply into that point, but it is the real key to this problem.  As we stand at the moment, it is a poor excuse for an army to look after.</P>
    <P>I want to give one example of what happened in my time in the Army and it is no harm for the Minister to know it.  It was a regulation which made the men completely fed up with the <Col N="1439" /> discipline imposed upon them.  About 1943 or 1944, an order relating to the wearing of greatcoats was made, providing that a soldier had to wear his greatcoat and Deputies know what an Army greatcoat is like when it is pulled up around the soldier's neck like a big bag.  A conference took place amongst the Army brasshats as to how the soldier should wear his coat.  One brasshat said that the soldier should be allowed to wear it with the lapels open during the summer because it was not fair to him to make him wear it closed.  A bigger brasshat said no and the bigger brasshat naturally won the day, with the result that soldiers went about in the middle of summer with their overcoats buttoned up around their necks.  I met these soldiers and I had nothing but the greatest sympathy for them.  I think it is my job, having had experience of the Army for a number of years, to expose these matters, to bring them before the House, so that the House may judge the type of discipline imposed on a little Army where everybody knew everybody else.</P>
    <P>It is playing at soldiers to have, as we have at the moment, an officer for every four or five soldiers.  Go down to Athlone, Renmore or any other barracks and you will find that the officer strength is practically the strength of the N.C.O.s and men.  I suggest that in my idea for a citizen army we have the solution of the problem at our disposal.  We have available any number of first class officers who could be billeted on the country in the different areas and put in charge of citizen battalions&mdash;F.C.A., if you like to call them so.  They will be doing a good job there, instead of being stuck in barracks and nobody will be knocked out of employment as a result.  I do not wish to go too deeply into details and I will discuss other aspects of the matter on the general Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has fully considered the effect in the future of Section 8 of the Bill.  It is, to my mind, very serious if it is to be put on record that the Parliament of this nation considers that deserters <Col N="1440" /> should be given better treatment than men who served loyally in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop my point.  The section provides that men who deserted from the Army will be able to secure employment in Government and local government concerns, and that, if they have been there contrary to the law for the past few years, they will be secured and confirmed in that employment.  There are a number of men who served loyally in the Army who have not got any such security or confirmation in the matter of their employment, if they have been fortunate enough to get employment. We are actually providing that people who have been illegally in employment for some years will be secured and confirmed in that employment, these people being men who deserted during the height of the emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing this for these men who deserted, and some of whom actually joined armies who might at any time have been in conflict <Col N="1441" /> with our Army.  We are taking away from them these penalties, at a time when we are dismissing from employment in the Department of Defence itself, 1916 men and other I.R.A. men who founded this State.  Only to-day the Minister gave me a reply which shows that 54 men, 19 of whom were 1916 men, have been dismissed since the 1st August from the Department of Defence.  Under this Bill, we are making it easier&mdash;to put it very mildly &mdash;for deserters to secure public employment here.  That is something I, for one, cannot stand over.  At a time when the economy axe is falling to the detriment of 1916 men and Old I.R.A. men, at the stage they have now reached in life, we are trying to open up employment in public services for deserters.  I wonder, now that we are all republicans, if it is to go out as the policy of this republic, that the men who founded it are to be dismissed and we are to open up employment for men who deserted in the emergency a few years ago.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about not giving the benefit of this section to men like those the Minister mentioned the other day.  If it can be proved that a man did not receive his calling-up notice, the Minister should have power not to impose these disabilities on him. However, on the figures he gave us, if my recollection is right, there is only about a quarter of the total deserters who were in the reserves or who could possibly come under that; and surely all the reservists that are down as deserters were not deserters on the ground that they did not get the calling-up notice?  The number genuinely concerned in that must necessarily be very small.  It would be very deplorable, particularly for the future, if we say we are going to open up public employment for deserters from the Army, two years after the end of the emergency. That is what we are asked to do in Section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other disabilities that are mentioned in the explanatory leaflet, disabilities which will still apply, are just the ordinary thing one would expect. We could not make it a virtue that we refuse to give a pension or a gratuity to a deserter.  No one would expect <Col N="1442" /> anything else.  In view of our circumstances during the emergency and in view of the fact that some of those men went because they could secure higher pay in another army, I think it is right that we should take some steps against them.  The steps that were taken in 1946 were not at all too drastic and now, in 1948, we should not rescind them.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister did not refer in any way to the policy he was going to pursue in the Army.  We should have had some statement on that, particularly in view of the fact that hitherto we have had many divergent statements from himself and his colleagues as to Army policy.  Ten months after he has taken office, he should be able to give some general outline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told in the past that we should have only an armed police force and should not attempt to have an Army for defence purposes.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, at column 51, Vol. 105:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our peace-time Army is an Army required for the same purposes as most other peace-time armies are required in small States &mdash;to stand by and behind the civil power, to give necessary and very desirable training to our young men, to set standards in health, physical development, hygiene, etc., to the young men of the country&mdash;a small force to play its part in the ordinary essential ceremonial of the State. That is what in fact we want an Army for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder are those the Minister's views now?  He also stated that our resistance could not in any circumstances be more than a token resistance. I think I am entitled to take from that that the Minister does not think that we could possibly put up any worth-while resistance in case of attack.  Is that to be the policy or are we going to set out to do the very best that our numbers and resources enable us to do, if we are attacked? We have had that view from the Minister. <Col N="1443" /> We have had other views expressed and a sum of money named that would not keep even a police force.  One Deputy mentioned that £250,000 should be sufficient for our Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Who mentioned £1,000,000 at one time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The £250,000 was mentioned by Deputy Giles.  On the other hand we had the present Minister for Agriculture telling us a few years ago that we should go into the war to save America.  We had the Taoiseach, a couple of months ago, telling us that we should go to the aid of Canada in eventualities.  How we are to do all that if the Minister is now carrying out the policy that he enunciated in that statement, I do not know, but I think we are entitled, at any rate, to know what is to be the policy.</P>
      <P>The international position to-day is certainly not such that we can sit down quietly and imagine that everything will be safe for a very long time.  Only yesterday the British Commander-in-Chief was reported as having said that putting up the greatest defence possible is the best way of avoiding having to go to war.  Whatever our policy may be as regards entering a war or remaining neutral, it is right that we should know exactly where we stand as regards the Army.  I understand that the numbers are very considerably reduced and that is natural in view of the statements that were made here by the Government early in the year.  I think the policy put forward by the Fianna Fáil Government, who were as much concerned with saving pounds as anybody else in this House, of having a nucleus of 12,500 with the ability to spread out and to take control of the young men of the country who would be called to the colours or who would volunteer in an emergency, is the proper one.  The previous Government thought to do something similar on an Army of 5,000 but when the emergency came it was found to be practically unworkable. But for the time we got by the Grace of God, we would never have been able to meet any invader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> We must learn from that.  It is absolute waste of money to spend any number of millions on an Army unless you do the right thing, unless you so provide that the Army will be effective when the call comes.  The Army Staff, who are the men charged with this responsibility, recommended that figure of 12,500 as the very lowest on which they could undertake to do the job properly.  Is there any of us here in a position to say that he knows better than they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not think it.  We should be able to come to some agreement on that matter.  We all know that Irishmen will not sit down quietly in case of invasion.  Our history teaches that.  It is our duty in this House to take steps to see that resistance in such an emergency would be properly organised and that the most effective use would be made of every man.  We can do that only by providing a proper nucleus in the Army.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister is creating extra ranks in the Naval Service.  I wonder has he now changed the views he expressed here about that service&mdash; I hope he has&mdash;when he referred to the corvettes as rubber ducks.  There were other Deputies at that time who thought that we should not have a Navy at all unless we could have one like the American Navy.  We were never to make a start.  We were always to be at the top.  Let us hope that this indicates a change in that respect because this country, situated as it is, must make a start some time on a Naval Service.  We cannot do very much in any one year but I hope that there is an end to twitting at our Navy and that every year, under any Government, it will grow and build up.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been buying warlike stores in a frenzied, panicky kind of way, anywhere we could get them, at any price, for seven years... but we were not utilising or expending, and surely we must have amassed very ample quantities of those stores.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister now tell us if other <Col N="1445" /> such stores have been purchased since he went into office; if so, where they were purchased and of what they consist? I have reason to believe that some stores have arrived.</P>
    <P>On Section 5, about the extension of service for men who have already serve 21 years, do I understand that the three months' notice that a man hitherto was entitled to give if he wanted to get out after that period has been withdrawn, and that he must serve for two years unless he is released on compassionate grounds? That is my understanding of it at any rate.</P>

      <P>That is quite understood. In view of the statement about the Cork rececourse, will the Minister say whether he has got a written statement from the staff recommending or even accepting the changed plan?  I will wind up by appealing to the Minister to reconsider Section 8.  I think it would be a terrible thing if it went out from this Parliament just at this moment that we were facilitating deserters while dismissing the men who helped to found the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the aspects of general policy referred to by Deputy Colley deserve consideration.  I expressed a view on another occasion, when we had a Temporary Defence Forces Bill before us, that the ultimate idea in regard to the Army was not at all clear.  I was pleased to hear Deputy McQuillan making such a cogent advocacy of a citizen army, a subject to which I devoted a considerable part of my speech on that other occasion. It is true, as Deputy Colley pointed out when he was quoting the Minister, that we could make only a temporary resistance in the case of an invasion. <Col N="1446" /> That would be more from the point of view of professional armies, and professional armies only.  From the point of view of Irish resistance being carried out by a professional army against an invading professional army, it is perfectly true, as the Minister stated, that there could be only a token resistance. Like Deputy Colley, however, I believe that Irish men and women would not be content with that; that more would be expected of us and that more would be forthcoming from us, whatever Government happens to be in power at the time of such invasion.</P>
      <P>The point of view I expressed then, and I think it is opportune to reiterate it, was criticised by speakers on the Opposition Benches as asking for the disbandment of the Army and asking for things which were against the national interest along that line.  I strenuously denied that and I believe now, when the situation is a bit calmer and there is not so much war hysteria, that the view expressed by Deputies like Deputy McQuillan and myself might receive greater consideration from the Minister.  What I ask is that the responsible heads of the Army should sit down to consider whether the present form of military defence is the best form, the form from which we can expect the maximum resistance.</P>
      <P>Judging the development of military technique, every army is likely to continue as an organised force in a rut. What it has been doing for ten, 20 or 30 years becomes sacrosanct and the Army authorities consider this is the best and only possible form of organisation. I want the Minister to break away from that tradition and, in consultation with the military chiefs of other countries on a similar scale to ours, with the experience of the war, or with our own native genius, to consider whether or not the ideas expounded from these benches, with reference to a citizen army, are not more likely to produce greater results on a more economic scale than the present form of a professional army organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been statements that the military defence of this island is impossible while the island remains divided and while there is Partition. While that may be correct from a professional point of view, there is no <Col N="1447" /> excuse why we should consider that we can make only a token resistance in the case of an invasion.  It does not exculpate us from taking other measures to provide the best possible defence for our people in any emergency.  I urge that the ideas propounded by Deputy McQuillan are worthy of consideration in so far as they refer to the citizen army&mdash;a widespread organisation of our youth, the men and women of the country, based locally, with local knowledge and a local organisation, stiffened and strengthened, if you like, by a professional background, a professional group of officers&mdash;highly trained men and skilled technicians who are able to make the most of whatever little military stores we have and able, in the shortest possible time, to provide for the greatest amount of training for those whom they can gather into such a widespread organisation.</P>
    <P>I would urge furthermore that the best form of a fighting organisation, as is well known by those who have any experience, is that form in which there is some kind of camaraderie.  In this country, the trade unions play a very important part in the economic life of the country and there is no reason why they should not play a prominent part in the defence policy of this country. Their sympathy, their assistance and their organisation could be enlisted in building up a citizen army.  Many of them are familiar with the Army; many of them know the idea of workers and citizens generally springing to arms whenever the occasion demands it.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a spontaneous resistance of a desperate form, seeking out, at the last possible moment, ways in which to maintain our national sovereignty&mdash;to maintain the republic which we were so enthusiastic in declaring&mdash;now is the time I think when the military chiefs and the Minister for Defence should consider laying the basis of a practical organisation, so that resistance will be, not hopeless and desperate, not merely heroic, but such as will achieve success by the measure in which it will make any invasion of our shores so costly to the invader that they will pause before attempting it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> If the defence of this island rests purely on a professional army, which could not be equipped with the same skill as the army of a great power, because the efficiency of a modern army depends on its industrial backing &mdash;the amount of steel that can be put to warlike purposes&mdash;in a conflict of that type, balancing our weight against the weight of others, it is quite obvious that we do not count.  It is by turning to other ways, ways in which this country showed a great example to other countries, ways with which this country is quite familiar, that these forms of resistance could be given a more organised shape.  If the Minister would get his military staff and those competent to consider this matter, to come to the question with open minds, not to consider it merely on a hide-bound professional army basis, not to bring to bear on it the mind which Deputy McQuillan instanced&mdash;the mind which considers the buttoning-up of greatcoats&mdash;but fertile minds to consider what are the potentialities of this form of defence, I think the Minister would be doing a great day's work for the country.</P>
    <P>There is little more I have to say except on the one question of the introduction of ranks in regard to the Navy, which permits a discussion on the question of the Navy.  Deputy Colley hoped that year by year we would be able to provide some funds for the building up of a Navy so that we could strengthen our maritime defence, but we must consider this question in a realistic manner.  From the small beginnings which we now possess, can we possibly hope to build up a Navy of any strength before the Navy perhaps becomes obsolete? It would appear to me, having regard to our very restricted resources, that the work which it is intended to have done by the Navy&mdash;the safeguarding of our shores, protecting our fisheries and other activities of that kind&mdash;might be much better done by strengthening the air forces of the country.  There is hardly any function that I can see, apart from ceremonial functions and apart from our traditional desire to have some maritime force, that could not be more efficiently discharged by the Air Force.  To hope <Col N="1449" /> to expand our naval forces seems to me a policy that is fantastic.  The Navy, such as it is, is sufficient for our needs, and if there is any expansion required for other functions, I submit the expansion ought to come by training the Air Force of the country to take over functions such as are taken over by the Air Forces of other countries in regard to maritime defence.</P>

      <P>I just want to appeal once more very earnestly to the Minister on behalf of ex-soldiers who find that they have no housing accommodation when they leave the Army.  I would ask him to give early consideration to the possibility of setting up some machinery whereby, when a man has done his term in the Army, he will be provided with a cottage or flat in which he can take up residence with his wife and children on the day he leaves the Army.  It is a matter which it will not be very easy to solve but I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to see that such machinery is set up or, alternatively, to confer with the Minister for Local Government with a view to providing houses for ex-soldiers.</P>

      <P>This debate has widened far beyond anything I thought was possible under the Bill.  The subjects which have been raised are ones upon which I should like to have something to say, both from the point of view of the Party, from the personal point of view and from the point of view of the experience I have had in connection with the Defence Forces.  I am at a loss to know exactly whether it was intended that this Bill should give us an opportunity for a general debate on defence policy.  My opinion is that it was not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping, seeing that we had an Estimate last March and that we shall have another before next March, that this would be treated as the annual renewal Bill and that the main debate would be on the Estimate when I would be bringing facts and figures before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that was my own view but a number of things have been raised in the debate and the <Col N="1450" /> question is how far it is wise to follow them because they are subjects of very great importance.  For the moment, keeping close to the Bill, I think the Minister made a mistake in introducing Section 8.  Desertion is a very serious offence, as I am sure he will be the first to admit.  According to the regulations, it is a matter for which every deserter is liable to be court-martialled and get very severe punishment.  At the end of the war I think we were very lenient in making it known that courts martial were not going to take place. That was an act of very great leniency and we wondered whether, in fact, we were justified in adopting it, seeing the danger that arises from leniency in matters of that sort.  We had to show that this offence was one which could not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>After all, the people who are involved were people who came voluntarily into the Defence Forces.  They were trained, and it was at a period of great national emergency that they actually left the forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, also, it would be a bad thing if it were to get about that when there is a change of Government there will be something like a general amnesty for those who had broken the law.  It is bad because it means that people who are about to commit offences and thinking of the penalties involved, will say: &ldquo;Well, these will go once there is a change of Government&rdquo;.  I think we ought to approach these matters from the point of view of continuity: continuity in the State and continuity in ideas with regard to what is right and what is wrong.  I do not think the penalty in this case was very severe seeing that the alternative would have been a court-martial.  I cannot, at the moment, recall exactly what the penalties in the case of a court-martial would be but I do know that the penalties that could be inflicted for desertion in a time of emergency like that would be very great.  To have these disqualifications simply means that those concerned failed in a fundamental matter with regard to their citizenship.  They entered the service at a time of grave emergency; when they deserted they took away with them the knowledge that they had <Col N="1451" /> gained at a time when the State looked upon them as certain props.  By deserting, they took away these props.  I think it would be carrying leniency too far if we are now to go and remit the punishments which had been imposed in lieu of court-martial and its punishments.</P>
    <P>I was not able to be here when the Minister was speaking, but I understand the reason he gave for this is that there were some technical desertions which he wants to cover.  It ought to be possible for him to deal with these.  If there are some cases of purely technical desertion, he ought to be able to deal with them and make it clear that he is only dealing with that particular class.  If a notice was sent out, and if the person concerned says he did not get the notice, well there ought to be some investigation of that.  I think it ought to be possible for the Minister to distinguish between purely technical cases of desertion and cases of gross desertion of the country at a time of danger.  On the part of those people there was a violation of their pledges.  I do not know to what extent their oath involved a pledge to remain with the colours, but I suppose it did.  I would again urge on the Minister not to insist on Section 8. Apart altogether from the considerations that have been mentioned by other Deputies, the really serious consideration for us is that what is proposed here seems to suggest that this is an offence which can be lightly pardoned, and that pardons of this particular type are likely to occur when there is a change of Government.  That is bad.  I would urge on the Minister what has been said from our side here, that he should not continue with that section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I come now to some of the wider matters mentioned by other Deputies. There is no more serious matter that can be discussed, and no more serious matter I would say for any small State, than the question of its defence forces and defence policy.  It is always a question of what is the best you can do, and whether that is going to be at all adequate for your needs.  Every small <Col N="1452" /> nation has to face that.  My own answer to that question has always been that one has to do the very best that one can.  It is a bad argument to say that you have taken such and such measures, that you have done your best, but that it is all useless because it is insufficient.  I know that a good deal can be said on that, but what it simply amounts to is that you are putting up your hands and saying that the country is at the mercy of any forces, big or small, that come against you.  I think, therefore, that we ought to make up our minds to do the best we can with the manpower that we have and with the equipment that we can get.  I know that in modern times international guarantees may not be sufficient.  I know that we have examples of small States so guaranteed which have escaped miraculously. They were protected by certain international agreements which did not, however, prove of real value to other small States.  Through their military organisation, those that were saved enjoy the position which they still occupy as independent States.  If they had not been careful to take measures to defend themselves, I doubt very much if the international guarantees they had would have been sufficient.</P>
    <P>Their defence measures were very expensive.  I have not the figures before me, but I know that at one time when I looked at them their defence expenditure represented a very high proportion of the national expenditure. It is doubtful whether, in our circumstances, our people, not being accustomed to such expenditure, would be prepared to face it, but if we are to do our best, we have to think of things in the way in which they are thought of in these States.</P>
    <P>The question of age&mdash;a young Army &mdash;has been raised.  There is always that difficulty.  In the case of anybody that has to be active, you have always to balance the question of experience with the physical ability to do the things that are required.  I think most people will admit that a young Army is in general desirable.  In the case of the higher ranks, the age to which you can keep experienced people is a matter of opinion.  It is generally felt that in <Col N="1453" /> modern war, except in the case of those working at headquarters, you do want your officers to be sufficiently active and, therefore, sufficiently young to be able to keep pace with the younger men.  It was on principles of that sort that the suggestion was made to the Government that we should have, as far as possible, a young Army.  That is why the ages were cut down.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to whether we could not use some officers, who would be too old for the regular Army, on the Reserve.  Our general idea was that we had a standing Army which was to be the central skeleton of a force that could be expanded, and that when it was expanded you would have the main body of your Army.  If a large portion of the Reserve was to be included the members of it, too, must be young.  That is a matter that was considered, and we came to the point at which it was felt that the Reserve force ought to be practically as young as the regular Army.  I say, practically, because there might be some slight difference for those who would be engaged in peace-time training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>For certain functions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a definite limit to the number that you can use in that way.  I do not think anyone can speak definitely on the question of age.  You have only to look at those who are in charge, doing various types of work, estimate their average age and ask yourself whether they are really capable of doing the work they are called on to do.  I may say that during the emergency period the feeling was that we had a number of people who had been kept on in the Army and who, through no fault of their own, but merely through advancing age, were unable to do the work required of them.  In that connection I do not think you can have anything hard and fast but the tendency ought to be, as far as possible, to depend upon youth.  At the top a certain number are required to supply the necessary experience.  The trouble is that in war the tactics, weapons and so forth change so rapidly that very often <Col N="1454" /> the experience of a previous occasion is the very worst equipment for the new war.  However, that applies only if it is carried too far.  In war as in other operations some things remain constant while other things change.  The important thing as regards war is to know to what extent you have to change&mdash; weapons, tactics and so forth.</P>
      <P>Another criticism was that we had kept on the chiefs of the Army, such for instance as the Chief-of-Staff, for too long a period.  Our trouble is that unlike some other States, we have not posts into which we can easily fit ex-Army officers.  What is very badly needed here&mdash;if you are going to have a young Army and if the officers leave at an early age and at a time when it is very difficult to begin life all over again&mdash;is a system whereby they would be given preference in regard to some State posts.  We were considering whether that could be done but unfortunately in our particular circumstances it is not easy.  Large States which have colonies, etc., have posts into which they can fit the retired army officer and use his experience and his administrative ability&mdash;if he has had experience of administration&mdash;in a continuing way which would be of value.  We have only a very small number of posts of that nature.  If we are to have a young Army, with officers retiring at a fairly early age, we must try to provide some openings for them.</P>
      <P>There is, first of all, in regard to higher officers in the Army, the question of individual ability.  In the case of an extremely able officer who is filling his post properly I do not think it is wise, because of some sort of general routine rule, to change him.  The emergency through which we have passed was of vital concern to this country. We are satisfied that our senior officers were the best we could get; we found that they did their work excellently. I do not think, therefore, that because of some general routine rule such officers should be changed every two or three years.  What are you going to do in the case of a man who, say, has reached the rank of Chief-of-Staff?  He has a certain position, and he enjoys certain emoluments.  Where can he be fitted in the Army?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new problem. It is well to remember that people have been struggling with it for some considerable time and that they are very anxious to get a solution. When one tries to find out where he can fit a man in it very soon becomes apparent that suitable openings are very limited.  It is not a good thing, in the case of a man who has reached the top, to send him down to the Curragh or somewhere else in such circumstances.  It would be all very well if the Army were a religious order because these things could then be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but you are dealing with human beings who have to contend with the things that affect people who are out in the world.  They have not given up a lot of the things which members of the religious orders have given up.  In the case of religious orders, if a man is at the top and then changes that is all about it.  I am not so sure that that would work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience during our own time was that theoretically it looked all right but I do not think that fundamentally it is a good principle.  When a man had reached the top you could undoubtedly send him to some other post but when he is at the top he is recognised and he would not be there if he were not recognised as being outstandingly fit for that position.  He is demoted then and becomes a subordinate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would apply to one only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it applies to that one.  The point is that that is <Col N="1456" /> the one that is affected by the rule suggested.  If you do not accept the rule then you have to act on some other principle.  The principle we worked on at that time was that&mdash; whilst we admitted and generally recognised that it would be well to have changes&mdash;so long as the work of the nation, so far as the Army was concerned, was being well done by the individual concerned it was more important than a mechanical rule &mdash;even though the mechanical rule might, in a long period, have been held to work out better.  If I personally were to have anything to do with it, I would stand for the rule we had during the emergency. I would stand for that rule, in the case of promotion, until we would have a situation where, in the case of a man who reaches the top, he would retire or go into some other position in which he could serve the State equally well.  Mention has been made of extension of service.  That is a matter which is related to the question of age.</P>
      <P>Another matter which was referred to was the subject of political appointments. I do not know of any political appointments and I do not think the Deputy would be able to point out any. I do not think it has ever before happened in history that a body who had been in arms against an Army became the Government and took over that Army and whose subsequent relations were as harmonious as they proved to be in our case.  It is quite obvious that that state of affairs could not have lasted if, as the Deputy suggested, there had been political appointments. Appointments were made generally on the recommendation of the Army.</P>
      <P>At the same time it is important to remember that the Army is a part of the civil executive's arm; that national policy must be decided by the Government subject to the approval of the Dáil; that it must be the civil authority that is in control and that must take responsibility for everything that is done; and that in the case of every military action that is taken there is generally some political objective&mdash;it may be that of maintaining the peace or of defending the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Anything that would suggest in principle something different to that would, I think, be quite wrong.  We must proceed very firmly on the principle that the Army is at the disposal of the civil executive of the day, the Government, and that it is their right, so long as they act legally in the ordinary way, to decide policy&mdash; adopted and supported by the Oireachtas.  There has never been any question about that so far and I think it is very important that that should be understood by everybody.  The Government of the day has to take responsibility and must act in accordance with its best judgment.  It should, of course, in all these matters in regard to defence, hear the views and technical advice of the Army authorities and take them fully into consideration. I think, however, it would be very bad indeed if there should be any suggestion that the last word in all these cases does not lie with the Government.  It must lie with the Government.</P>
    <P>Whether it be a question of appointments or anything else the Government must have the authority.  They are open in this House to criticism in regard to their actions.  I do not think we can have it any other way.  If they are wise of course they will listen carefully to the advice given to them by the Army authorities and they will consult with them on all matters of defence.  However, ultimately it must be accepted that the final authority in all these matters is the Government. If we have any criticism, if anything is done, we must hold the Government responsible.  That does not mean that they are to interfere in matters in which they ought not to interfere.  But they must have the right inasmuch as any military action that may ultimately be taken has always as I have said a political objective.  I do not think that it is proper that I should on this Bill deal with the entire question of defence, the part that should be played by the Navy, by the air force and by the land force, and the extent to which we should dip into the pockets of the taxpayers in order to give us an efficient defence force; these are all matters of grave import for the country but I think they should be dealt with <Col N="1458" /> directly instead of as a side-wind on a Bill of this particular kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, I have often asked myself whether it would not be desirable to have the position reviewed every year.  I think that is done in some other countries.  The Bill is reviewed annually and there may be slight changes made from time to time. I think just prior to the outbreak of war there was a permanent Bill drafted here.  I know we intended bringing one in but I do not know whether it was intended to operate over a period of years or whether it would be reviewed annually.  The purpose of it in the countries where it is passed annually is to ensure that Parliament is in control and has the necessary power.  That, in turn, compels recognition by everybody of the fact that it is a Parliamentary Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a traditional reason for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In one country there is probably a traditional reason for it. The question is whether it might not be a good principle.  It is a matter for consideration.  I do not think we should on a Bill of this kind enter into a more or less desultory discussion of the fundamental policy of defence.  There are many things I would like to say if the time were appropriate but I think this is hardly the occasion.  I would, however, urge upon the Minister the desirability of reconsidering Section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every speaker in this debate made mention of the advisability of introducing a permanent Army Bill.  Deputy Traynor, who opened the debate on the opposite side, more or less suggested that I was guilty of some unreasonable hurry in introducing this Bill at this particular date.  He said it could very well wait until next March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I am introducing this Bill in December rather than in March next is to give the Department of Defence 15 months in which to bring forward a permanent Bill when next a Bill affecting the Defence Forces is introduced. Irrespective of when that Bill will be introduced, I think there is a lot to be said for the view expressed <Col N="1459" /> by the Leader of the Opposition that, even though it may be a permanent Army Bill, there should be an opportunity given annually to Parliament to discuss the Bill.  There is a considerable amount of weight in that argument. We are a two-House Parliament and Estimates do not go before the Seanad.  If there were not some Bill coming before the Seanad annually in regard to the Army the Second House would never get an opportunity of expressing any views they may have on the defence system and the Defence Services of the country.  My attitude on that matter is that there is nobody sufficiently experienced in this Parliament to claim to be the last word as an authority on defence.  The more suggestions, the more discussion and the more advice available to the particular Minister for Defence the more likely we are to have a proper defence system in the country.  Every Minister for Defence will try to do his job under the immense disability of our being a small country and a poor country.  When all is said and done, at least in the period between wars, finance&mdash;and nothing else&mdash;will decide the strength of the Army, and the Army defence plan will have to be organised within the sum available.  One Government may make more available than another.  That is only a difference of degree.  The world has progressed very, very far away from the time when one could build an army out of men and muskets.</P>
    <P>Even in a small country in the past it was easy enough to mobilise a fairly formidable army with men and muskets, and possibly horses.  Now the smallest and, indeed, the cheapest factor in any army is the human element.  I was amazed recently when I was told by an experienced officer from a neighbouring army that to equip one division on modern lines would cost a fantastic number of millions of pounds&mdash;more than we could ever dream of spending even in peace times on the whole Army over a period of ten to 15 years.  The modern unit is a very expensive unit.  The equipment is nearly beyond our compass so far as price is concerned.  The best we can aim at is to purchase the more expensive <Col N="1460" /> type of equipment year by year in order that we may have enough to train our troops in the handling and use of particular types of equipment. The previous Government was progressing steadily in that direction in endeavouring, when material and money were available, to build up within our Army at least one fully equipped unit around which to train the rest of the Army so that we could expand further if the necessity arose. The real limitation with regard to a modern defence force, whether it be land, or sea, or air, is the absolutely prohibitive cost of the equipment evolved as a result of the recent war. I venture to say that the equipment of an army unit to-day on modern lines is 50 times as expensive as the equipment of that same unit on modern lines in 1939, and that is really the big problem and the big headache that confronts any Minister for Defence. The smallest part of the difficulty, the thing that should in fact in the modern world give rise to the least uneasiness is the number of men, either the number available or the number actually in uniform.</P>
    <P>If I were disappointed at any particular trend in this discussion it was the amount of words and time devoted to the numbers of men.  If you look out on this particular State of ours you will find that, in proportion to our numbers, it would be true to say that we have the highest percentage of trained men, higher than in any other country, due to a great extent to the fact that we were not in the last war, that we escaped it.  We had not the high percentage of casualties that other populations suffered.  We put through our own Army at home here something in the neighbourhood of 60,000 men; we put through our reserves an equivalent number.  We have ex-Army men who are not included in that particular figure and we have a great number of people who returned home from other armies.  The percentage of trained men in this population at this moment I would say would be higher than in most European countries, and we have a higher percentage of young and middle-aged males left than in most other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Therefore, the least important thing and the aspect of the Army that we should spend least time arguing about is whether in fact we have 8,000 or 9,000 men with the colours.  The military strength of any country in modern times is its man-power potential and the extent to which the man-power potential is trained, semi-trained and available.  In proportion to our population, we have a very high trained or semi-trained man-power potential in this country.  In addition to that, I would say, that, if there were a shadow across the country or a threat to the country, we would certainly have very little trouble in having a very high percentage of that potential available, if and when required.</P>
    <P>In times of peace, to keep marching around barracks, knocking sparks out of the cobble stones in barracks, a great number of men is not sound national economy, and I doubt if it is sound military policy.  I have heard it argued from different sides of the House, and I heard it from behind my back in the course of this debate, that the ideal thing would be to have the very greatest number of young men, in particular highly trained and available, but proficient in the use of arms over and above the rifle which was sufficient 30 years ago.  I believe, without being wedded to the system as it exists at any particular moment, that, properly handled, we have within the idea of the F.C.A. the filling of that particular function.  I have ensured for the last seven months that very much more attention should be given to that particular force than was possible to give to it in the earlier years.  I have doubled the number of regular officers attached to that particular force.  I have made an arrangement that a high number of the most senior officers in general headquarters, including two members of the general staff, would be out every single week-end moving about and investigating different units of the F.C.A.  That has been going on for months.  They are, as it were, engaged in the study of that particular organisation with a view to making recommendations as how to make it more real, more reliable and more effective.  I expect before the next year's Estimate is introduced that I <Col N="1462" /> shall have available for the Dáil the result of these investigations.</P>
    <P>At the present moment I think nobody knows exactly to what extent that is a force on paper and to what extent it is a force which could be counted on as being effective in the event of an emergency.  The figures show a strength of approximately 50,000 officers and men.  Personally, I do not think that more than two-thirds of that number could be regarded as the effective strength.  It is difficult, however, to know exactly when a man should be knocked off as ineffective. There may be a number of men who, for some months, never turned up at parade or drill or instruction or anything else, and then, at the end of four or five months, they begin turning up and eventually they become perhaps the most regular attendants and the best of the lot.  All that side of the F.C.A. is being studied and investigated, but at the moment I candidly confess that I am unable to say to the Dáil to what extent that is an effective force.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to halls. Every effort is being made to get halls built, and a certain amount of progress has been made throughout the country in getting halls built or, pending the building of permanent halls, the transportation and utilisation of huts for that particular purpose.  There is at least the germ of a very large volunteer force or citizen army within the four corners of the F.C.A. in course of time. There is a lot of balancing to be done as to whether it is desirable to increase the number of officers and N.C.O.s attached to that force.</P>
    <P>There is a difference of opinion amongst even Army men.  Some say that if you attach too many officers and too many regular N.C.O.s, it will never develop its own officers and N.C.O.s and its own sense of responsibility. Others hold that a unit fades away or practically fades away, unless there are regulars moving in and out through it the whole time.  There is a certain amount of study going on in that direction. We have units here to which we are attaching regular personnel to a heavy extent and we have units there to which we are attaching the minimum number of regular personnel.  At the <Col N="1463" /> end of some months, or some reasonable period, we will compare these two units and judge by results, and we will be wiser after we have got these results.</P>
    <P>I think it is rather idle and useless to be arguing here in terms of whether our regular Army with the colours is 8,000 or 10,000 strong.  The difference is a difference of degree, not worth wasting a minute's breath in discussing.  On that point, there seems to be an amount of misunderstanding which I cannot understand.  Deputy Traynor, the ex-Minister for Defence, the man who, as Minister, was responsible for bringing in this Book of Estimates, representing, as it must have done, the decision of his Government with regard to the strength of the Army for this present year, prepared that Book of Estimates and provided for an Army of 9,000 odd.  Yet, when we were discussing the Estimates last year, he opened the debate and said that his provision had been for an Army of 12,500, and he walked his leader and every Deputy who followed him into that mistake.  I ask him to look at the Book of Estimates, as a Minister of considerable experience and as a man who obviously understands the Book of Estimates and that, on pages 378, 379 and 380, he would find that he had made provision for 10,982 N.C.O.s and men, costing £1,100,000.  The next line in that book reads: &ldquo;Deduct in respect of numbers below strength during the financial year, £310,000.&rdquo; That meant that you were to deduct one-quarter of the strength.  That was the book which was presented to Parliament and that was your Army for this year.</P>

I went to considerable pains last April to correct the debate and to correct Government and Opposition Deputies on that particular point, and I have all the corrections in this booklet.  Yet, six months after, the whole debate is led off on that same point.  If we are to accept the incorrect contention of Deputy Traynor that what is down here does not matter in the least, that it is your peace establishment that matters, I can claim to have the very same Army strength as the Deputy.

With regard to the peace-time strength of the Army, I went back and got a return of the peace-time strength of the Army in every year prior to 1939 when we mobilised our wartime Army, for comparison with the present strength.  The total strength of the Army in 1932 was 5,793; in 1933, 5,823; in 1934, 5,763; in 1935, 5,582; in 1936, 5,799; in 1937, 5,885; and in 1938, 6,519.  In 1939, it was mobilised as a wartime Army and the strength of the Army at the present moment is 8,039.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have information available as to the difficulties which faced the previous Government and that I am conscious of them.  The point I am making is that the provisions which have been made for the Army this year provide for an Army 30 per cent. greater than was ever carried in this country in peace time before.  Of even more importance than the strength of the Army, which, of necessity, must be small, whether it is Deputy Traynor's 10,000 men or my 8,000 odd&mdash;either number is so tiny that it would not be a factor one could lean on except as a skeleton around which to build&mdash;is the strength of the Reserve available.  Here are the strengths of the Reserve available in the different years.  In 1932, 8,800&mdash;I am giving round figures; in 1933, 9,000; in 1934, 9,000; in 1935, the second Reserve had been formed and the strength was 18,000; in 1936, 17,000; in 1937, 16,000; in 1938, 15,200; in 1939, 15,000; at the present moment, 51,900.  The immense growth and expansion of the Reserve between the pre-war period and the post-war period means that our potentials are very much greater than they were in the past.  That, of course, is due to the stimulus of danger and the amount of nationalist and militaristic spirit that naturally flows from a period of danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Within the last six months, the strength of the F.C.A. itself has grown by approximately 5,000, showing that you still have that sense of military responsibility among people who are in their normal way of life civilians.  That is healthy and gratifying and it is because of that immense number and the fact that new recruits are coming forward in such great numbers, that I consider it is of the utmost importance from the defence point of view, that every possible attention should be given to that force and that the most satisfactory plan should be adopted for its equipment.</P>

      <P>They will be called up next year.  I explained earlier this year, on the Estimate, that the reason they were not called up was all the examination that was going on, but they will certainly be called up next year.</P>
      <P>References have been made in the course of this debate to barracks.  I am as well aware as anybody else that when the Army was mobilised there was a shortage of barracks and I think there always will be.  I have never heard that any country in the world, even the great military nations, had ever enough barracks to house a fully mobilised army.  The reason why the position did not become impossible in other countries was that when the army was mobilised, it took the field. The peculiar and acute difficulty arose with us because we mobilised the Army but had not to take the field. The usual thing all over the world is that when the army is mobilised encampments or hutments must be brought into use and buildings commandeered all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last two wars, you could walk from Piccadilly to Fulham and scarcely see a building that was not occupied by troops or by some army formation.  I do not think that anybody would really make the case that we must have, down through all the years of peace, sufficient barracks to house every soldier we would mobilise in a time of emergency.  The great <Col N="1467" /> difficulty with the Army in normal times is the high number of barracks they have to maintain when they have not the troops.  At the moment in Dundalk, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, Duncannon, Cavan, Boyle, Buncrana, Castlebar, Longford, Templemore, Tralee and Nenagh there are barracks unoccupied and having to be maintained.  There are an equal number of barracks elsewhere with just small maintenance parties in them.  I was criticised <i>vis-a-vis</i> that particular situation for considering the surrender of Rock Road Barracks to a housing authority for the purpose of housing the people.  I think if Deputies would give the matter a moment's impartial consideration and consider that all through the war years on account of the lack of materials and the fact that the Army had to get priority, not a cottage was built and the appalling housing conditions which have arisen in country, town and city, they would admit that it would be in human for the Army to hold on to the empty barracks on the flank of Cork City, a barracks that is capable of being readily converted into 400 residences for families, which was unoccupied and in fact, as far as one can see, unwanted. That was the position, and I do not think, no matter what geographical positions we occupy in this House, when that demand was made <i>vis-a-vis</i> the appalling housing situation, that any Government, the war being over, would have refused that particular barracks. The reason I say &ldquo;that particular barracks&rdquo; is that it was not built on the barracks system.  It was built on lines of so many separate, selfcontained, permanent hutments or houses, two sides to a single street. For that decision I take full responsibility, but that decision was not taken without very full and generous acquiescence of the General Staff.  It was not a thing I had to argue about or even put up to them.</P>

      <P>Until there is ample housing elsewhere, we cannot get any barracks back, even Portobello or Collins, from the civilians there.  The two Deputies Byrne, both members of the Dublin Corporation, which is the housing authority for Dublin, asked me to make provision for ex-soldiers and their families.  I am tired asking the two Deputies Byrne and their colleagues to make provision for ex-soldiers and their families, but the Dublin Corporation has adopted the extraordinary attitude that they are not responsible for such people.  The Housing Acts lay it down that, when a house is overcrowded to a certain point, the housing authority is responsible for giving those people priority.  There is a considerable number of houses in the military barracks in Dublin occupied by civilians, where there are three generations at the moment, the original family and sons and daughters married, remaining in the houses.  There is an appalling, a serious and a rather discreditable state of overcrowding in those houses in our barracks and I cannot get the Dublin Corporation, the housing authority, even to admit that such people have any right to a house outside.</P>
      <P>I would like very much to be able to meet the request put up by Deputy Byrne that I should make provision for ex-Army men, but my difficulty at the moment is that I cannot make provision even for married soldiers who are serving at the moment.  There are hundreds of soldiers married and who are unable to live with their wives and children because there are hundreds of civilians occupying the married quarters in our barracks.  Nobody likes evictions and it certainly is a problem as to what will have to be done.  There are serving soldiers, living apart from their families, and their families are living under appalling conditions: and they must have the first claim on the Department of Defence.  If the day comes that we have to force out all or some of the civilian families, the appropriate housing authority in the area must take responsibility for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Far from being in a position to look after the married man leaving the Army, we are not in a position even to make provision for the married serving soldiers, who have an implied right by contract.  Our public advertisements and so on imply a right to the Army to carry a marriage establishment and provide them with houses up to the strength of that establishment.  That we cannot do at the moment, on account of the number of civilians.</P>

      <P>There was considerable reference to Section 8, which deals with deserters.  When introducing this Bill, I expected that much would be said about that section and did not anticipate that I would have to go over again all the ground covered in the Estimate last March, which will be covered again, presumably, next March.  On this particular question of deserters, I will put this to the House. I made the fullest inquiries that I could as to whether there was any other army in the world that asked for a continuing penalty of this kind, that asked that military offences be <Col N="1470" /> punished by county managers, town clerks and corporation secretaries. From a military point of view, there is something offensive to the <i>esprit de corps</i> of an army that for military offences we ask the various county councils, town councils, town commissioners and corporations to deal with them.  I would consider it of a certain amount of importance, by way of precedent or guide, if I had been able to ascertain that there was any other army that, for such offences, even at the height of war or when they were actively engaged in war, carried such continuing penalties and disabilities as we had in the Emergency Order and have incorporated since in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the maximum penalties that would be inflicted for desertion in these cases would involve long terms of imprisonment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold and held that we should deal with our military offences in a military way and that we should not pass the baby to various civilian bodies.  I consider that it is wrong to have civilian authorities writing to the Department of Defence about John Brown or John Black.  It is bad for the Army and it is bad to have the Army publicising through the different councils that this is a group of men who infringed Army regulations, defied Army rules and that we wanted them to be punished by the local authority.  I would still believe in the advisability, if those men showed up, of having them tried by military courts.  Let military men deal with soldiers for military offences.  Military men should not ask civilian authorities up and down the country to deal with them.  Another point, one which I put to Deputies opposite, is that if there were a reservist in some county with a wife and eight or nine children, absolutely destitute and starving, and if there were a minor relief scheme in that area, and if this situation were brought before any of those responsible ex-Ministers opposite and they were asked &ldquo;Are you going to deny that man work, though there is a minor relief scheme in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Are you going to insist that the families starve?&rdquo; there is not one <Col N="1471" /> Deputy opposite who, if he were up against that decision, would not say: &ldquo;Give work to the unfortunate man. We do not want to punish the wife, we do not want to punish the children, because that man infringed the regulations when he was in the Army.&rdquo; That is the decision that faces me in a number of cases and there is no good in anyone trying to evade that decision by waving the green flag and saying: &ldquo;Here is what they did and there is what is happening the old-I.R.A.&rdquo;  I have as much regard for the old-I.R.A. as anybody else.  These men are not going to get work under the Department of Defence or under any State Department, because they are ineligible for employment in any State Department if they have not a clean Army discharge.  I am thinking of work on the bogs, minor relief schemes, a drainage scheme across one of our provinces and work passing by the door of that father with the starving children, and saying: &ldquo;Because of the law that was introduced or the amendment carried in Dáil Eireann last December, you cannot get work and you must starve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I ask Deputies to consider.  I am suggesting there continuing every military penalty and continuing all the punishment that any modern European army imposes on soldiers but removing this seven years' disqualification that they are to be seven years unemployable, pariah dogs.  Has not the ex-Minister for Defence considered the question and will he take responsibility for leaving the father or the husband in the case I pointed out in the position of being denied the right of employment under a minor relief scheme, say, a Christmas relief scheme or a winter relief scheme, because, seven years ago, he deserted or because seven years ago he did not leave his address?</P>
    <P>I invite the Deputy, as a military man, to differentiate between the regular Army soldier, who knew the full gravity of the offence, and the reservist who was never a week with the colours.  Would the Deputy consider that it is fair to have that penalty for seven years on the young street arab <Col N="1472" /> that we practically conscripted into the Construction Corps, a corps that was formed with the idea of trying to reform this kind of young street arab?</P>

      <P>The Construction Corps are under the legal definition of deserters at the moment and I suggested when I was opening this debate, and I believe it still, that none of us realises the breadth to which lawyers could extend that legal definition. Years ago, when we were making that Order to govern deserters, we were thinking of the men in our uniform, with the colours, occupying a bed in one of our barracks, who went over the wall and scooted out of the country and joined another army.  That type of men are only a fraction of the whole lot that have been covered by the official or legal term &ldquo;deserter&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I did suggest that I would look into that, and, having looked into the whole question, what I am putting to the Deputy and to his colleagues and to his leader at the moment is, is it really Christian for us to carry out this five years' policy of certain men being unemployable, no matter what their matrimonial circumstances are and no matter what their family circumstances are, no matter if they are completely destitute and absolutely starving and there is relief work in their area?  Is that a policy that we are going to embark on and still call ourselves a Christian country?</P>

      <P>If he is in prison, when he is released from prison he would not be a pariah dog for seven years.  In fact, on his release from prison, there are all kinds of benevolent organisations that try to hook him up with some employment centre.  I think that is the policy of the State now, and from the beginning of time, wherever and whenever possible to find employment for the unfortunate fellow, exprison.</P>
      <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition will conscientiously agree with me that even though these orders are legitimate and defensible and necessary in time of war, in order to prevent the melting of an army in face of danger, in order to strike home to every soldier and every reservist the responsibility of a soldier's calling and the gravity of the crime of desertion, nevertheless, when all that can be said for such an order in time of war or in time of grave emergency, on full consideration of the reactions, even if the reactions apply to only one family, to six or seven human beings in one family, there is nobody opposite, facing, as we hope, a period of peace, that would take responsibility for the continuation of that order.</P>

If the Emergency Powers Act were in operation that could be done by making an Order, but the Emergency Powers Act is not now operating and there is no authority to do it under the Supplies and Services Act.  Therefore, it was necessary to introduce this amendment of the main Act of 1934. The amendment is confined merely to raising the weekly compensation.  That represents the scope of the Bill.  There are many blemishes in the main Act with which I would like to deal, but I cannot do so now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been ruled by the Chair that these amendments are not in order, and I take it the Chair was actuated in coming to that decision by the fact that the principle in this Bill is merely to step up the weekly rate of compensation.  It does not propose in any other way to deal with the variety of flows and blemishes contained in the 1934 Act.  On the Second Stage we had <Col N="1477" /> considerable criticism of the imperfections of the Act of 1934.  I was not responsible for that Act.  I know there are blemishes in it; even the Minister responsible for its introduction was not prepared to defind it in the light of experience.  It certainly calls for a remedy, and that will be found in due course.</P>
      <P>This amending Bill seeks merely to step up the weekly rate of compensation payable to persons who will meet with accidents after the enactment of this measure.</P>
      <P>
        <i>An Ceann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sole purpose of the Bill and the Chair has ruled that anything not dealing with the narrow issue of setting up weekly rates of compensation in the form set out in the Bill is contrary to the principle of the Bill as passed on the Second Stage.  I have no responsibility for that.  It is the decision of the Chair and I am as much bound by it as any Deputy in the House.  May I say this to Deputy Lynch, if permitted to do so by the Chair?  Deputy Lynch submitted an amendment the effect of which would be that not only would a single workman get compensation at the rate of 50/- per week, but that if he were married, a sum of 14/- should be paid in respect of his wife and that a further sum of 10/- should be paid if the injured workman had two or more children. I do not know whether Deputy Lynch appreciated the full significance of that but, if his colleague Deputy Corry were sitting beside him, he would.  Let me tell the Deputy what would happen under the amendment if it were possible to discuss it.  There is always the risk that an employer who wants to carry his own risks in respect of workmen's compensation, may try to keep these risks down to a minimum. If Deputy Lynch's amendment were carried he could do that and do it effectively by recruiting only single men and not recruiting married men, especially married men who had children, because they would be bigger liabilities.  I am attracted to the principle of making provision for a married man but not under the present pattern <Col N="1478" /> of workmen's compensation because I cannot protect the married workman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the 1934 Act to compel an employer to insure, with the result that an employer if he is compelled to pay certain high rates by an insurance company, will carry his own risk.  Again a sense of self-protection will induce him to make the risk as light as possible.  He would make the risk as light as possible under Deputy Lynch's amendment by employing only single men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost goodwill in the world, I have no power to interfere with the rates of premium charged by insurance companies.  That may be done by another Minister but let me say this to the Deputy.  I have great sympathy with the point of view he is ventilating but I think he is ventilating it at the wrong time and the wrong place.  I think he does not appreciate that he playing with fire by this amendment.  Let us see what would happen if the Deputy's amendment were carried.  Let us take the case of an agricultural worker with a wage of £3.  Under this amendment he would get 45/- as workmen's compensation, an additional 14/- for his wife and 10/- additional if he had two or more children, allowing him a total compensation at the rate of 69/- per week while he is ill, although he was paid only 60/- while he was working. The farmer who employs him will have to pay that 69/-.  If Deputy Lynch discussed this amendment going home on the train with Deputy Corry, I do not imagine that the atmosphere in the carriage would be very cordial.  I do not imagine that Deputy Lynch wants to do that but that is what would happen if his amendment were carried. I hope, however, in other circumstances under a State scheme, the principle of this amendment can be accepted without bringing in all these other difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is primarily a permissive Bill to enable county committees of agriculture to requisition the local authority to levy a rate up to 7d. in the £ instead of 4d., as is at present the case, but there is no provision in this Bill placing any mandatory duty on the local authority to adjust its rate up to 7d. in the £.  It merely provides permission for a local authority that wishes to raise its rate to raise if now to 7d. if it so desires.  There is a further provision in the Bill to permit county committees of agriculture to pay their members' expenses for attending meetings and sub-committee meetings on a <Col N="1483" /> basis analogous to that in the Vocational Education Act for the members of vocational education committees of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision that Deputy Corry inquires about provides that, where heretofore a county committee of agriculture was permitted to pay its members only what I think may be described as vouched expenses, they can now fix a mileage rate and pay a member of the county committee 5d. a mile, or whatever rate they fix, for travelling to and from the place of meeting, and that whereas, heretofore, a member of a county committee of agriculture could not receive any subsistence allowance if his attendance at a meeting involved his absence from home throughout the whole day, here-after he will be entitled to recover a subsistence allowance where the local authority elects to provide it within the same limitations as control a subsistence allowance made for members of vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>In every case, the rates provided by the county committee must be approved by the Minister.  That applies also to any rates of compensation for travelling which are proposed where a member is elected to a meeting of a sub-committee of the county committee and is required to travel to the meeting of that sub-committee as distinguished from a meeting of the committee as a whole.  Deputies should remember that the provision made for vocational education committees is that travelling expenses can only be paid to a member who lives more than five statute miles from the place of meeting, and that a subsistence allowance can only be provided for where the member's absence from home is greater than three hours. The rules applicable to vocational education committees provide that if the absence be from three to seven hours, 4/6 may be allowed, and if the absence is more than seven hours from home, up to 7/- may be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another provision in this Bill to which the attention of the House should be specially directed.  It is contained in Section 4, a section designed <Col N="1484" /> to remove doubts which might arise in the interpretation of an earlier Act.  Under the original Act, it was intended to include, under some new provisions, all the officers of an agricultural committee.  Some doubts subsequently arose as to whether certain categories of officers were clearly made subject to the new general proviso. Whatever doubt may have arisen in that connection is finally laid by Section 4 of this Bill which is intended to be and is, in fact, no more than a declaratory section.  I say that in order to reassure Deputies that it is not intended by Section 4 of this Bill to create any new situation, but, in fact, to make sure that the situation which it was intended to create under the original Act has, in effect, been created beyond all doubt, and that those who are guaranteed rights under the original Act, even if there had been a flaw in it, will now be retrospectively confirmed in those rights, and that where there had been duties or liabilities imposed on them, that similarly, retrospectively, they will be deemed to have been effectively imposed by the original Act. I do not think that there is anything I can profitably add to what I have said, at this stage.  I need hardly say that if there are any matters on which Deputies want further information I shall be very happy to provide it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have reached us from several county committees of agriculture that the revenue made available to them by the local authorities is insufficient and that the local authorities desire to make a fuller provision but are restrained from doing so by the existing limitation of 4d.  Now it is for the local authority to decide for itself whether it wishes to avail of the additional power provided under this Bill.  I think there are districts where the number of poultry instructors and agricultural instructors may be insufficient but, where the county committee of agriculture believes that it would be a profitable and a prudent thing to strengthen these services in their area, that is a thing for them to decide.  I am quite prepared to recommend to the House that, in the financing of the county agriculture committees of the country, local authorities are not asking for any extravagant discretion if they are asking for permission, where necessary, to raise the rate to 7d. as their contribution to the functions of the county committee of agriculture of their area. I am not making the case here&mdash;I do not think it is any part of my duty to do so&mdash;that the local authority should levy any particular figure but I am making the case that the local authority, when considering appropriate provision for the county committee of agriculture, should have discretion to raise a rate not in excess of 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the question of the Minister because we want some more information.  He has very cleverly evaded telling us how the position has arisen in which local authorities&mdash;in this case the county committee of agriculture&mdash;need a higher rate.</P>
      <P>With the general provisions of this Bill I am sure that we on this side of the House will have no objection.  The provision in regard to the travelling expenses of members is long overdue. It has been awaiting legislation for about two years because it was promised to bring that point into step with vocational education committees and county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of county committees of agriculture have a fairly shrewd idea, <Col N="1486" /> and in fact they have very full knowledge, of the reason why it is necessary to increase the rate.  Within the past 12 months, owing to the scheme for the increase in poultry and egg production in this country, the work of the county committees of agriculture has been greatly increased, with the result that it is necessary to increase their staffs in order to carry out the scheme.  We were told, when the scheme was being introduced, that all the expense would be met by the Department of Agriculture out of a special fund.  The county committees of agriculture now find that their ordinary staffs of poultry instructresses are working double time looking after hatcheries and supply farms in order to promote this scheme. I would point out that, as a result, the private small poultry keeper, the ordinary farmer and the workers' wives in the different counties have a big grievance. They are not getting any service at the present time.  This is a very important matter and I want the Minister to give special consideration to it.  The only way county committees of agriculture can provide the normal service they were accustomed to give to those who live in a particular county or half county, or whatever the area may be, is by doubling their existing staffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not do that on the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to continue, please.  That is the reason why it is necessary for the Minister to make provision to allow local authorities to increase the rate.  They must increase the rate if the county committees of agriculture are to give the service in the future that they gave in the past. That is only one of the reasons.  I want the Minister to give very special attention to the second reason.  For the past six months the ordinary staffs of the county committees of agriculture have been fully engaged at supply farms and hatcheries, with the result that they could not give any service to the ordinary members of the community. I want to stress that because, with my intimate knowledge of the whole matter, I know it to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time after the Minister took <Col N="1487" /> office, when he was young and green, he told the House and the country, with a flourish of trumpets, that he was proposing to have a soil survey of every acre of land in this country carried out. That is a very desirable thing and it is something to which none of us has any objection.  We were also told that the Department of Agriculture of this State would make provision for the carrying out of that soil survey.  Is that being done?  The position now is that, when a soil survey is requested, the appropriate county committee of agriculture must provide the officer to do so.  Every county committee of agriculture has, according to the size of the county, two, three or four agricultural instructors.  If any farmer needs to have a thorough survey of the soil of his farm carried out the only person to whom he can turn is an officer of his county committee of agriculture. The result has been, I am glad to say, a generally increasing demand from farmers to have a general soil survey of their farms.</P>
    <P>The only officers to whom they can turn are the officers of the county committees of agriculture.  These agricultural instructors have given good service in regard to live stock and thousands of other matters of interest to the agricultural community.  If there is to be a soil survey carried out these instructors will not be available for the duties they have performed up to this. I want to stress that to the Minister. Even if the present staffs were increased by 100 per cent. in order to carry out a soil survey the work could not be done in less than 15 years.  With the best goodwill in the world and the best possible staff the work could not be done in less than that time.  I think it is very unfair to the farmers that the agricultural instructors should be taken away from the work they are doing at the moment of giving lectures and holding classes and demonstrations, advising upon live stock and the hundred and one other functions they are called on to perform.  Soil survey is not work on which these instructors should be engaged.  The Minister has a staff at his disposal for such work.  He has a number of the officers who were <Col N="1488" /> engaged during the emergency in the enforcement of the tillage regulations. Some of those are engaged at the moment on taking a survey to see what crops the farmers may grow in the next emergency.  To my mind that is ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss it on another occasion.  I shall have something strong to say about it then.  The Minister has the machinery at his disposal. The staff employed on the farm improvements scheme have been idle for many months of this year because no schemes were sanctioned.  With training they should be competent to take a soil survey.  In most counties there are only two agricultural instructors. There are at least eight to ten of the others.  Instead of asking the farmers to bear the additional burden of providing more staff for the purpose of a soil survey, which the Minister promised to have done at State expense, it is the Minister's duty to provide the staff.  The Minister is taking advantage of the fact that it was necessary to introduce a short Bill in order to permit the committees to pay the same travelling expenses as the county councils to insert this particular provision thereunder.  He did that for the purpose of relieving the Exchequer of its liability.</P>

No service whatever is being given to the ordinary poultry keepers.  I know that is the case from my own experience.  If this work has to be carried out by the county committees the staffs will have to be increased. But I hold that this work is outside the jurisdiction of the county committees.  The imposition of this work will entail an increase in the rates.  I do not object to the increase in rates but I do object to the cost being placed on the already overburdened farmers.  This is work which should normally be paid for by the Exchequer. This is another experiment of the Minister for Finance to reduce taxation while putting a bigger burden on the farmers.  I am surprised at the Minister for Agriculture agreeing to this.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, instead of seeing to it that sufficient funds were provided to carry out the soil survey and to organise the poultry industry, is trying under this Bill to saddle the already overburdened farmers with additional taxation in order to have these two functions of the Department of Agriculture carried out.  That is what the Bill is for and what the increase in the rate provided for in this Bill will be spent on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to provide additional finances for committees of agriculture. I did not quite follow the point raised by Deputy Allen, but I do know that a number of committees of agriculture have reached the limit of their revenue-raising powers and will be unable to continue their existing activities unless provided with additional power to requisition money from the county councils.  In this connection, there is a big anomaly, inasmuch as county councils are restricted by statute to a limited rate in the £ for agricultural purposes, whereas for all other purposes the sky is the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming community contributes the greater portion of the rate, and it is rather surprising that the county councils should be restricted in their power of finance for the purpose of assisting the industry upon which they mainly depend, while there is no restriction upon them for other purposes. If an agriculturally-minded county council, with an agriculturally-minded committee of agriculture, decided to spend money fairly lavishly on the development of agriculture, they would find themselves definitely outside the law.  But, if an extravagant county council wishes to spend unlimited sums upon roads or the creation <Col N="1491" /> of palatial urban centres or amenities, there is no restriction upon them.  That is just one of the many anomalies which exist in our present set-up.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing the county councils with additional power to raise money for committees of agriculture, the Bill provides that members of committees of agriculture shall have additional travelling and subsistence allowances. Before we decide to give this Bill a Second Reading, we ought to examine our individual and collective consciences as to whether this expenditure is providing any useful result or not.  These committees of agriculture have been functioning for 50 years.  It is over 50 years since the late Mr. Tim Healy declared this country was provided with enough boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that this is a very limited Bill and the principle or the purpose for which county committees of agriculture were established or why they were established 50 years ago does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for increasing the finances of these bodies and, before we decide to increase the finances of these bodies, we have to consider whether or not they are serving a useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, this Bill would give them power to increase the expenditure and the allowance to their members.  Just as the late Mr. Tim Healy described the boards in this country as being sufficient to make a coffin for the nation, I think there are enough boards at present surrounding the agricultural industry to make a coffin for that particular industry. Before we decide to provide additional money for decent farmers and decent agricultural workers to come away from their farms and their natural avocations and sit around a table at committee meetings, we have a right to decide whether their deliberations <Col N="1492" /> at committee meetings are serving any useful purpose to the nation.</P>

In those circumstances, may I respectfully submit that it is relevant to the provisions which I recommend to this House to consider what they would spend this revenue on if they got it and that it is relevant to make submissions to the House as to how that revenue is likely to be used bearing in mind the use to which existing revenue has been put? I respectfully submit that if the House is asked to pass a Bill authorising the raising of revenue, the House is entitled to consider what that revenue is raised for and whether there is any reason to hope that it will be properly used.</P>

      <P>There are a lot of aspects of this matter which occur to a Deputy when he is called upon to provide additional revenue and they would almost compel him to vote against this Bill.  As I know a considerable amount of county committees of agriculture, however, being a member of a county committee of agriculture for a long number of years, and as I know the useful purpose they serve, I was hoping that the Chair would be a little more lenient.  I want to say now, since I was not allowed develop the point, that I do not consider the money devoted to county committees of agriculture to be a complete waste of money.

      <P>I object to this increase because I think that as far as the ratepayers are concerned, we have more than reached saturation point.  The rates in my county for 1946-47 were 13/4d. in the £.  In 1947-48, they were 15/1d. and in 1948-49 they were 19/1d. and judging by all the demands we have got from various Ministers during the past five, six or seven months.  I will be very much surprised if they are not raised by at least 10/- in the £ next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied. Restrictions are put on county committees <Col N="1495" /> of agriculture as to the manner in which their present money is being spent.  We are prevented, for instance, from giving a subsidy on ground limestone, although the Minister has been shouting in this House and not alone the Minister but every Deputy has been complaining and saying that if there is one thing the land of this country wants, it is lime.  The Minister has refused Cork Committee of Agriculture to give any subsidy on ground lime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lehane was missing from the meeting when the Minister's letter was read.  I regret it, but he can have the information now from me.  Another thing the Minister has refused is the subsidy on dried lime.  There are hundreds of thousands of tons of dried lime lying in Tuam factory, in Carlow factory and in Thurles and the Minister has refused to give a subsidy on it which would enable that lime to be distributed immediately to farmers.  The Sugar Company has done a very good job in Cork County.  They are purchasing plant and machinery to produce ground limestone for the benefit of the farmers of the county, but the Minister steps in saying that he will not give any subsidy for that, though he is looking to enable us to get more money.  I have a definite objection as to the manner in which a large portion of this money is being spent.  I think that when the ratepayers and the taxpayers with them have been asked for the past 25 or 26 years to pay each year premiums on bulls, the result of which has been that you cannot get a decent milch cow in the country to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this is a Bill which seeks to empower the county councils to increase the rates by 3d. in the £.  Even though I believe it is vitally essential that agricultural advisory services and various other services which the agricultural committees could undertake should be provided, I feel, at the same time, that the ratepayers are being called upon to bear a burden which is more than they can bear.  Already we have to face an increase of 4/- in the £ this year and goodness only knows what the rates will be next year.  That is one thing that is upsetting me and it is something which is going to reduce and hamper production in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not like to see this Legislature adopting a policy which will enable the rates to be increased when we have in operation a system of adult suffrage and most of the voters at local elections free from the burden of these rates.  I suppose that, like Deputy Corry, I shall be ruled out of order, but in the past, voting at local elections was confined to ratepayers.  That system was changed some time ago and a system of adult suffrage adopted which meant that those not paying rates could vote and appoint people to spend their money for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, Sir.  What I was going to say was that the position was such that even the Party in favour of adult suffrage had to bring in county managers to curb the extravagance of those who were elected on the basis of adult suffrage.  I believe it is vitally necessary that we should have more instructors, more advisers in agriculture and I think it is a wrong thing to shove every new service on to the rates, as is happening at present.  The rates are increasing and everybody who pays rates knows that he has to pay an increase of 4/- in the £ this year and will have to pay considerably more next year.  I am opposed to passing any other burden on to the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>We read in the papers yesterday that the Minister for Health is passing on another burden to the ratepayers, because the sweepstakes are paying three-quarters of the costs.  There is an old saying about the last straw breaking the camel's back, and, even though this is a very laudable object, it may be the cause of breaking the camel's back.  For that reason, I think the Bill is inadvisable and I suggest that these very necessary services should be provided by the national Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to permission being given to local authorities to make provision for paying reasonable travelling expenses to members of agricultural committees, because, if there is one important committee subsidiary to the county council, it is the agricultural committee, and in fact I think the differences between the agricultural committee and, for instance, the visiting committee of the mental hospital and the vocational education committee should long ago have been removed.  The previous Government should have given permission to county councils to pay the expenses of agricultural committees before taking any of the others into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only objection to this proposal is that the permission to be given is tantamount to a request to county councils <Col N="1499" /> to increase the rates for the purpose of a soil survey.  The Minister is very keen on a soil survey, and to a large extent, I am with him, but, if a national soil survey is to be carried out properly and systematically, the expenses connected with carrying it out should not be borne, either in whole or in part, by the local authorities. Taking the agricultural instructors away from other spheres of work in which they are engaged and putting them on to a soil survey may be all right; it will require a very much increased staff; but, when the rates are soaring as they are soaring, I believe it would be sound and good policy that the expenses of that survey should be borne not by the local authorities but by the Central Exchequer.  Domestic economy instructresses' time is now taken up largely on advancing the poultry scheme and paying attention to hatcheries and supply stations.  That is going to mean a great increase, if it is to be done properly, in the existing staff and anything in excess of what was being paid previously by the local committees of agriculture, and which was raised by the local rate, should also be borne by the State.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I do not think this Bill should be presented in the form it is.  I would have no objection to a Bill for paying reasonable expenses to members of committees.  If the county council is judicious in the selection, many members of the committees will not be members of the council itself.  In County Galway, we have a number of members of the agricultural committee who have not been elected to the county council at all, men such as Brother Jarlath of the Agricultural College in Mountbellew and like our Chairman, Mr. Christie Kerins of Oranmore.  Of course, expense would not matter very much to him, as he is within a fairly short distance of Galway and I feel that he would not take any expenses at all.  Such men's services are very valuable.  It is possible that such a man would have to come from near Ballinasloe, a distance of 60 miles and it would be very unfair to ask him to travel at his own expense. That is why I think the part of this <Col N="1500" /> Bill that refers to members of agricultural committees should have been given precedence over similar Bills that have been brought in in regard to members of vocational education committees and mental hospital committees. As far as the other matters are concerned, they are national schemes and, as such, any increase in staff should be borne by the Central Funds. There will have to be an increase, if they are to be carried out properly, and I am sure the Minister would wish them to be carried out properly.  That is all I have to say in criticism of the Bill.</P>

I am astonished to hear Deputy Allen say that the farmers are getting no service at all from the poultry instructresses in County Wexford. I shall have that matter closely investigated at once.  However, I am bound to say that, so far as my information goes, the poultry instructresses of the County Wexford Committee of Agriculture are giving excellent services to the farmers of County Wexford; but I can assure the Deputy that careful note will be taken of his complaint and an exhaustive enquiry made into the abuse he alleges.</P>

      <P>It was never held that a soil survey could be undertaken or that the Supply Services Vote would be charged with it.  In fact, no soil survey is in progress, except in that area of the country which will be scheduled as a tillage area in the event of an emergency analogous to war&mdash;which I <Col N="1501" /> do not believe will recur.  Whether it recurs or not, we are making preparations to meet it, lest it should.  In the restricted area, the soil survey will be made at the expense of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In regard to the soil testing services to which Deputy Allen referred, I cannot imagine any more appropriate occupation for an agricultural instructor in any county in Ireland than, on request by a farmer, to go on his farm and take a soil sample and send it to the soil testing station at Johnstown and, on the receipt of the analysis and advice provided by Johnstown, to bring that back to the farmer and help him effectively to put into practice the advice that Johnstown has provided.

They have been made available and agricultural instructors need no longer apprehend that, if they take soil samples to oblige farmers, the samples, when sent to the testing station, will be forgotten and never returned.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that the agricultural instructors of almost every local authority are doing admirable work in taking soil samples from those farmers who invite them to do so and that their zeal has been such that I have recently had to direct that the accommodation at Johnstown for soil testing be doubled.</P>

I do not think I need put it to the House how urgently necessary it is that full advantage should be taken of these services.  Artificial fertilisers are getting cheaper each year and they will continue to get cheaper each year, not as result of subsidies levied on the taxpayer but as a result of good <Col N="1502" /> healthy competition in the trade.  There are going to be no more millionaires in the artificial fertilisers industry in this country.  Yet even as the price goes down, they are still relatively expensive; and it is necessary that they should be used to the very best advantage. That cannot be done unless the farmer has reliable information as to the chemical analysis of his soil.  Every farmer is entitled to expect that that will be provided for him by the co-operation of the county committee and the Department, free, gratis and for nothing, in the shortest possible space of time.  I regard it as an achievement of which I may legitimately boast that, for the first time in the history of this country, such a service has been made available as from last June and that, though from time to time demand catches up on the expanded service we provide, I am in a position to assure the House that no matter how great the demand becomes, as fast as it is physically possible, the service will be expanded at the expense of the Exchequer to maintain this expedition and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan seemed to inquire by implication how many counties had reached the limit of their rating right and how many still have a margin in hand.  Seventeen county committees are receiving from their respective councils the full 4d. rate; nine are receiving between 3d. and 4d. and one less than 3d.  Deputy Corry managed, before he could be stopped, to repeat the grotesque misrepresentation that this Government was responsible for the disgusting robbery of the barley growers of this country which continued for seven weary years under our predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry inquired as to why it was decided that no part of the funds of the county committees of agriculture should be used for the subsidisation of ground limestone.  In any part of Ireland, it is not intended hereafter that ground limestone should be subsidised from the funds provided for the county committees of agriculture. The reason is this, that ground limestone in this country is being produced, sold and distributed at a price substantially less than that being <Col N="1504" /> charged in Great Britain and will be less and less.  There is no intention of lifting the burden of distributing this commodity at an economic price from the shoulders of those who have undertaken its production.</P>
      <P>I want to say quite clearly that I hope the firms that have undertaken and are about to undertake the production and distribution of ground limestone will make a good profit.  I would be glad to see them profiting but they will get no chance of exploiting the public or of battening on the public funds.  But, I am bound to add, from what I know of the firms engaged in the industry, they have never shown the slightest inclination to try.  On the contrary, in all their operations to date they have done their best to bring down the cost to the farmer to the lowest possible penny that the development of their industry would permit. I look forward to the distribution of ground limestone of suitable fineness spread upon the farmers' land at 25/- per ton.  It may take a little while to reach that low figure.  That is where we are going, without any subsidy at all, and if there are obscurantist and antiquarian farmers who would prefer to draw it from the pit, they can go and draw it at 16/- per ton and spread it themselves and get themselves and their labouring men to swallow half of it in the process.  The sensible farmer, who values his time and skill more highly than the man who thinks it is worth nothing at all or that it is well spent tramping the five miles to the lime pit and five miles back, will get the lime spread on his land by mechanical spreaders at 25/- per ton, and if he cannot afford to do more than one acre, he will get one acre done right and wait until the next year to do one or two more.  I am prepared to say that, in existing circumstances, ground limestone at that rate is a good bargain and any farmer who forbears from getting it will be a great fool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House especially to remember that I mention the figure of 25/- as a target towards which we are proceeding. At the moment it may be that in certain areas farmers who wish to avail of that service have to pay 3/- or 4/- more, because we are only at the beginning <Col N="1505" /> but, as we get all the plant fully employed and all the facilities, which have not been easy to secure, by way of automatic distributors and so forth, I am satisfied that we shall be able to guarantee farmers supplies of ground limestone at that price spread all over Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  Does the Minister realise that burnt lime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a word about burnt lime before the Deputy speaks? In regard to burnt lime, I am authorising county committees of agriculture to continue to pay the subsidy, for this reason, that we will not have sufficient supplies of lime to meet our requirements for some years to come.  Lime-burning is a traditional occupation and a living for a lot of very decent people in rural Ireland.  I am a great believer in efficiency and up-to-date methods but I do not believe in depriving my neighbour of his living.  I do not believe people want to ensure that, as they have recourse to more efficient methods, an inevitable sequel shall be the elimination overnight of people who have made a decent living at a useful occupation and who are not in a position now suddenly to metamorphose their whole lives and turn their hands to something entirely new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Burned lime is an excellent product, as good in every particular as ground limestone.  A great many people are earning their livings out of it.  I believe efficiency and money are not the only things that count in this world, and I believe I am correctly interpreting the feelings of most people in rural Ireland when I consent to county committees of agriculture, where they think it prudent, subsidising burned lime, so that our joint undertaking to the lime burners may be effectively redeemed. I believe that they will have plenty to do so long as they want to continue burning lime.  I want to say explicitly to the House now that so long as I am what I am, any county committee of agriculture desiring to maintain the subsidy on burned lime and preserve that modest industry in the area they cater for will have my consent for their proposal, but the <Col N="1506" /> initiative naturally, inasmuch as the funds are locally raised, is a matter for the local authority itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect that the Minister appears to have overlooked, that a ton of burned lime is equal to two tons of ground limestone. It appears to me that with the subsidy on the burned lime it will become cheaper than the ground limestone, and that will have the effect of bringing the ground limestone industry to a standstill, or handicapping it severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is well taken.  I can assure him that there will be a demand for the next 20 years far in excess of any equipment I can hope to see installed here for both products.  If, however, there is the slightest danger of the situation developing to which the Deputy refers, he can rest assured I shall lose no time in coming to the Dáil to consult Deputies as to the best methods to relieve it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry is scandalised because there was no subsidy provided by the Galway County Committee of Agriculture for the lime available at Tuam. The poor Galway people would not be enabled by the county committee of agriculture to acquire lime which was offered to them for nothing.  How can you subsidise nothing?  I will ask the Deputy this question.  Perhaps he could tell the House what became of the lime that the people in Galway were encouraged by members of the Beet Growers' Association not to buy?  Where did it go?  Did any of it go to the County Cork and, if it went to Cork, who bought it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I bought it.  Does the <Col N="1507" /> Minister see anything wrong in that? I did not even buy it.  I paid the freight on it, plus the cost of loading it, because the Galway people, like others, had to be educated into using it.  Is that clear enough to the Minister?  If the Minister wants to prove all that, he can go down to Cork, to Mallow factory, and see there every pound of lime taken out from the filters and thousands of tons of it lying in the other three factories.  But, of course, the Minister is looking for some cheap gibe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The facts then are these, that the Deputy deplores that the County Council of Galway, through its county committee of agriculture, did not subsidise this lime.  That failure he attributes to lack of knowledge how to use the lime.  The fact is that the lime was offered to the people of Galway for nothing.  The fact is that members of the Beet Growers' Association encouraged the people not to take it, and it was left at the factory to be shifted later to Cork to Deputy Corry, who bought it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Beegan in dealing with this matter said that he thought that appropriate and similar expenses should be provided for members of agricultural committees as were provided for other subsidiary committees of the local authorities.  I fully agree with the Deputy that there has grown up in this country a tendency to treat anything associated with agriculture as being something of an inferior breed.  I have always propounded the proposition that agriculture, and those who belong to that industry, are in fact carrying the rest of the community on their backs and that they and their representatives are entitled to the same respect, at least, as that accorded to the representatives of any other section of our society.  So <Col N="1509" /> long as I am Minister for Agriculture I intend to see that they get it.</P>
      <P>These are all the matters I have to deal with except to remind the House again that this Bill levies rates and taxes on nobody.  This Bill places an increased burden on nobody.  This Bill does not add a fraction of a farthing to the rates on any county in Ireland. This Bill simply permits such local authorities, as consider it expedient, to raise another penny, 2d. or 3d., as they think fit for the service of the farmers of the county.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that the poultry instructresses are being prevented from doing their regular work, and also that money levied under the authority of this Bill might be money wasted.  If all this money is as well spent as the money that was spent on poultry instructresses in the last nine months I do not think any Deputy need search his conscience in supporting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me conclude with the record of the results of the exertions of the poultry instructresses in the last six months.  In March of last year we shipped 153,223 great hundreds to England and we got for them £214,055. In March of this year we shipped 433,123 great hundreds and for them we got £746,785.  In April of last year we shipped 376,312 great hundreds for which we got £512,469.  In April of this year we shipped 549,826 great hundreds for which we got £946,981.  In May of last year we shipped 392,020 great hundreds for which we got £529,375. In May of this year we shipped 423,738 great hundreds for which we got £729,033.  In June of last year we shipped 214,705 great hundreds for which we got £290,214.  In June of this year we shipped 286,132 great hundreds for which we got £416,686.  In July of last year we shipped 86,702 great hundreds for which we got £126,532.  In July of this year we shipped 180,263 great hundreds for which we got £261,398.  In August of last year we shipped 1,826 great hundreds for which we got £2,674.  In August of this year we shipped 80,319 great hundreds for which we got £129,183.  In September of last year we shipped 195 great hundreds for which we got £308.  In September of this year we shipped <Col N="1510" /> 38,819 great hundreds for which we got £62,436.  In October of last year we shipped 1,091 great hundreds for which we got £1,739.  In October of this year we shipped 11,694 great hundreds for which we got £18,808.  If every penny of this increase produces results commensurate with that, no money ever spent in this country will have given better value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister three questions arising out of the Bill and his recent statement.  Is it not a fact that all the increases in the quantity of eggs shipped this year were the result of the organisation brought about in 1945, 1946 and 1947 by Deputies Dr. Ryan and Smith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question is: did the Minister produce what he boasted about, a six weeks' hen, a hen laying in six weeks or not?  Leaving that aside and coming to the question of lime, the Minister told us that ground limestone was being produced at 16/- at the quarry or wherever it is being ground, and that it is being distributed in parts of the country on the fields at 25/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that where the nearest lime quarry is 30 miles from areas that require lime, it will be possible to have it spread at 25/-?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping to have it spread on lands within 40 miles of the quarry at 25/- a ton.  I want to make it clear, and I said so explicitly, that that is the target.  At present it may be quite fair to charge 28/- or 29/- until we get 100 per cent. user of the equipment or 100 per cent. consumption of the product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Defence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether his attention has been drawn to a Press report wherein he is quoted as stating that officers of the armed forces of this State are or recently were engaged on a tour of inspection of British military posts situated in the occupied portion of our country; and, if so, whether he will state (a) what was the number and rank of the officers so engaged; (b) at whose request or invitation this tour of inspection was carried out; (c) whether he considers it in the national interest that such fraternisation with the forces occupying portion of our territory against our will should be permitted to members of the Irish Army.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply to that question, the Minister stated that he had read the report referred to, that two officers whose ranks were commandant and captain attended a training exercise in Northern Ireland recently, that the invitation was received from the British military authorities, and that, as he had stated on Friday last, he considered that it was in the best interests of the nation and of the world as a whole to have, as far as was humanly possible, the friendliest feelings between the officers and men of different armies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that reply I felt myself dissatisfied, and I felt it right to put to the Minister the following considerations: the territory of this country, the territory of Ireland, extends to the whole island of Ireland and to its territorial waters in our six north-eastern counties.  There is there at the moment an alien puppet Government maintained and kept in power, contrary to the will of our people, by the protection of British armed forces&mdash;kept in power by the bayonets of a British Army of Occupation, the invading army which remained behind when the British invaders evacuated the remainder of the country.  Their existence there is a continuing violation of our national territory by these armed forces, maintained by Britain in the Six County area.  In my submission, these armed <Col N="1513" /> forces are the instruments of aggression against the historic Irish nation.</P>
    <P>It may be possible to state the position in terms other than those in which I have stated it.  It may be possible to state it in terms less blunt, less definite, less fundamental, but they would be less true.  Under these circumstances, I am asking the Minister to ensure that, for the future, no act of this House, no act of the Minister's and no act of any servant or soldier of the Irish people shall be calculated in any way to permit of its being understood that we give even the most limited acquiescence to this wrong upon our country and this violation of our territory.  According to the Minister's statement, the visit of these Army officers was a visit to a training course.  I think the Minister described it as a training course.</P>

      <P>Training exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this training exercise is one which was described by the British authorities as &ldquo;Operation Antrim.&rdquo;  From the Minister's reply&mdash;I hope that I am wrong in this&mdash;but from his reply, and from the attitude adopted, I felt that it was possible to discern, or to suggest, a certain complacency on his part to the presence of these armed forces of Britain in six of our north-eastern counties.  The British forces whom these Irish officers had to meet, and with whom they had to fraternise, are here as servants, as soldiers, of an invading army, an army which has no moral right or title to be present on our shores.  For the officers of our Army to meet them under circumstances such as those outlined by the Minister does seem to suggest to me a situation similar to that which would take place if a burglar were to enter your house and you were to invite him to sit down at the table and discuss your plumbing or your electric lighting system, or if a footpad were to grip you by the arm and that your reaction were to be to discuss with him the technicalities of jujitsu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, in effect, that fraternisation by officers of our Army with the forces of Britain, occupying the Six Counties, <Col N="1514" /> is something like that.  If we admit in any way, by the exchange of courtesies or otherwise, that Britain's forces in the North are anything other than the armed agents of a rapacious empire, then we are abandoning, to some extent at any rate, the moral basis of our claim for the control of our country. The basis of my objection to the Minister's attitude is that that attitude involves a degree of collaboration with the Army of Occupation in the North. Any anti-partitionist must be opposed, if he examines the matter thoughtfully at all, to any degree of collaboration. We in Clann na Poblachta object to this instance of collaboration just as we objected to instances of collaboration which took place when the previous Government co-operated with the police force of the Northern junta in the arrest and handing over the Border of republicans such as Michael Quille and Harry White.  We objected to collaboration in that instance and we object in this instance too.  We believe that our attitude towards Partition must be one of constant protest and that we must make it plain to the world that the alien institutions imposed upon our people in the partitioned portion of our country are based on force, persecution and conquest.  For that reason the situation disclosed by the Minister is one which I and those with me on these benches feel we must view with some disquiet.</P>
    <P>We feel that it is a situation in which we cannot quietly acquiesce. For that reason also any contact between the Irish Army and the British Army of Occupation in the Six Counties must, we feel, be reprobated. We make this case not out of any feeling of hatred or antipathy towards the British people.  For the great social experiment that is at present being undertaken by the British workingclass we have nothing but sympathy and respect.  For the ordinary people of Britain we are ready and anxious to hold out the hand of friendship.  However, while Britain occupies our six north-eastern counties we feel that to British institutions assisting in maintaining the unnatural Border, assisting in the continuance of Partition, we can offer nothing but our active and <Col N="1515" /> implacable hostility.  The training exercises to which two Irish Army officers were invited were described by the British military authorities as &ldquo;Operation Antrim.&rdquo;  For those of us who know the history of the past 30 years in the occupied portion of our country, not to talk of other operations that were carried out there&mdash;other operations that were carried out there with the connivance of those same armed forces to which two Irish Army officers recently went as guests&mdash;we cannot think of &ldquo;Operation Antrim&rdquo; without remembering that it is not so many years ago since there was &ldquo;Operation Pogrom&rdquo; in Belfast.  For that reason also we feel we must reprobate and criticise the accordance of any permission to officers of the Army of this State to fraternise with the occupying forces in the Six Counties.  Over these Six Counties the Union Jack still flies and while it flies there it is the badge of our subjection.</P>
    <P>The British uniform to the ordinary nationalist of the Six Counties still represents the uniform of an alien army holding them in servitude by armed force and by armed force alone. I think, perhaps, also that in addition to these considerations we have very little to gain from contacts with any of the institutions operating in the territory controlled by what has been described as &ldquo;the most reactionary junta in Western Europe.&rdquo;  Latterly there has been much talk of the possibility of increasingly friendly relations between this country and Britain.  Separatists and republicans wish for these friendly relations as much as anybody else, but the friendship can be on no sincere or lasting basis while as much as one British soldier remains on Irish soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I want to speak for less than two minutes.  It is so important a matter that I consider it one of high policy, and in this matter of high policy the Clann na Poblachta Party forms part of the Government. Their Leader is a member of the Government.  If what has happened is a matter of such high policy that Deputy C. Lehane is speaking, as he speaks, for the Clann na Poblachta Party then I suggest that the Government is no place for the Leader of the Clann na Poblachta Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from looking around this House that this is an inter-Party Government debate. We are discussing a very, very serious question, and one that impinges upon the partition of our country and yet, as far as I know, for the first time in the history of Dáil Éireann while an important debate is taking place, there is not a single representative of the Opposition Party present.  It is a matter of courtesy that somebody always occupies the Opposition Front Bench.  Not only is the front bench quite empty, but all the other benches are likewise empty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case made by Deputy Lehane, I can subscribe to and share all the sentiments held by Deputy Lehane.  I do not think, however, that he was quite fair when he suggested that my attitude was one of complacency in the partition of our country. He suggested that.  I think that remark was probably made in the course of his speech inadvertently and was not intended to carry the interpretation which it might possibly carry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to abhorrence for the partition of our country and the occupation of any part of our country by foreign troops, no matter how strong may be the feelings of Deputy Lehane, my feelings are equally as strong.  There is just one point on which I disagree with him.  It is, again, a point of view.  I do not regard the Northern Government as an alien Government.  I regard it as a Government of Irishmen gone astray.  I have hopes, my profession being designed to <Col N="1517" /> cure rather than to kill, that they will be cured of the mental aberration that instigates them to look outside their own country for leadership.</P>
      <P>I regard the people of Belfast, whether Protestant or Catholic, as Irish.  I regard them as our people.  I think it is our function in life to try to instil into them a proper spirit of Irish nationality&mdash;a spirit which may be superabundant in some portions of Ireland and deficient in others.  It is a case of, instead of &ldquo;Operation Antrim&rdquo;, a little blood transfusion so that that nationalism which is so common to a great many portions of this country will incite the Northern Protestants towards the recognition that this country is as much theirs as it is ours and to come along and join with us in sharing the burden of making the best we can of this little island.</P>
      <P>The gist of Deputy Lehane's remarks were directed towards objection to Ireland's troops, wearing the uniform of Ireland, asserting the right of Irish troops to carry that uniform in every square inch of our country.  The Constitution lays it down, and Deputy Lehane opened his remarks by pointing that fact out, that the whole of Ireland is ours and the waters around our shores.  I subscribe absolutely to those views.  I believe that that is so and I would be proud to see, not two, but 22,000 troops in the uniform of Ireland marching through Antrim with the same ease as they would march through County Cork.  We are tending towards the slave mind if we acquiesce in the partition of our country and if we shy away on every occasion from that abominable border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud of the fact that Irish officers in Ireland's uniform are marching through the Six Counties, are seen by the people there and are satisfying the extremists up there that we down <Col N="1518" /> here do not grow horns and that we are as good men&mdash;and perhaps better &mdash;than many of the people up there.  I can see nothing but good flowing from that kind of comradeship between the different armies.  I know that the influence of the contacts made between our Army and the army up there is little by little instilling into the minds of those who were most bitter the fact that we are not the outrageously, outlandish people that we have been featured as in the past.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there are two ways of looking at the matter.  Are we to acquiesce in the partition and mutilation of our country by not even using the soil of the Six Northern Counties as guests as long as the Union Jack flies there?  That is a matter of opinion.  I do not say my opinion is necessarily better than or in any way superior to the opinion and views expressed by Deputy Lehane.  I can understand the motives behind the views he has expressed.  I am sure that he will understand the motives behind the views that I have expressed. The motives, the aims, the intentions and the objectives of Deputy Lehane and myself are similar.  It is merely a matter of who is charged <i>pro tem</i> with the responsibility for action in respect of invitations of the kind we have received.  I believe and hope&mdash; and I have every reason to believe and hope&mdash;that it is by fraternisation that the hard feelings, which were in the past the principal obstacle up there, are gradually being moulded and softened and modified.  I may be wrong in that particular view.  But those were the motives underlying the particular sanction that I gave in this particular matter.</P>
