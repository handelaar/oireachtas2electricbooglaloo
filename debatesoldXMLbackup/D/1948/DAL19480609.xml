    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what is the position in relation to the lands of Mrs. Hyland, Togher, Hollymount, County Mayo, and if it is the intention of the Land Commission to have them acquired before November, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings are in progress for the acquisition of an area of 168 acres of the land of Togher, held by Mr. and Mrs. Hyland.  At the present stage of the proceedings the Land Commission cannot say whether the lands will be acquired by November next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that Mr. Thomas J. Campbell has three parcels of nonresidential land, situated at Rathscanlon and Kilbride, Swinford, County Mayo, and, further, that this land is now being offered for sale, and if he will consider taking over the lands for relief of the congestion which exists in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of resuming Mr. Thomas J. Campbell's lands at Rathscanlon and Kilbride is under investigation by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether any steps have been taken to acquire the large farm of Mr. Garrett Nally, Roundfort, Hollymount, County Mayo, for the relief of small land holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proceedings pending in the Land Commission in respect of Mr. Garrett Nally's lands <Col N="628" /> at Hollymount, County Mayo.  The question of acquisition was considered fairly recently by the Land Commission, who decided to take no further action in the case for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the Land Commission will take no further action in this question or will the Minister give us a guarantee that the Land Commission will take action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of my reply is &ldquo;The question of acquisition was considered fairly recently by the Land Commission, who decided to take no further action in the case for the present.&rdquo;  The situation is that the Land Commission may not consider the land suitable for acquisition at the moment but circumstances may change so as to cause them to alter their opinion in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no reason why this land should not be taken over because there are 700 acres of it in County Mayo alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (i) the quota of bacon authorised by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to be supplied by curers to their customers during the current month, and (ii) the quotas similarly authorised for each of the preceding months since 30th November, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised quota for the current month is 30 per cent. of the monthly average supplied in the year ended 31st March, 1941.  The monthly quotas authorised since 30th November, 1947, were: December, 1947, to February, 1948, 40 per cent.; March to May, 1948, 33? per cent.</P>
      <P>The decision to fix the current quotas was taken while the deplorable situation in the pork and bacon trade bequeathed to the Government by our predecessors was being tackled and it was then impossible to foresee the remarkable degree of success which was to attend the efforts of the officers of my Department, the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the Gárda Síochána, but if this should be maintained it is intended substantially to increase the quota next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, in view of the statement that the supply of legally cured bacon is the lowest on record, cause an inquiry to be made into the sources of the bacon which the <i>Irish Independent</i> tells its readers is more plentiful in the shops than ever before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to cause an inquiry to be made because I am painfully aware that the source of the exiguous supplies of bacon was the gross incompetence of the Minister responsible for maintaining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the <i>Irish Independent</i> has published statements, illustrated by photographs, of the plentiful supplies of bacon in the shops and that householders have written to the <i>Irish Independent</i> asking them to detail the shops <Col N="630" /> and the sources of the supplies to them? The Minister has made a statement indicating that the supplies of legally-cured bacon are the lowest on record.  The Minister must realise if the <i>Independent</i> statements are true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that the statements contained in the <i>Irish Independent</i> are true, and, if so, is he not aware that the source of supply must be other than a legal one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the statements in the <i>Irish Independent</i> are true; I am also well aware that the stated quotas fixed by my predecessor and his servants in office were not filled; I am also well aware that it was attempted to maintain an illusion that supplies were going to the retail shops for distribution which were not going there because the pork that should have been going to the curers to be turned into bacon was, in fact, going to the black market and not to them; the pork is now going to the legitimate market and the 30 per cent. quota at present is a greater supply than the alleged 33? per cent. and 40 per cent. quotas which were stipulated in the days gone by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last evening, I was dealing with the importance of afforestation to the country.  As other Deputies have stated and as is admitted, at the moment we have only slightly over 1 per cent. of our area under forests. This percentage is inadequate to maintain the necessary quantities of homegrown timber to maintain equable climatic conditions, the prevention of soil erosion, the creation of essential quantities of humus, wind-breaks, and the most perfect method of controlling extremes of flood and drought.  I mentioned also that the general opinion seems to be that only waste land should be utilised for afforestation.  That, I think, is a complete misunderstanding of the position.  If afforestation is to fulfil the requirements that I mentioned, it will be necessary to acquire substantial tracts of land that would be suitable and very suitable for agriculture.  There <Col N="634" /> is, as was pointed out, in the Department of Lands a considerable conflict between the Land Commission and the forestry division.  The Land Commission has as its objective the acquisition and division of land into suitable holdings, and that section of the Minister's Department is not anxious to make available any land that can be farmed to the forestry division of his Department.  If soil erosion is to be counteracted, we cannot do that simply by growing our forests on waste land.  It will be necessary, I think, for the forestry division to prepare a national plan which will make provision for the establishment of forests in the proper places in the country.  The activities of the Land Commission and the activities of the forestry division can be co-ordinated by the Minister, provided there is a comprehensive plan prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do admit that, for the present at any rate, and under the present circumstances, it would be rather difficult to carry out the planning programme that Clann na Poblachta advocated, or the planning programme that Clann na Talmhan advocated. There are practical difficulties in the way.  We believe, however, that if the plan is properly made and if there is determination on the part of the Minister to put that plan into operation we can easily double the annual acreage that Fianna Fáil indicated as their objective.  One of the difficulties in their way is the insufficiency of trained technical staff. I understand that it will take some time to train this staff technically and, consequently, the plan the Minister must have in mind must be a plan making provision for the training of a technical staff to carry out afforestation successfully.  According to my information, the staff that we have at the moment, although it is small, is a very efficient staff, which can hold its own with any afforestation staff anywhere in the world.  But, unfortunately, it is too small.  Those 26 years have been allowed to pass by two Governments &mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil&mdash;without the building up, as they should have built up, of a proper <Col N="635" /> technical staff, so that we would have now available the trained personnel to carry out the annual programme of planting that Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan advocated.</P>
    <P>I understand that a mistake was made some time ago when we had as director of the Forestry Division a person who received his training in Germany and that substantial belts were planted with similar timber.  I understand that that is a mistake and that, if the full value is to be obtained from afforestation, short-lived trees and long-lived trees must be planted in a uniform manner.  The object of that is to make suitable provision for the essential watering of the timber. You require a certain amount of timber with roots that do not go down very deep into the ground and, side by side with that, planted in the way our present director of afforestation would advise, timber with roots which go much deeper into the ground.  Three water tables would be more successful than two.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Californian red wood is a valuable and beautiful timber and that, outside the red wood belt in North-Western California, this country is the only country in which it can be grown satisfactorily, and that there are magnificent specimens at Summerhill, County Meath; Fort Granite, County Wicklow; Stradbally Hall in Laoighis, and at Ashford, Cong, County Mayo.  These are matters on which I do not pretend to have technical knowledge, but they have been brought to my attention by a person who has technical knowledge and experience in timber growing and afforestation all over the world.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here that the forestry division required belts or areas of 300 acreas to make the area under afforestation successful and economic.  I am informed that 300 is a slightly low acreage and that the suitable economic acreage is 450.  That, again, is a technical matter and I would be quite prepared, from the information I have got as to the efficiency of our present director of the forestry division, to leave that matter in his hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Deputies have referred to the problem of private planting where owners of land who have cut timber are compelled to replant.  I agree with the general criticism with regard to that.  If this private planting is to be successful it should be done, or the owner should be compelled to do it, to the satisfaction of the forestry division. The requirements of the law can be carried out at small expense but, from the point of view of timber-growing or afforestation, the present practices are useless.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with the approach that was made by the Deputies who took part in the debate.  I was particularly impressed by Deputy Seán Collins' contribution.  If we are all as determined with regard to afforestation as the debate yesterday would indicate, then I think the Minister has behind him the goodwill and support of this House in putting into effect the afforestation programme of his own Party within a short time.</P>
    <P>I agree also with what Deputy Seán Dunne and other Deputies said with regard to the wages of forestry workers.  These workers should be paid sufficient to enable them to exist under reasonably decent conditions.  That should be the measure of whether the wages paid are adequate or not.  This thing of gearing the wages of forestry workers to the wages paid to agricultural workers is only part of a general plan that someone seems to have worked out to keep the wages of agricultural workers, forestry workers, road workers and turf workers as low as possible.  If one endeavours to get an increase in wage for any one of these classes of workers, he is countered by the argument that it is geared to the other rate of wages and cannot be disturbed.  That has been the position here for many years and, unfortunately, people with that outlook still seem to have a substantial say in the running of the country.</P>
    <P>Only a few nights ago, with regard to the farm workers in Portrane Mental Hospital, the very same excuse was trotted out, that they cannot be paid a wage higher than that paid to agricultural workers in the area.  That must <Col N="637" /> be broken down.  I would ask the Minister to discuss this matter of wages with the forestry workers and to give the forestry workers what he considers to be a living wage, a wage on which they can marry and bring up a family in ordinary conditions of comfort.  If the Minister will once break through his old idea of gearing all these wages together he will have done a very useful and a very good work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little seemed to think yesterday that it was wrong to advocate an increase in wages for forestry workers, and said that it was dangerous to be developing this class consciousness. I cannot, I must say, understand the mentality of any person who is reasonably well supplied with the world's goods and thinks it a crime or a shame that anyone should advocate that our lowest-paid workers&mdash;who are paid below the ordinary standards of decency&mdash;should be brought up to a living wage.</P>

However, I do think that it is the Minister's duty to see that the forestry workers are well paid.  That is his duty and if he grants the increases they require he will have the support of Deputy Little, who apparently was concerned about this matter before I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the problem of money has been mentioned.  The general view is that we are doing this work for posterity and that posterity should pay for it. There probably is a good deal to be said for that view, but I realise, and I want to make it perfectly clear, that the afforestation programme that Clann na Poblachta had in mind, that it advocated and that it still advocates can hardly be carried out by borrowed money.  If it is to be carried out, this House will have to take steps to break the financial connection with England, and this House will have to give to its own Central Bank the power and the authority to create the money that we <Col N="639" /> need for afforestation and other purposes.</P>

      <P>It is entirely and absolutely inadequate.  We have been left in that position.  We have been left in the position that you have two wings of the Department of Lands in absolute conflict, one with the other. When the forestry division requires land that is suitable and suitably placed for afforestation they cannot get it from the Land Commission.  That is the position that has been left to the present Minister by his predecessors.  I appreciate and realise that Deputy Moylan did not carry this burden, or <Col N="640" /> responsibility, all the time.  I listened yesterday to his contribution to this debate, and I am quite sure that he is just as anxious as I am, and as the Minister is, to see afforestation pushed ahead, but he had to face these troublesome difficulties, one of which is finance.  My incidental reference to the method of finding the money was for the purpose of showing Deputy Moylan that, when we take the steps that ought to be taken, we shall dispose of all these difficulties and shall make our afforestation programme a practical and a possible programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of afforestation has been worn almost threadbare now.  It has been discussed and argued from many points of view for a number of years.  Deputy Moylan yesterday said truly that afforestation was viewed from two points of view, one, the urban and the other, the rural.  I have listened to a number of the speeches and all of them, from Deputy Moylan's right along to Deputy Cogan's, gave expression to the urban thought on this matter.  I was not surprised at that being so until Deputy Cogan spoke.  I thought he would try to give us the rural viewpoint.  He said that 10,000 acres per year was altogether too small and I think he went so far as to say that we should at least be able to afforest, in normal times, 50,000 acres per year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind Deputy Dunne&mdash;he speaks the urban mind as well&mdash;talking of the great loss which the disappearance of the forests was to this country.  I do not hold that point of view at all, and, while I am very anxious that certain types of land should be planted, there is one regret I have, a regret which I think the nation in general should feel, that is, that we had the forests too long in this country.  I am glad to say that, where there were forests 50 years ago, <Col N="641" /> and even less, there are happy homesteads to-day with contented families living on a fertile soil which is growing good crops.  Deputy Cowan said that the public good should be taken into consideration in this matter and that land should be taken which would be capable of growing timber on a large scale.  He advocated blocks of 450 acres.  I am thoroughly opposed to that, and if any such thing is attempted there will be more incidents of the type described by Deputy Moylan as having occurred in Gort.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is a good deal of waste land which could be planted in the country, but there seems to be a policy over in the forestry division that they will take only land which is capable of growing commercial timber. If that policy is not altered and if the suggestions made by Deputy Moylan and Deputy Collins, to the effect that the Department should undertake uneconomic afforestation, are not adopted, I do not think there is any hope whatever of the Department reaching even this modest figure of 10,000 acres per annum.  Land has become very valuable in recent times. At present almost the worst of land, except barren rock, if it is set for grazing, will bring a return of at least £2 per acre.  Does anybody imagine that the forestry division will get fairly average land, land which is even superior to the type of land I have mentioned, for £4 an acre, which I understand is the maximum price?  The maximum to-day is the same as it was in 1932, 1933 and 1934, and perhaps even previous to that.  If you are to get even fair land for afforestation with the goodwill of the owner, the price will have to be stepped up to at least double £4, if not more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the big drawbacks. It is all moonshine to talk of getting this, that and the other, if we are not prepared to pay the true value.  It is all right to talk about educating people into becoming forest-minded.  The farming community of this country may be looked upon as fairly dense and unintelligent, but they are fairly practical and they understand what suits themselves and what is in their own best interests.  They understand the <Col N="642" /> value to place on whatever property they have and they are not going to make a present of it for the sake of having forests created, when they can make much more of it by using it in another way.  It is not very often I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, but I heard him say here on several occasions on this Vote that land which was capable of rearing sheep or cattle should not be taken from the owners, that it was much more useful to the country by being worked in that way than to have it planted with trees which would not bring in a return for perhaps 50 or 70 years.</P>
    <P>There is, as I say, a good deal of waste land in the country, but I know the difficulties which exist.  I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that there are considerable areas of cutaway bog in the country, and whether there are any real owners of these areas, I do not know.  In many instances, I believe that these large areas of cutaway bog belong to nobody. They were merely taken over by people near them who chanced putting their stock in on them for a week or two each year.  The position in most cases, however, is that, at the time the landlords owned the bogs, they gave turbary to their tenants at a yearly rent, and the right they gave them was a right of turbary while the turbary would last, together with a spreading bank.  That died when the bog was cut out, and, in a great many cases, when the landlord sold his land to the Estates Commission, the Congested Districts Board or the Land Commission, these areas of cutaway bog were not included in the sale, but a few people, who, in my opinion, have no right to it, insist that they have.  I know there is a difficulty there, but these tracts of waste land all over the country are undoubtedly eyesores.</P>
    <P>I think the Department should try to get that land voluntarily, have it drained and planted.  I believe that is the best type of land for planting.  As Deputy Moylan and some other Deputies have pointed out, it will help to dry such land and bring it back into fertility in the course of time.  I was interested in a statement also made by Deputy Moylan yesterday evening from <Col N="643" /> the employment point of view.  He said that at present one man is employed per 100 acres.  He said that with a bit of a drive he believed it should be possible to employ one man per 50 acres and, as time went on, one man per 25 acres.  But if we take the relief of unemployment into consideration, even at the rate at which the forestry branch intends to proceed with the planting of 10,000 acres per year, which I believe is a fairly fast pace and one they are not likely to out-step for a very long time, that would only mean, at the rate of one man per 25 acres, 400 men a year.</P>

      <P>I am subject to correction on that, but I understand that he was speaking in regard to unemployment. One man for 25 acres is certainly not going to give much relief from the employment point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Deputies advocated the rigid enforcement of replanting in all cases where felling permits were given.  I suggest to the Minister that he should proceed cautiously there.  It is all very well to suggest the enforcement of that regulation if the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture are satisfied that the land on which replanting would take place cannot be brought into a state of fertility to produce crops and grass.  Where that is possible I hold that that condition as regards replanting should not be rigidly imposed, provided the owner of the land or the occupier of the land is prepared to pay £6 per acre to the forestry branch.  That £6 could be utilised for the purchase of waste land which would be of much greater advantage to the country in the long run <Col N="644" /> than the rigid enforcement of that condition where an occupier is in a position to bring that land into fertility and into production.  I pay very little attention to Deputies or others who talk about 50,000 acres, or 60,000 acres a year.  In my opinion that is all so much moonshine and people will very soon see through such talk.  I think 10,000 acres are the very maximum. If the Minister and his Department insist on acquiring the type of land that has been insisted upon in the past for afforestation purposes and only pay £4 per acre for it, even in normal times the Minister is not going to get half that amount; he is not going to get even 5,000 acres of land in any one year for afforestation.</P>

I do, however, want to put a question to the Minister concerning a matter of considerable importance in that portion of my constituency adjoining the Galway border where the Department of Lands have been carrying out forestry operations for some time.  As I understand it, the scheme was to migrate a large number of people from the Flagmount district of County Clare adjoining the Galway border to estates which were to have been provided for them by the Land Commission.  Owing to an adverse decision in the Land Court recently the estates to which these people were to have been migrated are not at present available nor are they likely to be available in the near future.  Now, I do not expect the Minister to reply to my question at the close of this debate, but at his convenience I would like to know from him what will become of this particular scheme.  Is it going to be continued?  Will these people be migrated to other estates?  It would be a pity if the good work done by the forestry branch were to be discontinued now.  It would be a greater pity to deprive those people of improving their conditions elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to forestry, it is somewhat amusing to listen to the various viewpoints.  One hears residents of our cities and towns advocating the plantation of trees on a tremendous scale, on an impossible scale, quite forgetful of <Col N="645" /> the fact that even in the waste land to which reference has been made most of this land is situated at an altitude at which timber will not grow.  Beyond a certain contour line timber will not grow.  I notice the Minister shakes his head.  Apparently he is of the opinion that timber will grow anywhere irrespective of height.  I would advise him to consult with the expert of his Department on that particular point. I do not want to create obstacles for the Minister.  I merely want to point out some of the drawbacks that are not perhaps apparent to the minds of those people who would like to see the country, as we would all like to see it, studded with trees.  There is no greater admirer of forestry than I am.  Frequently in my journeys over many years I have sat the whole journey watching the changing countryside and the changes in the colour of the trees. There is no man keener on forestry than I am.  But there is a limit to our resources and it is as well that we should all realise what the limit is with regard to the amount of land that can be made available.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Beegan has said. Before you can have any afforestation scheme you must have the goodwill of the people in the particular district. If you have not that goodwill one evil-minded person may destroy thousands of acres and the results of several years' work overnight with a single match.</P>
    <P>Some of our bogs will not carry timber without reclamation.  A certain class of timber will not grow in peaty soil, but there are certain types of timber that will grow in such soil provided suitable reclamation is carried out.  There is one aspect of this problem that appeals to me.  Now that materials for fencing are available again it should be possible to carry out small scale planting on most holdings. On nearly every holding there is a corner of waste land.  That corner may only be a quarter of an acre or, as in the case of some of the larger holdings, it may run into a couple of acres. Every encouragement should be given to the owners and occupiers of these lands to plant shelter belts throughout their farms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> The multiplication of these shelter belts would have a tremendous effect on the scenic appearance of the countryside.  They would also help to provide shelter for live stock.  I very strongly advocate that the Minister should direct his attention to that aspect of the situation.  This is particularly true of my own native heath, County Clare, and of the western and south-western counties, where there is a lot of bleak unprotected land.  I know that there are difficulties with regard to forestry but I know also that they can be surmounted.  In these districts there is the prevailing western wind together with a high annual rainfall. Suitable timber should be provided, or even shrubs, to break the force of the rain and the western gales. I believe a good deal could be done to beautify the country and, at the same time, protect the live stock.  In that way the health, not merely of the animal population but of the community as a whole, would be improved. I commend these suggestions to the Minister.  I hope that he will have the question I am raising in regard to the plantation in the Flagmount area dealt with without delay or else inform me of the alternative plans of his Department for dealing with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, like every other year, we have the usual amount of encouragement on the Forestry Vote in this House.  Unfortunately, this year, like every other year, we see very little progress being made with regard to the actual number of trees or forests that are about to be planted.  It is encouraging in a slight degree to hear the Minister say that we will be able to plant approximately 1,000 acres this year more than last year but we are still a long way behind even the target of the Fianna Fáil Government which was 10,000 acres a year.  Ten thousand acres a year are not a sufficient target for the Forestry Department of this country.  However, we cannot go ahead at the present time with the great forestry scheme because of the events of the past seven or eight years, due to the war.  If we had sufficient land to plant 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 acres to-morrow and if we had sufficient men <Col N="647" /> to work that land we certainly would have to stand by because we would not have sufficient plants or trees.  The amount of seed that we have been able to import would not in any way be sufficient for our needs.  We cannot go to the Scandinavian or the Continental countries to purchase seedlings or young trees because those countries have neglected their own nurseries over the past seven or eight years.  They have cut to the very utmost their supply of timber.  They are not now in a position to supply any outside country with either seedlings or trees in the quantities which those outside countries require because they want them for their own forests and their land.  Therefore, we shall have to wait, as we have already waited so long, before we see any great boom in forestry in this country.  We all know that this country is much below what it should be with regard to forests.  We are told that the safety margin in forestry for any country is to have planted 8 per cent. of the total acreage of land.  Be that land good, bad or indifferent, 8 per cent. of the total acreage is necessary to be planted to ensure the good health and the general wealth of a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have less than 1 per cent. of our little country planted, and when we think that this headline of 8 per cent. is essential to countries which are surrounded by the sea, namely, islands, we can understand how far we are off the mark that would bring us safety with regard to forests and health.  We are, if you like, only amateurs on this subject, but we must realise that in the Scandinavian countries 200 years ago there were very few forests also.  The real boom in forestry in Scandinavia came not for the purpose of improving the wealth or the beauty of the countryside, but to improve the health of the population. In those years almost between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of the people were supposed to be affected with tuberculosis.  An old scientist found out that the growth of timber would improve the climate and dry up the atmosphere generally, thus bringing <Col N="648" /> better health to the community.  That was the real reason why the Scandinavian countries set out on the giant plantation schemes they did.  In later years the result of their wise thoughts proved beneficial to the countries. Their most valuable industry to-day is timber, just as our most valuable industry would be timber in the years to come.  We must admit that the forestry scheme we would plan this year will be of no value whatsoever to any man in this House or even to the youngest child born in this country to-day.  We know perfectly well that there are people who think that trees will grow to maturity in ten to 20 years.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>Such trees may be useful for certain things like pit props or firewood and would add a little to the wealth of the country, but their real commercial value can never be achieved until trees have at least 50 years of growth.  That should not, however, deter us because the amount of employment that can be given at the present time in a proper forestry scheme is something we do not visualise here in this House.  We are told that the acquisition of land for forestry is one of the big stumbling blocks.  The provision of money by way of State finances does not seem to present any difficulty at all.  There are various opinions here with regard to what authority the section of the Irish Land Commission which deals with forestry should obtain with regard to the provision of land for the planting of forests.  Some Deputies advocate that it should not be given great powers; others state that it should.  I am opposed to having timber planted on land that could be used for agricultural production of any kind.  It is more valuable to us at present to have agricultural production.  Therefore, we should plant our forests in the secondary class land of which there is plenty in this country.  Hitherto, for some peculiar reason, the forestry pointer has been entirely away from the province of Connaught.  I am speaking in this debate, not because I think there is any great hope of a vast forestry scheme within the next two or three years, but because I want to bring the Minister's attention&mdash;<Col N="649" /> although I do not think I need do so&mdash; to the hundreds of thousands of acres of waste land that are in the province of Connaught and that are admirably suitable for forestry timber.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan hit the nail on the head when he talked about cutaway bogs.  We all know the immensity of these cutaway bogs along the western seaboard.  They would grow first-class timber.  They will not, however, grow timber if trees are planted haphazardly by the Forestry Department.  If the scheme is properly prepared there is no doubt that we can have first-class timber grown on the derelict and waste bogs.  The goodwill of the local people is also taken into consideration.  We are not savages and we know perfectly well that if there is any industry brought into a locality which will give employment and let money go around, the people will not go out to sabotage it.  There may be forest fires which will, if they get under way, destroy in one night or day the efforts of ten or 20 years.  But this island is not so big and is not such a wilderness that we cannot find a forest fighting section to look after such fires.  Anyone who puts up that obstacle to the progress of forestry knows little of his subject.</P>
    <P>I believe that the forestry section of the Land Commission should have more powers to acquire land.  The price which will be paid may or may not be enough.  In my part of the country, where we have so much congestion and where people are looking for an industry which will provide employment instead of having their sons and daughters forced to emigrate, I believe that even at £2 per acre the Minister would get plenty of land for tree-planting purposes.  It would be land very suitable for trees and as good as any to be found elsewhere through the the country.  The same would apply to other parts of our State.</P>
    <P>We are told that if trees are planted at a certain height they will not reach maturity and most of them will fail. In my opinion even the highest point in this country is not too high for growing trees.  Along by the seaside, if there are protecting belts of a more hardened type of timber, fit to stand <Col N="650" /> exposure to the elements&mdash;a timber which, I am sure, the scientists of to-day could produce&mdash;I am sure we would be able to get trees which will be beneficial to the country from the point of view of industry and as a means of absorbing our unemployed.</P>
    <P>If we were faced with the problem that the Italians were faced with, when they dredged the Mediterranean, brought up mud from the bottom of that sea, plastered it along the mountain sides, planted young trees and got those trees to grow, then we might have more respect for our land and we could say to ourselves: &ldquo;This is land which can be worked easily and without half the slavery that other people have experienced&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not approaching this matter in the right way.  There is plenty of co-operation in this House.  No man has said a word against forestry.  There is, however, a hold-up somewhere.  The Department does not seem to be inclined to tackle this matter in the enthusiastic manner in which it should be tackled.  I know the Minister has the best intentions in the world, but in the matter of forestry, above all things, he cannot expect to perform miracles in a few years.  The 10,000 acre target indicated by the last Government is not sufficient.  With that 10,000 acre target it would take 100 years to plant 1,000,000 acres.  Everyone knows that we have more than 1,000,000 acres of forest land available.  If we read some of the books about forestry we will be told we have between 3,500,000 and 4,000,000 acres available.  Even if we confine ourselves to 1,000,000 acres, we would have to have that planted within 100 years or otherwise we would not be doing our duty.</P>
    <P>The real wealth of timber comes in what is called the rotating forest.  The 10,000 acres that will be cut one year will give way to 10,000 acres that will be planted and that system of rotation will continue through the years.  That is the sound way of making timber wealth producing.  It is the type of wealth for which we cannot make plans.  Our duty is to tackle it immediately and hand on the work to posterity. If in 1922 or 1923, when it was very easy to go to the outside world to <Col N="651" /> get forest plants and every other requirement at a very cheap rate, we planted 10,000 acres, I have no doubt that the industry would have got such a hold on the people that at the present time we would be able to lay down plans for the planting of 50,000 or 60,000 acres.</P>
    <P>During the election there was plenty of talk about forestry schemes to the extent of 50,000 and 60,000 acres.  The rotating scheme of forestry is the only one that will ultimately be successful. That is the secret of success in the Scandinavian countries, and it can be made successful here.  We will be getting somewhere if we tackle it that way.  If we do not adopt that policy, we will be wasting time and merely fooling the country.</P>
    <P>The planting of trees on higher ground is a problem.  We are blessed with one thing that very few countries have.  We have no erosion.  We can safely say that the mountain-side which had its green patch 50 years ago can have the same to-day.  In many parts of the world the wind will this year sweep the side off a mountain.  In this country that rarely happens.  We have a moist climate, very suitable for trees. We now have a native Government in control, we have plenty of resources, ample man-power and sufficient land and it is up to us to make the best of our opportunities or else admit complete failure.</P>
    <P>There are many by-products from timber.  The use to which timber can be put is really amazing.  We are told that 300 different articles can be produced as by-products of timber.  I read an article four months ago about what they are doing in Sweden.  It amazed me to learn that sawdust in the Swedish mills is now being ground and mashed up by some process, and the result is the hardwood that we are using here and that the world is being supplied with from Sweden.  That hardwood is now being made from sawdust that heretofore was allowed to go waste in timber mills all over the world.  That is only one of the many industries that can be brought about through forestry.</P>
    <P>In this country we are almost at a <Col N="652" /> standstill in regard to forestry.  The war years have drained the forests and timber nurseries of the world.  Even with our best efforts we cannot go ahead very rapidly.  The different statements that were made here should give every encouragement to the Minister.  There is no doubt that if a proper reclamation scheme were put in force here we would have at least 100,000 acres of land that could be devoted to useful agricultural production. We know that the highest mountains here will grow grass, because there is no erosion and the earth will stick there.  We have evidence of that from what the Cistercian monks have done in Mount Melleray, where they cleared away the rocks and made fertile land on the top of the mountain. In Sweden and Norway at present the timber industry is so valuable that it is now more profitable for them to plant their agricultural land in forests than to produce food or the other things they want.  If to-day those countries could be guaranteed food from the outside world, they would plant almost their entire acreage in timber.  That shows the value of the timber industry.  Even at the 15-years' growth stage, the value as firewood and pit props is great.</P>
    <P>Forestry is an industry which would give employment to youth and keep people working, and these are the main things we want.  A good forestry scheme would also improve the health of the people.  What was done in other countries can be done here.  We have plenty of workers and there seems to be no shortage of money, as we are never told that finance is the big drawback. We also have men in the different Departments who understand forestry perfectly.  While I have very little use for many of the officials who constitute the powers-that-be in the Land Commission, I fully believe that the men in charge of the forestry section know their job, and if they are given enough encouragement by the Minister and by this House they will go ahead with their work.  The difficulties in the provision of land should not stop them.  The Minister should have more powers to acquire land.  People will not give up anything <Col N="653" /> voluntarily.  It is amazing how the value of an acre of cutaway bog increases when a Department inspector is seen with a mark in his hand and is trying to acquire it for any Government project.  It has been derelict and waste for 50 years, but let anyone appear and it suddenly becomes a goldmine for the people concerned. That must stop, and the Minister can only stop it and go ahead with forestry if he introduces legislation and takes more power into his own hands regarding acquisition and regarding the different types of trees that should be planted.  He must also see that no effort is spared to bring the acreage &mdash;which this year is only something like 6,000 acres&mdash;up within the next three years to 10,000, and within five years after that to at least 15,000 or 20,000 acres a year.  If that is not done, we will not have the forestry scheme we envisage and would like to see; but if it is done, there will be a vast improvement in the general forestry outlook.</P>
    <P>With regard to forestry workers, we know that Cong in County Mayo is the only place from which a complaint has come.  There is no forestry or State plantation within 50 miles' radius around me, although there is plenty of land.  We are told these men are dissatisfied with the wages.  Forestry workers have to work hard at manual toil.  Timber must be put down by the hands of men.  There are no machines which will plant trees or knock them down.  It is by the sweat of their brows that the forestry labourers grow the timber.  We all know how they have to work on wet days going through the forests, wet to the skin, and then we are told their wage is not a living one.  The Minister must look into that complaint, if it is genuine&mdash; and it must be genuine.  If he brings satisfaction to them, there will be an increased output and those workers will do their best to improve the forestry situation of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, after his short sojourn in the forestry section, appreciates much better than he did a year or so ago many of the difficulties of carrying through the programme <Col N="654" /> of his group.  One would have thought that, in introducing the Estimate, the Minister would have given it something of the new look and that he might have asked for double the Estimate of last year.  Of course, he may come along later with a Supplementary Estimate, after getting the new design for forestry from Deputy Cowan.  I have no doubt he will do so, if he accepts Deputy Cowan's design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot need money. If he consults Deputy Cowan as to how the money is to be provided, he will have no difficulty there.  It is obvious that there is no settled mind on the matter of forestry policy in this House, amongst the different Deputies who have expressed their opinions.  We have city Deputies with city minds who believe they need only wave a wand and have all parts of this country planted as they desire.  There is a very great difference of opinion as to the land that should be planted, and there always will be.  That is one of the main difficulties in forestry policy.  It has been so in the past and will be so in the future.  The Minister has, in his own hands in the Department, all the powers for compulsory acquisition that he could desire.  As he is a careful man, I am sure he will use those powers very sparingly and will not proceed to acquire compulsorily very much land for forestry purposes.  It is far better to get it voluntarily, from people who desire to part with it voluntarily, rather than acquire it compulsorily. As Deputy Beegan said, most people who own land and are putting it to any use can reap more advantage from it than they could by selling it to the forestry section.  I would like to say to the Minister that if he and his Department hope to acquire much more land in the future for forestry, they will want to mend their hand in the matter of price.  They cannot hope, if the price of land and the price of agricultural produce remain anything like what they are at the present time, to acquire in the next dozen years anything like the amount of land that they have acquired in the last dozen or 20 years unless they take very inferior <Col N="655" /> land.  I believe that the maximum price is £5 an acre with annuities redeemed. You might offer a man £5 an acre but by the time the annuity was redeemed he would not get half that. I have heard of an offer of £1 per acre and that would not even be £1 when the annuity was redeemed.  The Minister cannot hope to get land unless he can persuade his Department or whoever controls the finance to make more money available or the type of land which he will get in future years will be very inferior.</P>
      <P>Whatever the views of his Party in the past in the matter of forestry, I hope that the Minister will not embark on any wildcat schemes such as that advocated by Deputy Cowan, to have 1,000,000 acres in five years.  No sensible person, no person at large outside Bedlam would continue to suggest that there were 1,000,000 acres of land suitable for forestry in this country that could be planted in five years.  It could not be done.  The sooner Deputy Cowan and his friends get away from that and get down to something sensible the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Estimate last year I suggested to the then Minister that something should be done by the Forestry Department to get the patches of good forestry land here and there throughout the country on which timber was felled during the recent emergency replanted.  They are not owned by the Department of Lands but by private farmers and others throughout the country.  I would again suggest the replanting of the immense number of small patches of land which are available throughout the country, on which good timber was felled during the war and which proved themselves as good forestry land.  You cannot grow good timber, heavy timber, except on good land.  That is a well-known fact.  The land which grows the best crops, the best land in the country, grows the best timber, and poor land will never grow good timber. An immense amount of matured timber was cut throughout the emergency in the valleys and dells throughout the country, and it has not been replanted.  There is no doubt about <Col N="656" /> that.  This was due to the scarcity of plants up to now.  I am sure, even if some farmers were compelled to plant, it would not succeed owing to the difficulty of cleaning.  There is great difficulty in cleaning, in uprooting roots and getting ready for replanting. If the Department were to undertake the replanting and, if you like, charge it on the farmers as an annuity, thus recouping themselves, it would pay dividends over the years.  These patches are spread all over the country where timber has been cut, and I suggest to the Minister that it must be replanted.  I suggested that last year to his predecessor and he made some move in trying to get the local authorities to plant that land. Personally, I do not think that is feasible, because the local authorities have no machinery for protecting that land. They are ill-equipped and they would not be the proper authority at all to undertake any planting, even in a small way.  The local authority, however much they might be inclined to do it, would be the wrong people altogether to undertake this job.</P>
    <P>The question of the wages paid to forestry workers compared with the wages paid to farm workers is a big problem.  Take a county like the county I come from, County Wexford, where there are some forests.  I had complaints at different times from farmers that the Forestry Department were competing with them for the pool of labour available.  I would say, however, to give the Forestry Department their due, that they are most careful about that, but at times they do compete with the farmers for the pool of labour available.  Every farm worker in the country would get into forestry work if he could in preference to working on a farm.  Men will work on public work, whether road work or forestry work, in preference to working for a private individual&mdash;that is, in the main.  In fairness to them I would say that they have to work much harder for the Forestry Department than for any farmer and they would, in my opinion, be entitled to somewhat preferential treatment in the rate of compensation because they are kept out in bad weather under difficult conditions very often.  These men work <Col N="657" /> under difficult conditions when men working on a farm can go in and get shelter.  There is that difference in the type of employment and that only.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Cowan has come back to the House.  He is available now again and we are most interested to hear his scheme which Clann na Poblachta outlined but which they are putting in abeyance and which they are going to put in operation some time in the very distant future.  It will not be in this century.</P>

      <P>We all know that during the emergency many woodlands in this country were cut for commercial and fuel purposes.  This timber served a very useful purpose but now the job is to plant that land again.  We have the land; we have the men; we have the money but to get the trees is the problem, as far as I can see.  I have been speaking to nurserymen in Cork and they tell me that it will take 20 years to plant the lands of Cork and Kerry.  The Minister has a big task therefore, but I am sure that he will have the co-operation of the House and of the country in the schemes which he envisages.  The timber in this country served a very useful purpose during the emergency and maybe in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years' time we might have a similar emergency and we must look forward to it.  In order to grow timber you must encourage the farmers.  Every farmer has some waste which he would plant if he were encouraged, but to encourage the farmer you must pay him.  I suggest that the Department should give him trees.  If every farmer planted some trees during the next ten or 20 years in conjunction with the Government schemes you would get the waste land planted.  The second last Deputy said that all land in this country was forestry land.  The monks <Col N="658" /> in Mount Melleray came to a mountain and had to make the land fertile.  A lot of the land is not suitable for anything but trees, but you need good land to grow trees.  In Norway and other countries where they have good timber and trees 80 or 90 feet high they are grown on good land.  Bad land will not grow timber.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider giving trees free to every farmer.</P>

      <P>I was criticising the other Department, the twin brother of the Forestry Department, a few days ago.  I am sorry I cannot say very nice things about the Forestry Department either.  If they continue as they are going on, it is obvious that we will be importing ash-plants very soon into this country.  I am not accepting as excuses the danger of fires and many other things which have been put to us in the past and I am sure will be put up to us by the present Minister. If we are here this day 12 months, we will hear the same old excuses trotted out.  As to the excuse about goodwill. I wonder was much goodwill obtained 100 years ago when certain elements in this country did take in certain lands and planted them; I am not saying very much against them for planting. That is the only thing they left to us which has been very much use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not accepting the excuse that you must have all this goodwill.  I am not at all satisfied that the people of the country are so mischievous that they will burn down every place where a forest is planted.  I do not think they would.  If necessary, the Minister for <Col N="659" /> Justice could make it a very serious crime for any mischievous person to burn down any of our forests.  Any person who did that should be kept in jail until the trees have so matured that paraffin oil and a few matches will not burn them down.  I agree that the Minister will have to do something very strong about these people.  Until recently we had not very much in the way of fire-fighting appliances.  For the past five or seven years, however, there is not a town but has some fire-fighting appliances, and they were able to cope with most of the fires that occurred, whether accidental or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am an advocate not only of a bigger wage for forestry workers but of a greater number of workers being employed.  It does not require much technical knowledge to be an ordinary forest worker.  A man becomes a very efficient worker after a very short time. I have been associated with very many of them over 40 years and I know they are first-class men who do their job very well.  I am pleased to hear of the development in Dundrum in recent years and I hope the Minister will, if at all possible, undertake further development of the sawmill there.  If, as Deputy Commons stated, boards have been manufactured from sawdust and if they are able to do that in some other countries, there is no reason why the Irish people should not be able to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan put forward a lot of excuses.  I am not accepting all his excuses. We were led to believe that the members of Clann na Poblachta are forestry minded.  If they are, and if the Minister is not going fast enough, they are the people to tell him, and they can make certain that he will go fast enough by cutting another ash-plant, in addition to the one they have. I am not suggesting that they should use the ash-plant on the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan suggested that the farmers should be helped to plant shelter belts, that they should be given every encouragement <Col N="660" /> to do that.  It would be a very good method of helping in a small way the reafforestation of the country.  For instance, most of the committees of agriculture give a certain number of trees to farmers, but I believe the main trouble for the farmers is the fencing. I agree that wire and stakes are costly. I think committees of agriculture should be given greater grants with a view to enabling farmers to fence off portion of their lands.  I would even go a little further and say that farmers should be given a certain amount of money each year for maintenance of the shelter belts.</P>

      <P>The remarkable thing about this discussion is the unanimity of opinion as to the desirability of forestry development.  I think the debate has been on a par with the type of debate which takes place on this Estimate year after year.  While Deputies are unanimous about the objective, every alternate Deputy who gets up expresses a different point of view. The result is that when it comes to digesting the conflicting advice offered to him the Minister finds himself in the same position as he was before.  There are so many conflicting views as to how forestry should be developed that the powers that be carry on in the same old way.  Whether that is wise or not, I do not know but I am afraid they do not get any alternative direction from the discussions that take place in the House year after year.  None of us knows much about timber.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputy Commons stating that you can grow the best commercial timber on bog lands.  I have heard Deputy Allen stating that you can grow the best solid commercial timber only on the best agricultural land.  I am not an expert but I would be inclined to contradict both of them. First, I say you cannot grow good, commercial, resinous woods on bog lands.  You would have to resort to what they call mound planting.  That is not considered economic or capable of producing good, commercial, resinous wood.  On the other hand, I have seen the best woods that this country ever grew, and that is saying a lot, grown on the slopes of the hills of Lough Derg, which is not agricultural land by any means, having a rocky surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In purchasing timber on behalf of the <Col N="662" /> railways of this country, I had to visit various parts of Munster and the finest timber I have ever handled, not excluding foreign timber, was Manitoba pine grown on the slopes of Lough Derg.  That forest was denuded at that time and has not been replanted since. Whoever was responsible for planting the original belt did a good job but their successors have not done a good job.  The altitude did not seem to matter, and a couple of feet or a couple of yards above Lough Derg did not seem to interfere with the production of magnificent timber capable of being converted into furniture or of being put to any other use.  You do not get that timber in all places but it is not necessary, in my opinion, to get the best agricultural land for afforestation. There are plenty of types of land available that are not suitable for growing the best quality timber but that could grow good timber.  As far as the bogs are concerned, they could be utilised only for small coniferous trees that would be used within a short period for pulp and things of that kind of good commercial value.</P>
    <P>The net point is that we ought to get on with the job and the question is whether we are doing sufficient. Deputy Commons expressed the view that we ought to get so much done in a certain period of time.  Everybody seems to think afforestation is desirable but, as I have said, I am afraid we will get back into the old groove when we have finished the discussions here and the old order will continue.</P>
    <P>Following the experience of the recent emergency, when we were up against it, we must realise that it was a good thing that we had some timber in the country.  We were amazed to find the quantity of commercial timber that we had.  The millers were able to go to the various parts of the country and cut timber which, up to that, had not been regarded as commercial timber.  By using drying kilns, they produced magnificent timber, not perhaps comparable with timber from the Black Forest or the American continent, but which could be regarded as good commercial timber with proper seasoning.  After three months' seasoning it was as good, in most cases, <Col N="663" /> as the best wood we had to import.  We are using to-day white deal from Sweden, Finland and other places that is inferior and incapable of producing any kind of decent joinery but there are no complaints about it because it comes from outside.  The joiners and carpenters one meets, the men who supervise the housing schemes, find it impossible to get decent joinery done because of the inferior nature of this wood.  It did not grow in Ireland and so there are no bones made about it.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with saw millers and people in a big way in the commercial world.  Their one fear is that we would revert to the apathetic forestry methods of the past.  They feel we ought to have been aroused from our slumber by our experience. There is definitely a big advantage to be gained if we embark on a bold policy of forestry.  We may not be able to produce the 1,000,000 acres that somebody was talking about in a given number of months but I would suggest that the Minister should establish a commission composed not only of forestry experts but of people engaged in the commercial life of the country and agriculturists, to plan the best method of advancing forestry in the minimum of time.  We cannot take agricultural land from agricultural purposes but we could easily get a survey of the amount of land that is capable of producing good timber of the various types.  There is plenty of labour available and it could be engaged in very good, national and reproductive work.  We are told that there would not be any shortage of money for this project.  If there is no lack of goodwill, what is lacking?  There is a lack of directive.</P>
    <P>In my early years as a Deputy I had a tangle with the forestry people from time to time.  They were inclined to be helpful but each man had a different point of view.  One inspector would accept a couple of hundred acres for planting and that would be reported on by another inspector as being unsuitable.  At that time we were told that areas of at least 300 acres were required for planting.  I went to the trouble of getting the consent <Col N="664" /> of farmers to give 15 to 30 acres to build up a belt of 300 acres only to find that my work was in vain because some expert said trees could not be grown there.  But the tree stumps were already there showing that trees had grown there before the Forestry Department was ever heard of.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that we ought to get on with forestry.  It could be used to build up a national reserve against future emergency.  Even when there is no emergency, it is a good thing to have it.  If it is so desirable, we ought to have some further advice, if necessary, called in to assist the Minister. The commission that I have suggested should be composed not only of forestry experts but of commercial people engaged in building and furniture making and financial business in this country to collaborate with agriculturists and the forestry people, to advise the Minister how to get on with the job of employing more men at a reasonable rate of pay.  That has been covered by everybody and I will not stress it again.  Forestry workers are entitled to something more than the pay of the ordinary agricultural worker.  I think the Minister will agree with that.  There are sections of them engaged in dangerous work and in work calling for skill and there is constant risk.  Even the humblest forestry worker is entitled to a small differential above the wages of the agricultural worker because of the arduous nature of the work and the weather conditions he has to endure. The men are prepared to work.  There are plenty of them available.  With the goodwill of all Parties in the House, who admit the desirability of making advance in a speedy way, I would suggest that the Minister should call in a commission, with a time limit within which to report and to recommend the best methods of speeding up the work and getting maximum results in the minimum time for this very laudable industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight or nine years ago I had occasion to speak on this Estimate.  At that time the Forestry Department sent inspectors to Kerry and rejected proposals that were put <Col N="665" /> forward.  Deputy Cowan mentioned one of the inspectors in this debate, Mr. Reinhardt, who was in charge at that time.  Strange as it may appear, the very areas in connection with which schemes were proposed and rejected by his predecessors were reported on favourably by him, after inspection, and he recommended to the Department to sanction afforestation schemes in those districts.  I quote that to show that even at that time forestry experts were no unanimous in their opinions.  They had no settled programme, as far as I can understand it, at any time within the past ten or 5 years.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Minister to review that position in so far as the general scheme is concerned and also in regard to the area that I represent.  I am glad that Deputy Keyes referred to the fact that, in certain parts of the country in the past, schemes were not approved of for laying down plantations.  That applied to certain parts of South Kerry.  It was held that commercial timber could not be grown there, but the fact is that some of the finest larch and pine in this country has been produced in those areas.  They were planted there within the past 100 years by landlords and other people who beautified that part of the country with these plantations.  They left, if you like, an asset to the country in these wooded glens and mountains.  I am unable to understand why our native Government could not at least do as well as those people did in their time.</P>
      <P>I again suggest to the Minister, as I did on former occasions, that, where there is a drainage scheme and an afforestation scheme to be carried out, the Department should co-ordinate its policy so that the men employed on the drainage scheme during the summer period could be employed on the afforestation scheme in the winter period.  If a policy of co-ordination of that sort were carried out, it would provide continuous employment for the men located in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take advantage of this Estimate to protest against the system that is being employed in the Killarney district at the moment.  I referred to it <Col N="666" /> here recently by way of Question.  The point is that the forestry workers on the Bourn-Vincent estate at Killarney are classed as agricultural workers. That should not have been done in my opinion.  I have had occasion to visit the Board of Works and the Land Commission about it, and all that I could gather from them was that they found it easier, from their point of view, to so classify these workers.  They admitted quite frankly that these workers were not, in the main, agricultural workers, only a small percentage of them, and yet they classified the greater number of them as agricultural workers, thereby depriving them of the right, first of all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I thought that I could deal with it in detail on this Estimate.  There is another matter that was referred to by the Minister in his opening statement, namely, the question of timber.  On the estate near Killarney, which I have already mentioned, timber was made available during the emergency.  There is a huge quantity of unsold timber on the estate at present.  I would like to know what is going to be done about it.  Will it be sold by public auction, or will it be sold to one or two local people?  It was originally intended for sale to Fuel Importers.  I understand there are about 100 tons of this timber available at the moment.  I would ask the <Col N="667" /> forestry section to devise some scheme whereby it can be sold to local people at reasonable rates rather than that one or two people should be allowed to come in and take the whole lot at their own price.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister more or less ridicule the idea put forward by Deputy Sheehan who suggested that farmers be asked to co-operate in afforestation schemes.  The Minister seemed to think that the idea was fantastic, and that that would really not be afforestation work.  I suggest to the Minister that if we are to have a real forestry drive in this country, and if we are to get all the people interested in afforestation, then farmers and everybody else in the rural districts should be asked to co-operate. Apart altogether from the shelter belt schemes carried out by the county committees of agriculture, the Forestry Department should devise some scheme for each rural district together with the major schemes that this Estimate is intended to deal with.  We found difficulty in certain areas in Kerry in providing 300-acre belts as insisted on by the forestry section.  That can be well understood when one examines the terrain and the surrounding areas in the mountainous districts and valleys adjacent.  Three-hundred-acre belts may be all right in other districts, but in these places it is pretty difficult to have an economic scheme of 300 acres in each valley or area.  We suggested the grouping of areas, so as to make the scheme economical, and that a forestry supervisor would supervise the grouping.  The area might cover ten or 15 miles.  Such a scheme as that would fit in with conditions that are peculiar to the areas that I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the question of afforestation in districts in County Kerry.  We are not at all satisfied that it was ever taken seriously so far as we are concerned.  Take these areas which were recommended and approved.  Nothing has been done about them.  I admit that at one time the local people did not want to dispose of their lands and did not want to co-operate with the forestry division in disposing of certain areas at a certain price, but the price offered, £4 an <Col N="668" /> acre, even for mountain or marsh land, land in a congested district, was not a very good price and was nothing like what should have been offered.  If the Minister directs a review of the whole position, he will find that some of the recommendations which have been there for years were never carried out.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what explanation can be given for that.  The forestry division were anxious, I know, to do everything possible, but they are working within a system which precludes them from doing effective work and doing it quickly.  With the best intentions in the world, they cannot face up to the requirements of the country in afforestation.  The Land Commission, as pointed out by Deputy Commons, who gave a very exhaustive explanation of these matters, cannot, under their unwieldy system, make land available to the forestry division, and, if there is not a clear understanding between the Land Commission and the forestry division, nothing will be done, and we will stand up here in a year's time to make the same type of statements and will have to go back to our people and tell them that nothing has been done for them.</P>

      <P>A good many Deputies have taken part in this debate and I suppose that fact goes to show that they all take a very keen interest in this matter of forestry.  It is only natural, however, that there should be a conflict of opinion as to the best way in which to advance forestry.  Many Deputies have referred to the question of getting co-operation from the farmers.  The last Deputy who spoke referred to it and was surprised when the Minister shook his head and doubted the practicability of his suggestion. One thing I notice in this House is that we are all sometimes very generous when talking about our neighbour's property, but, if we ourselves were the owners of land down the country and an inspector from the Land Commission or the forestry division came down and told us that he wanted our land for a certain purpose and offered £3 or £4 an acre for it, would we be the great co-operators that we expect other people to be?  The fact of the matter is that people who <Col N="669" /> own land are not very willing to give it at the price offered by the forestry division.  One would think from the way people sometimes speak here that there is an inexhaustible pool of land to be acquired.  Deputy Cowan has referred to a possible competition in the matter of the acquisition of land between the Land Commission and the forestry division.  Of course, there is, and there must be, that competition when the amount of land available is limited.  I would say that, if land is to be acquired, the people who live in the congested districts have first claim upon it.</P>
      <P>It is only when these families living in congested parts of the country have been satisfied, when their uneconomic holdings have been made economic and when they have been given a livelihood, even by migration, that we can turn our attention to the grandiose scheme of afforestation referred to by certain Deputies.  That does not mean that I am not as anxious to see afforestation going ahead as any other Deputy.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to statements made by certain political Parties during the general election about the amount of land they would acquire, if they were returned to power, and the amount of afforestation they would be responsible for.  We now find that they are wiser and more chastened people, who admit that their promises were greatly exaggerated and could never be carried out.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to bog land, to what is called cutaway bog, and there appears to be a conflict of opinion as to whether it is possible to grow trees in those areas in which there is this cutaway bog land.

I remember that occasion and I remember that those suggestions were turned down on the grounds that trees would not grow in the place suggested. Surely, this is a matter that could be settled once and for all.  I ask the Minister, when he is replying, to tell us exactly whether commercial timber can or cannot be profitably grown in cutaway bog lands.</P>

      <P>We of the Clann na Poblachta Party have been made the subject of some rather cheap jibes and sneers on the debate on this Estimate for afforestation. Clann na Poblachta as a Party believes in the pursuance of an intensive policy of reafforestation.  We believe that to succeed that policy must be carried out as part of a major economic plan.  We believe that it must form an integral part of such a plan.  I cannot conceive of any real progress being made towards substantial reafforestation unless there is a comprehensive national scheme drawn up and developed on progressive lines.  I believe that the whole subject of afforestation has the goodwill of the present Minister.  I believe that for a very long time it had the goodwill of his predecessor.  I think it is rather a pity that the present Minister's predecessor in the heat of a by-election and in the heat of a general election campaign sought to drag this question down from the high national plane it did occupy to the level of mere political Party propaganda.  I think that in a matter as important as the one we are discussing now it should be possible to approach it, not from the point of view of securing cheap debating points and not from the point of view of showing that somebody said something six months ago, or six years ago, or 16 years ago over which he cannot now stand, but that it should be approached in a helpful and constructive way.</P>

    <P>I believe that this question can be approached in that manner by all Parties in this House.  Perhaps I have not yet got that degree of cynicism which apparently comes after prolonged periods in this House, but I am <Col N="672" /> still sanguine enough to believe that the Minister will get co-operation if he looks for it.  I hope he will look for it. I believe he will get it.</P>
    <P>We approach this question of afforestation, first of all, as a scheme of national importance capable of increasing the wealth of the nation and as a means of putting to work here at home numbers of young men who might otherwise be compelled to seek a living elsewhere.  I have no authority to pose as an expert on afforestation.  I believe that the truth lies somewhere between the uncritical fervour of those who regard it as a panacea for all our economic ills, on the one hand, and the cynical attitude of the man who would suggest that talk about afforestation is so much rainbow chasing on the other hand.  Probably the truth does lie somewhere between those two extremes. In order to assess the position accurately it will be necessary for us to have a more exact idea than we have at the moment of the amount of land in this country suitable for the planting of commercial timber.  I have heard the figure put as high as 3,000,000 acres. I have heard the figure reduced down to 500,000 acres.  The experts of the Minister's Department can enlighten us on this.  I would not like to be taken as endorsing Deputy Keyes' suggestion that a commission be set up. I agree with Deputy Kissane that very often the setting up of a commission is the surest way of putting things on the long finger and impeding progress. But I do think it would be helpful if we could have an authoritative statement as to the area in this country suitable for the planting of commercial timber.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the criticism directed by some members of the farming community against the activities of the Minister's Department as tending to reduce the amount of labour available for the labour pool.  I would appeal to the Minister not to let considerations of that nature weigh with him.  To my mind it may, perhaps, be only in ways like this that the general level of agricultural wages and the general standard of living of agricultural workers can be raised.  If the activities of the Minister's Department tend to do that in any area then, far <Col N="673" /> from finding that a ground of criticism, I would consider it an adequate reason for endorsing such activities.  Comment was made and a statement was attributed to my colleague, Deputy Cowan, to the effect that we were not in a position to put our policy on afforestation into practice.  That is so. We are certainly urging and we intend to continue urging on the Minister and on the inter-Party Government to give the fullest possible effect to that policy and to put as much of our afforestation policy as possible into practice.  We are satisfied, however, that under the present Minister and under the present Government greater progress will be made in afforestation than would be made if their predecessors were in office.  I would appeal to the Minister to urge on the Government that from whatever assistance, whether by way of grant or otherwise, that accrues to us from the Marshall Aid Plan or the European Recovery Programme a portion will be earmarked for an intensive drive for reafforestation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to bring to this question of the planting of commercial timber&mdash;of an intensive drive for afforestation&mdash;all the energy, enthusiasm and vigour that he and his Department can command. By doing that we will ensure that thousands of young Irishmen who would otherwise be compelled to leave the country will be able to find employment at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been wondering where the land is to be procured for this colossal scheme of reafforestation. I do not know what the Minister's view is but on many occasions in this House I have heard that if we continue dividing land at the rate we are dividing it and if we continue giving the same amount to each allottee we will have something like 60,000 or 70,000 uneconomic holders left over.  It would appear to be rather puzzling, therefore, to discover where all this land is to be got for afforestation. I have also heard statements in this House in regard to tree-planting by private individuals.  I think that though tree-planting does not come <Col N="674" /> under this Vote it is, nevertheless, a very excellent idea.  In fact, all the timber we had here during the emergency came under that heading.  What we now term afforestation did not exist in the old days.  These trees were planted by individuals and, fortunately for us, they were there and we got the benefit of them.  The Minister for Lands is going to try to procure something like 500,000 acres for division in the next five years.  In addition, we want to get 1,000,000 acres for reafforestation.  That makes the matter more difficult and more puzzling still.  I fail to see why this House should be asked&mdash;if ever it happened to borrow money from the United States or if it is even necessary to borrow it&mdash;to spend borrowed money on such a scheme as this.  One would imagine from the speeches that have been made in this House that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did not make a reasonable attempt to reafforestate this country.  One would be certain anyway that the Fianna Fáil Government did not make any attempt to do so.  Both those Governments made attempts and they both found the question difficult.  I do not believe that there is any commonsense in making such a plea as to allow any money we may be able to borrow for this purpose.  It is simply saving the face of a very wild-cat scheme.  I am sure the Minister knows perfectly well that, even if the price of land were to fall, he will not be able to do much better than we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country it is really a question of the price and the value of land. If people can feed sheep on land, produce a certain amount of food on land, and so forth, I am quite certain that it is going to give a far better return than the planting of trees and waiting 30 years for their maturity.  That is generally the period required to bring soft timber, for pulping purposes, to maturity.  The other types of timber will take a longer period&mdash;40, 50, 60 and even 70 years.  I think we are not going to increase the speed&mdash;and it would not be sensible to ask any Government in this country to do so&mdash; at which we are working at the present time.  It stands to reason that, if we are going to have increased reafforestation <Col N="675" /> and if we spend money on it, there must be a greater degree of prosperity in the country.  If that is the case there will be more people, more land wanted, and more food wanted.  It is quite true, if we were to get back to the conditions which existed when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was in office&mdash;when we imported everything and did not want any food produced at all; when we simply produced cattle, sheep and a few pigs and fowl&mdash;that the price of land would then fall to a very low level, and that the landholders would offer the land for £3, £4 or £5 an acre.  However, that is not going to happen again.  The prosperity is there and land will get its price. Food is a much more valuable commodity than timber and I think the farmers will stick to the land.</P>

      <P>One thing that struck me about this discussion this afternoon is the complete unanimity that seems to exist on all sides of the House on the point that this problem should be tackled forthwith.  Afforestation to me, at any rate, is one of our major problems and one which has been too long delayed.  I must certainly say, as an admirer of nature, that nothing leaves a more pleasant impression on my mind than, when travelling through the country, to see thickly-wooded areas.  I trust that the Minister will give serious consideration to the various viewpoints that have been expressed in this House on this problem over the past two or three days.  I consider that the growing of timber enhances the appearance of the countryside to a considerable extent and that it will be, in addition, a great source of revenue to this country in the years to come&mdash;let us say 30 or 40 or 50 years.  Well, now is the time to look ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that in many parts of the country, particularly in my own locality, where woods were cut during the 1914-18 war, never yet has there been an attempt made to replant them. I know that along by the valley of the Blackwater up as far as Cappoquin and on to Lismore there were many woods cut in those days.  They were a great source of revenue to the people who <Col N="676" /> owned them.  Nothing has been done in the interim period to replant those, if I may say so, waste places.  I think that is a pity and I hope the Minister will use his best endeavours to put those areas into use again.  All over the country there is a considerable amount of waste land which is only suitable for growing timber.  It is not rich enough for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that you want good land to grow good timber.  As regards timber such as red pine and other high-class timbers, I do not think there is any chance of growing them in this country, but timbers such as we have seen for the past 25 or 30 years we should certainly be able to produce. It is a pity that land not capable of producing anything else but timber should be allowed to remain unused.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will tackle this problem, which has been discussed from many angles.  I would like to see farmers with waste patches of land encouraged to plant trees and those should be given to them free. This matter has been discussed at great length and there is not really much that any one of us can say after 20 or 30 speakers have addressed the House.  The Minister, as we look down upon him where he sits below us, is a big man in every respect.  I feel that he will tackle this problem in a big way. As was said by Deputy Keyes during his very admirable contribution to the debate, it is time for us to stop talking where afforestation is concerned and get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to detain the House unduly on this Vote. It has been so well discussed from all parts of the House, there is really nothing new that one can say on the subject.  The Minister will perceive that he has got the signal from all sections of the House to go ahead with afforestation and in any steps he may take to speed it up he will have the co-operation and blessing of all Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I intervene in the debate is to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that we have in County Donegal thousands of acres of mountain, moorland and cut-out bogs which, in the opinion of many people interested <Col N="677" /> in forestry and with a sound knowledge of afforestation, are ideally suited for the planting of trees.  There are thousands of acres of that type of land in the congested areas.  The Minister is no doubt aware that since the cessation of our main industry in the congested areas&mdash;the turf industry&mdash;the ranks of the unemployed have been considerably swollen.  For weeks past we have had an enormous trek of young men and women who cannot obtain work at home and who are heading for the potato fields of Scotland and the grimy cities and towns of Great Britain in which to eke out a hard existence.  The important work of planting trees would, in our opinion, in the congested areas absorb a good proportion of our unemployed.  The important thing is to give them work within easy distance of their homes. It would also enrich our barren hillsides and eventually would be a source of wealth to the country.</P>
    <P>We have been told by some speakers that it would be only a waste of time to try out the planting of trees in the areas I have mentioned.  I would point out that in the congested areas at one time we had dense forests and plenty of trees.  It is our opinion that it would be better if the Department moved itself sufficiently to go on with this work and carried out experiments, instead of moralising and theorising here as to whether trees would grow or not.  If we proceeded on the assumption that they would grow we could give more work to the unemployed, put them working beside their own doors, and in the course of time this would be a great source of wealth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously what I have said.  A start could be made in the congested areas in all counties.  If the Minister proceeds with that work he will have the help and blessing of all Parties. Even if he does make mistakes in the beginning, we will forgive him; he will have every co-operation if he goes ahead with this important work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time in this House I have been listening to suggestions as to the best approach to the forestry position.  My idea as far as native timber is concerned is that you <Col N="678" /> may relate it only as a means of obviating floods, establishing shelterbelts for arable land, and to be used in its immature state as timber for propping or such other purpose as it might be useful for.  To consider it from a commercial point of view, I believe trees replanted would never be used to any advantage for such things as the building of houses or for other buildings that may be required.  We may not be looking far enough ahead as regards the progress of those buildings.  I would be very much in favour of replanting land where the timber has been cut and that is available at the moment.  Some people may be genuine regarding the Fianna Fáil acreage, but that is no reason why they should be critical regarding the genuine opinions of other Parties.  Many are of the opinion that by replanting this country we will give a fillip to the recruitment of labour and give the labourer better wages than he is getting at the moment from the forestry section.</P>
      <P>It is very fine to talk about inanimate bodies, civic beauty and commercial value, but after all the hewer of wood is not to be relegated to any secondary position whilst we are trying to improve the other amenities of our land.  A hewer of wood is drawing a meagre wage of £2 15s. a week and there are certain disadvantages and anomalies attached to his labour and very little reliefs.  He is working in an area of solitude and under adverse conditions.  People who profess to be solicitous&mdash;I hope it is not synthetic solicitude&mdash;should have mentioned more frequently in this debate that the conditions of life and of work of those labourers should be improved.  If in our wisdom we carry on the schemes mentioned here, we should give priority in our thoughts to the people who will be doing the work and see that they are paid a fair day's wages for a very fair day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an area from Ballydesmond in County Cork to Youghal which was mentioned, I think, in <i>The Rape of Ireland.</i>  Last year, some people voiced their opinion that the floods are doing very serious damage to towns in the valley of the Blackwater and that if the land were replanted it would <Col N="679" /> obviate the floods and prevent the damage.  If we have the land, why should we not do it?  What is all the talk about acquisition?  This land belongs to us, apparently.  We have men working on it.  Why not speed up the work, increase the momentum, as was suggested to the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>There is also a great scarcity of skilled forestry technicans.  It is surprising that people never suggested that there should be a forestry college, just as there is an agricultural college. This industry may be of a secondary consideration to agriculture, but it should have been contemplated long ago&mdash;and should have been implemented by now&mdash;that a forestry college be set up where we could train our own young Irishmen.  They could get their degrees and could be sent out and from them would radiate a certain system that would speed the replanting of this country.</P>
    <P>If there is any arable land, I tell the Minister to steer clear of it.  What we want is &ldquo;Ireland for the Irish and the land for the people,&rdquo; a great slogan of long ago.  We cannot allow the land for the people to grow inanimate bodies, no matter what the commercial value of the timber may be.  Let us plant firmly on the soil of the country the people of the country, and after that we can take what has not been utilised and use it for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to realise the hardships under which forestry workers are carrying on and I hope that, in the very near future, they will get a substantial increase and that that increase will be given also to those who are in charge, those with 15 or 20 years' experience, who are highly qualified men and who are in charge of reafforestation and have a very responsible job on their shoulders.  I hope the Minister will give us the satisfaction that we expect from him within 12 months and that the policy he has spoken of in this House will be put into operation, so that when we come back again to this Estimate we will be able to look on the position with pride and judge by results.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is directed towards the creation of national wealth.  On this occasion, we are not being asked to spend money on a project from which we cannot reasonably expect a tenfold return. On that note, I desire to direct a few words in favour of the moneys asked for by the Minister.  Afforestation is a great task and something very much needed at the present time.  During the 26 years of our native Government, this problem has not been tackled as ably as it might have been.  We find now that, during that period, we could have created a certain amount of wealth and that we could be deriving benefit now from those things that could have been done in the 26 years gone by.  Instead of looking back, we must look forward to see what we can attain.  During the recent emergency, our native timber stocks were lower, I suppose, than ever in our history. However, we have passed through the emergency and the necessity for wood fuel is not as great; but the necessity for timber in the form of building material is greater than we can hope to meet at the present time.</P>
      <P>During the war years many parts of the country were denuded of trees, because we could not import coal.  But we can import coal and now we have an opportunity of building up our forests again.  We have in this country State lands which are neither bogs nor forests nor producing food and where it is found that they can be utilised to the best advantage by planting trees and I would ask the Minister to act immediately and carry out whatever steps are necessary to make the land suitable for the planting of trees there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were lucky enough to have timber at the present time, our housing would not be curtailed and we would not have to look to the future having regard to the available supplies of timber that we can obtain from other countries.  The timber from these trees would be capable of supplying Electricity Supply Board standards, railroad sleepers, furniture, telegraph poles and fencing posts, but we find that our supplies of timber are not <Col N="681" /> capable of making these things available, with the result that many of our national projects are held up by lack of timber supplies.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the House that we are importing timber from Scandinavia, Russia, Latvia and several other places which are not trading with us.  We are purchasing that timber from these countries by drawing on our national wealth, but we are not exporting anything to these countries, and the balance, as far as I can see, is very one-sided.  Before we can plant forests, we must have nursery stocks and suitable land on which we can plant those young saplings. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to have the available land surveyed and examined so that he could be sure that if he puts these young trees into that land the planting will not be a failure.  There are types of soil which are not suitable for the planting of trees, but we have in this country bare mountain slopes which cannot feed live stock or produce crops but which could very well be used to grow certain classes of trees.  There are trees which need more moisture than others but the Department could choose the suitable type of tree.  A longer period of maturing is needed for hardwood trees than for softwood trees, and therefore, in taking the long view, it would seem desirable that the Department should plant a certain proportion of softwood timber and a certain proportion of hardwood timber.</P>
    <P>Trees in any country are responsible to a small degree for the climate obtaining in that country and in winter time if we had a great number of trees we could be sure that the climate would be more moderate and that the degree of cold would not be so great. On the other hand, during the summer period, they create a certain amount of humidity besides reducing a great proportion of the oxygen in districts where they exist.  They also encourage vegetation in those districts by reason of the humidity that exists in their vicinity.</P>
    <P>Farmers have been required in recent years to plant trees in place of those for which they got permits to fell.  They have been required in some instances to plant as many as three trees in place <Col N="682" /> of each one they felled.  In the case of farmers who felled perhaps 1,000 trees and who were required to plant 3,000 in place of them, a certain hardship would be caused, because the area required for planting 3,000 trees would encroach upon the arable land on their farms.  In that case I would ask the Minister to have the farms concerned surveyed by experts in forestry so as to ensure that farmers would not be required to plant trees on arable land because of the necessity for them to plant three trees in place of every tree which they felled.</P>
    <P>The afforestation grants of £10 per acre of which farmers can avail are not attractive to individuals if they can at all produce food or feed animals on the land concerned.  As well as that, an individual is not able to do without money for as long a period as the State.  No doubt the planting of trees, even for a farmer, is an investment, but he will never reap the reward.  In the case of hardwood trees it takes anything from 50 to 100 years before its produce can be obtained.  Softwood trees, no doubt, will produce commercial timber at an earlier period.  In that case it seems that the State must take the initiative in planting trees for timber, because they can afford to do without the money for a longer time.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will see his way to have the matter of forestry as carried on in Scandinavia thoroughly examined with a view to bringing methods to this country which will produce the greatest possible resources. In Sweden timber exports represent something like 17 per cent. of the national income and this shows the value of this produce in any country and it encourages us here in the belief that afforestation should be pursued more actively than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>Self-sufficiency in Ireland is not impossible as far as the production of timber is concerned.  It is calculated that the timber from some 10,000 acres per annum would supply all the needs of this country including commercial timber and firewood timber.  Pre-war we imported something like 60,000 Electricity Supply Board or telegraph standards per annum and it is only <Col N="683" /> right to believe and to expect that in the years ahead we will not be required to import this class of timber when it could be supplied from our own native forests.  Money has been poured out in unemployment benefits during the past 15 or 20 years when it could very well have been invested in the work of afforestation.  We could have financed large schemes in that period.  I know that we were handicapped during the emergency and that we were unable to import certain classes of suitable seed. The rate of planting, however, up to the present has proved to be too slow and I am glad to know from the Minister's speech that this process will be doubled, if it is possible, during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The possibility that plastics would replace timber has been suggested in the past, but I believe that there is no possibility that that can occur.  I believe that timber in Ireland, as elsewhere, will always serve a useful purpose and that it cannot effectively be replaced by plastics.</P>
    <P>There is a large acreage here in Ireland which produces neither food nor timber and it is only right to expect that the State will take steps to ensure what these areas of land which are capable of producing good-class timber should be utilised.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is a pool of 30,000 acres available for development. I understand from what he stated that the soil concerned has been examined and found suitable for the growing of trees.  I also assume from his statement that this area has been drained and made ready for planting. Next winter's programme is to be something in the region of 4,000 acres. That is coming near the original aim of 10,000 acres per annum, which would ensure that at the end of 50 years we would have 500,000 acres under forests. No doubt there are 500,000 acres of land in this country capable of producing good commercial timber.  The Minister has around him an able technical staff and it remains for us in this House to assist him in every possible way and to ask in what way we can offer our help in the development of this project.</P>
    <P>I know that we must take a long-term <Col N="684" /> view.  After seeds are planted, it takes them three years before the saplings are capable of being transplanted. The Minister has stated that during the past year over 7,300 acres of land were purchased for the growing of timber and it is reassuring to know that he is having other areas surveyed with a view to acquisition.  There are holdings purchased by the Land Commission which are not altogether suitable for the allotment of arable land, and in such cases I am glad to know that the forestry section is prepared to acquire that land from the Land Commission in order that trees may be planted on it.  In the course of the debate it was stated that 300 acres in any one place should be made available in order that development of the area could be effected at the least possible expense.  I know, however, that there are smaller areas and patches on farms which could be developed effectively for the benefit of farmers, although as a State project they could not be regarded as practicable.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister mentioned that, as a result of forestry development in the past, the State has been enabled to establish three sawmills, one at Dundrum, County Tipperary, another at Cong, and another at Avondale which I believe is working in some form at present.  No doubt these sawmills, besides treating timber in the way required, give considerable employment. The object of forestry is to create employment in addition to making this valuable commodity available. There is a steady demand for rough boards at the Dundrum and Cong sawmills.  In addition to boards, they are producing spokes and felloes and other things which are used in the making of farm equipment.  It is proposed also to establish a timber drying kiln at Dundrum.  I understand that this is the first of its kind to be established in Ireland.  With the extension of forestry, however, it will become necessary to establish more kiln drying plants throughout the country and the treatment of timber at these plants will make it equal in quality to imported timber, about which people boast at present when comparing it <Col N="685" /> with our native product.  As I say, our native timber will be equal in quality to imported timber when the method of handling is improved.  I am with the Minister in his efforts to create national wealth by means of afforestation.  Although the creation of this wealth will not show results in our time, we have a duty to the nation and I believe we are fulfilling that duty by pursuing this matter of afforestation effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a number of questions in regard to afforestation.  First of all, as I understand it, some ten years ago experiments were conducted in the western areas where the amount of wind and rain is very high and where the soil is shallow and it was found impossible to plant in those areas, irrespective of whether the land was available or not and farmers would have to give up their grazing rights.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied, in the light of any experiments which have taken place in other countries since that date, that this general statement still holds&mdash;that there are very large areas where wind velocity, great rainfall and soil depth make it permanently impossible to carry out the planting of commercial timber.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask him whether he now considers that it might be advisable in certain of these areas to plant non-commercial timber either for scenic or protective purposes, particularly in areas such as parts of Galway where he will be informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance it is hard to find road work for men undertaking minor employment schemes in the winter.  There are areas where there is no great turbary and where, as any visitor will find, most of the roads have been put into excellent repair, even the smallest boreens.  I should like to ask whether he still considers, under present conditions, that it would not pay to plant non-commercial timber in such areas both as a method of giving employment and as having some value to the country from the standpoint of preventing erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he can give some more facts to the <Col N="686" /> House in regard to the areas which can be regarded as dead for afforestation purposes.  Could he give us an approximate figure of the number of acres of land suitable for planting which are unlikely to be taken for planting if the Minister and the Government consider that sheep grazing should continue there or, alternatively, that it is not possible from the standpoint of public opinion in the locality compulsorily to acquire land for afforestation?  What is the total area of land potentially available for afforestation which is, so to speak, dead from that standpoint?  I should also like to ask what is the total area of non-arable land which is unsuitable for planting under any circumstances.  I ask these questions because during the election we heard the most fantastic nonsense about this matter from people who obviously never bothered to read any of the debates upon it or to learn the facts in regard to the total area available.</P>
    <P>Next, I should like to ask the Minister whether, under normal conditions, he considers that publicity in regard to shelter belts is adequate to the purpose it is supposed to serve.  Any person who visits the extreme West and who goes to areas in Clare and Galway, where the wind velocity is high and practically continuous, will note the number of small farmhouses completely denuded of shelter of any kind although such grants are available. Such visitor will notice that perhaps one farm in 50 will have a shelter belt and will immediately note how much more pleasant domestic conditions are in that farm.</P>
    <P>If one makes inquiries one ascertains there is no particular reason why the people in the other farmhouses have not secured shelter-belt grants.  It either has not occurred to them or perhaps they thought there would be difficulties or that the trees would not stand up to the wind.  I notice that particularly to be the case in County Clare in the peninsula that ends in Loop Head.  There were only a handful of houses there where there was any protective belt and the people there disagreed among themselves as to whether any known type of small bush or tree would stand up to the <Col N="687" /> wind, and yet you would see certain houses where the bushes, apparently, had been able to resist the wind and where the people had far more comfort than in other houses.</P>
    <P>During the war the materials necessary for shelter belts were not available and the Minister knows as well as I do that very frequently publicity has to be used to get people to take up Government grants, particularly where it involves technical knowledge, the help of an inspector, knowledge of trees.  I would like to ask him whether he thinks the time is now opportune for advertising the shelter-belt scheme on a more extensive basis.</P>
    <P>I would like further to ask the Minister a question, not in criticism but simply by way of information.  I have been informed that if someone, in addition to taking the kind of training available in the forestry schools of the Department, takes a diploma or degree in forestry in the National University &mdash;I forget whether it is called a diploma or a degree&mdash;he secures no advantage in the matter of employment or status or pay should he apply for a position with the Department of Forestry and that, from that standpoint, the only advantage in taking such degrees is in the knowledge he will acquire that may result in more rapid promotion but that he receives no automatic advantage even if he takes the whole of such practical courses as are available after being through the National University.  Two cases occurred during the lifetime of the last Government and were brought to my notice.  In each case I was not entirely satisfied with the reply.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he could give us some information on those lines because it would seem to me to be entirely wrong for a degree or diploma to be available which merely encourages the emigration of the person concerned.  I quite realise that there may be certain administrative difficulties in giving such advantages and I would like to know if they exist.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Department has recently considered the advisability of planting wind breaks in areas where <Col N="688" /> there are practically no trees whatever. Wind breaks of comparatively narrow width planted between two walls would do much to improve production of crops and to save crops from the effects of continuous wind.  I realise that there are great difficulties there because permission would have to be secured for a small amount of land bordering on a great many farms, but I have knowledge that where individual farmers have planted such wind breaks it has been to their great advantage, but that there are great stretches of the country where there is a complete absence of any kind of protection from wind, where trees have been cut or there are simply very low bushes.  I would ask the Minister whether he has ever considered that as a desirable policy.</P>

      <P>Cé go bhfuilim cinnte go bhfuil an tAire tuirsech den diospoireacht seo anois, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá.  I think it is notorious that State Departments are not as efficient with regard to business methods as private individuals are and it occurred to me during the course of this debate&mdash;it was in fact conveyed to me by the several speeches which I heard&mdash;that there must be gross inefficiency in the section dealing with forestry in this country.  Take, for instance, the contribution to the debate made by Deputy Ben Maguire. It is not necessary for me to repeat the stories which he told.  Those of us who are sufficiently interested can read the report.  Both stories will show an extraordinary degree of difference of opinion among the people in the forestry section who are supposed to work as a unit and to follow a definite policy.  I assume that the Minister regards this House, under the Constitution, as the supreme authority in this country and that he is satisfied to take his direction from this House.  In his appearance on this Estimate for the first time as Minister, he has got a very clear direction as to what Dáil Éireann wants in the matter of afforestation. People have expressed criticisms, and helpful criticisms.  Just a few speakers made some silly contributions.  The great majority of the speakers, however, have made it clear that they are <Col N="689" /> keen on afforestation to the maximum degree.  It is merely on the question of the degree that they differ.  I feel that if I were shouldered with the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, I would take my cue from the trend of the debate in the House and I would say to the forestry section: &ldquo;Go ahead and plant the trees.  That is your business.  The Dáil obviously wants that and the country wants it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before I leave the point I am making as to inefficiency, I am convinced of it, I am sorry to say.  I feel it is clearly established from the book to which reference has been made already, <i>The Rape of Ireland.</i>  I was once present at a meeting of Muintir na Tíre at which the author of that book showed very clearly that there was inefficiency in the Minister's Department.  Deputy Childers mentioned a matter which is of very considerable interest and that is the amount of importance placed upon the degrees in forestry which are conferred in the National University. I have in mind the case of a man who was trained at State expense, who now holds degrees which no other person in the country has, and yet he has been unable to find employment in the Forestry Department.  I intend to bring this matter to the Minister's attention.  I would not have referred to it but for the fact that Deputy Childers referred to it, because I thought it would not be quite appropriate to do so.  I want to give the Minister warning that I intend to pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question as to the actual amount of land which is available for forestry, the experts, apparently, in the Department contradict each other. One of the first things which, I think, the Minister ought to direct is the initiation of an intensive propaganda campaign so as to create a public opinion about forestry and to make the people tree-minded.  The Minister will get information from every member of the House as to the amount of land which appears to be suitable for forestry in his constituency, and he will also get co-operation if he takes steps to create a public opinion on the question.  I was in part of the Gaeltacht in the County <Col N="690" /> Kerry last summer.  The area was very treeless indeed.  I discussed the lack of trees with several farmers in the locality.  They appeared to know nothing about the schemes which the Department has for making trees available to farmers at a very low cost, and they knew nothing about State schemes for the planting of trees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the desirability of encouraging farmers to plant trees on even small patches of land.  Deputy Moylan very caustically told him that that was not forestry. A short time afterwards, when Deputy Davern advocated the same thing, the Minister told him as caustically that, in his opinion, that was not forestry. These two Deputies were speaking with the best intentions and whether what they were advocating is forestry or not in the technical sense, it would, at any rate, if adopted, mean a multiplication of the number of trees in the country.  That is the desirable end at which we should aim.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that concentration on the production of commercial timber alone is of paramount importance. Even if you have only what we regard as non-commercial timber, you will have more trees and you will be going some part of the way to make our people tree-minded.  I am glad to be able to say that in my constituency in South Tipperary we have a very fine sawmills there under the forestry division.  A considerable amount of planting has been done in that area, but yet there are big tracts of land around that locality which are treeless. The Minister would have very little difficulty indeed in getting full information, as to the amount of land which is there available and which is valueless to the people who own it, by a simple inquiry from those in charge of the sawmills and from the forestry officials in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all that the question of pounds, shillings and pence, and a quick return, should be the sole factor in directing our policy with regard to afforestation.  From the social point of view, afforestation on a large scale would have a very beneficial effect on the country.  Apart altogether from the effect from the economic or <Col N="691" /> financial point of view, afforestation has very wide ramifications on climatic conditions and so on with, of course, a multitude of by-products from timber. I understand from what I read in newspapers and periodicals that there is hardly anything now which one cannot make from wood pulp.  I am satisfied, of course, that the progress cannot be as fast as we would like it to be, but I believe that if those in that section of the Department which deals with forestry are made aware that the Minister means business, there will be a considerable speeding up in the afforestation programme by the time he comes before the House next year with his Estimate</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of forestry, I would like to see a strong national campaign started for the growing of commercial timber and of timber for other purposes.  We have heard Deputies speak of the possibility of planting 1,000,000 acres of land. There are trained experts in the Department to give advice on the possibility of growing timber under certain climatic conditions and on land which is definitely useless for any other purpose.  Then we have the other point of view: why not grow it on agricultural land?  Any Minister who attempts to grow timber on agricultural land will have the people of the particular area up against him, because these people want the land for the production of food, and, if he goes into a district where a number of people have the right to graze, for instance, a particular mountain, he must consult them and it is all a rather slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we should adopt the policy adopted in other countries where farmers are encouraged to grow two, three and four trees for every tree cut.  During the recent emergency, large numbers of trees were cut down &mdash;this was particularly the case in my constituency&mdash;and the people were delighted to get them for fuel at the time. I was possibly one of the biggest culprits in that matter, but it was necessary to have firing.  Small and large farmers do not go in for the growing of timber, with the exception of hedgerows, and I suggest that there should <Col N="692" /> be more encouragement to the farmer to grow timber and more co-operation between the Forestry Department and the county committees of agriculture for the encouragement of the planting of shelter belts.  The Minister may say that these will not be of much use to him, but I feel that these shelter belts would not alone be an asset to the farmer but to the country, because, if an emergency arises, the timber can be used.  Anybody who has land suitable for growing timber should be encouraged to grow timber.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the various methods which should be adopted and I urge the Minister to see to it that the people on whose lands large areas of timber were cut down during the past few years will replant. There are a number of examples of that in my own area.  The timber was cut and sold, but I see no replanting done there yet.  I know that there were many difficulties with regard to supplies of rabbit netting and such equipment, but I suggest that the Minister, in the national interest, should see that this work is carried out.  I have been down through Wicklow and other areas where there are plantations and I know that the Forestry Department are doing fine work.  Now that the turf scheme has been shelved, I suggest that the Land Commission should carry out experiments in certain areas, and in South County Dublin especially, on the bogland used by the Dublin County Council for turf production, and see if these areas are suitable for growing timber.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pay of forestry workers, I hold that these men have to do very heavy work and the men who work at timber continually&mdash;I am not referring to the man who plants&mdash;the man who cuts trees down and attends at the saw-mill is doing a specialised job.  These men should get a reasonable wage.  The Minister will possibly say that it is not his bailiwick, but the fact remains that they have to do very skilled work and they should be compensated in a proper way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot about the great industry of the Forestry Department in the beautifying of the country.  I have met the workers <Col N="693" /> on the scheme of planting which is being carried out outside Enniscorthy and anything at all will satisfy these men, instead of the conditions under which they had to work under a Fianna Fáil Government for the past 16 years. These men ought to be treated as industrial workers and should receive more than the agricultural rate of wages, and, if the Minister wants to have contented workmen, if he wants to see forestry work going ahead, he should give these men 60/- a week and see to it that their half-day will commence at 12 o'clock on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Deputies have spoken about shelter belts.  Who wants shelter more than the workers on the hills of Wicklow, Wexford and other counties, who have to travel miles on bicycles and who get no allowance?  These men do not benefit by the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  People employed at other work must be insured in respect of unemployment and national health insurance, but here we have State workers who are not getting a living wage and who are not getting the benefits enjoyed by workers in other employment.  These men have to work under hard conditions, with no shelter, and it is a matter which the Minister should look into.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to talk about scenery and about the lovely trees we will have in 50 years' time, but the people who are reaping the benefits to-day of earlier plantations in this country are not our own people.  I know of one millionaire who came over here and bought a mansion and demesne.  He got permission to cut down all the trees and to-day those trees are lining the village park cut up in firewood.  If they are the people for whom we are going to plant in this generation I think it would be better to cut out afforestation altogether and divert the money which might have been spent on it into some more useful and beneficial industry for our own people.  The men who are engaged in this afforestation should get a living wage.  There should be a decent wage for forestry workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke about turf. That, of course, is a different industry altogether.  The men engaged on turf <Col N="694" /> made good wages, particularly those who were engaged on piece-work. Since I came into this House in 1943 there has been a lot of talk on afforestation. If, for every word that was spoken in this House on that particular subject, a tree had been planted we would now be in the happy position of looking for some new scheme because we would have more than enough reafforestation done.  Talk is no good to those people who are looking for employment.  If there is delay in this matter it is up to the Minister to speed things up.  He is responsible.  Everybody looks to him to see that the work is done and to see that his officials do their part.  If that is not done, then our talk is in vain.  County council men are supplied with oilskins.  Corporation workers are supplied with boots.  Here we want to put men on the important work of reafforestation at agricultural rates of wages.  If we cannot do better than turn our people into salves upon the hillside there is very little use in beautifying our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a vast amount of advice from both sides of the House.  Some of that advice was to go ahead and plant as large an acreage as possible with timber.  Some of it was of a gloomy and pessimistic nature.  When we sift the wheat from the chaff I am afraid that we shall find there was a good deal of chaff and very little wheat.  A good deal of play was made by the Opposition upon the Clann na Poblachta programme during the last general election.  It is alleged that Clann na Poblachta had a programme which aimed at 1,000,000 acres under trees in five years.  Clann na Poblachta have not retracted one word of that.  I listened carefully to their speeches.  Perhaps, for the sake of argument, their programme was exaggerated but we must admit that it was put forward in the best of faith.  Something has got to be done about afforestation. New Parties like Clann na Poblachta are definitely required from time to time in this House.  They have a definite function to fulfil.  They are sent in here by the people of the country with a definite end in view. Their aim is to get things going and to <Col N="695" /> ginger up some of those people who have got into very rusty grooves through having enjoyed too much confidence from the people in the years gone by.  Perhaps we, in Clann na Talmhan, said the same things.  I do not want to go into that now.  But I think in the years gone by other Parties put forward just as ambitious programmes and much more extravagant aims than those of which the Clann na Poblachta Party are guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Clann na Talmhan Party was first formed they had ambitious aims.  Newcomers into the field, who have neither the technical knowledge nor experience at their disposal, always think that things can be accomplished in a very short time.  In my opinion that is one of the advantages of democracy.  It is said democracy has its faults but that is one of its good points.  New Deputies come in here.  They may make exaggerated statements in the House but they make them in the best of faith.  Time and knowledge of the working of Government Departments temper their statements as the years go by.  That is not to their discredit.  I have not the slightest doubt that if I were to go back on my speeches of four or five years ago I am sure I said things then that, under the microscope to-day, I should not care to try to live up to and I am sure much more extravagant statements were made in the past than those of which the Clann na Poblachta Party has been guilty.  It is a bad thing to attack a new Party or a new Deputy. It is a bad thing to jump on a new Deputy's neck the moment he makes some statement that appears exaggerated to some of us of the older school.  If we are to get the best out of this House and out of the new blood transfused into it we must give our new Deputies the benefit of our experience. The people sent those Deputies here with a specific object.  It is up to us to give them a patient hearing and not to jeer when they make even exaggerated statements in all sincerity.  I propose to give those Deputies and this House the <Col N="696" /> benefit of my experience here and now. There is no perfect human being and I hope that in time we shall get away from that system of attack.  We all make mistakes.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have suggested to me that we should plant an enormous acreage with trees.  It is my duty to tell them exactly where the truth lies. It is my duty to tell them exactly why we cannot plant an enormous acreage. It is my duty to tell them why it would be unwise to do that.  Many Deputies on both sides of the House say that the delay in reafforestation is due to lack of money and that that dreadful man, the Minister for Finance, will not open his purse wide enough.  Some Deputies say it is due to shortage of land. Deputy O'Reilly, and some other Fianna Fáil Deputies, did not seem to like the idea of afforestation at all.</P>
      <P>I think the 10,000-acre programme aimed at by the Fianna Fáil Party is much too small.  I am saying that in the full knowledge of my experience as Minister for Lands in charge of the forestry branch.  We are not short of suitable land for planting.  We are not short of money.  The present inter-Party Government and the Minister for Finance are keenly anxious to go ahead with afforestation and to have as large an acreage under timber as is economically possible without disturbing land owners and agricultural production which a too rapid expansion in afforestation might entail.  We must learn by the experience of other countries.  A short time ago in New Zealand some private individuals put something like 500,000 acres under timber.  In ten or 12 years when that timber fell due for thinning the available labour was not there without seriously upsetting agricultural production. The result is that these forests have grown into attenuated ghosts because they could not be attended to at the right time.  We must take things as we find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not do to rush madly into forestry.  We must fix on an acreage which will not overtax the resources of the country, which will not affect the small landholders and which will not cause labour to rush away from the production of food into the production <Col N="697" /> of timber.  It would be all very well if we had rushed into timber and tree-planting on a tremendous scale.  We might then very easily have the situation arising in which we would have plenty of timber but no food to eat in the evening.  That would not do.</P>
    <P>Seed is the great difficulty with us at the present time.  When I examined things I found that we have now on hands something in the region of 34,000 acres of plantable land.  I found also that the Minister for Finance was not anxious to close down on me as far as cash was concerned.  However, neither finance nor suitable plantable land is the difficulty&mdash;it is seed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to this, protection for the forests was scarce.  We have plenty of it at the present time.  If we want to aim, say, at a programme of 25,000 acres per year we will want at least 700 acres of very good arable land under nurseries in order to provide the necessary tree plants. Roughly, about 1,700 plants per acre is usual.  That means that even for 1,000 acres you want, in round figures, 1,750,000 plants.  A good deal has been said about how much land is available for planting and how much land is not available.  Some have argued that only arable land will grow first-class commercial timber.  Some have argued against that.  The truth is, of course, that arable land will grow excellent timber but it does not take arable land alone to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of what I would describe as non-agricultural land, which is at the present time being used as a sheep run, will grow excellent timber.  The experience of the experts in the Forestry Department is that we cannot expect too good a return from the first crop.  In other words, we will not by any means attain to the pitch of perfection or get the quality in the timber from the first crop that we will get from the second and succeeding crops. Deputies have asked what areas are plantable.  It is roughly estimated that there are about 7,000,000 acres of waste land in this country&mdash;I have heard that figure given.  I should, however, like to <Col N="698" /> say that no survey has ever been taken, on the accuracy of which we can rely. There are about 1,500,000 acres suitable for planting, but there is a huge acreage that is not suitable for planting and that will never grow anything other than moss or some such other low form of vegetation.  We have, however, 1,500,000 acres of land which is excellent for planting without encroaching on arable land.  I do not propose to put one perch of arable land under timber if I can help it.  Food for the human population should come before timber.  Every perch of arable land should be devoted to food production. Besides, I know that we will have enough non-agricultural land to put under timber.  I do not agree with the gloomy outlook expressed by some Deputies who as much as said: &ldquo;What is all this nonsense about afforestation? What is the need for it?&rdquo;  There is a need for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a single gloomy speech from this side of the House but there were a few from Fianna Fáil&mdash;why, I do not know. After all, if anybody has travelled throughout the country&mdash;throughout the counties Wicklow, Tipperary or Waterford, where we have fairly large areas under forests&mdash;he would realise that, if it was for nothing but the beauty of it alone&mdash;great barren mountainsides have been absolutely transformed and it is very pleasing to the eye even if it is perfectly useless&mdash;the work would be justified.  Apart from that, it is giving employment and the employment up to date is nothing to the employment that will accrue from it when this timber matures and is brought down to the saw-mill.  Some Deputies put the question that we should plant alternate rows of hard wood and soft wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alternate rows. The suggestion was that there should be a proportion of hard woods and a proportion of soft woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of that, Deputy, is that some land is suitable for growing hardwood and will give <Col N="699" /> better results in the long run than if it were under softwood.  Some land will give better results under softwood than others.  From a business point of view we will not be able to intermix them like that.  We have to figure out what ground is suitable for hardwood and what ground is suitable for softwood. In other words, we must plant in order to get the best results.  We are using money which belongs to the people&mdash; taxation.  We are using land obtained from the people and it is up to us to make the very best use of it and to give the best results.  One Deputy in his speech, thoughtfully I must say, mentioned that if we go ahead on a big scale we are bound to make mistakes. He took it upon himself to say that he would absolve us from any mistakes that we might make.  That is a most encouraging note.  If we go all out on a policy of expansion I must say, human nature being what it is, we are bound to make some mistakes.  We will make it our policy not to make any mistakes, but if we do go in for an expansionist programme we definitely will make some mistakes.  It is very nice to have in the records of Dáil Éireann that at least one Deputy in the year 1948 in the Forestry debate was asking some future House to look kindly, at least on the mistakes that I will have made when the debate on Forestry comes up in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan mentioned there was opposition to forestry in Cong.  There was no opposition to forestry in Cong. He is referring to the opposition that Deputy Commons and I put up a few years ago when arable land was being planted.  The small-holders around about Cong demanded that the arable land be given to them as additional land.  I am sure if the ex-Minister had gone down there he would agree that it was not opposition to forestry.  Some people were applying for the land. Deputy Moylan must be well aware that our Party always favoured forestry, but on suitable land without encroaching on the arable acreage of the country.  Time enough when we have all non-agricultural land planted&mdash;we can then consider going into arable <Col N="700" /> land, but that will be many years to come.</P>

The percentage will depend on the nature of the ground, on the particular quality of ground as we come up to plant it.  We will have to rely on our experts who, after all, have some experience in the matter.  We will have to rely on their judgment to decide what ground is suitable for hardwoods and what ground is suitable for softwoods, when they say do not cross them, do not mix them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Deputy Commons, in referring to other European countries, said that there was no erosion here.  It is on the hillsides and it is pretty noticeable.  In other words, the soil of our hills is slipping down with the rains year by year, perhaps slowly, but nevertheless I am told that in some cases the hillsides are being stripped bare of soil that would be quite capable of growing timber to <Col N="701" /> a height of 40 feet or 50 feet in a comparatively small number of years. There is a certain amount of erosion. Perhaps it is not serious but it would be desirable to arrest what is going on. Deputy Cowan spoke on that point.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies asked why we do not take over a great deal of land and get some work done.  Let any Deputy who thinks that exchange places with a small farmer in a mountainous district, a poor district, a farmer who happens to be the possessor of some non-agricultural land, yet land that would be suitable for planting.  How does that man live?  He probably has a cow.  He is fortunate if he has two.  He might have a few dry cattle and some sheep running on the hills.  If we take his commonage we are seriously upsetting the economy of his little holding and we must bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>We must be careful not to upset his economy.  It might be a fine thing to put a huge acreage under timber, but it would be too bad if we reduced to poverty or semi-starvation some of the farmers from whom we are taking commonage on the mountain or their non-agricultural land.  We must make sure we are giving them something equal in return.  Let it be that we migrate them to better land.  If we could reach that stage, it would be very desirable.  We cannot blunder in blindly and foolishly and grab land because we have great forestry ideas at the backs of our heads.  We must be careful to discommode people as little as possible.  We must see that they do not suffer loss.  It is my desire and intention that where we take over land, even where tenants surrender plantable land for forestry purposes, we must give these people first preference in employment on the land.  That is what I intend to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience in Wicklow, Tipperary, Waterford and other places is that it may be hard to get a foothold, to get the necessary land in a district or county to start a forestry scheme. We might find it difficult to get 200, 300 or 400 acres with which to make a start.  Our experience is that once <Col N="702" /> forestry gets a foothold, actually more land is offered to us than we can conveniently take.  I am sure many Deputies will be glad to hear that. Such was our experience in Wicklow. Even in my own native county, where we have only very small areas, notably in Cong, I have been offered land which I hope to be able to acquire and get planted for the purpose of making a start there.</P>
    <P>There are many western counties that have non-agricultural land, which is nevertheless suitable for timber growing, and I intend to go ahead as much as possible in those areas.  My difficulty is to get plants and seeds.  I do not propose to go foreign for the plants.  I propose to have the whole industry centred within the country and I do not propose to go foreign unless as a last resort.  I propose to get enough land to be used as nursery grounds to start off with.  The very earliest that we can hope to take any transplants out of the nurseries and plant them in the forest grounds will be three years.  Seed will be sown next spring and it will be three years before we can do any planting.  That is as soon as any advance can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ben Maguire mentioned some huge area of 1,100 acres in his county and conveyed the impression that there was nothing done about it.  I do not want to whitewash my predecessor, or blackwash him either.  The truth is that that land was examined four times between 1932 and 1938 by four different inspectors and finally by the Director of Forestry.  The ground is not suitable, and that is that.  Any Deputy who tells us to plant a piece of ground may in all sincerity think it is excellent ground to plant.  Do not forget that the officials are handling public money and it is up to them to see that the money is spent to the very best advantage.</P>
    <P>A Deputy comes here with the very best intentions and tells us he does not see why a certain stretch of country is not planted.  The experts go there on his representations and examine the land.  If they know from past experience that that ground is not suitable for planting, they are perfectly justified, and I clap them on the back, for <Col N="703" /> not wasting money in order to please the Deputy.  The experiment might run into many thousands of pounds.  The forestry experts have been accused of slowness and other things.  We will give them a chance from now on.  We will judge them at the end of a number of years and it is time enough to condemn them if we find they are lacking in their duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little mentioned trees in relation to defence of the country.  That has nothing to do with us.  It is a matter for the Department of Defence. If they want to plant trees or protect existing trees for the purposes of defence in case of invasion in years to come, it is their duty to look after that. We will not hinder them.  We will assist them in every possible way.  I think that meets Deputy Little's case.</P>
    <P>There was some mention made of forest fires.  They are our biggest enemy.  Forest fires are deadly.  It has been said it is necessary to get the goodwill of the people when taking over land, that it is absolutely essential that the land will be purchased by agreement between the Forestry Department and the people who surrender it for the purpose of getting goodwill.  I believe we have reached the stage where it would be very hard to find a scoundrel bad minded enough deliberately to drop a match into a forest in the Spring time of the year when the February-March drying is there and when it would be deadly to drop a match.  I believe we have reached the stage when people are more civic minded, have a better sense of citizenship.  I know accounts from counties where forestry is fairly well established show that the people working and earning there, and even those who never earned a penny from our Forestry Department, are most anxious that none of the forest would be destroyed.  They love the forests and care for them just as a man would care for his stock.</P>
    <P>Perhaps once in a while you may get a man who will deliberately burn a piece of forest; that very rarely occurs. Most of the fires are accidental.  Any person outside a lunatic asylum must know that if he deliberately sets fire to a forest he is burning thousands of <Col N="704" /> pounds' worth of property that does not belong to him or to his neighbours and that he is taking away the future living of children perhaps yet unborn who will find employment on that timber when it reaches maturity.  While we must take every precaution, let me say that it would be impossible to establish a fire-fighting station of any kind.  Deputies know what the undergrowth in a forest is like in February, March or April.  It is like tinder.  If you drop a lighted match near it on a breezy night or a windy day you are likely to destroy the whole place. There is nothing to stop it.  It goes as fast as the wind.  It is ridiculous to talk about a fire-fighting system ready to put out all fires.  It is not unknown where the canopy of a forest has taken fire.  The fire develops and it burns out the whole area.  We must be careful, just as each person is careful about a fire in his haggard, and we must encourage a sense of responsibility amongst the people.  When the hay and corn are going into the haggard the farmer is naturally careful and smoking is prevented.  We must adopt some such attitude in regard to our forests.  There is no other way out of it.  A few Fianna Fáil Deputies referred to forestry as a madcap scheme. I wonder what kind of mentality that is, or where they were born or reared.</P>

      <P>I wonder what attitude those people took up when it was a question of planting aerodromes, particularly those that were not needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some talk about shelter belts.  I think it was Deputy Timoney who mentioned that Deputy Moylan and myself crossed swords on that.  I am not opposed to shelter belts and I like them, as a matter of fact, though they are usually of a kind of timber which is not of commercial quality.  I like to see a house protected by a shelter belt.  It is nice and, as Deputy Childers said, such houses generally are cleaner and neater.  Certainly, a shelter belt has a brightening effect and if a person is go-ahead enough to have one and beautify around the house, the house inside is <Col N="705" /> probably as neat and nice as it is outside.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the notice of Deputies that there is a system whereby we come to the assistance of private persons and public bodies anxious to plant their own land.  There are 383,000 farmsteads in this country&mdash;big, middling and small&mdash;and if they each planted one acre next spring it would mean 383,000 acres of forestry.  I am more than anxious that farmers, big, middling and small, would plant whatever acreage of land they can spare.  It would not be easy for us to do it&mdash;we will not do it&mdash;as we could not plant an acre here and a rood there, since that would be dissipating our energy and scattering our foresters.  No one can meet that problem but the farmers themselves.  If the farmers plant ash, beech or oak in any waste, non-agricultural ground, in the years to come that will benefit the future generation. Turf as the fuel in the country is running very scarce in many counties.  To meet that situation and encourage plantation, I am prepared to consider applications for grants in accordance with the following regulations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The minimum width of the plantation must not be less than two chains, except in exceptional circumstances to be approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount of any grant will be £10 per statute acre payable as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>£5 per acre within six months of the proper establishment, to the satisfaction of the Minister, of the plantation, and £5 per acre five years after the first payment.</P>
    <P>Application for a grant must be made on a form obtainable from the Secretary, Department of Lands, Forestry Division, 88 Merrion Square, Dublin, and must be posted to reach the above address not later than the 1st January during the season in which the planting will be completed.  It is desirable that applications should be made as long as possible <i>before</i> 1st January.  Applications received after the 1st January in any one <Col N="706" /> planting season will be treated as if they referred to planting to be carried out during the following planting season.</P>
    <P>Each application must be accompanied by a six-inch ordnance survey map, or a tracing therefrom, showing the boundaries of the area for which the grant is required.</P>
    <P>The area to be planted shall not be less than one statute acre in extent.  Subject to this minimum, no area of less than half an acre will be considered in calculating the amount of ground.</P>
    <P>The trees planted shall consist of an adequate number of one or more species of forest trees as may be approved by the Minister as suitable for timber production in Éire.</P>
    <P>The area planted shall be properly protected, where necessary, against injury from fire, domestic animals, livestock, etc., and shall be adequately fenced and protected, where necessary, against damage by rabbits, hares, vermin, etc.</P>
    <P>The trees shall be planted at not more than five feet apart each way except in special circumstances to be approved by the Minister.  Planting at wider spacing unless specifically approved beforehand may render the area ineligible for a grant.</P>
    <P>Grants will not be payable in respect of any area for which a grant is being paid under any other State scheme or for the planting of which trees are provided at the public expense either free or at reduced rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister reserves the right in all cases to refuse a grant or to withhold the second instalment thereof in the event of the trees planted being unsuitable in respect of species or condition or unlikely to lead to successful results or if the planter has neglected to protect or manage the plantation in a satisfactory manner from the date of planting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> This scheme shall not apply to plantations laid down prior to the 1944-45 planting season.  No application will be entertained unless made within five years of the date of planting.  In any matter of dispute relating to this scheme the decision of the Minister for Lands shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That runs to any number of acres. Ten pound per acre is not a bad grant. Deputy Sheehan suggested that we should give free trees to those who wished to plant their own land.  We will not do so, but will give them money instead, as it is more enticing and we get better results.</P>

      <P>Where farmers would be anxious to plant larch or pine, would the Department give them any assistance by providing the plants at moderate cost?  Could they provide the plants at the average market price, as farmers seem to find difficulty in getting larch and pine in some areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>We have our own nurseries for our own timber.  If we did what the Deputy suggests, we would be entering into competition with private nurseries, and I would not like to do that.  The average person who wishes to plant will get plants at a reasonable price from the nurseries.  The price of three or four year old plants is never unreasonable at the nurseries.  We are giving £10 per acre as a grant&mdash;£5 when planted to the satisfaction of the officials and £5 at a later period.  Then there is no limit to the number of acres that one person may plant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Childers asked if those with university degrees in forestry would get preferential employment in the Department.  We will not give preferential employment to anyone no matter what attainments he has, from a university or elsewhere. He will have to await his turn in the queue and go through the usual Civil Service examination.  Then he can make use of his education and brains, and merit will come to the top in the usual way.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked me what I intend to do.  I do not like to say I am forest mad, but at the very least I will admit that I am very enthusiastic about forestry and I will definitely try to expand it as much as I can economically. What that will mean at the moment I cannot say.  I mean to ask the Land Commission to acquire land. The Land Commission has been accused of not working in harmony with the forestry section.  That is not the case.  All the land that is not suitable as additions, or for holdings under the Land Commission, is handed over to the forestry section without delay.  That is taking place every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are really only belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all, in some places; but any time the forestry section has asked the Land Commission to acquire a big area, where it would be available, the Land Commission has got to work and acquired it.  I am informed that there is no delay and no friction and that there is the greatest harmony and good working.  In getting the forestry section working into full swing, you cannot, even if you had a whole county at your disposal, plant until you have the plants and before you can get the plants you must have the seeds and before you can get the seeds you must have proper nurseries; and in order to have 25,000 acres a year you will need to have 750 acres of nurseries.  These must be got going, and that is no small job in itself.  Once you have a decent acreage of nurseries giving good plants, you can go ahead with the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to discommode land owners <Col N="709" /> as little as possible, as the type of person from whom we would be taking land are the very least that can afford any kind of shuffling or inconvenience in the process.  We must try to make good to them, either by means of an alternative holding, if possible, or by a guarantee or next to a guarantee employment on the forestry schemes while the work is in progress.</P>
    <P>Last but not by any means least, we have a question which was raised by several Deputies, the question of the wages paid to forestry workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if the securing of grants from the Department is conditional upon farmers growing certain species of trees?  Deputy Flynn mentioned a very useful tree to farmers, the larch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. I think that they can plant any of the ordinary hard wood trees or soft wood trees, but I will drop the Deputy a note on the subject because I am not quite conversant with it at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to wages, the inter-Party Government is the friend of the workers and has not the least thought of chiselling them or dealing harshly with them in any shape or form.  The forestry workers have my sympathy and I think that the Labour Deputies and the Clann na Poblachta Deputies know that.  I will do my best for them and I will fight with Finance in order to get them the best possible terms. More than that I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally there is the question of small farmers who have to cut down trees, who got a permit to cut them with a replanting condition on the permit. In the case of farmers who have no non-arable land, I will not ask them to comply with the replanting condition as it would not be fair.  I know several small farmers in my own locality, and in other districts besides County Mayo, who got holdings from the old Congested Districts Board or from the Irish Land Commission in the past.  These holdings were part of estates and occasionally it happened that there was a corner of woodland or timber on them.  They applied for a permit to cut the timber in order to sell it or to use it for firewood and <Col N="710" /> there was a condition for replanting. I know one man who got a small holding from the Land Commission some 13 or 14 years ago.  He took up the roots of the trees by his own labour although he was a man of 60 years of age in order to provide arable land for his holding, and it would be nothing short of tyranny to ask that man to plant over 1,000 trees in place of the 500 or so which he cut down.  Each case will be considered on merit and where the replanting condition is tyrannical or a hardship, I will not prosecute it to the bitter end and I will absolve the person concerned from the condition.  But that is not to apply in all cases.  If I meet a case where a farmer has non-arable or nonagricultural land on which he can fulfil the replanting condition without any hardship, I am afraid that he will have to do it.  I hope that that meets the situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputies on all sides of the House who wished me God speed in my forestry campaign, and I would like to say to those more despondent members who do not see eye to eye with forestry that forestry is a very necessary thing and that as a matter of fact we are starting rather late with forestry.  Without any doubt it would help to improve the climate; it would help to provide very useful employment and would help to provide money. Forestry is here with us and here to stay, if I can see to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question and it demands a fair explanation. The acreage will be as much as we have plants to put in, which is small.  I understand that we are in a position to put down between 7,000 and 8,000 acres, with the plants which we will have next spring, or rather next planting season, at 1,700 plants per acre.  By thinning that down from 1,700 to 1,200 plants to the acre we can increase our <Col N="711" /> acreage but my experts advise me that that course is not advisable as it would leave the forest too thin and it would take a long time for the forest to thicken again.  We will put down as much as we have plants to meet and that is the answer to the question the Deputy put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pin the Minister down.  We have had arguments here&mdash;this is not an election argument&mdash;Clann na Poblachta say 1,000,000 acres, you say 60,000 per year; I have said that I considered the Fianna Fáil idea of 10,000 acres too little; but what does the Minister think?  Could he give us any idea of what he proposes to do?  I do not want to pin him down in any fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor do I want to evade the question but I will say this.  We have just emerged out of a period of emergency and there is the whole question of seeds to be considered. Deputies must know that that is a deciding factor.  Any statement which I make will have absolutely no effect because I cannot tell what the seed position is until this time next year, but this time next year I will know what seeds we have and what steps can be taken for acquiring suitable land and then I can say what the general programme is going to be.  I could say 50,000 acres or I could take the Clann na Poblachta programme and say 200,000 acres, but the Deputy himself must know quite well that any answer to the question now would not be more than the vaguest guess.</P>

      <P>Under the present system I think that you will never get even the very meagre Fianna Fáil estimate for an eventual forest cover of 600,000 acres because the Land Commission or the Forestry Department are looking for land which on a first crop will produce commercial timber.  I think that there is no hope in the world of getting 600,000 acres of land which would produce commercial timber on the first crop and that you would need a more modest proposal to get land which would produce it on the second crop.  You could plant not so good land which would produce a good second crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <P>If we import plants they will not be a success here.  It may seem a strange thing, but if we import plants from Scandinavia, where the climate is much colder than ours, the plants will not be a success when sown here, for this reason, that although their winter is very severe, we have much later frosts here than they have and I am afraid it would be a dangerous experiment.  I understand it has been tried on a small scale in the past but purely as an experiment and it has been a complete failure.  For that reason, until I go into the matter more fully, I would be afraid to expend any large sum of money on foreign plants. We can put down from 10,000 to 12,000 acres, although it will mean a lot of thinning out.  The forests will not canopy after thinning for a long time and it will have a very damaging effect on the timber ultimately.</P>

      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that, with the best will in the world on his part to get forestry going as fast as possible, taking into account all the difficulties with regard to seeds and plants and the fact that the nurseries are inadequate to deal with large-scale afforestation, his aim would be in about three years' time to reach a position when he would get roughly 25,000 acres per year?  I think the Minister mentioned that figure.  I do not want to get a wrong impression and I should like if the Minister would say whether that is roughly what he has in mind.  The Minister did suggest that he would require a certain acreage of nurseries to do a certain amount of plantation.  He also stated that owing to the emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister, in answer to Deputy Moylan, did not say what his hopes were, taking into account all the circumstances such as <Col N="714" /> acquisition of land, the nurseries available and the plants, etc.  He made it quite clear that the House could not expect that any sudden rapid development could take place this year or next year, which the House accepts.  But, from the point of view of policy later, I should like if the Minister would say if I am correct that he said he hoped to do about 25,000 acres per year, as against 10,000 acres which Fianna Fáil envisaged.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £37,970 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for salaries and expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including housing grants and the purchase and sale of homespuns.</P>
      <P>There is required under this Estimate a sum of £127,970.  This amount is less by £3,390 than the aggregate provision last year.  This is due to the fact that the Appropriations-in-Aid estimated to be collected are greater by £65,595 while the estimated expenditure is increased only by £62,205.  If payments out of Appropriations-in-Aid are taken into account it will be seen that a total expenditure of £512,135 is provided for and that gross receipts amounting to £384,165 are hoped for apart from the possible receipt of an extra £30,000 to be accounted for as Exchequer Extra Receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> There is an increase of £932 in the provision under sub-head D (1) due to provision for additional technical staff for the rural industries.  The provision under sub-head D (4) for the travelling expenses of the rural industries staff has been increased by £900 as it is anticipated that visits of inspection will be more frequent than last year.  There is an increase of £2,250 in the provision under sub-head D (5) for machines and plant.  The provision includes over £14,000 in respect of equipment for the spinning mill at Kilcar.  The balance relates mainly to machines for the knitting industry.</P>
    <P>A total provision of £199,500 is made for manufacturing materials under the sub-heads D (6), D (8), D (10) and D (11) as compared with £151,160 provided for last year.  The provision for the year is based on the trading which it is hoped to do during the year in the textile and toy industries.  Of the total increase of approximately £48,000, increased purchases of knitting yarns and materials for the toy industry (including materials for the manufacture of dolls heads) account for £21,000. A further £25,000 is accounted for by increased purchases of wool to be spun in the factory at Kilcar where two spinning units have now been installed. The remaining £2,000 represents provision for increased purchases of homespuns should the state of the market justify such expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is provided under sub-head D (8) £4,040 for the machinery which would be required for the manufacture of dolls heads for the toy industry. There is a decrease of £4,575 in the provision under sub-head D (12) for the leaden model industry established in Connemara early in 1947.  Reserves of manufacturing and packing materials having been built up last year, it is necessary this year to provide only for a normal year's requirements.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of approximately £12,000 in the provision under sub-head E (3) for kelp and seaweeds. This increase represents seaweed and sea-rods which it is hoped to purchase this year in excess of the amount purchased last year.  It is not anticipated that kelp will be purchased, as efforts <Col N="716" /> to find a market have so far failed.  A token provision has however been made in case conditions should alter.  The provision of £620 under sub-head E (4) relates only to the carrageen which the Department puts on the market in packages for food purposes.  It is left to private firms to purchase the ordinary commercial carrageen from the gatherers and to sell it here and overseas.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £650 in the provision under sub-head F (2) as it is proposed to carry out more advertising this year than was deemed necessary hitherto.  There is an increase of £1,220 in the provision under sub-head F (3), General Expenses, due mainly to the increased cost of packing materials and transport.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £15 in the provision under sub-head G, Miscellaneous Services.  All the sub-divisions show token provisions as previously with the exception of sub-division (5) which provides for payment towards certain expense in connection with the transport service between Cape Clear Island and Baltimore, County Cork.</P>
    <P>There is a decrease of £2,000 in the amount being provided under Sub-head H (3) for grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  The amendment of these Acts is under consideration at present with a view to bringing the assistance thereunder into line with the assistance authorised under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  A Supplementary Estimate will have to be introduced to provide for the cost of increased grants consequent on amendment of the Acts.</P>
    <P>Gross receipts of about £375,000 are hoped for from the Rural Industries, an increase of £87,000 on the final amount estimated for last year, while receipts of £37,600 are hoped for from the sale of marine products, being an increase of £13,880 on the final figure for last year.  It is estimated that £104,500 will be paid out in workers' wages in the coming year, being an increase of £20,000 on the amount paid out last year.</P>
    <P>The year just finished has been one of extreme difficulty for the industries carried on by the Department and the amount of the present Estimate is an <Col N="717" /> indication of the uncertainty of present-day markets.  While full provision has been made for possible expenditure the amount estimated for receipts from sales has been put down at a conservative figure so as to avoid, if possible, the necessity of approaching the Dáil for further funds pending improvement in the markets and the collection of credit sale accounts.  It will be realised, therefore, that this Estimate cannot be taken as representing the financial state of the industries.</P>
    <P>Last year our sales of homespuns and knitwear were far below the figures originally estimated for them and through a too optimistic estimate of the rate of progress in the leaden model industry the figures for sales in this case were also far below what was provided for.  The purchase of homespuns was continued for a large portion of the year in the hope that the home and foreign markets for them would improve as time went on.  Such was not the case, however, with the result that the Department has now large stocks which it will be necessary to get moving before purchases can be resumed.  The toy and handwoven tweed industries are the only ones which came up to expectations but, apart from sales of homespuns, the sales of the other industries remained in the aggregate at the level reached in 1946-47.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the coming year will be a better trading one and that it will not be hampered to such an extent as last year by the import restrictions and economic difficulties of countries with which trade was formerly done.  The present Estimate has been framed so as to provide for the purchase of materials on a scale necessary to cater for a revival in trade.  Expenditure will, however, be related as far as possible to trading prospects.</P>

      <P>Chím ó ráiteas an Aire go bhfuil laghdú ar an Meastachán i mbliana i gcóir Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta ach is dócha gur deacair é sin a thógaint air mar bhí an Meastachán ullamh nuair a tháinig sé isteach.  Sé an tsuim ar fad atá i gceist anseo ná £128,000 agus go deimhin, nuair a chuimhneodh duine ar an méid atá le déanamh ar son na Gaeltachta ní mór <Col N="718" /> an méid airgid é sin mar im thuairimse tá deacrachtaí faoi leith ag baint leis an nGaeltacht nach misde iad a réiteach.  Agus rud eile, tá rudaí áirithe lasmuigh den Mheastachán seo a bhaineas leis an nGaeltacht nach bhfuil sé de chead agam cur síos a dhéanamh orthu ar an Meastachán seo gí go bhfuil dlúth-bhaint acu le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Ceann acu is ea an iascaireacht sa Ghaeltacht agus ceann eile ceist na móna sa Ghaeltacht mar dhá thionscal is ea iad sin a bhí anathairbheach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus a bhfuil níos mó ag teacht isteach uathu ná ó aon tionscal eile a cuireadh ar bun sna háiteacha sin.</P>
      <P>Tamall ó shoin, nuair bhí baint agamsa le Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta is minic a bhí comh-fhreagarthas againn idir na ranna Rialtais a raibh baint acu le ceist na Gaeltachta agus do bhíodh cruinnithe againn go minic agus do cuirtí daoine as na ranna eile go dtí na cruinnithe a cuirtí ar bun faoi stiúrú Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta chun a dhéanamh amach cad ba cheart a dhéanamh chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Ní fheadar an ndein-tear a leithéid fós mar is dóigh liom gur ceart é a dhéanamh agus gur maith an chuspóir é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na dtithe sa Ghaeltacht, is maith liom a chloisint ón Aire go bhfuil an scéal sin á chíoradh ag an Roinn faoi láthair ach do réir mar a thuigeas uaidh, is é atá i gceist ná Achtanna na Gaeltachta a chur ar aon dul leis na hAchtanna a cuireadh i bhfeidhm don tir ar fad.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé sin sásúil go leor mar, nuair cuireadh an tAct sin ar bun, Acht na dTighte sa Ghaeltacht, 1929, do deineadh foráil go dtabharfaí níos mó airgid sa deontas ná mar a tugtaí faoi na hAchtanna eile agus, mar gheall ar sin, ní dóigh liom gur cheart don Aire bheith sásta Acht na dTithe sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar aon dul leis na hAchtanna eile.  Ba cheart, ar a laghad, timpeall ceathrú eile a chur leis an méid de dheontas a bheadh le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus is é an chiall atá leis sin agus an bunús atá leis ná go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta bocht agus nach furasta dóibh na tithe a thógaint in aon chor.  Is mar gheall air sin d'iarrfhainnse ar an Aire níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil do lucht na Gaeltachta <Col N="719" /> chun tithe a thógaint sna háiteanna sin nuair atá an t-airgead chómh gann ionnta.</P>
    <P>Má támuid i ndáiríre i dtaobh na Gaeilge, ba cheart é bheith mar chuspóir againn tithe maithe a sholáthar do mhuintir na n-áiteanna sin.  Is chuige sin a cuireadh an tAcht i bhfeidhm i 1929 agus tá difríocht idir an tAcht sin agus na gnáth-hAchtanna a cuireadh i bhfeidhm anseo do mhuintir na tíre ar fad.  Tá súil agam, mar sin, go gcuimhneoidh an tAire air sin agus nach mbeidh sé sásta Acht na dTithe sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar aon dul leis na hAchtanna eile ach go bhféachfaidh sé chuige, má bhíonn níos mó deontais ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre, go mbeidh 40 faoin gcéad sa bhreis air sin ar fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Do dhein an tAire tagairt do bhád atá ag obair idir chósta Chorcaíghe agus oileán na Cléire ach ní fheadar ar chuimhnigh sé in aon chor ar sheirbhís den tsórt sin a chur ar bun idir chosta Chiarraíghe agus an Blascaod. Fé mar is eol don Aire, tá trí mhile farraige ansin agus farraige andainséareach leis.  Is dóigh liomsa gur cheart seirbhís ar aon dul leis an tseirbhís atá luaite aige a chur ar fáil do mhuintir an Bhlascaoid mar is minic a thagann sé cruaidh orthu teacht amach ón oileán sin go dtí Aifreann nó chun aon ghnó eile a dhéanamh agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé tuillte ag na daoine sin seirbhís den tsórt sin a chur ar fáil doibh, mar, sí an Blascaod an pointe is sia amach ón chósta agus an pointe ina bhfuil an Ghaeluinn ar fáil faoi láthair go cruinn agus go nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na tionscail eile, ní mór an bhaint atá ag muintir Chiarraighe in aon chor leis na tionscail atá i gceist sa Mheastachán, is é sin, tionscail na mbréagán, tionscail an bhréidín agus mar sin de, ach mar sin féin, ní dóigh liom gur cheart dearmad a dhéanamh ar fad de Ghaeltacht Chiarraighe maidir leis na tionscail sin agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil an t-am tagaithe nuair is ceart machnamh a dhéanamh ar cad ba cheart a dhéanamh chun Gaeltacht Chiarraighe a chur ar aon dul leis na nGaeltachtaí eile maidir le tionscail.</P>
    <P>Níor chuala ón Aire, nuair bhí sé ag <Col N="720" /> cainnt, cad é an margadh a bheidh le fáil don bháinín san aimsir atá le teacht nó an bhfuil aon soláthar déanta maidir leis sin.  Le déanaí, do cuireadh conradh tráchtála ar bun idir an tír seo agus tír na Fraince.  Ní fheadar an ndéanfaidh an conradh sin aon mhaitheas do thionscal sa tír seo, tionscal an bhréidín i dTír Chonaill, cuir i gcás.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh mar mura ndéantar iarracht mhór chun an tionscal sin a chur chun cinn béidh thiar ar lucht saothruithe an tionnscail sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le saothrú na ceilpe, le linn an chogaidh, do baineadh feidhm mhaith as an gceilp le haghaidh abhar leasuithe talún agus go deimhin bhí margadh ann le linn an chogaidh deireannaigh mar a bhí nuair a bhí an chéad chogadh ar siúl.  Ní fheadar conas a bheidh an scéal san aimsir atá le teacht.  Ba mhaith liom fhios a bheith agam an mbeidh aon chosaint le fáil ag an dtionscal sin nuair a bheidh soláthairtí le fáil ó na tíortha lasmuigh.  Tá súil agam nach ndéanfar aon dearmad ar thionscal na ceilpe.  Is cuma cad é an méid soláthairtí a bheidh le fáil ón na tíortha lasmuigh, níor mhaith liom an tionscal sin a fheiscint ag fáil bháis.  Thaispeáin an dá chogadh a bhí sa domhan dúinn gur cheart na tionscail a bhí againn da n-oibriú anseo a choimeád ar siúl agus ceann acu ab ea tionscal na ceilpe. Tionscal nádúrtha is ea é sin már tá an cheilp le faíl go flúirseach tímpeall chósta an iarthair.</P>
    <P>I dtosach mo chuid cainte, dheineas tagairt don iascaireacht sa Ghaeltacht agus cé nach dtagann sé faoin Meastachán seo agus nach bhfuil aon soláthar airgid ina chóir sa Mheastachán, is ar éigin is ceart scaoileadh leis an Meastachán gan trácht ar iascaireacht. Is dóigh liom gurb í an iascaireacht an tionscal is mó le rá maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus cé nach bhfuil aon airgead le fáil i gcóir na hiascaireachta faoin Meastachán seo, is é mo thuairim gur cheart don Rialtas an oiread agus is féidir a dhéanamh chun na hiascaireachta a chur chun chinn&mdash; chun báid iascaigh agus fearaistí bád a sholáthar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, iad sin a bhfuil taithí acu ar an iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, tá áiteanna timpeall an <Col N="721" /> chósta atá contúirteach do na hiascairí ag teacht isteach le lón éisc agus is mór an gá atá le feabhas a chur orthu. Tá áiteanna nach bhfuil iontu ach cé no caladh beag mí-oiriúnach chun an eísc a chur ar talamh.  Is dóigh liom gur cheart féachaint chuige sin agus caladh slán a dhéanamh i dtreo nach mbeidh aon chontúirt ann do na hiascairí maidir le ceist na hiascaireachta. Dar ndóigh, caitear airgid ar mhórán rudaí sa tír seo chun saol na ndaoine i gcoitinne d'fheabhsú agus is ceart airgead a chaitheamh chun saol na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht d'fheabhsú chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá cuan áirithe im Dháil-cheantarsa a bhfuil géar-ghá le deóntas airgid a thabhairt chun na deacrachtaí atá sa tslí ar na hiascairí a thógaint as. Deinim tagairt anois do chuan an Daingin.  Do chuireas ceist ar pháipéar na Dála mar gheall air sin le déanaí chun go ndéanfaí an cuan sin d'fheabhsú agus ba mhaith an rud dá gcuirtí deontas ar fáil chun an cuain sin a leathnú agus a ghlanadh i gceart i dtreo nach mbeadh aon bhac ar na hiascairí maidir lena geuid iascaireachta.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, maidir le ceist tionseal, ba mhór ar fad an tionscal a bhí ann go dtí seo, tionscal na móna, agus, faraoir, is baolach go bhfuil teipithe ar an tionscal seo anois.  Is mór an trua é mar tá an-chuid móna le fáil i ngach Gaeltacht sa tír seo&mdash;Gaeltacht Chiarraighe, Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe, Gaeltacht Dhun na nGall agus, is dócha, Gaeltacht Phortláirge leis&mdash;agus is mór an trua nach bhféadfaí rud éigin a dhéanamh chun an tionscal seo a choimeád ar siúl.  Nílim chun dul amach ar fad ar an argóint sin mar gheall ar nach bhfuil aon airgead curtha ar fáil sa Mheastachán seo ina chóir, ach is dóigh liom nach cheart dom scaoileadh leis an Meastachán gan tagairt a dhéanamh dó.  Ba cheart tionscal na móna a chomeád ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ar aon chuma, maidir le ceist Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta ar fad, is ceist andeacair í.  Bímid ag éisteacht lena lán daoine ag iarraidh a dhéanamh amach gur cheart seo agus siúd a dhéanamh chun muintir na Gaeltachta a chur ar a mbonna agus an Ghaeilge <Col N="722" /> a shábháil mar theanga beo.  Is furast caint a dhéanamh ach ní furast an leigheas ceart a chur ar fáil.  Ní fheadar an féidir iachall a chur ar lucht gnótha anseo, nuair a bhíonn siad chun tionscal a bhúnú sa tír seo, dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus na tionscail a bhunú ansin.</P>
    <P>Dá bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh, ba mhaith an rud ar fad é, ach tá an deacracht seo sa scéal, go bhfuil na háiteanna sin iargúlta agus i bhfad óna bailte móra agus gur mór an costas a bheadh ag baint leis na hearraí a thiocfadh as na tionscail sin a chur ar fáil do lucht na geathrach agus na mbailte móra, ach b'fhéidir nár mhiste, san am chéanna machnamh ar an scéal féachaint an féidir rud éigin a dhéanamh sa tslí sin.</P>
    <P>Mar adúrt i dtosach, ní mór an t-airgead atá ann chun Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta a chur ar a mbonna i gceart.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil obair mhaith á dhéanamh ag na daoine atá ag stiurú Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta ach tá an chuid constaicí sa tslí rómpu, ach mar sin féin, tá súil agam nach mbrisfidh sé sin an misneach orthu.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár mhiste dhom tagairt a dhéanamh don tslí ina bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag brath ar Ranna eile.  Tá tagairt bheag déanta agam cheana dó sin, ach ní thuigim conas nach bhféadfai Fo-Roinn na hiascaireachta agus Roinn na Gaeltachta a chur le chéile mar gheall ar go bhfuil dlúth-bhaint ag na tionscail sin le muintir na Gaeltachta ach is dóigh liom gur minic cheana a deineadh tagairt dó sin.  Tá a lán daoine sa tír a chreideann gur cheart roinn faoi leith a chur ar bun chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a stiúrú i gceart ach is dócha go mbeadh costas ró-mhór ag baint leis sin.</P>
    <P>Ach is cuma an roinn iomlán a bheadh ag gabháil don scéal, nó fóroinn, is ceist airgid í sa deireadh. Dá mbeadh an t-airgead le fáil agus an stiúrú ceart ann ar conas mar a caithfi an t-airgead sin, b'shin é an bun rud. Tá súil agam go gcuimhneoidh an tAire ar an méid atá ráite agam ar an scéal sin.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud is mó a bhíonn ag déanamh buartha dom agus atá ag déanamh buartha dom anois ná ceist na dtithe sa Ghaeltacht, agus ní ceart go mbeadh an tAire sásta an deontas a <Col N="723" /> bheidh le fáil feasta ag muintir na Gaeltachta chun tithe a chur ar bun bheith ar aon dul leis an deontas a cuirtear ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghalltacht. Tá súil agam nach mar sin a bheidh an scéal&mdash;go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó airgid le fáil ag na daoine a bheidh ag tógáil tithe sa Ghaeltacht ná mar tá le fáil ag daoine sa chuid eile den tír faoin Acht nua.  Tá, i gcásanna áirithe, dha oiread le fáil ag muintir na tíre anois chun tithe nua a thogáil ná mar bhí, agus, i gcásanna eile, tá tri oiread le fáil ag daoine a bhíonn ag tógáil tithe faoi láthair ná mar bhí le fáil sar ar cuireadh an tAcht nua i bhfeidhm; ach, ar aon tslí, is cuma cad é an méid a bheadh le fáil ag muintir na tíre uile, ba cheart go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;40 per cent. níos mó, im thuairimse.  Is chuige sin a chur ós cóir an Aire, thar aon ní eile, d'éiríos agus tá súil agam, nuair thiocfaidh an Meastachán seo faoin ár mbráid aris, go mbeidh dul chun chinn déanta maidir leis na daoine atá ag maireachtaint ar phaistí loma agus atá ag féachaint chugainn chun leigheas d'fáil ar a scéal.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, is maith liom go bhfuil an tAire ag cur oiread suime i ndéantuisi na Gaeltachta nó bhéarfaidh sé misneach agus uchtach do na daoine bochta sna ceantair sin.  Tá fhios aige mar bhí fhios ag an tAire a chuaigh roimhe nach dtig leis na daoine bochta seo slí bheatha a bhaint amach ar na spleóireáin bheaga talaimh atá acu. Ní chothódh toradh na ngabháltas mbeag seo na daoine ráithe amháin den bhliain&mdash;tá orthu seiftiú don chuid eile den bhliain ag iascaireacht ar an fharraige, ag obair ar na bealaigh mhóra, sniomh 's ag cniotáil 's ag fiodóireacht agus ag gabháil de tionscail eile mar sin.  Téann cuid acu ar an choigrich gach bliain nuair nach bhfuil sli saothruithe ar bith eile acu sa bhaile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an cuireadh a gheibh siad ón Rialtas leis na tionscail seo a chur chun cinn brí an mheastacháin atá romhainn anois.  Tá dualgas speisialta ar an Rialtas cuideadh fial fíúntach a thabhairt do na daoine seo&mdash;an trinse <Col N="724" /> deireannach de fhír&mdash;threibh Ghaeil san iarthar a choinnigh beo teanga agus tréithre ar sinsir fríd sciúrsadh agus anró na gcéadta blian.  Mar sin dó, ní shílim gur airgead amú an t-airgead seo a caitear ar dhéantúisí na Gaeltachta agus ná bíodh an Rialtas cúng ná ceacharda ag cuideadh leo.  Is maith atá fhios agam go bhfuil saothar agus triobhlóid leis na tionscail seo a bhúnú i gceart.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil oifigí na Roinne ar a ndícheall ag freastal orthu agus nach dtig leo míorúiltí a dhéanamh. Tá fhios agam gur corrach an rud an margadh: go mbíonn na tionscail thíos seal agus thuas seal do réir mar tá éileamh an phobail orthu.  Anois san am i láthair tá smúid ar mhargadh an bháinín príomh-thionscal na Gaeltachta, ach tá súil agam nach mbeidh sé i bhfad faoi smúid.  Tá dochs láidir agam as an Rialtas agus as an socrú atáthar a dhéanamh le Rialtas na Fraince agus Rialtais na Breataine, go rachaidh sé chun sochair do thionscal an bháinín agus do thionscail eile na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a rá go bhfuil ag éirí go bréa leis an mhuileann olla a chuir an Roinn ar bun i dTír Chonaill.  Tá an muileann seo ag tabhairt obair mhaith seasmhach do mhóran daoine óga san cheantar sin agus sna páráistí ar gach taoibh de.  D'fhág an muileann seo na céadta d'fhíodóirí oilte againn agus choinnigh sé iad sa bhaile.  Mar bé é bheadh a n-aghaidh ar thíortha i gcéin agus a saothar caillte ar an tír seo.  Anois tá aois a bpósta ag móran acu agus mholfainn don Roinn gur chóir scéim tithe a ullmhú daofa.  Dá mbeadh na tithe acu agus caoi pósadh bheadh siad feistithe sa cheantar agus bheadh sé mar chúltaca láidir ag an mhuileann na fíodóirí seo a bheith comhgarach.  Tá mé cinnte go dtabharfadh aithreacha na bhfíodóir seo leathacra thalaimh do gach duine ar mhaith leis teach a thógáil agus pósadh.  Níl a dhíth ach deontas fial ón Rialtas, agus ba mhaith a bfhiú dóibh an t-airgead a chaithfí ar an scéim seo.  Neartódh sé líon na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht agus chuirfeadh sé cúl ar an mheath a thig leis an imirce.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fosta dá mbeadh cumhacht ag an tAire hallaí siamsa a <Col N="725" /> chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá siamsa agus pléisiúr a dhíth ar aos óg na Gaeltachta chomh maith le muintir na geathrach.  Chuirfeadh siad spéis i léachtaí, drámaí, cluichí, damhsaí dá mbeadh na hallaí acu.  Mura mbeidh beidh a n-intinn ar na cathracha móra agus tíortha thar sáile.</P>
    <P>Mar an gcéanna ba cheart go mbeadh cumhacht ag an tAire páirceannaí imeartha a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht. Níl aon leigheas ar an imirce chomh maith leis na rudaí seo ach bíodh saothrú réasúnta ag na daoine ar dtús.</P>

      <P>I thought that the Minister would have taken the opportunity on this Vote of making some statement as to what are the prospects of disposing of the Donegal homespun tweeds now in the hands of the people of the district.  The Minister and his Department are aware that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst the people who for the past few years have been engaged in the home-spinning industry.  They have now accumulated stocks, some of them manufactured from wool supplied by the Minister's Department.  These webbs have not been taken from them. They are still on their hands, and they are being asked, although I must say they are not being pressed, to pay for the wool that has gone into the material that has not been purchased from them.  The position in that regard is very far from satisfactory, and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what are the prospects with regard to the sale of this material that is already manufactured and in the hands of the people.  What is the prospect of their getting a market for the disposal of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear amongst the people of the Gaeltacht is that the Gaeltacht Department will, in any bargain made for outside markets push the sale of the Round Tower tweeds to the detriment of the genuine Donegal homespuns. The Round Tower tweed is helpful for the employment it gives but it could not compete at all, either from the point of view of the employment or in any other way with the homespun industry which is carried on in the people's own homes.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that the Donegal <Col N="726" /> homespun, as distinct from the Round Tower tweeds, is kept in mind and is catered for in any export market that may be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past we have been agitating with the Department for a stamp for the Donegal homespuns. I wonder what progress has been made in that direction?  A couple of years ago, when the matter was discussed at a conference in Dublin between the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Gaeltacht Services with representatives of the homespun manufacturers, it was more or less agreed, we understood, that the Department was inclined to provide a stamp for the marketing of the Donegal homespuns.  So far nothing has been done about it that I am aware of.  I would like to know what is the position in regard to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>These are the principal points which I wish to raise on this Vote.  They are matters of some concern to south west Donegal.  On the question of the homespun industry, during the war the people had to go back to spinning and weaving after being idle for some years, and the hope was that we would be able to keep this industry going. I know that difficulties have set in.  The difficulties are not of the Minister's or of the Department's making.  No one is blaming them for them, but I would remind them that, when facilities become available again and when, as we hope, markets will reopen in the near future, that they will not sacrifice the homespun manufacturers in the interests of the Round Tower tweeds.</P>

      <P>An bádóir is fearr an fear a bhíos ar an talamh, go minic.  Ta an Teachta Ó Ciosáin ghá rá gur cheart dúinn a leithide seo agus siúd a dhéanamh; ach, nuair a bhí sé ina lámha féin é a dhéanamh, ní dhearna sé é.  D'ardaigh a dhream deontais na dtithe i ngach áit ach d'fhág siad iad mar a bhí siad sa nGaeltacht.  D'fhág siad ar deireadh an Ghaeltacht, ach geallaimse nach fágfar ar deireadh anois í.  Iarraimse ar an Aire na deontais faoi Achta Tithe na Gaeltachta a ardú níos airde ná na deontais atá sé a thabhairt in <Col N="727" /> áit ar bith eile.  Sin iad na chéad Achta a tugadh isteach a rinne maith don Ghaeltacht, d'arduigh seasamh na Gaeltachta; nuair a tógadh tithe nua, tháinig meas chucu orthu fein agus féachfaidh an Teachta Mac Pháidin agus mé féin chuige nach bhfágfar thiar iad.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an bhfheamainn a bhí dhá baint i Rinn an Mhaoile, dhá bhlian ó shoin, fágadh ar lámha lucht a bainte í agus ní bhfuair siad blas aisti.  Ba cheart rud eicínt a dhéanamh i dtaobh na feamainne agus na slata mara, agus déanfar rud eicínt freisin. Bhí an Teachta Ó Ciosáin ag labhairt faoin gceilp, ach céard a rinne siad fein dhá bhliain ó shoin faoin gceilp nuair d'fhág siad ar lamha mhuintir Rinn an Mhaoile í, daoine a chuaigh, go minic, go hascallaí i bhfarraige ag tógáil feamainne lena déanamh agus ní bhfuair siad pinginn ariamh ar a sáothar ach fágadh ar a lámha ansin í gur lobh sí.  I nDún na nGall tá tionscal na holla acu.  Tá olann againn i gConamara chomh maith le olann Dhún na nGall.  Tá ceantar ansin in aice leis an Mám agus na mílte caorach ann agus ba cheart rud eicínt a dhéanamh le tionscal fíodóireachta a chur ar bhun ann.  Dá ndéantaí é sin coinneofaí na daoine sa mbaile.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Teachta Ó Ciosáin gur cheart Roinn an Iascaigh a cheangailt le Roinn na Gaeltachta in aon roinn amháin.  Ach bhí sé féin sa Rialtas le chúig bhliana déag agus ní dhearna sé tada faoi.  Bhí beirt fhear as Ciarraidhe agus fear as Corcaigh i Roinn na Gaeltachta ach is maith liom go bhfuil fear as Contae Mhuigheo, as Iar-Chonnachta, ina bun anois agus tá súil agam, cibé rud a dhéanfhas sé nach ndéanfhaidh sé níos measa ná rinne an mhuintir a chuaigh roimhe ach go gcuirfidh sé go leor feabhais air.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Aire a bhí sa bhFhrainc faoin socrú a rinne sé.  Tiubhra sé seo cúnamh do thionscail an bhréidin agus do thionscail na Gaeltachta.  Is as an nGaeltacht a fáisceadh muid agus is as an nGaeltacht a faisceadh an Teach seo, agus ba cheart dúinn, ar a laghad, cúnamh a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht. <Col N="728" /> Má cailltear an teanga sa nGaeltacht, beidh sí imithe go brách agus tiocfaidh leámh chúr na habhann uirthi.

      <P>Duirt sé nach ndearna siad tada don Ghaeltacht. Ba é Rialtais Fhianna Fáil d'ardaigh deontas na dtithe dhóibh agus hardaíodh deontas an £2 go dtí £5 faoi Rialtais Fhianna Fáil freisin. Cé mhéad atá le fáil ón Aire atá ann anois?  Tá sé toilteanach, ach níl an t-airgead aige.  Chuir an Teachta Ó Floinn ceist air agus chuir mé féin ceist air, agus níl ráite anois aige ach go bhfuil an chéist faoi bhreithniú, go bhfuil an cheist dá cíoradh; agus níl aon dheimhniú go n-ardófar deontas na dtithe.  Déarfainn féin go bhfuil sé in aimhreas nach n-ardofar an gnáth-dheontas.</P>
      <P>Mar adúirt an Teachta Ó Ciosáin, ní leor é mura ndéantar de mhéadú orthu ach a geur ar aon-dul leis na deontais don gcuid eile den tír.  Ba cheart go mbeidís i bhfad níos mo. Ba cheart go mbeadh deontas níos mó le fáil ná deontas £235 mar atá ag dul faoi Achta an Rialtais Aitiúil.  Ba cheart go mbeadh níos mó ná sin ag dul le haghaidh tithe sa nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh tionscal na mbréagán i gConamara sul a dtáinig an Rialtas deireannach agus ní raibh an t-airgead do na páistí scoile ann, ach an oiread. Sin dhá rud.  Bheadh i bhfad níos mó creidiúna ag dul don Teachta dá labhradh sé an fhírinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gceist na slata mara agus na feamuinne, <Col N="729" /> bhí mise ag iarraidh cúiteamh a fháil do na daoine ar chlis an margadh orthu.  Níor éirigh liom.  Níl a fhios agam ar thug an tAire aon lámh chúnta dhóibh.  Fuair mé geallúint béil&mdash;ní raibh sé scríofa&mdash;ar an nguthán ón Roinn, go mbeadh ceannach ar an gceilp.  Is dóigh gur chlis an margadh ar an Roinn agus nach raibh siad i ndon an cheilp a cheannach. Rinne mé féin mo sheacht ndícheall cúiteamh a fháil dóibh ach dhiúltaigh an Roinn cúnamh a thabhairt.  Bá cheart é dhéanamh anois más féidir é &mdash;níl sé ró-dhéanach fós.  Ní dhiúltóidh muintir Rinn an Mhaoile an t-airgead.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire cén tairbhe a bheas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta as an socrú a rinneadh le déanaí leis an bhFrainnc, cé nach dtagann sé isteach sa Meastachán seo. Chlis orthu a chuid gliomach a dhíol le seachtain anuas, ó tháinig an fógra amach.  Béidir go bhfuil na ceannachóirí ag súil le tairbhe níos fearr dóibh féin; tá súil agam gurb shin é a bhfuil d'údar leis.  Más é, iarraim ar an Aire dlús a chur go gcuirfear deireadh leis an neamh-chinnteacht agus nach bhfágfar na gliomaigh agus eile ar a lámha acu.  Béidir nach leis an Aire go díreach a bhaineas na cúrsaí sin ach san am chéanna tá dlú-bhaint ag an gceist seo leis an nGaeltacht.  Sin pointe a ndearna mé cheana, ar an Meastachán seo, gur chóir go dtiocfadh ceist na Gaeltachta faoi bhráid na Ranna Stáit eile.  Cuir i geás, an pointe a rinne an Teachta Mac Pháidín i dtaobh hallaí paráiste a chur ar bun le haghaidh siamsaí, tá mé ar aonintinn leis san rud sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh baint éigin idir an Roinn Oideachais agus Ranna eile, agus nuair a bheidh siad ag cur scoileanna nua gairm-oideachais ar bun, ba cheart go dtiocfadh an cheist seo isteach agus go ndéanfaí an scoil ar bhealach go mbeadh cuid de d'fhéadfaí a úsáid mar halla, chun cuidiú le drámaíocht.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-tsuim ag an Teachta Mac Pháidín sa gceist sin.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart, freisin, nuair a fheiceas an tAire rud éigin á dhéanamh ag Roinn eile, ag déanamh dochair don Ghaeltacht ba cheart go labhródh sé amach go misniúil dána ina aghaidh.  Bhí cúis mhór leis sin nuair a bhí fás trátaí <Col N="730" /> sa nGaeltacht ina chúis spáirne le gairid.</P>
    <P>Dá ndéanfadh an Rialtas seo an obair sin chomh maith agus a rinne Rialtas Fhianna Fáil, ní dhéanfadh sé dochar dóibh.  Ach, mar adúirt an tAire Talmhaíochta linn cuirfidh sé deireadh ar fad le scéim na dtrátaí ansin.  Tá ceist na Gaeltachta andeacair&mdash;admhaím gach aon duine an méid sin&mdash;agus teastaíonn cabhair uathu ó dhaoine taobh amuigh&mdash;ó gach dream sa Teach seo agus sa tír.  Ní féidir an cheist sin a réiteach ar aon bhealach amháin.  Roimhe seo, bhíodar ag braith ar an imirce go Meiriceá agus seiceanna a chur ar ais, agus ar imirce go hAlbain le linn na fátaí a bheith dhá saothrú, agus ar bheagáinín iascaireachta, ar bheagáinín cniotála, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Caithfear na rudaí sin agus rudaí eile a thabhairt isteach sa cheist, má tá caighdeán maireachtála sa Ghaeltacht le n-ardú.  Tá sé déanta go rímhaith go nuige seo.  Ní fhaca mé aon rud níos fearr ná na monarchana bréagán a cuireadh ar bun i gCois Fhairrge.  Tá tairbhe don tír ar fad mar tá toradh na monarchan dá dhíol i Meiriceá agus a saothrú dollaerí don tír seo.  Sin rud nach féidir a rá ar chuid de thionscail mhóra na tíre.  Níl mórán fonn ormsa labhairt ar an meastachán seo imbliana, ach ba mhaith liom moladh a tabhairt don Roinn, mar a mholas an Roinn gach blian faoin Aire eile.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go mbeidh siad ionmholta faoin Aire nua freisin.  Níl mise ag fagháil droch-mheasa ar an Roinn toisc Aire nua a bheith ann.  Má leanann siad leis an obair a bhí ar siubhal acu, gheobhaidh siad moladh agus árd-mholadh uaimse, is cuma cén taobh den Teach mbeidh mé.  Tá moladh thar cuimse ag dul don Roinn agus don Rialtas eile, go raibh siad indan na tionnscail seo do choimeád ar suíl le linn na hÉigeandála.  Tá a fhios agam chomh deacair agus a bhí sé aon ádhbhar d'fháil, chun cniotála agus eile.  Rinneadar an obair sin go h-an-mhaith agus do bhunaíodar saidhbhreas in áiteanna nach raibh sé ann cheana.  I ngheall ar sin, molaim an Roinn as an deagh-obair atá déanta acu.  Níl aimhreas ar bith orm, agus <Col N="731" /> tá mé ar aon intinn leis an Teachta Ó Mongáin i dtaobh an Aire nua.  Tá mé lán-chinnte go ndeanfaidh sé a chion fhéin agus a dhícheall le tuille feabhais a chur ar an obair seo.</P>
    <P>Níl ach an t-aon locht amháin agam air agus sin í nach ndearna sé iarracht an Ghaedhilge a labhairt, ag tabhairt an Mheastacháin isteach dó.  Fiú amháin dá mbeadh sí beagáinín bacach aige, ba cheart dó an deagh-shampla a thabhairt mar a thug gach Aire go nuige seo.  Ní thógfadh aoinne anseo air dá mbeadh sí bacach aige.</P>
    <P>Is léir ón méid adubhairt mé gur thug Rialtas Fhianna Fáil árd-chabhair don Ghaeltacht, agus ba cheart dúinn go léir é sin d'admháil agus ba cheart go mbeadh an fhírinne le chloisint i gcónaí sa Teach so.</P>

      <P>Ní theastaíonn uaim ach focal nó dhó a rá ar an meastachán seo.  Is é an fáth go bhfuilim ag caint ná go bhfuil sé mar thuairim againne ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh gur ceann des na meastacháin is tábhachtaí dá dtugtar isteach sa Tigh seo an meastachán seo.  Má táimid i ndáiríribh faoi shábháilt na teangan, ní foláir dúinn a thuiscint nach féidir linn í do shábháil má cailltear an Ghaeltacht, an áit a bhfuil fíor-thobar na Gaeilge.  Ná bhíodh aon amhras ar an Teachta Mac Párthaláin go geloisidh sé aon tsearús ná cúrsaí easaontas uainn-ne.  A mhalairt atá im aigne. Mar sin féin, ba mhaith liom an fhírinne do labhairt agus is dócha gurb í fírinne an sgéil í ná go ndearna an chéad Rialtas dar gcuid féin a bhí againn sa tír seo éageóir ar an nGaeltacht. Ní dóigh liom go dtug an Rialtas deireannach a bhí againn sa tír seo Cothrom na Féinne don Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil breall orm, ach ceapaim ná fuighidh an Ghaeltacht Cothrom na Féinne ó aon Rialtas, an fhaid is atá ná fuil ach a laghad sin ag na Teachtaí ar an gceist tábhactach seo nach fiú leo fiú amháin teacht isteach sa Tigh agus an cheist do phlé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An cheist mhór seo atá le réiteach ag an Aire, is ceist eacnaimíoch í.  Tá an dá rud ann, ach sa gcéad dul síos, is ceist eacnaimíoch í.  Tá fadhb amháin le réiteach aige agus is é sin conas slí bheatha réasúnta do thabhairt <Col N="732" /> do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht.  Le déanaí, tá an-chuid tráchta ar na ceanntracha cunga agus ar roinnt na talún.  Ní dóigh liomsa gur féidir ceist na Gaeltachta do réiteach sa tslí seo amháin.  Caithfear a thuille monarchan agus a thuille tionscal a chur ar bun sa nGaeltacht in aice le bailte agus sráid-bhailte, i dtreo is go mbeidh caoi ag muintir na Gaeltachta a slí bheatha a bhaint amach ag a baile.  An chaint a dhein an Teachta Mac Pháidín, nuair a dhein sé iarracht ar a chur ina luí ar an Aire chomh tábhachtach is atá sé caoi a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sult, pleisiúir agus caitheamh aimsire a bheith acu ina gceanntair féin, aontaím leis sin go léir.  Is é mo thuairim go mbféidir, dá ndéantaí níos mo oibre den tsórt sin, go mbeadh laghdú ar an imirce ón nGaeltacht atá ar siúl le blianta anuas.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart go mbeadh an deontas le haghaidh tithe sa Ghaeltacht ar aon-dul leis an deontas sa Ghalltacht.  Is é mo thuairim gur cóir go mbeadh breis le fáil as muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá cúiteamh éigin tuillte acu.  Níl an talamh ann go maith, ach do choimeád siad an teanga agus an náisiúntacht beo nuair a thoiligh an chuid eile den tír an méid sin a ligint in éag.</P>
    <P>Maithim don Aire é nár dhein sé an meastachán a thabhairt isteach tré Ghaeilge.  Maithfidh mise é sin dhó, má thuigim uaidh i ríth na bliana go bhfuil sé toilteannach cion fir a dhéanamh ar son muintir na Gaeltachta.  Cuimhnimis ar an oighreacht mhór sin, an Gaeltacht, agus féachaimis chuige ná caillfimid an oighreacht sin.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to give more details with regard to the provision of housing in the Gaeltacht areas.  As the Minister is aware, the grants allocated under the Gaeltacht Housing Act are not sufficient to enable the people concerned to take advantage of housing schemes or to carry out building operations.  I have been asked to make representations in regard to this matter with a view to getting something definite from the Department as to what will be done in these areas as far as housing is concerned. The matter is a very urgent one.  Ninety pounds were allocated by <Col N="733" /> way of grant.  That is not at all adequate under present conditions.  The people are faced with the option of relinquishing these grants altogether. I think the Department should take steps to supplement the grant by way of amending legislation, if necessary. I am aware that I cannot suggest amending legislation on an Estimate but the matter is of very urgent public importance.</P>

I would like some definite assurance from the Minister at this stage because this is a matter of vital concern in the Gaeltacht districts.  The people in these areas have received no consideration whatever under the 1947 Housing Act. I cannot understand why the Gaeltacht section of the Department of Lands did not bring this up to date under that Act.  The poorest section of the people and the people who represent the real Ireland were left without any consideration when this 1947 Housing Act was brought into operation. In the atmosphere that prevails at the moment I would appeal strongly to the Minister to expedite this matter and to come to the immediate assistance of these people.  When he is replying, I shall be glad if he will elaborate on his opening statement in that connection.</P>

      <P>I regard the Gaeltacht services section of my Department as a very important one.  As I stated in my opening speech, over £104,000 were paid out in wages this year.  While I cannot forecast at the moment what we will pay for finished work, last year it reached slightly over £49,000.  This is a service that caters for areas where employment such as obtains in most other areas throughout the country is not available.  The service meets a definite want by providing work of a remunerative kind particularly in the people's homes thereby supplementing the incomes or the earnings in the households.  It is a service which all of us would like to see expand.  I shall do my utmost to expand it as much as possible and bring earning power into those homes which have not a chance of obtaining employment such as prevails elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Most of the Deputies who spoke in this debate spoke about housing.  I am aware that there is a big discrepancy between the grants given under the Local Government Housing Acts and the grants given under the Gaeltacht Services.  I do not want to anticipate proposed new legislation but I will say that I think the situation will be met in the very near future in a way that will meet the wishes of all those who have spoken on this subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady wants to know what the prospects are of a market for homespuns.  As regards the sale of homespuns we are going through a very difficult time at the moment.  That is entirely due to circumstances outside our control.  It is due to the fact that the world market is more or less flooded with piece goods.  We are finding it difficult to dispose of our materials.  Nevertheless we do not want any hardship imposed on those who have supplies or stocks on hands because of the world situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McFadden wants a special <Col N="735" /> grant for houses for weavers.  I will examine into that.  I am well aware that the housing accommodation for some of these is quite inadequate.  If it is possible to come to the rescue we shall do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane referred to the setting up of an inter-departmental committee for the purpose of co-ordinating Gaeltacht Services with other Government Departments.  There is complete co-operation at the moment between this particular service and all other Government Departments.  There is no friction; there is nothing left undone through lack of co-operation.  I am satisfied with the harmony that exists.  If the necessity arises, I shall have to consider the suggestion Deputy Flynn made.  I do not think there is any other point that calls for attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) Timothy Joseph Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £659,950 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to local authorities and other expenses in connection with housing, miscellaneous grants and a grant in aid.</P>
      <P>The total of the Estimate for the expenses of the Department for the year is £1,139,950.  The main divisions of the Vote are those relating to salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister, amounting to a net sum of £127,400, miscellaneous grants of £11,660, and finally a sum of £1,000,890 for housing.</P>
      <P>It may, therefore, be seen at a glance that the provision for housing will absorb the greater portion of the estimated expenditure, 88 per cent. of the total in fact.  By reason merely of the magnitude of the provision made in the estimates for this service I should, therefore, give it the most prominent place in my introductory remarks, but it deserves that place also on account of the magnitude of the problem which it presents and the grave social considerations which demand its speedy solution.</P>
      <P>The most urgent housing needs are those which the local authorities are responsible for meeting.  They involve the provision, in a comprehensive programme, of new houses for about 60,000 families at present living in insanitary or overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable conditions.  Of this 60,000, the needs of Dublin City and its environs account for about 26,000.</P>
      <P>The carrying out of this local authority programme involves very serious difficulties and it is to the solution of these difficulties that I have been giving prior attention since I assumed office as Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Deputies will be already aware of the main headings under which these difficulties may be classified&mdash;shortage of materials; shortage of skilled labour; a consequent lack of readiness on the part of contractors to tender for the erection of local authority houses; rising costs where tenders are received; delay in completion of contracts; and, as a result of all these factors, a general state of uncertainty in the minds of local bodies as to the extent to which they are expected to proceed with their programmes in view of the difficulties which appear to many of them to be insurmountable.</P>
    <P>It is to remove these uncertainties and to get generally accepted methods of approach that I have instituted the practice of going round to meet the representatives and officers of local bodies in their own areas, to discuss these problems with them and to bring them into contact with the representatives of building organisations and trade unions which are concerned with the building of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>For the relatively short period during which I have been engaged on this work I may say that the results are on the whole encouraging.  I feel that the local authorities with whom I have been in contact, and other local authorities who have read the Press accounts of these contacts, are now convinced of my determination and the determination of the Department to allow no obstacles to be placed in their way in so far as their proposals for building more houses can be shown to be practicable.  The utilisation of the direct labour system to supplement the contract system where the latter has been found insufficient has been discussed with the local authorities.  I propose shortly to give them detailed practical suggestions as to methods of planning and organising direct labour building and to advise them as to the materials which might be purchased and brought into stock beforehand. The guarantee of a continuous programme of house-building should help to attract skilled tradesmen into the employment of local authorities and, where possible, such a guarantee should, therefore, be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Another very desirable practice which I wish to see generally adopted is the acquisition by local authorities of sites for letting to private persons who are unable to purchase sites individually.  These facilities might be provided in particular for those classes of houses qualifying for grants or for advances under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the recent appointment of a Housing Consultative Council for Dublin City and County and Dún Laoghaire Borough and in connection therewith the delegation of all executive housing functions to the assistant city manager, Mr. T. C. O'Mahony, who will act as housing director for the whole area.  The Dublin problem, as I have said, represents a large proportion of the whole national problem and I have asked the consultative council and the housing director to examine every possibility of relieving the housing shortage.  The results of their investigations can be made available through the Department to the housing authorities in other areas.  The matters to be dealt with by the council and the director include a survey of vacant or derelict accommodation in the city and county and the question of its acquisition and reconditioning for at least the temporary use of tenants badly in need of accommodation.  Another matter for examination is the question of the adoption of new methods of building to supplement traditional methods.  This examination will, I am sure, be conducted in the most objective manner by the representatives of all the interests concerned.  These interests are fairly fully represented on the consultative council.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing finance, the Minister for Finance stated in his Budget speech that while there was a general need for retrenchment in capital expenditure, such retrenchment would not apply to housing.  The Local Loans Fund is already available for meeting the capital needs of most local authorities in respect of housing. Any local authority which can provide for its capital requirements by borrowing from sources other than the Local Loans Fund may, of course, obtain <Col N="739" /> their loans from other lending agencies or by the issue of stock.  The rate of interest on loans from the Local Loans Fund was recently raised from 2½ to 3¼ per cent., but, as intimated by the Minister for Finance, it is intended to alleviate the adverse effect that this would have on the housing finances of local authorities.  This may be achieved by adjustments in the amounts of the Transition Development Fund grants or in the limits on the capital expenditure per house on which subsidy will be payable, or partly in one way and partly in the other, so that local authorities will be left in as favourable a position as hitherto in regard to their net liability for repayment of housing loans.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been empowered to make advances to persons providing houses for themselves up to a market value limit of £1,750.  Representations have been made to me that this limit is too low.  I am considering these representations at present, subject, however, to the overriding consideration that a position is maintained whereby the funds available for this type of transaction shall be restricted to that class of borrower who is most in need of housing accommodation within certain minimum standards.</P>
    <P>I have said that the local authority housing programme contemplates the provision of some 60,000 houses.  It was estimated some years ago that the total needs of the country for new housing accommodation was 100,000.  The balance of 40,000 will be provided by private enterprise and the grants made available on the scales provided for in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, will be the State's contribution towards this private persons' programme.  That programme is intended to dovetail into the local authority programme: in those rural areas where the population consists mainly of small farmers rather than agricultural labourers the predominant building activity will be that which qualifies for grants for private persons' houses.  In other areas where the portion of the population eligible for labourers' cottages is more numerous the local authorities' labourers Acts programme will predominate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The planning and execution of housing schemes are affected by various matters arising out of planning control and the provision of water supplies, sanitation, roads and other services. In so far as these matters facilitate development they are available to enhance the amenities of the houses, and they will, of course, be utilised, but I wish to put on record my conviction that the time is not opportune for setting standards too high in these respects.  To get the houses built must be our main and primary objective and if the ancillary services are not immediately available we must go ahead without them.</P>
    <P>My predecessor set up a committee on piped water supplies so as to ascertain the practicability of providing water on a regional basis in rural areas. This was a rather difficult matter for a committee to examine in a deliberate way.  Although there were engineering experts appointed on the committee they could not, of course, be expected to get down to particular schemes in the manner in which they would tackle them if they had professional responsibility for their design. Actually the problem is not of a general nature but one involving <i>ad hoc</i> examination, surveys, planning, etc., in each particular case.  At the same time the existence of the committee was, I found, tending to induce local authorities to defer the formulation of schemes in areas which they might anticipate would form portion of a wider area for which the committee might be planning.  As housing schemes for many of these areas are urgent and in various instances include provision for sanitary services in the houses, the carrying out of housing schemes could not be allowed to be deferred until the long-term programme of the piped water supply committee had been formulated, recommended and subsequently implemented.  I therefore decided that in all the circumstances it would be best to put an end to the investigations of the committee and I have communicated with the members accordingly.</P>
    <P>I turn now to actual achievements during the 12 months which ended in March last.  Houses completed by local <Col N="741" /> authorities in the year ended 31st March, 1948, totalled 729, as compared with 619 in the previous year.  This is a point of some significance in spite of the, as yet, extremely inadequate output indicated.  It is the first time since 1941 that the returns for annual output of housing authorities have shown an increase.  The figures for houses under construction have maintained their upward trend.  On the 31st March last the number of local authority houses in course of erection was 3,812; on the corresponding date in 1947 it was 2,212.</P>
    <P>With output at present levels it is obvious that, if rapid improvement does not take place, it will be a very considerable time before the housing programme is realised.  I am confident, however, now that the downward trend in production has been checked, that improvement will go ahead at an accelerating rate.</P>
    <P>Building costs continue at a high level and tend to increase further.  In urban areas building costs since the beginning of this year have ranged from £1,040 for a house of 672 square feet in Dublin to £1,628 for a house of 821 square feet in a small urban district.  This represents an average of roughly 30/- per square foot in Dublin and about 40/- per square foot in the urban district.  In Dublin County construction figures (including site development) for a two-storey house of 798 square feet with water and sewer services work out at over £1,660, or more than £2 per square foot.  In Wexford, on the other hand, a 614 square feet single-storey cottage without services is being built at prices varying between £600 and £660.</P>
    <P>These costs, even with an appropriate increase in the rents, would mean a crushing burden on the finances of local authorities if special financial arrangements to tide housing authorities over the transition period had not been made.  The time for the abandonment of these transition arrangements has not yet arrived, but we must inevitably arrive at a point where the new pattern of building costs, whatever it may be, must be faced up to, and I have this aspect of the matter under examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Grants from the Transition Development Fund continue to be paid, the aim being to keep both the rents and the housing authority's contribution within reasonable limits.  During the year which ended in March last a total of £408,359 was paid out to housing authorities in respect of 1,751 dwellings.</P>
    <P>An item of £4,000 appears in the Estimates for expenses connected with competitions to be held by selected housing authorities in the layout of sites and design of houses and cottages. It is important that local schemes should be well laid out and the houses suitably designed.  These competitions should help to stimulate local interest in sound and tasteful design and layout. The committee set up to supervise the conduct of the competitions is proceeding with the arrangements and their findings will no doubt raise the standard of future housing, but, of course, in the meantime housing must proceed on the basis of the best designs at present available.</P>
    <P>The number of houses being built and reconstructed by private persons, public utility societies and other private agencies with the aid of State grants also shows an increase over last year.  The total for the year 1947-48 was 1,350, of which 773 were new houses and 574 reconstructed houses.  The corresponding figure for 1946-47 was 1,146, of which 456 represented new building and 690 reconstructions.  The increase was, it will be observed, attributable entirely to new building.  The number of reconstructions completed during the year actually declined.  The number of houses of these classes in course of erection on 31st March last was 1,983, as compared with 1,394 on the same date last year.  The number of reconstructions in progress was exactly equal to the number of new houses, viz., 1,983.  The corresponding number last year was 1,932.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Estimates for the payment of private grants under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  I should point out that in the citation of the Housing Acts in subheads 12 and 13 (Parts II and III of the Estimate) the year &ldquo;1947&rdquo; should, of course, read &ldquo;1948.&rdquo;  When the Estimates were being made out it was <Col N="743" /> expected that the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1947, would have become law within the calendar year 1947.  It was actually signed by the President on the 13th January of this year.  The reference to Sections 15, 16, 17 and 21 of the Act in Sub-head 13 (Page III of the Estimate) should read Sections 16 to 21, inclusive, to allow for amendments inserted in the Bill during its later stages.</P>
    <P>The grants payable under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, are considerably larger than those provided for under the old legislation. They are designed primarily to assist white-collar workers, tradesmen, small farmers and others in what might be called the intermediate economic category to get houses built for their own occupation, or to secure houses for rent.  There is, however, no means test in connection with the grants; they are merely confined to houses with floor area limits of 500 and 1,250 square feet.  Arrangements have also been made for giving second priority&mdash;first preference goes, of course, to local authority housing&mdash;to grant houses in the issue of building licences by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am confident that this scheme of assistance will be of considerable benefit to a section of the community whose housing difficulties are, in their way, as acute as those of workers who depend on housing authorities to provide them with accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, also provides for making special grants to housing authorities who provide what are called reserved houses.  These houses are intended for persons recently married or about to marry.  The scheme is confined to county boroughs, boroughs and other urban districts whose population exceeds 12,000.  Regulations under the Act will provide for the preparation by these housing authorities of schemes for the provision of reserved houses and it is hoped to get a number of schemes under way this year.</P>
    <P>Progress was made during the year with schemes for the provision of extra dwelling rooms for persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.  The <Col N="744" /> authorities whose duty it is to frame these schemes are the health authorities, that is county councils and the corporation of county boroughs.  All 31 health authorities have now prepared and submitted schemes; 14 of these were approved during the year. The schemes provide for the construction of a total of over 2,000 rooms, huts or châlets.  Health authorities may make grants towards the cost of the accommodation.  Two-thirds of the grants, up to a limit of £100 per room may be recouped by the State.  The average cost of providing the extra room, hut or châlet has worked out to date at £196.  Progress on the scheme has been slow, but it is anticipated that during the current financial year the schemes will be availed of to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>The number of allotments provided by local authorities in urban areas has been falling over the past number of years, owing to the slackening of demand for plots on the part of unemployed persons and others.  The figure for the 1947 season was 10,083 as compared with over 20,000 in 1942.  It is estimated, however, that the number of plots which will be taken and cultivated in the current year will be about the same as the figure for last year.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in the Road Fund income in 1947/48 of about £500,000 as compared with the previous year.  The increase was due partly to the increased number of vehicles licensed and partly to the increased rates of duty introduced in November last.  The Road Fund income for the current year is estimated to be approximately the same as that for last year, namely, £2,000,000.  The number of vehicles of all classes under licence in August, 1947, was 90,374, as compared with 76,552 in August, 1946.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the grants notified to local authorities for road restoration and maintenance for the current year is about £3,450,000.  Having regard to other commitments from preceding years and the draw on the Road Fund in respect of general taxation, a supplementary grant of £2,250,000 was required to meet current commitments. The allocation of this grant was decided on by the previous Administration, <Col N="745" /> but the source from which it was to be allocated was left undetermined. Questions have been put to me as to the source from which it will be provided.  I am not in a position to make a statement on this matter just now, but as soon as a decision has been reached a statement will be issued.</P>
    <P>The Department continues to cooperate with the Garda Síochána in the institution of various measures in the interests of road safety.  These include an exhibition at the Royal Dublin Society Shows, the display of road safety films in schools and cinemas, a Press advertising campaign conducted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and the issue of a booklet and leaflets to applicants for driving licences and for distribution otherwise. Two working mechanical models for testing the reactions of motor drivers have been acquired.</P>
    <P>The committee on road surfacing in relation to animal-drawn traffic has completed its investigations and its report is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>As to rate collection, on the 31st March, 1948, the amount of warrants outstanding for the financial year then ending was 3.6 per cent. as compared with 5.5 per cent. the year before.  The best collection was in Monaghan, where 99.6 per cent. of the rates were accounted for.  The lowest was in Kerry at 88.2 per cent.  The position in regard to the rate collection as a whole may be regarded as very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The amount of grants-in-aid of local taxation has increased considerably and the question of reducing county council overdrafts in the early part of the year by making earlier payments of grants from the Road Fund and from the agricultural grant is being considered. The total expenditure on local services in urban and rural areas and from grants as well as rates is now approaching the impressive total of about £20,000,000, of which about £9,000,000 will be met from grants.</P>
    <P>The estimates of county councils show a rise of about £1,000,000 on the estimates for the preceding year.  The increase is on the whole higher in respect of health and hospital services than for local government services.  The <Col N="746" /> net cost of the county councils' local government services is estimated to amount to somewhat less than £5,000,000 in 1948-49, while the estimated amount for health (including medical assistance) services is a little over £4,000,000.  Of the total of £9,000,000 to be raised by county councils about £3,750,000 or 42 per cent. is being provided by the State by way of the agricultural grant.  In addition, the special grants in aid of various services supplement the expenditure from rates.</P>
    <P>The rates leviable in many of the urban areas have shown an upward tendency and in some instances the figure is now in excess of 30/- in the £. Further increases in capital and revenue expenditure will be found necessary in many urban areas in respect of housing and other schemes. These schemes cannot, in the interests of the community, be deferred, and when carried out will conduce to the real wealth and welfare of the local community.  They will in due course involve increases in local valuations and thereby assist in widening the present incidence of local taxation. Another important factor contributing to the increase in local expenditure is the general increase in salaries and wages which has taken place since the revised scales of salaries for the various local officers were introduced as from the end of 1946 and with the increases in employees' wages following on the increase accorded to agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>The Public Libraries Act, 1948, provided for the establishment of a Library Council which has been constituted on the nomination of the bodies set out in the Act with a chairman appointed by me after consultation with the Minister for Education.  I have every confidence that the new council will get to work energetically on the improvement of the library services in co-operation with the local library authorities in the manner contemplated in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, became law on the 14th January last.  Local authorities have been advised of the principal provisions of the Act.  The <Col N="747" /> adoption of Part III of the Act to provide for the superannuation of established servants is at present under consideration by local authorities generally.</P>
    <P>The Town and Regional Planning Acts are now in operation in 47 of the 62 urban and municipal districts and in 17 of the 27 county health districts. Sketch development plans have been completed in respect of 22 planning districts and are in course of preparation for 20 other districts.  During the past year 197 appeals were submitted to the Minister.  In 53 per cent. of the decided cases the decisions of the local authorities were confirmed.</P>
    <P>The progress made by local authorities in 1946-47 in the preparation of water supply and sewerage schemes which had to be deferred during the war years was well maintained during the year 1947-48.  The major schemes initiated during the year involve an expenditure of £340,000 of which a sum of about £120,000 is being met by way of grant, the remaining portion of the cost being defrayed by the local authorities, generally by way of loan.</P>
    <P>Loans for housing amounted to about £1,000,000 in the year as against £127,000 the previous year.  There was an increase in the amount borrowed for other purposes of £94,490 as compared with the previous year.  The principal increases occurred under the heading of expenditure, on hospitals and water supply schemes and roads.</P>
    <P>The distribution of air-raid precautions fire-fighting appliances to local authorities was completed during the year.  An experienced officer with engineering qualifications has been recruited to advise the Minister in connection with all matters arising in the administration of the Fire Brigades Act and to act as inspector of fire brigades throughout the country and advise on the formation and organisation of fire-fighting services.</P>
    <P>Conditions remain far from normal in regard to the operation of the combined purchasing system, notwithstanding that certain controls and emergency provisions have been removed or revoked.  Special difficulty was experienced in securing the minimum <Col N="748" /> requirements of local authorities in such things as linseed oil, white and red lead, brushes, solder, as well as goods manufactured from iron, steel and other metals.  In consequence the strict terms of the contract had frequently to be modified both in regard to the period of delivery and the acceptance of substitutes.  The present rise in prices affecting an increasingly wide range of goods has also been disquieting.  Some of the increases claimed amounted to from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. on the prices prevailing in the previous year.  On the other hand, the official list for the current year contains many items which have not appeared since the commencement of the emergency, and it is hoped that further additions will be possible next year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to offer any detailed comments on the general system of local administration at this stage, save to say that I am convinced of the necessity for restoring to the elected bodies a larger element of real and effective control of their own affairs. My intentions in this matter will, however, involve the introduction of legislation, and accordingly I do not propose to develop the subject any further on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I formally propose that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, I should like to say to the new Minister for Local Government that, so far as I am concerned, I wish him, personally, well. I shall do my utmost as far as I can to co-operate with him in trying to provide this country with what I think it needs, a system of local administration suited to the circumstances of the day. I have listened to the Minister's speech with close attention.  I have no doubt he found it somewhat difficult to deliver because, after all, it was in fact not an account of his own stewardship but an account of mine in so far as there has been progress in housing and the provision of water supplies, sewerage schemes and in the development of our local services generally, I think it will have to be conceded that the major portion of that work was carried out in the 46 weeks which elapsed prior to the 18th February, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I have to move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  I do so with some reluctance because I recognise the difficulties under which the Minister has laboured since he took office such a little while ago.  Yet, I find that there are, in so far as they have been made public, certain aspects of his administration, for which I think he is personally responsible, that call for criticism.  It is for that reason, in order to enable me to record our dissatisfaction in a more formal way, that this motion to refer back has been put down.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to the provision which he found and which I had found necessary to make for the repair and reconstruction of our road system.  Our road system, as everyone knows, has suffered very severely, not only from the lack of facilities for repairing and maintaining it which we suffered during the war but, also, from the abnormal burdens which were imposed on it during that very difficult period.  It is a matter.  I think of first importance that everything possible should be done to restore the roads to a proper and safe condition, fit to carry the traffic which is immediately being imposed upon them and improved, if possible, to provide for the requirements of the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that it was considered that grants amounting to £3,450,000 would be required to enable the road authorities to carry out the works of repair and maintenance which were required to be done in this year as a matter of urgency.  He has also disclosed to the House that the estimated revenue from the Road Fund this year would be about £2,000,000, not all, of course, of which would be available for the purpose of providing the grants.</P>
    <P>So far, the Minister was accurate in his statement, but there was an inaccuracy in it which I deplore and which I wish to correct.  It is true that the last Government, the Fianna Fáil Administration, had decided that the moneys available from the Road Fund would have to be supplemented by special grant.  That problem, at my instance, was considered by the Government <Col N="750" /> and it was decided that a special grant should be made to the Road Fund in order to enable it to discharge its obligations to the local authorities, if those local authorities conformed to our views and carried out the road works which we thought were urgently necessary.  It was decided by the Cabinet on which I sat that this additional sum should be provided from the Exchequer by way of free grant to the Road Fund.  There was no question of that money being raised on the security of the Road Fund or of that money being charged against the Road Fund in any way.  My recollection of this matter is perfectly clear and I have no doubt that, if the documents are examined, what I am saying will be borne out.</P>
    <P>It would be most unfair and unjust to the road users of to-day and to those of the future to mortgage at this stage the revenues of the Road Fund.  As the Minister will ascertain, if he makes inquiries, my then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Childers, and I feared that the future revenues of the Road Fund would not be sufficient to enable us to carry out the programme of road improvement and modernisation which we had in contemplation and which we were planning.  We felt it was essential, since the general tendency will be to make roads the main avenues of landborne traffic in future, that they should be designed in accordance with the most modern principles and designed to carry safely the loads and vehicles, high speed vehicles, which we may anticipate will become the usual mode of conveyance as motor engineering and road engineering develop.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing such a modern road system for our country, a road system which is necessary, not only for the conveyance of passengers safely, but for the conveyance of goods, particularly agricultural produce, expeditiously and securely, would have been very great indeed.  The programme that we envisaged was so extensive that it would take, even to carry out the first instalment of it, a period of from ten to 20 years, and we were worried about how that scheme was going to be financed.  It is quite true that we felt that the motor vehicle <Col N="751" /> duties could be increased substantially Until the Supplementary Budget, they remained at their pre-war level even though, as we have been told so often in the House during the period when he was not in office, by the present Minister for Finance, that the purchasing value of money had declined by 50 per cent.  Therefore, it seemed to us that there was a substantial margin for an increase in the motor vehicle duties which would not impose any undue hardship on road users who were going to secure the benefits of that increased taxation in the shape of modern and safer roads which would not merely enable them to travel with more security but, also, if I may say so, with less cost to themselves in the shape of charges for vehicle maintenance and tyre replacement.</P>
    <P>I was saying that I had persuaded my colleagues in the Government that it would not be fair at that stage to impose as a charge upon the Road Fund the cost of restoring our present roads to what might be regarded as their normal state of repair.  The arguments for that, of course, I think must be patent to everybody.  First of all during the war period it was not possible because of the shortage of materials and the equipment to provide for the normal repair and maintenance of those roads.  That is a condition which arose out of the war and it is a condition I think which should have been met as an expense arising out of the emergency, an expense which would be chargeable to the community as a whole and not to the particular section of it who have to use the roads as a means of livelihood or even as a pleasurable amenity.  The second argument, of course, is this, that during the war period the roads had to carry an abnormal traffic in certain commodities which were necessary for the life of the community as a whole. Again, like the expenditure which has to be incurred in making good the deficiency on normal road maintenance the expenditure on making good the abnormal wear and tear thus arising is an expense which should be chargeable against the community as a whole and not against that particular section <Col N="752" /> of it which was compelled to use the roads.</P>
    <P>For these two reasons, and I think they are compelling reasons, the last Government had decided that whatever moneys might be required to make good the deficiency in the Road Fund in respect to these special works of repair and maintenance should be accepted as a general charge upon the Exchequer.  I regret very much that that decision seems in some danger of being either repudiated&mdash;I am not going to say dishonourably because it was not a decision of our successors, but perhaps I may put it this way&mdash; reversed.  I say in some danger of being reversed by reason of the answer which the Minister gave to me in reply to a question which I put down.  I asked him to state the total amounts he proposed to make available to county councils and other road authorities (a) from the Road Fund, and (b) by special Exchequer grants for the repair and restoration and maintenance of county roads.  The Minister in his reply stated that the final figures were not available but that it was expected that £3,300,000&mdash;he has amended that figure, I think, to £3,450,000 in his statement this evening &mdash;will be made available out of the Road Fund, the income of which will be augmented if necessary by borrowing or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am raising this question in a rather tentative way.  I have read that reply as suggesting that it is proposed to borrow on the security of the Road Fund.  If that is a correct interpretation of the Minister's answer then I can only say that I deplore it.  I hope that having regard to his responsibility for the roads of this country, and his responsibilities to the road users, who contribute to and build up the Road Fund, that he will use his best endeavours with his colleagues, and in particular with the Minister for Finance, to secure a reconsideration of that decision and, if possible, to induce the Minister to make a free grant to enable these essential road works to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I think it would be highly undesirable in the circumstances as I have outlined them,&mdash;and, as I am sure, <Col N="753" /> they will become familiar to the Minister himself if he studies the question&mdash; to mortgage for the purpose of making good this deficiency in road maintenance and repairs the revenues of the Road Fund.  These revenues will be scarcely sufficient to carry the Road Fund if the planning that was taking place when I was in office is to continue under the present Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his statement gave some statistics showing the progress which had been made in tackling the housing programme.  I find some difficulty in talking on this matter, but I have a duty to my Party and to my colleagues in the previous Administration.  I think we will all agree that in the circumstances as they existed last year somebody is to be congratulated on the signal progress which was made in tackling the housing problem in the year 1947-48 as compared with the year 1946-47 and those which went before it.  The Minister told us that for the first time since the year 1941 the figures for that year had been excelled, and went on to say that he thought the downward trend had been reversed and that henceforward more rapid progress would be made.  I do not take any credit for the fact that world conditions have improved and I do not suppose that my successor will take any credit for that fact either.  I can say this, however, that the conditions in this country which make it possible for us to take full advantage of the improvement in world conditions were created and determined by the Fianna Fáil Government when it was in office.  We as the Government were responsible for the successive Housing Acts passed, even during the war, each one of which, I think, represented in its own way some progress during years of acute difficulty, naturally, because of that perhaps, limited and not so extensive as we would like it to have been.  The 1948 Act certainly signalised a very marked advance, and even it, as the Minister must now know, was merely a preliminary to a more comprehensive Housing Act which would codify all previous enactments and which would put us as we were put by the Act of 1932, in the forefront of housing progress the world over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture to-day to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) The quota of bacon authorised by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to be supplied by curers to their customers during the current month, and,</P>
      <P>(ii) the quotas similarly authorised for each of the preceding months since 30th November, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply was in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The authorised quota for the current month is 30 per cent. of the monthly average supplies in the year ended 31st March, 1941.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The quota for the current month is 30 per cent. and that is a figure which, I think, we must note.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The monthly quotas authorised since 30th November, 1947, were: December, 1947, to February, 1948, 40 per cent.; March to May, 1948, 33? per cent....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For the current month, let me remind the House again the quota is 30 per cent of the basic supply, a decline of 10 per cent. on the figure from March to May, 1948, and no less than 30 per cent. on the quota fixed for each of the months from December, 1947, to February, 1948.  The Minister, who has launched a campaign to put more bacon on the breakfast table, certainly found something to explain, or to try to explain, away in these figures, and, of course, the Minister for Agriculture set himself the task.  He proceeded to exculpate himself by adding an addendum to the information which was strictly relevant only by way of apology for his failure to improve the supply of bacon on our breakfast tables.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to fix the current quota was taken while the deplorable situation in the pork and bacon trade bequeathed to the Government by <Col N="756" /> our predecessors was being tackled and it was then impossible to foresee the remarkable degree of success which was to attend the efforts of the officers of my Department, the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the Garda Síochána, but if this should be maintained it is intended substantially to increase the quota next month.</P>
    <P>The first issue which that statement raises is as to when the quota for the current month was fixed and by whom it is fixed.  The plain implication here, of course, is that it is fixed by the Government, and it was perhaps borne out in the evasive reply which the Minister gave to the supplementary question I addressed to him, in which he said that the quotas given by the previous Government were not filled and the current quota of 30 per cent. was substantially greater than the alleged 33? to 40 per cent. stipulated in the years gone by.  I say that, on that reply to my supplementary question, the issue is raised at once as to by whom the bacon quotas are fixed.  The Minister in his supplementary reply wishes the public to infer that the quotas are fixed by the Government as a whole, or, if not by the Government as a whole, by the Minister for Agriculture, who is a member of that Government.  Unless things have changed and he has overriden the statute, the Minister knows as well as I that the quotas are fixed by the Pigs and Bacon Commission and that they are determined by the commission upon information furnished to them from various sources, which they have at their disposal.  It was not the Government, therefore, which fixed this quota in the years gone by.  It was the Pigs and Bacon Commission, unless, as I have said, the Minister has overridden the statute and interfered with the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises is as to when the quotas are fixed.  We are now in the second week of June and I understand the quota for July has not yet been fixed.  I must assume, therefore, and I am justified in firmly believing, that the quota for June was not fixed until the latter half of May, <Col N="757" /> just as the quota for May was not fixed until the latter half of April, and the quota for April was not fixed until the latter half of March.  The principal quotas for which the present Minister must accept the degree of responsibility which the statute imposes upon him, to the extent to which he may be said to be responsible for the operations of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, are those for the period from March to May of 1948 when they were fixed at 33? per cent.  For the current month, let me repeat, the quota is 30 per cent., representing a reduction upon the monthly quotas fixed for the period March to May, 1948.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the reply the Minister gave to my supplementary question and recall its terms to the House again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The quotas given by the previous Government were not filled and the current quota of 30 per cent. was substantially greater than the alleged 33? to 40 per cent. stipulated in the years gone by.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I assume that the Minister's statement refers equally to the monthly quotas fixed for the period March to May, 1948, and those fixed for the period December, 1947, to February, 1948, so that if the Minister intends to stand on the terms of that supplementary reply, what he is telling the House is that he fixed these quotas for some reason or other at a higher figure than in fact he was justified in doing.  Let me repeat&mdash;if the Minister intends to stand on the terms of his reply&mdash;I know, and he knows, that the Pigs and Bacon Commission are supposed to fix these quotas and to fix them on the basis of information which is furnished to them from, no doubt, reliable sources.  Therefore, we see this: That the campaign which was ushered in with the banging of the big drum in those organs of the Press which support the present Government&mdash;the Hibernians beat the big drums as well as the Orangemen, make no mistake about that&mdash;this campaign which was ushered in with such a <i>réclame</i> on 15th April, has proven, so far as the consumers of bacon are concerned and so far as the condition of our breakfast tables is concerned, to be a dismal <Col N="758" /> failure.  In fact, the supply of bacon to the general public has touched a lower level than ever recorded in history.</P>
    <P>Let me say something about this campaign and some of the after effects of it.  The campaign opened on the 15th April with a statement in the newspapers, but particularly in the <i>Irish Independent</i> under the caption &ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture announces a drive against black market bacon.&rdquo; Then there followed a very graphic description of the steps which the Minister proposed to take in order to ensure that the black market in bacon would be ended and that there would be a more plentiful supply of that commodity for the general public.  Reading the Minister's own statement of the details of the campaign which he proposed to wage against the black marketeers recalls to my mind a famous episode in the history of our neighbours when a certain Cabinet Minister marshalled all the forces of the Crown in order to apprehend two wrong-doers.  I know of nothing more apt to apply to the measures which the Minister for Agriculture visualised than a quatrain from the well-known &ldquo;Ballad of Sydney Street&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The gallant chief sent this dispatch out:</P>
    <P>I find pork butchers in arms arrayed,</P>
    <P>So send us on all the other polis</P>
    <P>Likewise, the army and the fire brigade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With all the panoply of war, therefore, the Minister sailed into action against the alleged black marketeers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In April, as is customary at the outbreak of a campaign which has not fully developed, the newspapers&mdash;and particularly those newspapers which support the Minister &mdash;were filled with highly optimistic bulletins as to the progress of the conflict. On April 19th the <i>Irish Independent</i> announced: &ldquo;The Government drive may mean more rashers&rdquo;. On April 22nd, however, it recorded a slight reverse for the Minister.  The <Col N="759" /> Minister had previously disclosed to some people that he was in favour of a free market in bacon and the removal of all control.  But on April 22nd, no doubt inspired by an observer or by a correspondent at headquarters, the <i>Irish Independent</i> announced that bacon control was to stay&mdash;the Minister meets the curers.  And then a very extraordinary position develops, which has not been without its influence upon the present situation because, according to this dispatch, the curers were requested&mdash;requested was the word used by the <i>Irish Independent</i> though I understand that, in effect, what was addressed to the curers was not a request but an order&mdash;not to supply pork to certain elements in the trade because it might find its way to the black market.</P>
      <P>I only want to refer in passing to this newspaper announcement.  Here we have in Dublin a perfectly respectable trade in which there are hundreds of law-abiding citizens engaged, people who observe the laws as strictly as any Minister of Dáil Éireann.  The bacon curers, over whom the Minister for Agriculture has a certain element of control and against whom he can enforce certain coercive measures, are ordered not to supply the members of this trade with the requirements they were customarily used to obtain from the bacon curers of the city and elsewhere; while the trade, as a whole, is branded as a collection of black marketeers.  This was done in order that the Minister might carry out one of the most childish and unsuccessful publicity stunts on which any politician has ever embarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  Deprived of their normal source of supply, the pork butchers of Dublin went into the Dublin market and bought their porkers there and sold them to the public in the ordinary legitimate way of trade.  But, in any event, the Minister's interference did not make any difference to them in that regard.  The Minister's Order did not make any difference to the supply of porkers to the pork trade.  All it did was to put in jeopardy the jobs of employees in certain curing factories where porkers <Col N="760" /> are killed as an ordinary branch of their business.</P>
    <P>What happened then?  We have been told that this Government was out to remove control and to restore liberty of trade.  The pork butchers, having to go into the market and having to pay whatever prices were necessary there in order to secure their supplies were, I understand, paying higher prices than the officers of the Minister thought justified.  I am told that some time in the early hours of this morning a squad of Gardaí accompanied by those officials, whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce has inelegantly and incorrectly described as &ldquo;pip squeaks&rdquo;, and others raided the Dublin market and seized the books of every buyer whom they regarded as paying too high a price for pigs.  The only comment I would make on that, if I had it available, is a quotation from an appeal for funds which was issued by the present Minister for Education, then Chairman of the Fine Gael Party, in which he pledged himself that, if he were returned to power, there would be less interference with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Then, what happened?  On April 22nd, a statement appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yesterday bacon began to flow into the shops of Dublin traders for the first time for several months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was followed by a graphic and tantalising description of the suddenly released bacon that must have made many a mouth water.  It was in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Most of it was quite excellent, smoked, dried and hard, indicating that it had been seasoning for a considerable period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All of it was non-existent bacon, however, because when the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> were written to and requested by a certain number of people to furnish them with information as to where this hard, smoked, dried bacon of excellent quality could be secured these papers could not tell them.</P>

      <P>A number of people addressed letters to the <i>Evening Herald</i>, one of which I propose to quote as a sample:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Some weeks ago your paper gave a considerable amount of prominence to Mr. James Dillon's efforts to wipe out the black market in bacon and you went so far as to say that his efforts had succeeded to such an extent that the shops in Dublin City had now stocks of bacon which they had not got previous to the Minister's activities.  This statement was, however, contrary to the facts and the mystery of the bacon scarcity gets deeper and deeper.  For several days your paper gave glowing accounts of the stern action being taken by Mr. Dillon spreading terror amongst the black marketeers and, as a result bacon suddenly appearing on the shop counters.  The Minister for Agriculture may have been extraordinarily active and some shops may have been closed down, but the cold fact remains that in so far as the public are concerned the position has become infinitely worse.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This campaign has been carried on in order to persuade the general public that there has been an improvement in the bacon supply position in this country.  On the contrary, there has not been, and I make bold to make this prophesy that, if the activities of the Minister continue&mdash;his misdirected and ill-judged activities&mdash; there will be less bacon next month and less bacon in the succeeding months, because the one thing the Minister is doing is to drive the farmers out of pigs and to deprive the Irish consumer of any prospect of getting Irish bacon in the future.</P>

      <P>Let the rights and wrongs of this matter be determined by whether Deputy MacEntee's prophesy in regard to supplies of bacon next month as compared with this month are proved to be right or proved to be wrong.  If Deputy MacEntee be right, then I am not fit for my position here.  But, if <Col N="762" /> Deputy MacEntee is proved wrong, will he apologise here for the attitude he has seen fit to adopt?  Let me assure the Deputy that his protestations on behalf of the poor individual who can no longer bring pork carcases from rural Ireland into this city will not protect the individual who briefed him for to-night's proceedings.  If I can get the man who brought pork carcases into this city and sold them to black marketeers who cut them up and put them into pickle in the pork butchers' shops, I will do all that a prosecution will permit me to do to clap him in Mountjoy Jail and keep him there.</P>
      <P>The facts are that when I became responsible for the Department of Agriculture I found in progress in this city an open, defiant and rampant black market in pork.  I found that the illegal curing of pork was being carried on openly and in circumstances into which I may not go in detail now, because the facts connected with this matter are <i>sub judice,</i> but every detail will be described in the criminal court in the course of the next eight days, because during the next eight days every one of these gentlemen will be prosecuted in the criminal court&mdash; every one of them&mdash;and I venture to prophesy that the members of this House will be astonished when they discover the condition of affairs which I was called upon to deal with when I came into office.</P>
      <P>They will be more astonished if they reflect on this for a moment.  How is it that, within 48 hours of going into office, I discovered these facts, while my predecessor in office, who had been 12 months there, if he knew about them did not appear to be doing anything about them?  I have made it a rule since I sat in these benches not to carp at or criticise what my predecessor in office has done.  When challenged about the specific actions of my predecessor I have on more than one occasion here said that, doubtless, he did what in the circumstances he thought was best, but that when I came into office I would take another course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I am going to draw the attention of the House to this.  Where is Deputy Smith and where is Deputy <Col N="763" /> Lemass?  Did either of them raise this matter in the House to-night?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You can bet they did not raise it, and I am going to tell the House why.  What led up to the situation I have had to grapple with was that the bacon curers were summoned by the Department of Industry and Commerce and there told by the Minister responsible at the time&mdash; Deputy Lemass&mdash;that they must adhere to the maximum price fixed by him for bacon.  Within the same week they were summoned by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;Deputy Smith&mdash;and they were told that they must continue to cure pigs or lose their licences.  When the attention of Deputy Smith was directed to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had fixed 200/- as the price for bacon and that pigs were costing 210/- on the public market, Deputy Smith's reply was that that was none of his business and that if they did not go on curing pigs he would not renew their licences.  The curers got caught between the upper and nether millstones of two Ministers of the same administration and in that situation Deputies saw the price of pigs going up to 230/- per cwt.</P>

    <P>Who was buying them and who was selling them?  Did the responsible Ministers ever inquire how you could buy pork in the Dublin market at a price substantially higher than the fixed price for pork and the fixed price for bacon and still sell the pork and the bacon at the fixed price?  They knew it could not be done, but what was worse is that they knew it was not being done and, knowing that they deliberately refrained from taking the steps that they were bound to take by their undertakings when they took office in an Irish Government, to see that the law of this House was enforced.  The difference between them and me, and the measure of my offending in Deputy MacEntee's eyes, is that I took the undertaking I gave, when I took my seals of office, seriously and, regarding myself not as the master of our people but as their servant, I carried out the instructions our people gave through Oireachtas Éireann.  I carried out the <Col N="764" /> law and I told those who proposed to offend against it that whoever they were, big or little, if they fell foul of the law they would be made answerable to that law, and even the individual amongst them who briefed the Deputy to-night will be made answerable to the full letter of the law if I can catch him.</P>

      <P>I would like to describe to the House the circumstances in which the illegal curing was carried on, but that I cannot do because these matters are <i>sub judice.</i>  But the House will read of them and I will return to them when the courts have had their say.  It is true, I am happy to think, that the disgusting operations that were proceeding in this city a month ago are now pretty satisfactorily brought under control.  It is true that those who thought they could set the law of this State in defiance have now discovered that for such people there is no protection while this Government is in office.  It is true that there will be more bacon available next month than there is this month. It is true that the number of pigs going into the factories is rising&mdash;a thing it had not done for 18 months before. It is true that there is no one illegally curing bacon in Dublin now.  It is true that during the last three months more bacon was being delivered to those who were entitled to get it than was being delivered to them six months ago.  It is true that in the months of January and February bacon wholesalers in this city, whose people have been in the trade for over 100 years, got no bacon at all.  There is not a wholesaler in Dublin of whom that can be said now. They get their quota the same as the rest.</P>

      <P>In regard to the retail shops, if there is any shopkeeper in Ireland who does not receive the last ounce of bacon to which he is entitled under the datum quota, if the Deputy representing him or he himself will address a complaint to me he will get his bacon or I will know the reason why.  It is true that for the two or three months before we came into office a great many small retailers in this country were ruthlessly brushed aside and given nothing at all, that others got a part of the quota apportioned to them and that, in fact, general chaos obtained in the trade.  It is true that that will happen no longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say this.  It has been suggested that some body of citizens were called to my Department and there given orders.  No member of this Government has ever laboured under the illusion that we are the masters of the people.  We belong to that old-fashioned class that take pride <Col N="766" /> in the title of being the servants of the people.  It is true that the bacon curers waited on my Department, and the vast majority of them, being honest and honourable men, once they were reassured it was the Government's intention to enforce the law and see justice done between them, decided to from themselves into a voluntary vigilance body, and I am glad to say that since that was done they voluntarily, amongst themselves, have ensured that the regulations are being enforced, and any attempt to depart from that has been reported to me for appropriate correction.  Those are the facts as they are.  Later, when the courts have dealt with these matters, I will give fuller and more dramatic details, but I reserve that for another occasion.</P>
