      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that there are 62,000 native Irish speakers in Donegal alone; and, if so, whether he proposes to have primary school certificate examination papers set in Ulster Irish for Ulster children in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are a substantial number of native Irish speakers in County Donegal. It would not, in my opinion, be in the best interests of the preservation and the wider use of the language to accentuate dialectic differences by setting a special version of examination papers for a particular area as suggested. To do so would, in fact, be to deny what I am not prepared to deny, that is, the perfect unity of the language as it is spoken throughout the Irish-speaking districts generally. It would be to accept as the mark of mere dialectic differences qualities which, on the contrary, mark the richness and the flexibility of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2442" /> It is true that owing to a long period in which the language was not generally used for literature and writing certain differences in use became exaggerated and create a difficulty for young persons and for those who do not speak the language normally.</P>
    <P>It has, therefore, been the practice in setting papers for the primary school certificate examination to lean to some extent towards basing the paper in Irish as far as possible on the trends of expression in one of each of three fairly well defined districts in consecutive years.  When it is considered necessary alternate words and phrases in more general use in the other two districts are given in parenthesis on the paper.</P>
    <P>This practice is considered to meet adequately the difficulties of the moment, which are only temporary, and, at the same time, to foster the development of the language and to lead to the natural adoption of common forms which would render more practicable the achievement of that development.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that Press reports of the proceedings of the United States House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on January 12th do not quote Mr. Willard Thorpe, United States UnderSecretary of State, as having made the statement attributed to him by the Minister during the Dáil debates on July 1st; that Mr. Thorpe is reported to have said that certain countries, including Ireland, were not expected to ask for grants, and that he is not reported as having expressed any view on the probable decision on an application for a grant by this country; further, whether he is aware that, subsequently, a statement issued by the United States Information Service in London on January 19th indicated that Ireland would probably receive under the Marshall Plan supplies of named commodities equivalent to 1947 imports; finally, whether he is aware that an announcement was made by the United States State Department <Col N="2443" /> in Washington on January 20th that Ireland would get £37,950,000 from the United States of America in the first 15 months of the operation of the Plan; and, if so, whether he is prepared to correct any misunderstanding which may have been caused by his statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to statements made by him in the Dáil on the 1st July, 1948, (Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 111, No. 14, Cols. 2014, 2015 and 2073) and in the <i>Irish Press</i> on various dates, to the effect that no suggestion had been made before the change of Government that European recovery programme aid by way of grant would not be available to Ireland and to my statements that these allegations were incorrect and misleading.  The following are the facts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Mr. Willard Thorpe, United States Assistant Secretary of State, stated in evidence before the United States House of Foreign Affairs Committee on the 12th January, 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ireland, in our calculations, might have some assistance, but it would be in the form of loan and not in the form of a grant.&rdquo;  (Pages 59 and 60 of the House Official Reports.)</P>
      <P>The full text of Mr. Willard Thorpe's evidence is published in the Official Reports of the United States House. On the 14th January, a copy of the full official text of Mr. Willard Thorpe's evidence, containing that passage, was sent by my Department to the Department of which Deputy Lemass was, at that time, Minister, with a covering letter drawing attention to this passage of Mr. Willard Thorpe's evidence.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Irish newspapers of January 13th carried a summary of Mr. Thorpe's evidence.  The <i>Irish Press</i> carried that summary, on its front page under a three-column heading, reading as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;LOAN TO IRELAND IN MARSHALL PLAN, GRANT NOT NEEDED.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(3)  On the following day the <i>Irish Independent</i>, under the heading:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="2444" />&ldquo;ÉIRE NEVER MADE CASE FOR U.S. GRANT,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>stated on its main news page:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No surprise was created in Dublin by the statement by Mr. Thorpe, Assistant Secretary of State, before the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Éire was not expected to ask for grants and would be able to finance her own rehabilitation through loans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was not controverted on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>(4)  By reason of the evidence of Mr. Willard Thorpe, referred to above, on the 16th January a memorandum was handed to the American Minister on behalf of the then Minister for External Affairs (Deputy de Valera) referring to this evidence and advancing arguments against Mr. Thorpe's evidence. A copy of this memorandum was sent to the Deputy's Department for his information.</P>
    <P>(5)  On the 14th January a report was published in the <i>New York Times</i> stating that Ireland had been classified as a country that would receive aid by way of loan only, and not by way of grant.  The attention of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce (Deputy Lemass) was directed to this report and a copy of it was supplied to his Department.</P>
    <P>(6)  The statement referred to by the Deputy, stated to have been issued by the United States Information Service in London, on the 19th January, related solely to the quantities of commodities that were likely to be made available under the Marshall Plan.  It contained no suggestion that those commodities would be financed by way of grant.</P>
    <P>(7)  The announcement referred to by the Deputy as having been made by the United States State Department in Washington on January 20th, stated expressly: &ldquo;no estimate as between loans and grants has been established&rdquo; and that the method of financing could not then be indicated.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is clear beyond doubt that the Deputy made statements that were incorrect and misleading in the Dail, when he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  It was a surprise to the whole <Col N="2445" /> Irish people and a particular surprise to us, who had previous contact with the administration of official business, when the Minister announced, prior to his departure to the United States, that grant aid would not be forthcoming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  I say, however, that up to the day we left office no suggestion had been made that grant aid would not be forthcoming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing facts, I trust that the Deputy will now admit that he was mistaken and withdraw the statements made by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Government was informed that Mr. Thorpe, in his statement before the United States House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, had misread his instructions and that nothing that he said was to be taken as indicating that a decision had been taken by the American authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  I am aware that the Deputy has made statements to the effect that no suggestion had been made before he left office that Ireland might receive aid otherwise than by grant.  I have now proved that the Deputy had full information showing that that suggestion had been made, not once but repeatedly.  It had been published in the American Press; it had been published in his own newspaper and in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I now ask the Deputy to withdraw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if the question of Partition was raised at the recent London talks with members of the British Government and if he is in a position to state whether any progress has been made towards its abolition, and further, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent negotiations in London were concerned solely with trade matters, and the question of Partition was not within their scope. The question of Partition was, however, raised informally at the recent talks with members of the British Government. From the point of view of definite results, I cannot say that any tangible progress was made.  The urgency and importance of the problem was impressed upon the British Ministers, and, in so far as it is necessary that the British Government should have a clear understanding of the importance and urgency of ending Partition, I feel that progress was made.</P>
      <P>I sincerely trust that these discussions will ensure a better understanding of our viewpoint and thus bring about a realisation that the continued division of our country against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of its people is not merely contrary to the principles of democracy and to the right of national self-determination, but a hindrance to the friendly relationship that should exist between our two islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the House, I have indicated that, if this State is a drain on the resources of the United States or of the sterling area reserve, it is, in the <Col N="2447" /> main, due to the unnatural division of our country.  Inversely, I should now like to take this opportunity of pointing out in all friendliness to our fellow-country men and women in the Six Counties that, if they are undergoing shortages and experiencing high taxation, it is also due to the fact that they are cut off from the rest of Ireland. The truth of the matter is that both portions of our country are economically complementary to each other.  The Six County area has an adverse trade balance, varying from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000 annually, with us; on the other hand, it secures little or no advantageous return for its not inconsiderable overseas exports.  The integration of our economies would enable a reduction in their taxation and would overcome many of the serious food shortages they now undergo.  Their industrial and business genius would find increased and welcomed scope in our midst.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to give assurances that the rights of minorities would be safeguarded in the event of Partition being ended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question on Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our Constitution, full and adequate safeguards are rigidly imposed to protect the religious and political minorities that may exist, but in so far as it might be suggested that these are inadequate to safeguard the views of any of our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties, I think I can say, not merely on my own behalf but on behalf of any Irish Government, that we would be prepared to give them any other additional rights and guarantees that were reasonably required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the farm of Mr. Thomas Varley, situate at Ballinalecka, Loughaphuil, Castlebar, <Col N="2449" /> has been sublet for a number of years past, and has recently been sold by private treaty to Mr. Irwin; that there are a number of uneconomic holders in Ballinalecka and that the division of this farm would solve the local congestion problem; and, if so, whether he will forthwith take steps to acquire this farm for the relief of congestion in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have no proceedings for the acquisition of the lands of Thomas Varley at Ballinalecka, Drumneen Beg and Coguala.</P>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report to the effect that the farm of Thomas Varley, situated at Ballinalecka, has been sold.  According to my information, the purchaser, Michael Joseph Irwin, is one of the younger members of a family of 12.  His parents reside on a small uneconomic holding. Consequently he, together with most of his brothers and sisters, had to emigrate to Great Britain.  Michael Joseph Irwin emigrated to England about 12 years ago.  He worked in coal mining, in agriculture, and latterly had risen to be superintendent in open cast coal mining in Wales.  He returned to this country about six months ago, where he resided with his parents until he purchased this holding.</P>
      <P>The two lowest poor law valuations within a radius of one mile of this holding are £9 each.</P>
      <P>The policy of the present Government is to welcome back all those who have had to emigrate through no fault of their own and to facilitate them as far as possible in settling down here. The Deputy's question appears to suggest that if it is not criminal it is at least wrong for any of our emigrants to return and settle down here, a view with which I completely disagree, and consequently I have not the slightest intention of acceding to the request contained in the latter part of the Deputy's question, because such a policy would mean permanently exiling many of our emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen any suggestion in my question that emigrants should be prevented from purchasing <Col N="2450" /> land here.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my reply has made the position perfectly clear.  The young man in question was, through no fault of himself or his parents, compelled to emigrate.

      <P>(a) I am aware that a request was made to my Department by the Government Employees' Federation in November, 1946, to have the wages of certain employees of the Ordnance Survey Office paid weekly instead of twice monthly.  The Federation was informed that, as this was a purely departmental matter, it should, under existing arrangements for staff representations, be taken up directly with the Ordnance Survey Office;</P>
      <P>(b) The Ordnance Survey Staff Association acted accordingly and in January, 1948, they informed the Director of Ordnance Survey that they agreed to the basis of payment set out in the question;</P>
      <P>I am not aware of (c);</P>
      <P>(d) The departure suggested by the association from the general procedure governing the payment of annual salaries was found impracticable.  As an alternative it has been decided to substitute weekly rates of pay for the annual rates now paid to the technical assistant grade in the office.  My Department expects to reach agreement with the association on the converted rates of pay at an early date.  Provided there is agreement, there will be little delay in changing over to a weekly basis of payment.</P>

However, as the Deputy may or may not be aware, we have been working on a decision with regard to the most necessary projects which must be carried out during the next seven years, taking the existing shortages of materials and labour into consideration.  Also we have had to consider certain reorganisation proposals with regard <Col N="2462" /> to tuberculosis facilities generally and accommodation in regional sanatoria generally.  In view of these considerations, Shane Sanatorium will take a possibly different part in the whole of the sanatoria and tuberculosis programme in the country, and until we have finally come to our conclusions in this regard we cannot sanction all the proposals submitted by local authorities.

      <P>Allowances under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948, may be paid only to persons to whom Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, applies.

      <P>It is inevitable, for geographical and other reasons, that diagnosis and treatment centres for tuberculosis, of which there are 11 in County Kerry, are at a considerable distance from the homes of some persons suffering from the disease but I have no evidence that the county medical officer of health for Kerry is unreasonable in requiring the attendance of patients at such centres or in the administration, so far as he is concerned, of the regulations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last night I was referring to the work carried out by the Minister during the past four months and the statement made by him on this Estimate.  It is reassuring to see that he has faced this problem of restoring the health of the nation by means of a long-term plan in the matter of providing hospitals and health services.  He proposes to provide approximately £15,000,000 over the next seven years.  It will be agreed that that is a determined effort <Col N="2466" /> towards preserving the health of the nation.  The health of a nation is its wealth.  In this Estimate I see that the Minister intends in the years to come to provide another 135 hospitals throughout the country.  I am in agreement with these proposals, because we have viewed with concern in years past the serious lack of hospital accommodation, not alone general hospital accommodation, but sanatorium accommodation. I notice that his plan will be guided by the availibility of building materials and the labour that will be needed to erect these hospitals.  I am glad that he is also planning for suitable extensions to various hospitals where such extensions can be provided.</P>
      <P>In my constituency we have Peamount Sanatorium and I know that there are plans under way whereby the number of patients who will be treated there will be very considerably increased. There is also in my constituency Lourdes Home, Dún Laoghaire. These two sanatoria are famous in this country for the manner in which they have treated tuberculosis patients.  The conditions have been as near as possible to ideal.  The accommodation, however, as in practically every hospital in the country, has not been sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Estimate also the Minister has provided for the treatment of cancer cases.  The figures, apparently, show a slight reduction in the number of cancer cases, particularly during the past 12 months.  It is unfortunate that, although there are clinics for the purpose of combating this disease, no radical cure for it has yet been discovered. Very effective methods of prevention, however, appear to be well in hands amongst the medical profession and we can only hope that the Minister will provide money for the purpose of discovering whether a cure for this dreadful disease can be found. Treatment in the early stages has, apparently, been effective in many cases.  I notice in the Estimate that rheumatism was not referred to at any great length.  Considering that we, in Éire, have a climate which is inclined to cause rheumatism I should like to see greater attention devoted to the methods adopted for the purpose of <Col N="2467" /> combating this ailment.  I suppose that, besides climate, the question of diet also arises.  These clinics could direct persons inclined to be affected by rheumatism in the matter of diet. Tuberculosis, which might be termed a national disease, shows in its statistics an increase in the number of affected cases in the past 12 months.  Although these statistics show an increase, I would not be inclined to believe that the disease was more rampant last year than it was in the previous 12 months.  I am rather inclined to the view that the people are becoming more health conscious as a result of the publicity campaign which has been carried on and which the Minister proposes to intensify in the years to come. It seems an extraordinary fact that there are only something over 3,000 beds available in this country for the purpose of treating persons affected by tuberculosis, especially when it is so common in families, whether they be in the city or in the country.  We know that time and treatment will cure this disease provided that it has not gone too far.  That is why it is reassuring to know that the Minister proposes to take a very determined step towards detecting this disease in its early stages so that the people affected can be cured within a reasonable period of time.  Many considerations, especially those of a financial nature, arise in the case of a person who is affected by tuberculosis.  We know ourselves that when a person is affected by tuberculosis it is probable that it will be one year, two years or perhaps even three years before the doctor can certify that that individual has completely recovered from the disease. When the individual or his family discovers that the disease has got its grip they are inclined to hesitate when faced with the necessity of going to hospital because of the long period of treatment and because there is the possibility that they will not be able to finance it.  For that reason, I am with the Minister when he advocates schemes whereby tuberculosis sufferers will not be faced with that dilemma.  A move has been made in that respect by the provision of an allowance for those <Col N="2468" /> who have been affected by tuberculosis and who have not been able to go back to their normal employment.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary fact that in the County Dublin and in the Dublin sanatoria, apart altogether from the general hospitals of the city, people who are affected by tuberculosis are coming there for treatment from every part of Ireland.  There are more people from the country in these hospitals than there are from Dublin or County Dublin.  I am glad, therefore, that the Minister proposes to treat this matter on a regional basis&mdash; he proposes to provide a sanatorium in the West of Ireland for West of Ireland people and in the South of Ireland for South of Ireland people.</P>
    <P>There is another view to be taken in the matter so far as tuberculosis is concerned.  We must realise that those who are affected by tuberculosis are very sick and that they have, perhaps, lost their appetites.  At the present time, however, in most of the sanatoria and hospitals the methods of cooking and distributing the food are not as good as they might be when it comes to giving food to a sick person who finds it difficult to eat even what would be palatable.  Therefore, I would urge upon the Minister, so far as his Department is concerned, to insist on better arrangements in those sanatoria and hospitals for the provision of food.</P>
    <P>There are farms also in connection with many of the sanatoria in charge of which there are farm managers.  Unfortunately, in many cases the farm manager is not all that might be desired. He does not seem to grow the proper class or a sufficiency of vegetables. I know of several sanatoria where the class of potatoes grown cannot compare with the potatoes grown by those who know the business. This is a national question.  In view of the fact that State money is concerned I am anxious that the Minister should consider it his duty to see that, besides the provision of proper medical assistance in those hospitals, conditions in general are improved.</P>
    <P>During the course of his statement on the Estimate the Minister referred to the infant death rate in this country. <Col N="2469" /> It seems to be approximately 7 per cent.  I should like to point out that in Northern Ireland and Scotland the infant death rate is approximately 5.5 per cent. and that in England and Wales the infant death rate is approximately 4 per cent.  There must be some reason why the infant death rate in Éire is nearly double the infant death rate in Britain.  One would imagine that, as that is a very populous country, the conditions there would not be as good as they are here in Ireland as regards fresh air and climate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be the Irish food, Deputy.  What I am trying to point out is that there must be some reason why the infant death rate in Ireland is nearly twice as great as it is in England.  If we consider that the food in Ireland is as good as the food in Britain it follows that it must be the hospital methods.  We have in this country perhaps a world-famous hospital&mdash;the Rotunda Hospital.  Naturally, all maternity cases cannot be treated there.  In that respect it would seem desirable that the Minister should provide better facilities throughout the country so that the greatest possible number of persons can avail of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Minister referred to a sum of £6,000 for which he proposes to ask for the purpose of a publicity campaign.  So far as the Irish nation is concerned, an expenditure of £6,000 towards improving the health of the people would be better spent than £60,000 used in advertising our air services in other countries.  As well as the ordinary channels of publicity through the Press, the radio and the films, I would impress upon the Minister the need for taking steps to make the people health conscious. They should be educated to realise that if they suffer physical disabilities trained medical practitioners are available competent to deal with their particular complaints and that they should avail of the services of these practitioners <Col N="2470" /> at the earliest moment.  It is well known that there are certain classes of people who try to hide from their neighbours and, perhaps, from the local doctor, the fact that they suffer from tuberculosis or some other ailment.  It is to their own disadvantage to hide these things.  I think that if the Minister encouraged publicity with the object of making people health conscious and instilling into them the fact that there are practitioners who can cure them of their ailments it would be to the advantage of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, adverted to the fact that every hospital in the country is running at a loss at the present time.  He said that the interest from the Hospitals Trust Fund meets the annual deficit.  The danger is that it may prove difficult in the future to avail to any considerable extent of the moneys we are getting from the Hospitals Trust Fund at the present time.  The amount has been increased this year to almost double what was formerly granted; it has been increased to something like £340,000. I feel that, with the new plans the Minister has in mind, that £340,000 will go merely towards the adjusting of the losses of these hospitals rather than towards the provision of amenities in them.</P>
    <P>In all our hospitals we have probationer nurses and trained nurses. Were it not for the fact that the majority of our nurses voluntarily undertake this training purely as a vocation we would not at the moment have any nurses at all.  The conditions, the hours of duty and the rates of pay prevailing at the moment would not entice anybody into this profession. Those who undertake the work do it purely as a vocation.  Nursing is a very important national service and it is only right that in the future conditions should be such as would encourage our young girls to take up this career in which they would engage in the important task of maintaining the health of our nation.  I think, too, that some scheme should be inaugurated whereby nurses who leave immediately after their training has been completed would receive a gratuity, while those who continue on <Col N="2471" /> in the profession would receive a pension at the end of their labours.</P>
    <P>In some areas the dispensaries are situated in very unsuitable localities. Populous areas are sometimes very far removed from the actual dispensary.  I know two places in County Dublin where that is so.  Those who wish to visit the dispensary are faced with a very long journey.  At the present moment, too, people are not able to avail of the services provided for them because the numbers requiring treatment are greater than the capacity of the dispensaries and the staff to meet them.</P>
    <P>There is a medical inspection scheme in operation in our schools.  If our school buildings are not improved I do not think there will be any improvement in the health of the children despite the carrying out of regular medical inspections.  The staff at present available for this work is not sufficient to enable an individual examination except perhaps once in every three or four years.  Dental care is also provided in our schools.  Early care of children's teeth will have its result in later years.  Dental care is one of the best methods of ensuring good health.  The Minister stated also that a scheme for after-care when the children leave school is under consideration. That is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to boarded-out children.  An allowance of 9/- per week is made for each boarded-out child.  It must be admitted that 9/- per week at the present time could scarcely enable foster parents to provide adequately for these children.  An allowance of £4 or £5 per year is made in respect of clothing.  Such a sum might possibly provide a certain amount of clothing for a very young child but it is of very little use for a child of ten, 12 or 14 years of age.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of increasing these allowances.  I have been informed by some of the teachers in our schools that these boarded-out children are supposed to be a certain age but it is very obvious to the teachers that in many instances the children are either younger or older than the age stated.  I think it is desirable <Col N="2472" /> that some method should be adopted whereby the correct age of a child could be ascertained.  Finally, I think that all prospective foster parents should be interviewed for the purpose of ascertaining why they wish to take these children.  If it is merely done in order to augment the weekly income I think it is undesirable.  These children should be boarded-out under the best possible conditions and if they are taken more or less on a speculative basis it can hardly be to their advantage in the long run.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success during the coming year and success in the tremendous task which he has undertaken. If he succeeds in improving our health services and our hospitals the health of the nation must improve. If our health services are made more easily available to the people in the future that will be to the advantage of the nation.</P>

A number of the Deputies who have spoken in this debate are members of public bodies and local authorities who have been very negligent in their duties to the people they represent on those bodies.</P>
      <P>I speak for one of the largest counties in Ireland, and there tuberculosis is definitely on the downward trend.  Most people here quote statistics which would go to show that tuberculosis is increasing, but I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that that disease is on the downward trend in my county.  That is due to the fact that we have erected in Galway county a sanatorium second to none.  We were prepared to go to the expense and we must express appreciation of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, as it was when we started the work&mdash;it later became the Department of Public Health&mdash;for facilitating us in every way so that we could go ahead with the work and establish that sanatorium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public bodies have not been doing their duty in this respect, and without <Col N="2473" /> the co-operation and the determination or a public authority behind it, the Department will always find itself in a hopeless position.  Quite recently we handed over to the Minister portion of the mental hospital in Castlerea.  We handed over to him a building we had erected for patients who, in their own way, are equally as deserving of first-class treatment as the type of patients who are going into it now.  We had that building to hand over because the local authorities there were anxious to help patients suffering from mental disease.  I think the Minister will agree that if every other local authority in Ireland worked in the same way as the Galway County Council to overcome those diseases and assist the people suffering from them, we would not to-day be regarding tuberculosis as on the upward trend. There are Deputies who have been throwing bouquets at the Minister and forgetting that they are themselves negligent in their duty to the people they represent.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that helps more than anything else to spread all sorts of diseases, not alone tuberculosis.  We have dance halls all over the country and the lavatory accommodation in these halls is a disgrace to the countryside. The Minister would be well advised to take steps immediately to see that wherever there is a dance hall there should be proper sanitary accommodation. Such accommodation as is available in these halls is purely disease breeding.  These places are little better than holes and corners.  The authorities should see that proper sanitary accommodation is provided before any dance hall is given a licence.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed at the Minister's statement recently regarding the conditions of county homes and I was particularly amazed at one portion of his statement when he said that soup is being dished out three times a day.  I think we are entitled to hear from him the names of the counties in which such county homes are situated.  If that is the position in any county, then the local authority concerned is falling down on its responsibility and it is not making any effort to do the things it was elected to do for the poorer <Col N="2474" /> and more delicate sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan delivered a very valuable speech here the other night. One of the things he had in mind when he was Minister for Health was free treatment for the poorer sections of the community.  That is one of the things that should be insisted upon. You have, not merely in towns but in the country as well, poor people who cannot afford to pay for hospital treatment, to pay a doctor to look after them once, twice or three times a week, or to pay for a nurse if they have not got people capable of looking after them in their own homes.  Of course, in these circumstances, those unfortunate people will be neglected.  The legislation which Deputy Dr. Ryan put through the House contains provisions which cater for the poorer sections in so far as free medical treatment is concerned. The present Minister should put those provisions into operation immediately.  Then there is another section of the community who may be slightly better off but still they are not in a position to pay for hospital treatment and in their case, too, free hospital treatment should be provided.</P>
    <P>When he came into office the present Minister found at his disposal legislation which will enable him to go as far as he wants to go in getting rid of a lot of the worries and troubles that are experienced in connection with different diseases.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House have been criticising Fianna Fáil for not having done more, but they should recollect that when the Public Health Bill was introduced they held up its passage through the Dáil and very little effort was made by them to assist the Government in enacting this very necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to dispensaries.  I have in mind the town of Tuam, and any patient who has to go to the dispensary there would become sick at the door if he or she was not sick already.  There should be a proper dispensary erected in Tuam.  A new dispensary is urgently required there. The present building is a sort of hole in the wall; it is not at all a proper <Col N="2475" /> place in which to give the attention that patients require.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's publicity campaign, a lot of the money he is expending on it could be saved if public authorities undertook to stand up to their duties.  It rests with the local authorities to co-operate with the Minister and his Department.  Without their co-operation any Minister's efforts would be rather hopeless.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the pleas that have come from all sides of the House on behalf of the nursing profession.  Nursing is the Cinderella of all the professions.  It has been left out in the cold all the time.  On almost every Estimate that is submitted here one hears Deputies making a plea for some of the persons concerned in carrying out the work that ordinarily comes under that Estimate.  The grievances which they wish to ventilate are, no doubt, important, but I respectfully suggest they are always small in comparison with the grievances of members of the nursing profession.  In the first place&mdash;and this is the most important point at the present moment&mdash;there is the question of the salaries paid to nurses.  I can only describe the salaries paid to nurses for the excellent work they do as ridiculous and I suggest to the Minister that he must make arrangements very soon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must make arrangements very soon to ensure that the salaries of all categories of nurses throughout Ireland are increased by at least 50 per cent.  If that is not done and done soon, the Minister is merely proposing to waste £14,750,000 in the building of hospitals and £6,000 on publicity.  Unless our nurses are sufficiently remunerated there will be no staffs available for these buildings, as all our nurses will go to Britain, as indeed many of them are going at present, where they can obtain conditions which are far superior to those prevailing here.  It is not just a question of a slight difference in conditions.  The conditions are far <Col N="2476" /> superior in Britain, and we shall have to increase the salaries of all categories of nurses, including midwives, if we want to keep them here.  In particular I want to refer to the excellent work done by public health nurses in return for the very small salaries which they receive&mdash;£307 each.  I do not know how they can exist on it.</P>
      <P>Reference has also been made to the proposed pension scheme for nurses. That is no doubt a very difficult problem.  Most members of the House will know that the former Minister was engaged in trying to introduce a pension scheme of some sort for nurses with the co-operation of the nurses' organisation.  I understand that the scheme has been deferred for the present pending the introduction of social welfare schemes, but I want to appeal to the Minister to expedite as far as possible the introduction of such a pension scheme for nurses generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes to give wide publicity to the campaign against tuberculosis and I think all sections of the House will agree with the suggestion which he has made in that connection.  Cream milk is an essential food for people generally, especially for the young, and I think adequate precautions are taken in most cases to ensure that milk supplies reach the consumer in proper condition.  At all events the Minister has the necessary powers to see that that is done. Tuberculosis is a disease that is generally spread by infection, and that infection can be caused by contact with persons suffering from the disease. That is one cause, amongst various others, for the spread of the disease and every avenue should be explored to ensure that, as far as possible, precautions are taken not merely with regard to milk but in regard to other foodstuffs and in regard to another beverage that seems to be more popular in recent years with adults, a beverage of a different colour.  I do not know if any Deputy who has yet spoken has drawn attention to that fact.  I wonder how many Deputies are aware, or even if the Minister himself is aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a possible source of danger in the spread of this disease in the conditions of sale of another beverage that seems to be even more popular, as I have said, than milk&mdash;that is the sale of porter and stout.  I do not know if all Deputies are aware or if the Minister is aware of the fact that in a great many public houses the sale of drink could possibly be a source of danger to the consuming public.  The sale of drink can be a possible source of danger to the consuming public.  It is the practice in a great many public houses to empty the glasses of all their customers&mdash;those who suffer from tuberculosis, from cancer and other diseases&mdash;into a pan at the back of the pumps that ornament the counters of public houses.  That is then doled out to the consuming public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Never, thank God, and never will.  I would not like to see a dog drinking it.  It is supposed to be sent back, and it is allowed by the brewers, if it is sent back, but it is not sent back. and I draw the Minister's special attention to the matter. If he has not got the necessary powers of inspection, the sooner he acquires them and makes sure that he inspects public houses as well as he inspects dairy farms, the better.  While drinking is as widespread as it is and while these conditions obtain, we are wasting £15,000,000 of public money, because this is one of the chief sources of the spread of the disease.  If the disease has been spreading in recent years, the increase is running parallel with the increase in the consumption of liquor. I am not a pussyfoot; I do not object to any man taking a drink, nor do I mind any man enjoying himself, but at the same time&mdash;it is not a very popular <Col N="2478" /> thing to get up here and speak on this subject, because we all know the influence which these gentlemen who sell that product possess in the country and there are few Deputies who will do so &mdash;I think it our duty to expose a scandal of that nature when we see it operating in the country.</P>
      <P>Good food and good clothing are essential to a healthy people, particularly children.  If children are not supplied with good food and clothing, we cannot expect them to grow up healthy men and women.  At the same time, we have experience of cases of tuberculosis occurring in families where lack of proper food or clothing could scarcely be said to be the cause of the disease.  As I stated earlier, in such cases the disease may be attributable to contact with people suffering from it.  There are many sources of infection for the youth of the country, and particularly dance halls, for which Deputy Davin would use a bulldozer. I do not think it would be necessary to go so far because young people must have enjoyment, but precautions must be taken so far as can be done to provide decent sanitary conditions in these halls and, furthermore, to prevent so far as possible the throwing up of dust from the floors which every person attending the dance breathes in. Another source of infection is to be found in insanitary schools and the deplorable practice which obtained in days gone by of asking some of the pupils to remain behind at the end of the school day to sweep the floors. That, I know, is a matter for another Department and I do not wish to stress it at any greater length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the conditions obtaining in certain hospitals, and particularly mental hospitals.  I had experience as chairman of a hospital authority for a number of years and it was my duty to inspect that hospital frequently.  It is impossible for the staff to maintain their health in the conditions which obtain there. Members of the staff who have to do night duty in crowded dormitories, where there are patients suffering from this dread disease, are breathing the same atmosphere, and, in course of time, they develop the disease and the <Col N="2479" /> death rate amongst the staffs of the mental hospitals from this disease is, I think, higher than the average amongst the general public, due to the fact that the conditions under which they have to work are such as to bring them in constant contact with those who are suffering from the disease.  I should like the Minister to give us some information as to the incidence of this disease in the creamery districts as compared with the non-creamery areas, for I know that the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the creamery districts is much higher than it is in the non-creamery areas, and I wonder if the same would not obtain, so far as the human being is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to another disease which, while not as fatal as tuberculosis, is responsible for at least as big a number of casualties amongst the working population and the community generally&mdash;rheumatism.  I should like to see a rheumatism clinic in every county.  The clinic established a few years ago by the Minister's predecessor in Dublin is doing wonderful work.  It has cured many sufferers and has enabled people to go back to work who, but for the establishment of the clinic, would be rendered permanently incapable of work.  The expense involved in the establishment of these clinics all over the country&mdash;it might cost a considerable amount of money&mdash;would be more than repaid to the community by making people available for work who would otherwise be crippled by rheumatism and the kindred diseases like sciatica and other similar complaints.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the conditions in county homes, and, before the Minister proceeds to erect new county homes where these are required, I should like him to consider the possibility of an alternative method of accommodating these people.  If the Minister could provide small cottages in groups, adjacent to some of the principal towns, rather than have these people herded in these old buildings, one-time workhouses, or even some modern adaptation of these buildings, it would make for more home-like conditions for these poor old people at the end of their days. <Col N="2480" /> Finally, I understand that Deputy Dr. Brennan stated that the Minister's predecessor, in the course of his speech, said that tuberculosis was incurable. I questioned Deputy Dr. Ryan since then and he informed me that he made no such statement.  I would be amazed at any ordinary individual, never mind a man who held the important position of Minister for Health and who himself is a medical man, making such a statement. I can speak from practical experience. I doubt if there is any other member in the House who can say that he has had tuberculosis.  I had it 31 years ago.  I am not ashamed to confess it.  It is only right that the general public should be educated into the knowledge that it is no shame to have a disease of the kind, but that it is something to be proud of that through medical attention the patient was restored to health.  I had that disease 31 years ago and was so certified by five doctors but, having got the proper treatment, thank God, my life was saved.  I mention that fact to show that those who have the misfortune to be affected by the disease can be restored to health by the proper treatment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would join with those who have already spoken on behalf of the nursing staffs of the various institutions. I have already mentioned the conditions under which the nursing staffs in the mental hospitals are employed.  I would like to associate with that appeal the nursing staffs in the various hospitals throughout the country.  I was amazed to hear that these nurses were not in the enjoyment of even one holiday per week.  That little concession should be given to these ladies who are devoting their lives to public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health occupies one of the most important offices, if not the most important office, in the Government.  The House and the country recognised the importance of that position when the Dáil created the special Department of Health and separated its functions from those of the Department of Local Government. Once that was done, the House and the country are entitled to expect that <Col N="2481" /> we would get more expedition in matters affecting health and that more advances would be made by the Minister who is now in the happy position that he can give all his time and energy to the health problem.  The Minister has a difficult job to do, and as Minister endeavouring to do that job, I wish him every success.  I should say, however, that he will not get the co-operation that he would be entitled to expect as Minister for Health if he uses his position as Minister for Health for purposes other than endeavouring to solve the problems of his Department. The Minister and his colleagues in the Clann na Poblachta Party profess to be political purists and we heard much criticism from them of former Ministers misusing State cars for political purposes.  That being the doctrine preached by the present Minister and his colleagues, I would not expect to find him using State cars for political purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir.  This Estimate provides, I take it, for the payment of £2,150 to the present Minister. I suggest that I am entitled to say that I am not prepared on this Estimate to pay the Minister £2,150 for going around the country trying to give political injections to the shattered remnants of Clann na Poblachta.  If the Minister is sincere in his efforts to get the co-operation of the local authorities and to get the people interested in health matters, I would suggest that he should discuss these matters with them <Col N="2482" /> and confine his attention to these matters. They are much more interested in discussing the urgent matters of health that the Minister proposes to deal with than they are in listening to the Minister discussing the age of Deputy de Valera.</P>
      <P>At all events, I believe the Minister was sincere when he set out on this tuberculosis campaign and my only regret is that on this Estimate he has his wings clipped financially.  He certainly did set out like the youth who bore the banner with a strange device &mdash;&ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo;&mdash;but evidently the Minister for Finance has substituted economy for &ldquo;Excelsior.&rdquo;  We find the Minister in the position that he is not getting sufficient money to fight the health fight, and, consequently, will not be able to carry out what he felt it would be necessary to do, or to make the provisions he felt it would be necessary to make to meet the scourge of tuberculosis and the other evils that the Minister proposes to deal with.</P>
      <P>In connection with tuberculosis, I see the Estimate provides for the expenditure over a period of 15 years of £3,800,000, roughly £250,000 per annum.  If the Minister confines himself to that, and if the problem of tuberculosis is as grave and as urgent as the Minister says it is, and as the country feels it is, I am afraid it will be a great number of years before the Minister will be able to provide the accommodation that he requires and will not be able to make the strides that he thought he should make and that the country feels he should make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the administration of the various schemes initiated by the Minister's predecessor, there is a certain amount of cutting down through red tape.  For instance, in connection with the scheme under which country people were entitled to a grant of £150 where some member of the family was suffering from tuberculosis in order to build an additional room, in practice the people find it virtually impossible to avail of the grant because so many obstacles are put in the way and the various medical men&mdash;I presume as a result of departmental direction&mdash;more or less insist on a number of members in the family being in a very advanced state <Col N="2483" /> of the disease before they can get the grant.  People are held up.  I have also been informed that a grant under this particular scheme was refused simply because the member of the family affected was resident in a sanatorium and the other members of the family were free from the disease.  One would imagine that this scheme was intended to provide for that very position and that when the individual who was affected by tuberculosis got sufficiently well to return home, he would have a separate room in which he could be isolated, thus diminishing the danger to the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>If that is the position, I would ask the Minister to direct local authorities who are administering the scheme to cut out the red tape and not to curtail the grants but, on the contrary, to encourage every family possible to avail of the grant so that they would have an isolation ward, as it were, in their own homes and thereby decrease the danger to the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>As a layman, I do not know how far climate or altitude affects the treatment of tuberculosis.  But I know that there are people outside this House and some members of the medical profession who maintain that the most effective treatment for tuberculosis is to send suffers to a high altitude and a dry climate.  If that is so, instead of pouring millions into the tuberculosis drive as we propose to do here, it would be better if the Minister considered building a national sanatorium in some place like Switzerland or Western America and have suitable patients for treatment sent to those centres.  It may be that climate has very little to do with it.  It may be that altitude has not a great deal to do with it, but it is true that tremendous success has been achieved in Western America and Switzerland, particularly in Western America.</P>
    <P>I also feel that in connection with the treatment of tuberculosis in this country the surgical side is greatly neglected.  As far as I have been able to gather from inquiries I have made, we are a very long distance behind <Col N="2484" /> America in this matter.  I understand that there are numbers of patients who could be dealt with on the surgical side and that nothing is being done for them.  Very few men in Ireland have specialised in that particular line and I would ask the Minister to get some of our doctors specially trained on the surgical side in the treatment of tuberculosis. If they get the results we are led to believe they get in places like Glockner Hospital in Colorado and the Mayo Clinic in Western America, it would be worth while, as it seems that great strides have been made there by surgical operation.  I would ask the Minister to look into this and not to let finance determine it, if it is necessary to have some of our surgeons trained to specialise in this particular sphere and pay them special salaries in order to induce them, when they get these qualifications, to stay here and work for our own people.</P>
    <P>I fear it will be a long time before it will be possible to achieve mass radiology.  The Minister should insist immediately, however, on the other members of a family being subjected to radiography when there is one patient affected in the house.  At present, when tuberculosis is diagnosed in one member, the others are left as they are. The Minister is well aware that there is grave danger in that.  There should be some way whereby the other members of the family would be checked every six months for about 18 months, to ensure that they have not contracted the disease.  It would be practicable to do that, as it would have to be done only in cases where one person was affected.</P>
    <P>It is true that most of the sanatoria are simply isolation wards, particularly in the country.  The conditions in some of them are not all that we would desire.  I could refer specifically to an institution in my own county.  Some of these places were unsuitable for sanatoria&mdash;the sites were unsuitable and the buildings were unsuitable.  It may take some time to replace them and, seeing the amount of money provided, I fear it will take a long time.  Such as they are, we must make the best use we can of them.  Where there is a long waiting list, such as we have in <Col N="2485" /> my country, if we cannot otherwise provide for them, I would ask the Minister to keep open the offer of his predecessor, that in the new addition to Peamount a number of beds would be earmarked for County Mayo.  The Minister may be able to provide for our surplus patients in Castlerea, but if he cannot I would ask that the beds earmarked for Mayo in Peamount should be kept available.  Peamount has been very popular with patients from the West of Ireland and very good results have been achieved there.  When people are going to an institution a lot depends on the confidence they have in it.  Some institutions got a bad name, due to the fact that many of the patients who went there were, unfortunately, too far advanced and a large number of them were dying; and some of these sanatoria got the reputation that people died immediately they went into them.  Consequently, many patients do not want to avail of the treatment in these country sanatoria.</P>
    <P>I hope that that position will change. It is a question of having the disease diagnosed at an early stage.  The great tragedy is that, until recent times, people were not prepared to admit that they were suffering from it.  I think that phase has passed and that they are now to a large degree tuberculosis conscious and prepared, instead of hiding the disease, to come out and fight it and take the necessary precautions when one member of the family has the misfortune to be stricken by it.</P>
    <P>Bovine tuberculosis is something about which the Minister will have to take action, if he expects to achieve any success.  The present scheme for the destruction of tubercular cattle is completely inadequate.  Even though a farmer notifies the local authority or the Gardaí that he has an animal suffering from tuberculosis, when a veterinary surgeon examines that animal and finds it is so suffering, the farmer is entitled only to 75 per cent. of the cost of the animal.  That is no inducement to the farmer to make a report.  On the contrary, it means that the agricultural community when they find such animals will cloak the disease and get shut of them.  What should be done is to make the position <Col N="2486" /> profitable for them, to appeal to the farmer's money sense, and instead of paying a reduced value for animals so diagnosed, they should be paid, if possible, an enhanced value, so as to encourage them to report any suspected animal immediately.</P>
    <P>In the same way, to get dairy farmers to supply pasteurised milk or have their herds tested for tuberculin-free herds, some improvement must be made.  The cost at present is prohibitive. A veterinary surgeon will charge from three to five guineas to carry out the test per animal.  That is beyond the means of a small farmer, a general man supplying milk to a country town, who keeps ten or 12 cattle; and he is not going to pay a veterinary surgeon £50 or £60 for the sake of certifying his herd free from tuberculosis.  If the Minister himself cannot provide free testing for dairy farmers, then I think he should get some of his colleagues, possibly the Minister for Agriculture, to do it.  Unless he does that, he will not get the farmers who are supplying milk to the public to have their herds tuberculin tested because, as I say, the cost is prohibitive.  If we are serious about this question from a health point of view, we should see that a free tuberculin service is provided by the State.  Possibly, the Minister might suggest that where there are young families the milk supplied to them should be boiled.  I do not know how far that would be effective as a preventive measure.  In my opinion, until a free tuberculin service is provided by the State, the Minister will not make any great strides towards getting the kind of tuberculin-free milk that he desires.</P>
    <P>In connection with bovine tuberculosis, there is also the question of meat.  The testing of meat is all right in places where you have a public abattoir, but in most country towns the butchers kill their beef and mutton in a backyard.  Even in some places where they could get the animals killed under departmental inspection, they refuse to have that done for the reason that they know they are going to be at a loss if an animal is condemned.  In the <Col N="2487" /> case of bacon factories, there is an insurance scheme.  The factories pay so much into a pool, and in that way their losses are covered if pigs are condemned.  In my county, apart from pigs killed in the factories meat is not subject to inspection at the time of killing, and there is nothing to prevent a butcher from selling meat that may be affected.  It is true that the meat is supposed to be inspected, but there is no inspection when the animals are being killed.  I do not know what the Minister can do about that, but I think something should be done.  There should be some system of testing at the time the animals are being killed, in the same way that the Department of Agriculture insists on inspection when pigs are being killed.</P>
    <P>Samples of milk are taken at various times by the food and drugs inspectors throughout the country.  The queer thing about it is that the samples are analysed by different analysts in the different counties.  We had an extraordinary position recently in my county when it was discovered that in the case of some samples that were taken and sent away for analysis it was found the analysis was wrong.  I suggest to the Minister that all food samples should be analysed in the State laboratory or possibly by the Dublin City analyst.  Recently a sample was sent to the public analyst for the County Mayo.  The analyst certified that it was badly infected with accri.  Another sample, taken out of the same packet, was certified by the Dublin City analyst and by a second analyst as being perfectly free from accri.  They certified that the sample was never so infected.  One must feel that a number of people in the country have been convicted in the wrong on these certificates, particularly farmers from whom samples of milk are taken.  For economic reasons they do not have the tests carried further.  In many cases they find it is too late to do so.  The certificate comes along, and because the sample they retain has deteriorated it is not possible for them to get a second opinion.  Evidently what happens in the offices of some of these analysts is that some minor assistant <Col N="2488" /> fills up the necessary certificate, and that certificate is evidence against a defendant until the contrary is proved in court.  I think this system is much too loose, and that some responsible department, some State Department or the department of the Dublin City analyst, should supervise these matters.  I do not think we should have different analysts dealing with different countries, acting, evidently, not with a great sense of responsibility or a big amount of efficiency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new school inspection system, I am of opinion that it is very inadequate.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that very competent medical officers of health have merely become collectors of statistics.  The county medical officer of health in any county visits a school and examines the children.  It may be five or six years before he can return to that school again to see the results of his first inspection, but by that time most of those children will have left school.  Therefore, I suggest that his work cannot be effective.  He can only achieve very limited results.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider having additional county medical officers of health, but, in my opinion, the present system is a sheer waste of time.  It will not become more efficient, I think, until we provide additional officers.  If a job like this is only half done, it might be just as well to leave it completely undone.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to find that the Minister was completely silent on the question of rheumatism.  I think the statistics show that rheumatism in this country, considered as a national disease, is 50 times worse than tuberculosis. There are far more man hours lost and more people incapacitated through this disease than there are among those afflicted with tuberculosis. The fact that people live quite a long time with rheumatism and that it is not immediately fatal may be the cause of this attitude of public complacency. In view of the serious figures given by the National Health Insurance Society and the fact that a very large section of our people are incapacitated through rheumatism, I think that some drive should be made in connection <Col N="2489" /> with that disease and that it should be classed as being of equal importance with, if not of more importance than, the tuberculosis problem.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to tackle this problem, too, and try to get us as advanced on this line here as they are in other countries.</P>
    <P>One matter which I would like to mention to the Minister before I finish is that many of the Minister's staffs in sanatoria throughout the country are working in conditions in which they are continually in contact with tubercular patients.  The position arising from that is that in some institutions nurses and maids have developed tuberculosis as a result of serving in these institutions, and, strange as it may seem, they are not entitled to take advantage of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, as tuberculosis is not classed as an industrial disease.  There is a far greater case for classing tuberculosis as an industrial disease for people who work in these institutions than there is for people who develop silicosis from working in mines.  There is no doubt that maids and nurses who are continually serving patients in sanatoria are much more likely to get tuberculosis than anybody working in any other kind of hospital.  We had a few sad cases in County Mayo where maids belonging to poor families, and some nurses, developed tuberculosis while working in the sanatorium.  When in one case there was an endeavour to recover under the Workmen's Compensation Act, it was found that the patient was not entitled to recover anything.  This is a matter to which the Minister should devote some attention because the Minister is by now, I am sure, aware that one of the big problems in these institutions is to get staff to stay.  Some of these institutions are out in the country away from towns and the usual facilities for entertainment and amusement are not there.  For that reason we have great difficulty in getting the staffs to stay and they are continually leaving these institutions, in the West, at all events.  It will not help matters if they also consider that if they have the misfortune to contract tuberculosis in the course of their duties there is no provision for them, so I <Col N="2490" /> would suggest that the Minister might consider that in the very near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to hospitals, I see that the Minister proposes to expend approximately £5,000,000 over a period of 15 years.  I suggest to the Minister that that is inadequate and the Minister will find that it is more inadequate as time goes on.  Although new hospitals may be built throughout the country the Minister will find that there is not enough accommodation in those hospitals as people will take advantage of the extra facilities provided.  If an old hospital had 60 beds and a new hospitals is built to cater for 120 patients it will still be found throughout the various counties that there is not sufficient room.  In the county hospital in Mayo patients have to be put on the floor and have to be put out of the hospital into the county home in order to make beds available for other patients who are more serious cases and have more urgent need of them.  There is an urgent necessity to provide a new wing in the near future and I am quite sure that the same position will arise in other counties throughout the country.  People are getting more hospital conscious and more inclined to avail of the treatment which is now made available to them.  I am afraid that the provision for hospitalisation that the Minister has in this Estimate and what he proposes to do over a number of years in connection with this matter will not meet the public demand as far as additional accommodation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of the staff of hospitals has been dealt with, and I do not want to refer to it except to say that I am sure that the Minister is aware that ordinary nurses in this country can go across to London and get £6 10s. a week as private nurses, and that it is too much to except that they will remain in our hospitals here at the present rate they are getting.  It is no use to talk about nursing being a vocation.  They are going every day because of the amount of money they can earn on the other side, and unless the Minister does something for them, and does it in a hurry, I am afraid that <Col N="2491" /> he will have difficulty in keeping a nursing staff in the different hospitals. They are experiencing that difficulty already and the longer the position is allowed to drift the more people will be attracted by the high rates which are being paid on the other side at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in connection with the blood transfusion service the Minister proposes to have a central storing station.  This matter has been left in rather a haphazard position for quite some time.  The position which we find throughout the country is that the small number of blood donors on the panel are simply being chased day after day when the hospitals find that they want a donation urgently.  I am afraid that this matter, too, is a question of money.  In the case of private patients I understand that the sum of two guineas is paid for a transfusion. In the case of the ordinary patient in a hospital&mdash;which, I might say, represents 95 per cent. of the cases&mdash;nothing is paid to the blood donors except the honour and glory of giving their blood to help those people.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be some fixed sum payable throughout the country to any of these people who want the money.  Quite a number of people in the country have been giving their blood voluntarily, and I am sure that quite a number of people will continue to do so.  Unfortunately, however, the number who are prepared to give their blood voluntarily are very much in the minority.  In some cases, where blood has been taken, the particular doctor who does the job is not very successful or causes a certain amount of pain. Then the donor spreads the news among his pals and frightens away other donors who would normally be prepared to come in.</P>

      <P>I do not want to give them a medal at all.  For the Deputy's information, only last week I donated a pint of blood myself, which is, I am sure, more than the Deputy has done. This is a big problem for hospitals and <Col N="2492" /> there should be some public drive or some monetary consideration made available or the ordinary working man will not be prepared to come in and give a donation as a good citizen should.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister recently referred to the county homes.  It is quite true that many of these buildings, from the point of view of a building, are not very suitable, but as far as diet is concerned, I can say in our own county home the diet is the same and the stuff the same as in the county hospital and other county institutions. The meat that goes into our county home comes from the mental hospital farm.  The same meat that goes to the mental hospital goes to the county hospital. It is true that the building is old, but it is kept clean and as well as it is possible to keep such an old building.  Until these places are completely pulled down and replaced by modern institutions, it will not be possible to make them what we would desire.  They are, in the main, very old buildings, in many cases with flagged floors and gloomy corridors, and they were never intended to fulfil the rôle for which they are at present being used.  The Minister would be much better occupied in endeavouring to persuade the Minister for Finance to give him more money to replace these buildings than in talking about them throughout the country.  He will certainly achieve more by doing that. There is nothing that I can see that can be done with these buildings except to pull them down and replace them, and we are trying to do that in my county.</P>

      <P>We were improving these buildings and replacing them when the Deputy was in his swaddling clothes.  We have done more for these buildings than the Deputy has done. I am suggesting that the Minister should try to find more money if he wants to replace these buildings.  I am <Col N="2493" /> suggesting that money spent on improving them will not be a success and will be so much wasted.  It would be better economics and cheaper ultimately to pull down those buildings and replace them than to sink a lot of money in endeavouring to improve them.</P>
      <P>I want to wish the Minister success in the job which he has undertaken, but I feel that, from the national point of view, in dealing with these problems that we face as a nation in connection with public health, if we are going to be pared down economically, we will get nowhere and that, no matter how the Minister feels about these problems or how this House feels about the solving of them, if we allow money considerations to stop us, we will not make any progress.  Certainly, if we are going to be cheese-paring in matters of public health we are not facing up to the difficult job that is before the country as far as tuberculosis and rheumatism are concerned. I fear very much that the Minister will find himself looking back on his hopes and able to do nothing unless the Government as a whole leaves out any question of economy when dealing with health problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to make a contribution on this Estimate of what I might term constructive criticism but, in case my doing so might be misrepresented, I do not propose to avail of this opportunity to make that contribution. Consequently, I propose to confine myself just to a few points.  I want to join with Deputies here and with the general public in congratulating the Minister on the efforts he has made to deal with the scourge of tuberculosis. I think that the Minister has shown in a very short period that any problem that faces us, when tackled with enthusiasm, can be solved.  For that alone, the Minister deserves commendation and congratulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that medical facilities and medical treatment should be entirely free for every person in the community and that the measure of the Minister's success as a Minister during the period of office of the present Government will be judged by the extent of the <Col N="2494" /> advance he makes in that direction. We are in a very peculiar position in this country.  We have the existence, unfortunately, of classes.  One class is provided by law with medical facilities free.  Another class is in a position to pay for any medical facilities required.  In between you have a substantial section of the community who are expected to pay for medical facilities and are, in fact, unable to pay for them.  I think that we would be making a very good step forward if we were to provide that medical attention and medical facilities would be available free of charge for every citizen. Until that is done we will not have dealt with the problem of national health in the way in which I think it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with the Minister's references to the conditions which exist in some of our county homes.  I think that that matter should not have been referred to here from the point of view of Party politics in the way it has been.  If there is one bad county home in the country, if there is one county home in which conditions are as bad as the Minister described, then I think the Minister ought to be commended for changing the conditions in that county home.  I do not think a good service has been done by those Deputies who tried to establish that conditions in every county home were as good as they should be.  I think that was going to the other and the wrong extreme.</P>
    <P>Although in the counties with which I am familiar our county hospitals are magnificent structures, built recently, it has always struck me that there was something wrong in the organisation of these county hospitals.  There is not the staff of specialists that there ought to be in these county hospitals.  Consequently in quite a number of them the main surgical responsibility rests on one particular doctor and there is insufficient equipment, X-ray and otherwise, to deal with the different types of cases that come before him for attention. We might as well face the fact that if the very best medical attention and facilities are to be available they will have to be provided on a regional basis.  In that way surgeons of the <Col N="2495" /> greatest standing, with adequate salaries, will be available.  There will also be X-ray experts and specialists of all kinds, a pathologist, a laboratory, and all the equipment that is required. Our roads are good and if those regional hospitals can be planned for suitable points in the country, patients can be brought to them by ambulance without any trouble or danger in a very short period of time.  That is something that will have to be considered and put into effect at the earliest possible date.  Hospitals of that kind with bed accommodation for 500, 600 or 700 patients will justify the expenditure that will be necessary.  They will also provide an excellent and very suitable training ground for our medical students and our young doctors.</P>
    <P>References were made in this debate to the danger from contaminated milk. I am afraid the inference might be taken from the remarks made here that the milk which is distributed in Dublin is dangerous to the citizens of Dublin. I am aware that in the case of the Merville Dairy and Hughes' Dairy in Rathfarnham the most up-to-date machinery is installed.  There is no danger whatsoever of contamination of milk in these dairies or of disease being spread by the milk supplied by them. I understand that there is another dairy &mdash;Dublin Dairies, Ltd.&mdash;in course of erection, in which also the most up-to-date machinery is being installed.  It is just as well that we should know that these dairies which supply such a substantial part of the milk requirements in the City of Dublin have taken every possible precaution against the danger of contaminated milk.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether sure if the problem of illegitimate children comes within this Vote, but I think that it does.  I should like the Minister to give particular and personal attention to the problem of these mothers.  In different parts of the country there are homes where these mothers are placed before childbirth and they are kept virtually as prisoners in them for a period of from one to two years afterwards. I think that is a shocking reflection on our country.  If the Minister will look into the matter I am quite <Col N="2496" /> sure that he will be shocked by what he will find out.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, there are many things that I should like to say on this Estimate, but I shall reserve my points for another occasion.  I am satisfied that if the Minister approaches these other problems with the same enthusiasm, the same energy and the same determination as he has tackled the problem of tuberculosis, we shall make substantial strides forward in the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain factors in the present situation which are very favourable to definite progress in the health service.  I think I should, in the first instance, mention the preparations that have been made by the present Minister's predecessor along various lines.  These have been very largely dealt with in the White Paper which was issued by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was in office.  The achievements and the plans for the future were set out in that document. The present Minister has had, so to speak, a plan of campaign prepared and handed to him on a platter. Secondly, I would point out that the Minister's Department is not, as other Government services are, entirely dependent on the money provided by taxation.  There is, as everyone knows, a large accumulation of money in the Hospitals Trust Fund.  Thirdly, we have at the head of the Department a new broom.  I do not use the term in any disrespectful sense, but we have a new Minister who has not had his enthusiasm damped in any way by administrative experience or even by apprenticeship on the back benches. He has given evidence of that enthusiasm throughout the country and he has brought the House down about his ears in consequence.  I shall not refer to his Galway speech because I think the Minister should be pardoned for it.  To choose Galway for the purpose of making a speech like that shows a certain spontaneity.  He hardly chose Galway deliberately to make the speech in order to attack the former Taoiseach.  But he did make a speech somewhere in the Midlands and in the course of it he made a reference <Col N="2497" /> to obstructive tactics in the Health Department.</P>
      <P>We were rebuked here yesterday by some of the speakers, notably the Minister for Defence, for complaints made by members of our party.  I take it that one of the cardinal rules of opposition is to complain.  There are, perhaps, times when the complaints may be somewhat thin and flimsy, but that is inevitable.  I would remind the House of the very definite obstruction offered when the first Health Bill was introduced by Dr. Ward.  On that occasion the entire Opposition walked out of the House.  No reference was made to that.  The extraordinary thing is that when a Bill in practically precisely the same terms was subsequently introduced it was accepted. In my opinion, the obstruction offered to the first Bill was entirely capricious. I do not wish to labour this question of obstruction too much or to dwell at length on the Minister's castigation of county homes and other public services. Perhaps there is method in his madness.  The worse one makes a problem out to be the more credit can one take in successfully solving it.  If that is the Minister's technique, then he has a very sound excuse for the references he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two Departments dealing with Local Government and Public Health respectively.  Formerly these were dealt with by one Department.  I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for keeping a certain coordination in the work of these two Departments.  Both have certain obligations in the prevention of disease. I take it that the allocation of water and sewerage services was made after due consideration.  Possibly I might not have spoken on this Estimate were it not for the fact that recently two cases were brought to my notice.  In Roundstone the water supply has failed completely for some weeks past.  I know that is not the responsibility of the Minister, but there is a grave danger of an epidemic if this matter is not attended to; should an epidemic break out it will become a matter for the Minister for Health.  I would ask him, therefore, to use his good offices with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that <Col N="2498" /> something is promptly done in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister for Lands that I am here now as a public representative in the Dáil. I am not a member of the Galway County Council.  The matter was referred to me by letter and I think it is encumbent upon me to use the first opportunity open to me to draw public attention to it.  That is what I am now doing.  Whichever Minister takes the matter up, he can make much speedier contact with the local officials than I can.</P>
      <P>A similar situation exists in Oughterard. There, there has not been a complete failure of the water supply but the position is acute.  At the moment public sewers are being laid and when that work is completed there will be a further demand on the existing inadequate supply of water.  I am informed that here too there is real danger of disease because of the insufficient water supply.  In Oughterard it is possible to get an adequate supply of good water.  The solution to the problem is not quite so easy in Roundstone but it is possible at the same time to remedy it.  I am sure that I have brought home the seriousness of the position in these two towns.  I merely refer to the matter because of possible repercussions from the point of view of public health.  There are other places in my constituency to which I would like to refer but in these places it is a question of providing a new water supply.  I do not think that comes within the scope of the present Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Roundstone, I have been asked, too, to refer to the recent sale of the doctor's residence.  I understand that there is a very bad dispensary building in the town, and it is somewhat puzzling to understand why a building which is in a good state of repair and which is owned by the local authority should have been sold instead of being retained as a dispensary.  Why it is not suitable as a doctor's residence is not quite clear.  Reports in the local <Col N="2499" /> Press would seem to indicate that the house had a tenant other than the doctor&mdash;a tenant who apparently refused to leave it.  The tenant, according to report, was a ghost.  I do not know whether that is put forward seriously as a good reason for selling a very fine building.  I do not think a ghost is a very substantial reason in explanation for this transaction.  If the sale has been completed nothing can now be done about it, but I think the Minister should take note of the matter.  In future where he is issuing sanctions for transfers of public property to private ownership he should first of all make a survey of the needs of the locality and assure himself that the buildings, if they are not suitable for the purpose for which they were being used, are not suitable for some other public purpose.  Property at the present time is hard to come by. Building is very expensive.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about tuberculosis, but I am not going to deal with it now.  I notice from the Minister's introductory remarks that there has been a heavier mortality from cancer than from tuberculosis.  If that is going to be the position, I imagine that a good deal of the effort and enthusiasm will be transferred from one disease to the other.  I notice also that a great many of those who are concerned with tuberculosis are not all of the one mind as to sanatoria being the very best means of dealing with it.  I know one person at least who believes that the main thing to be achieved in connection with the treatment of tuberculosis is segregation, and he maintains that you can segregate people at a much smaller cost than by building sanatoria. I do not say that I agree altogether with him.  I formed my opinion on this subject from the number of requests I got from members of a family affected by tuberculosis who wished to get into these places.  I take it that sanatoria must continue to be provided.  The last Minister for Local Government must have been aware of the other viewpoint when, in the Housing Act, he authorised means to provide additional rooms in houses for the benefit of people who have been suffering from <Col N="2500" /> tuberculosis and who have returned from sanatoria.</P>
    <P>On the question of payment of nurses, I suggest that there ought to be some means of standardising the pay of nurses in public hospitals and other institutions. Some nurses got increases early last year, some later last year, and others did not get them until this year. There is a good deal of comparison being made by nurses and apparently the increases are not quite standardised either.  I know the local authority is the employer, but we have a parallel case in the national teachers.  The local manager is the employer, but the central authority fixes the salary and decides qualifications.  Some standardisation on the lines of the teaching profession could be introduced into the nursing profession and it would remedy a good many of these complaints.</P>
    <P>Tá focal amháin scoir le rá agam&mdash; faoin scéim inmholta a chuir an Rialtas deireannach ar bun, le cailíní as an bhfíor-Ghaeltacht a oiliúnt agus a thréineáil mar bhanaltraí.  Fuair cuid mhaith cailíní as an nGaeltacht tréineáil agus postanna ina dhiaidh sin mar bhanaltraí, cailíní a bheadh ag imeacht as an tír murach an scéim sin a bheith ann. Fuair mé féin amach locht amháin a bhí ar oibriú na scéime.  Chuireadh an Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil agus Sláinte Poiblí, mar a bhí sé an t-am sin&mdash;an Roinn Sláinte anois, is dócha&mdash;chuiridís oifigigh thart faoi na Gaeltachta ar fad, sa deisceart, san iarthar agus sa tuaisceart, agus bhíodh agallamb acu le na hiarrthóirí.  Phiocadar amach ansin na cailíní ab fhearr.  B'éigean do na cailíní sin dul faoi scrúdú a cuireadh ar bun ag an údarás áitiúl. I nGaillimh, tharla, uair amháin ar a laghad, gur chuir an t-údarás áitiúil scrúdú ar bun le caighdeán a bhí ró-árd do na cailíní a fuair a gcuid oideachais sna scoileanna náisiúnta, agus ba é caighdeán na meánscol caighdeán an scrúduithe.  Tuigfidh aoinne nach bhféadfadh cailíní a hoileadh sna scoileanna náisiúnta scrúdú de chaighdeán meánscoile a dhéanamh &mdash;agus, dar ndóigh, chlis orthu ar fad.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh anois ar an Aire, sa geéad chás, an scéim seo a choinneáil ar bun agus, sa dara cás, caighdeán réasúnta scrúduithe a bheith ann agus gan leanacht den scéim ar an <Col N="2501" /> gcaoi sin.  Níl a fhios agam, ach b'fhéidir nach dtaithíonn an scéim sin le na hudaráis áitiúla.  Tá sé anoiriúnach, ó thaoibh amháin, agus sin é go mbíonn sé an-deacair ar an Jubilee Nurses' Association go minic iarrthóirí feiliúnacha a fháil le haghaidh áiteanna iargúlta sa nGaeltacht. An fhad is táim ag cur síos air sin, ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire féachaint chuige go bhfaighidh na cailíní seo, ní amháin tréineáil ghinearálta mar bhanaltraí ach go bhfaighidh siad na cáilíochta, freisin, atá riachtanach ag na húdaráis áitiúla.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say in English, for the Minister's benefit, that I want to impress upon him the importance of the Gaeltacht nursing scheme, which has been in operation for a number of years.  It is capable of doing a great deal of good for girls in the Gaeltacht who have no other means of getting nursing qualifications.  There is a danger that the scheme might be destroyed by too high a standard in the examination which is held by the local authority.  That has happened on one occasion to my own knowledge. I would like the Minister to see if he cannot link up this scheme with the Jubilee nursing scheme and other such voluntary nursing organisations.  These nursing organisations provide classes and the girls get a general nursing training.  They do not provide nurses who have all the qualifications required by the local authority&mdash;not always, in any event.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to ensure that these nurses will get such a training as will enable them to do the work heretofore done by the Jubilee association. I am not asking him to replace that organisation unless he thinks fit to do so for other reasons. In any event, the Jubilee Nursing Association has concentrated always on general nursing; it has not bothered so much about midwifery qualifications and it certainly has not bothered about providing girls who can do the work through the medium of Irish in the Gaeltacht, which everybody knows is most important.  People who have a small knowledge of English and who may be able to do a little bit of shopping and that sort of thing in <Col N="2502" /> English and carry on a small conversation are not able to explain their ailments except in the language they know well.</P>
    <P>It is most important, therefore, that nurses sent to the Gaeltacht areas, quite apart from any sentimental attachment to the language, should be fully qualified in the Irish language.  I know they make good progress when they have spent a while in the Gaeltacht&mdash;those of them who are interested&mdash;but if it is possible to send them in fully qualified in every respect, the Minister should do so.  I ask him earnestly to see that the Gaeltacht scheme is not let down in any way and that it will be saved from the economy axe.</P>

      <P>There is only one thing which concerns me and the people whom I represent, and that is exactly what are the Minister's views about providing additional hospital accommodation for the people of North Cork. We were in the fortunate position of having a county hospital erected at Mallow some years ago but, in pursuance of the drive made by the present Minister for Health against tuberculosis in the country, he took over the county hospital at Mallow quite recently.  We in the North Cork Board of Public Assistance, which is responsible for public health administration in that area, now find ourselves in the funny position, due to the fact that the county hospital has been taken over as a sanatorium, that we are left without any hospital accommodation.  I am sure that the Minister will do his utmost to assist us to find alternative accommodation now that he has taken over the county hospital.  Some time ago we had plans and specifications prepared and had purchased a site for the erection of a cottage hospital at Charleville in North Cork, and I should like to know from the Minister whether he has in contemplation the erection of this cottage hospital in the near future.  Not alone did the people of Charleville suffer as a result of the county hospital being taken over but a considerable number of people on the borders of Cork and Limerick who had to depend on the hospital at Mallow, <Col N="2503" /> suffered also.  I am sure that if the Minister will give this matter careful consideration he will not have the slightest hesitation in sanctioning the erection of the new cottage hospital at Charleville.</P>

      <P>My first duty is to congratulate the new Minister on the success of his administration in this Department.  I think the Government did an excellent day's work when they selected this young man as head of the Department.  I fully support the statement he made, which I read in the Press, as to conditions in county homes.  I agree with the Minister in the statement that the only change made in regard to county homes was the change in the name from &ldquo;poorhouse&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;county home&rdquo;, because the inmates of these institutions who have no relatives living outside are just in the same position as they were in days gone by.  Very few of the Deputies, who now speak in disparaging terms of the Minister from the Opposition Benches, spoke during the debates during the past 16 years on the question of conditions in the county homes or in sanatoria.  Whether they were allowed to do so or not I do not know.  We now find Deputy Bartley referring to Dr. Ward.  Dr. Ward was engaged in other things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly advise the Minister to continue along the lines which he has adopted and to visit every county home.  It is the first time that we had a Minister who took a sufficient interest in these matters to go and see the conditions for himself. Deputies on the far side, Deputy Moran in particular, referred to the <Col N="2504" /> fact that the last Government had plans which they had not time to complete for the erection of hospitals, but the fact is that they were interested only in the building of airports and not hospitals.</P>
      <P>The question of boarded-out children has been mentioned by Deputy Cowan. I certainly would appeal to the Minister that young unmarried mothers retained in these homes, who are willing to go out and work, should not be kept there whilst their children are boarded out.  They should get another chance in life.  The system at present in force is founded on cheap labour. They are doing the work of these institutions for nothing and if they are good workers they are kept there indefinitely. I think that is wrong.  If the £40,000 that went down the drain at Santry a few months ago had been expended on providing extra beds in existing institutions, much more accommodation would have been provided for the patients still on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>If one goes into any of these institutions on visiting day one finds everything is rosy.  Everything is dressed up to impress the friends of the people who are inmates, but when the friends leave the fresh clothes are taken away again and put in the press.  They are only for outside show.  Probably when the Minister visited some of these institutions he found conditions were such that he felt justified in making the statement which he did.  He has been attacked in this House on the ground that that statement was made for propaganda purposes.  He was also attacked at a meeting of the Wexford County Council by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing out that the Minister was justified in making this statement, because many local authorities are not doing their duty towards the people who are inmates of these institutions.  These people should be provided with better clothing and the prison garb in use at <Col N="2505" /> present in county homes should be replaced.  It is possible to recognise them as being out of the institution immediately one sees them.  The old garb should be done away with and an ordinary suit of clothes given to them. The same applies to the mental hospitals. The inmates of these institutions have a uniform in which they can be recognised a mile away.  These people should be properly dressed and not made to look like outcasts.</P>
      <P>With regard to tuberculosis, there was never any mention of tuberculosis in my young days.  That is merely the new name given to it.  People had another name for it at that time and they were afraid to go to the wake of a person who died from it.  Science then came along and called it tuberculosis. There is only one solution of the tuberculosis problem in this or any other country&mdash;proper food and nourishment&mdash;but, for the past few years, the young people have been brought up on a diet without fats.  I live in a poor locality and I can say that we will never get rid of tuberculosis until the people are in a position to get proper nourishment.  There are people to-day who have to do with half a pint of milk for their families, because they are not able to afford any more.  There is no such thing as nourishment for youngsters to-day. There was plenty of rough food available years ago, but, with the high cost of living to-day, the man on the dole or the man who is getting national health insurance or sickness benefit, of 15/- a week for six months and 7/6 for the next six months, under a Government which boasted about what they had done, cannot afford to buy food and there is nothing but misery in such a household.  There is plenty of money available to give people the necessaries of life and to look after them, without talking about building sanatoria.  Sanatoria and mental hospitals have been built here by talk since I entered the House in 1943.  In this connection, we are providing only for two classes of people.  Who are the greatest sufferers?  The poor. Did you ever find a member of the Dáil having to go into a county home or a sanatorium?</P>

      <P>They go to private nursing homes.  I visit the three institutions in my constituency and I know what is going on there.  I know that it is not all sunshine for the inmates.  There is not much happiness in these institutions for a person who has no relatives to look after him.  He is put aside, left to live or die and a piece of rough food is dished out to him.  Instead of a tasty tea on Sunday, with a bit of fancy cake, the people in these institutions get the same old food day in and day out, and half of it goes to the wash for the pigs, because the people have not got the stomachs for it.  That is what we must get at.  We must do away with this old system of the big cut of bread, with margarine on it and the sup of tea.  All that must be changed.  The man who now holds the position of Minister for Health is a man with practical experience, a man who was in an institution looking after patients, and he is the man the country is looking to.  We want a man in that position who will take an interest in these matters, and the Minister is now taking an interest which has annoyed the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The dispensaries throughout the country are old, tumble-down shacks, and in many cases people have to wait three and four hours for a doctor, who turns up whenever he likes.  That is a matter the Minister should look into, with a view to ensuring that the doctor will be in his dispensary at a specified time, so that the poor people will not be kept waiting for hours for the relief they seek.  I should also like to see medicines available in these dispensaries because the country is paying, and these medicines should be available for the people.  There being only one doctor in a district, the entire onus is thrown on him, with the result that dispensary doctors will only go to people when they like and will not attend them sometimes until the following day, as is happening to my knowledge. The red ticket also is a demoralising idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to visit the institutions in Wexford, because I know that it is not all sunshine for the poor people there.  I visited them during <Col N="2507" /> the big snowstorm of 1947, and I saw them in the day room, 40 or 50 old age pensioners, shivering with the cold, herded together like sheep afraid of a sheep dog and afraid to speak, so rigid is the discipline in these institutions. These old people should be allowed more freedom and should get the comforts they want.  Now that they are paying for it out of their old age pensions, these people should get better treatment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the attendants in mental hospitals, I suggest that the first thing the Minister should do is to give a shorter working week to the attendants in these institutions.  Work in a mental hospital is the heaviest form of work any young man or woman can take up.  They have to look after people who cannot look after themselves, and they should get every encouragement. From the point of view of their health, a shorter working week is essential, because the duties they have to perform are not the normal duties which the worker outside has to perform.</P>
    <P>With regard to hospital nurses, it is not everybody who is anxious to be a nurse.  Some of them go to England to take up work, but they come back from England, too, because conditions there are not much better, as I have experienced.  We are merely training these girls to go away, if we do not provide better conditions for them. The main thing which is wrong is the long hours.  Everybody to-day is clamouring for a 48-hour week, but mental hospital attendants have to work a 50-hour week, and a shorter week for those in all these types of institution is something which will bring about contentment amongst the staff. I congratulate the Minister, and I am 100 per cent. behind his policy.  I suggest that, when he visits these institutions through the country, he should refrain from giving any notice of his intended visit, but should slip down when he is not expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time I have had the doubtful honour of following Deputy O'Leary in a debate, and the second time, I trust, I will be <Col N="2508" /> able to keep to the points I originally intended to speak on.  The Minister, in opening the debate, dealt very largely with the treatment and cure of disease, but not enough, in my opinion, with the prevention of disease.  However, the debate has been fairly well balanced between treatment and prevention, and I hope the Minister will pay as much attention to the points made in regard to prevention as he does to those made in regard to treatment. The Minister will recognise that in the 1947 Health Act there are provisions which are designed towards prevention as well as treatment, and I trust that while he grapples with the huge task he has in hands he will not forget that in trying to combat disease, as well as curing existing infection, infection must be prevented.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly referred to the part adequate housing has to play in the campaign against disease and in the preservation of health.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in any housing schemes, as far as he can see to it, the provision of playgrounds will be foremost in the minds of the planners. I appreciate that the difficulty in acquiring sites, particularly in the cities, is a big one, that land is becoming increasingly dear and that it might not be good economics to buy tracts of land for the purpose mainly of providing playgrounds.  Nevertheless it would be good health policy, in the long run, to provide proper playgrounds in any building schemes that are to be provided in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1947 Act provides largely for the economic question in fighting disease and the economic question is very important.  Heretofore, people who had to leave their homes and go to hospital did so as a very last resort and, in many cases, they left it too late, with fatal effects, because they wanted to provide for their families. Now they have the assurance that under Section 44 of the Act their families will be fairly adequately, if not adequately, provided for and it will encourage them to go to hospital on the advice of their doctor at the earliest stage of the disease.  I would ask the Minister to publicise that provision in the Act and <Col N="2509" /> to drive it home to the people that their families will be provided for in the event of their suffering from an infectious disease and having to go to hospital.  I would urge on him to use his new publicity officer, for which the Act also provides, to drive that home to the people as much as possible.</P>
    <P>While I am on Section 44, I would like to cite a case that was mentioned to me recently.  I put it to the Minister by way of suggestion, if it is acceptable, or so that he may obtain information on the subject.  It is a case of a child who complied with all the requirements of Section 44 in regard to notifying the medical officer and undergoing the proper treatment.  The child's father was out of work.  The child suffered from infantile paralysis and on being discharged from hospital got the necessary nourishment from the local authority.  The father said that that was not sufficient for him, that he required some money payment in order to provide adequately for the after-care of the child.  Section 44, as I read it, presupposes that the person who benefits under that particular section is a wage-earner or a potential wage-earner. I would ask the Minister to consider that point and to see, even in the case where the person who has suffered from one of the scheduled infectious diseases is not a wage-earner or potential wage-earner, that some provision by way of money payment for the after-care treatment might be made to the parents or guardians, as the case may be, if they are in such poor financial position that they cannot afford extra treatment and clothing over and above what would be provided in the normal course from the public authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy of visiting institutions throughout the country is commendable, but I would ask him in visiting these institutions not to bite off more than he can chew.  The Minister will recollect the visit to Cork, where there are 12 or 14 hospitals.  He tried to visit all these hospitals in one day.  I say to him that he could not possibly have adequately examined the conditions in a hospital with a view to finding out the defects, if there were defects.  I was present at one particular <Col N="2510" /> hospital and I could only describe the Minister's visit as a hit-and-run affair.  In fairness to himself, I do not think he could possibly have taken in all that was required to be taken in there.  I know that for several weeks the committee of management had been preparing an agenda on which they proposed to address the Minister when he would arrive, but they found that the Minister had not the time.  While the Minister's object was to meet the people and make them all happy and to tell them that he was attending to their problems, I can assure him that he left nothing but dissatisfaction behind him in this particular institution. If the Minister intends to visit hospitals, let him visit them in the proper manner and give himself plenty of time in each particular institution and not make what I have described as these hit-and-run visits.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister, that is, the question of advertising for dispensary doctors. Advertisements have been inserted in English newspapers when advertising for doctors for dispensaries all over Ireland, and rightly so, because, unfortunately, many of our doctors have to emigrate; we have not got a market for them here.  The vacancies do not all occur at the same time.  There may be a vacancy in Donegal in January, in Galway in June and somewhere else in October.  I would suggest that when candidates who have to come from across Channel attend for interview in connection with a particular hospital, if the Minister foresees a vacancy in another hospital in the near future, that candidate's application and qualifications should be assessed in respect of the subsequent post as well as the particular post for which he came.  I know there is a genuine complaint among doctors&mdash;well-qualified young men&mdash;who are anxious to return to Ireland but who have not the means or the time to come back on each particular occasion for each particular interview for any one dispensary.  I appreciate that, over the course of time, with other countries coming into the field, new examinations will be held and new doctors qualified and existing doctors will have better <Col N="2511" /> degrees.  It might be possible for the Minister to take into consideration encouraging the visits and interviews of those cross-Channel young Irish doctors to fill several posts if they occur within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the prevention of disease, I should have referred to the point about bringing to the notice of people the necessity for avoiding the different forms of illness and disease. Some years ago, whether by way of personal adornment or otherwise, people became very conscious of the care of teeth.  Dentists at that particular time thought they would lose a lot of business in extractions and fillings because people were beginning to take more care of their teeth; but, on the contrary, it was found that dentists' business improved as the result of added interest in the care of teeth. People were encouraged to make regular visits to their dentists.  In like manner, the Minister might use his publicity officer in encouraging people to make regular visits to doctors, even though they may feel nothing wrong with them.  Doctors would not object, as they will get their fees for each visit and the people will benefit in the long run, as disease that might normally not manifest itself until a very late stage might be caught early on and treated.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister is taking a special interest in nurses' homes when he visits hospitals.  That is a commendable attitude.  Unless nurses are properly housed and cared for, it is hard to see how they can care adequately for the patients.  We might find, in the long run, that the nurses' health would fail rather than the patients' health improve.</P>
    <P>As regards Hospitals Trust Funds, in some hospitals they have trust funds and endowment funds which have been there for a long number of years.  I am told that payments from the Hospitals Trust will not be forthcoming until such time as these hospitals will have used up the funds at their disposal.  I know one hospital which got either no payment or insufficient payment to meet requirements, and the reason <Col N="2512" /> given was that the hospital had plenty of funds of its own.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is policy in that respect not to give proper payments to such hospitals.  In many of these cases, the hospitals cannot touch these endowment and trust funds they have on hands, as they were given for a special purpose; and the hospital is not empowered in law, in many cases, to make use of them. I would ask the Minister to give a direction to those hospitals as to what they are to do with those trust funds.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of conveying the gratitude and good wishes of the people of Cahirciveen, County Kerry, to Dr. Browne, the Minister for Health, for his prompt action in providing that important district with a modern hospital.  It had been under consideration for years, but in the course of a very short period&mdash;in fact, a few days' examination and investigation of the files and facts&mdash;the Minister allocated a hospital, which was not alone a benefit to the area but to practically the whole section of the south western portion of South Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil to-day I asked a question about the operation of the Infectious Diseases Act Maintenance Regulations. In one particular case, a woman was in Peamount Sanatorium and was sent back to her native district, Waterville, County Kerry, which is 60 miles from Tralee.  The county medical officer expected her to travel for treatment to Tralee.  She did so, but could not afford to continue those visits.  He wrote and told her that, unless she could attend some centre for treatment, she would not be entitled to benefit under the Act.  The nearest centre would be ten miles from her.  Cahirciveen dispensary, and 60 miles from the centre he prescribed in the first instance.  I ask the Minister&mdash;that is why I tabled this question to-day&mdash; why should that obligation be put on such people?  If the county medical officer is to decide in that manner, many of these poor people will suffer and will be precluded from the benefits that this House intended for them. This is only one of a number of cases in that district.  I have been told that, <Col N="2513" /> whether it is through indifference or lack of knowledge of the regulations, some doctors in my district are not quite clear as to who is entitled to benefit under these regulations.  I know the Minister is sympathetic and is anxious to assist the poor and everyone who is out for the health of the people concerned.  We have several cases who are debarred from consideration because the tuberculosis doctor for Kerry is not able to get round to all the districts.  One man, who was in a sanatorium and was sent back to his own residence, to his wife and three children, has to subsist on 10/- a week home assistance. His case is certainly an advanced one of tuberculosis, and yet the county medical officer or the county tuberculosis officer cannot arrive at a system whereby that man would get first consideration, or men in his category.  I cannot understand the position.  Perhaps it is because we have no board of health or county council operating in Kerry at the moment that there is this indifference.  I hope that, pending the restoration of the county council, the Minister and his Department will consider my appeal.  I am prepared to submit all the necessary facts and statements in regard to these cases to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to be very long.  I would like, in the first place to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on his earnestness in tackling the work of his new position. This earnestness is a very valuable thing, in fact, it is an essential thing for the head of any Department, and <Col N="2514" /> I hope that the Minister will continue on these lines and do excellent work so long as he is in charge.  There is, however, a complaint that I have to make, and I propose to make it at once.  It is in regard to some remarks that are attributed to the Minister with regard to county homes and to other aspects of public health.  I would like to point out that certainly, as far as the one county home that I am interested in is concerned, his remarks were not correct.  The description given by him of the dietary&mdash;whoever may have given it to him: I am sure he did not manufacture it himself&mdash; certainly does not apply in any way to the county home in Roscommon.  It is very far from it.  Neither is it true to say that nothing was done in the matter of public health during their terms of office by Fianna Fáil and their predecessors.  I think that very much was done by both Government and particularly by Fianna Fáil which was a good deal longer in office than its predecessor.</P>
    <P>With regard to the county homes, I do not want to weary the House, but I do want to point out that I was very much upset by the remarks that were made.  I was for some time chairman of the board of health before the managerial system was introduced.  I had been for a very long time a member of the board of health and I am a member of the county council.  I was really pained by some of the remarks that were made because I think they were an aspersion on the local authorities. I felt it that way, in any case. Strange to say, I was twitted in Dublin several times since then about the condition of things in Roscommon.  In fact, I was asked what kind of barbarians we were in Roscommon.  I know that the Minister had not Roscommon in view because he had not visited the institution.  In regard to the dietary in the county home in Roscommon, for breakfast the inmates get 7 oz. of bread, ½ to ¾ oz. of butter, one pint of tea, 1¾ pints of porridge and ¾ pint of milk.  That is the scale for breakfast and supper each day.  For dinner they get beef, mutton or bacon, as the case may be, and the quantity is 6 oz. each; on one day of the week they get Irish stew; <Col N="2515" /> 1½ lb. potatoes, ½ lb. vegetables.  On Fridays, 7 oz. bread, ¾ oz. of butter, pint of tea, 8 oz. of sweetened rice and one egg.  They also get an extra pint of milk on Fridays and 6 oz. of fish when it is available.  The old age pensioners each get an egg every day.</P>
    <P>I do not think that dietary coincides in any way with the dietary given by the Minister.  He may have been misinformed. I am not going to go into the dietary scale for the county hospital, which is, to my mind, excellent. I heard Deputy O'Leary talk about his visits to the county institutions.  I, too, have visited our county institutions.  I have visited them as a member of the visiting committee.  I think that, with one exception, I have never had any complaint, and I certainly did not go there to terrorise anyone.  There was no need for anyone to be afraid to mention complaints to me or to those who went with me.  I did not get any such complaints.  I do not know the position with regard to structural alterations or improvements in other county homes, but I can say that there have been very material alterations and improvements made in the Roscommon County Home.  A Deputy opposite said that we did nothing during 15 years. He did not know what he was talking about.  In the case of Roscommon the main building is for the ordinary inmates.  In addition, we have a special tuberculosis wing to accommodate 18 beds, and recently, under very trying circumstances, we spent £20,000 on the improvement of the buildings without any contribution whatever from the State.</P>
    <P>It, therefore, does not please me to be told that we have done nothing to improve the position of the county homes.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Moran that nothing could be done to make these buildings good and useful for accommodation.  I think that even one-sixth of what it would cost to erect a new building would make the old buildings very habitable and very presentable.  I invite the Minister for Public Health to visit Roscommon and to visit the county home there.  Of course the county hospital, which was occupied in 1940 or 1941, was built under the last Government. <Col N="2516" /> I am not claiming any particular praise for that, but certainly these two institutions, the county home and the county hospital in Roscommon, do not leave a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I want especially to bring before the Minister. When he examines the files of the case he will find that it is one of the gravest cases in the country.  It is the case of Boyle District Hospital.  I cannot lay the blame particularly on the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary of the time nor on the officials, but it was an extraordinary piece of bungling over a period of years with the result that this district hospital is in a desperately bad plight.  Plans were prepared and estimates made very many years ago, certainly not less than 10 or 12 years ago.  Then it was decided by the Department, or by the Parliamentary Secretary possibly, that the estimate was too high and that the building was going to be too costly and too elaborate. An order was prepared to prepare new plans and estimates and the board of health in every case acted promptly.  The hospital I refer to is in one of the poorest parts of the country.  It is in a remote district a long distance from the county hospital so that a district hospital is needed badly, but the war came along and nothing was done since.  Recently plans and specifications were forwarded to the Department of Health and are now awaiting sanction.  I am asking the Minister to examine this case, for he will not find anything more glaring in the records of his Department.  It is one institution in the country where patients are badly housed&mdash;certainly they are not badly fed, they are well looked after&mdash;but both nurses and patients are in a bad position with regard to housing.</P>
    <P>There are a few points apart from these which I would like to touch on. I agree with some of the Deputies who have spoken that prevention has been, perhaps, too little referred to in the Minister's statement, although I have no doubt whatever that he will give as much attention to this as possible.  As far as tuberculosis is concerned, these preventive plans should start early.  I feel <Col N="2517" /> myself that the foundation of tuberculosis is very often laid in the early years of a child's life and very often in school.  Many national schools&mdash;though some secondary schools may be bad enough&mdash;are in a bad sanitary condition. The sanitary accommodation in many of them is primitive and in many of them also there is not a suitable water supply.  I had a sad experience of this.  For many years I taught in a school where no water was available and it was pitiful in the summer months to see little children who could not even get a drink of water.  Our board of health did a great deal of work in County Roscommon, but water supply and sanitation are one of the most essential things if we are to avoid disease. Some people have said that we did not do very much.  I heard one Deputy in Roscommon say it, and I was astonished, because if any county in Ireland did anything during the past 15 years, it was County Roscommon.  There is hardly a town which was not provided with a completely new water scheme or a sewerage scheme, or if not, they are in the course of execution, but it is essential if we are to prevent disease that we must in the first place live under sanitary conditions.  Housing, too, is of absolute importance, and one thing about which I can agree with Deputy O'Leary is the necessity of having suitable food.  A great deal is done, and has been done, for the provision of food for the lower classes, but I think that we should go even further than we have gone if we are to rear children with healthy bodies, and healthy minds too for that matter.  We have got to see that they are properly fed and properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The sanatoria scheme is a thing which is certainly very much to be desired and I am glad that the Minister is so strong on this.  Ten or 12 years ago when the board of health of Roscommon invited representatives from four or five surrounding counties to come to meet us with a view to getting a regional sanatorium, we agreed to join with five other counties and we put proposals to the Department, but I am sorry to say that the proposals were not adopted.  I am glad that regional sanatoria are to be established and I am sure that this will be productive of <Col N="2518" /> much good.  When the stage is reached that a patient is sent to a sanatorium&mdash; at least as things are at the present time&mdash;the disease is gone too far and something must be done before it has developed.  My experience is that most of the cases that have been sent to a sanatorium do not live, or in the case where the patient does not die in a short time he is certainly very much impaired for the time he lives.  The examination of children should begin in the schools; even earlier perhaps, but certainly at the schools.  I agree with the Deputies who have said that the medical inspection of children is not at all satisfactory.  That is not to say that the doctors do not do it thoroughly.  I was present when a medical officer of health examined the children of a school and I never saw anything so thorough in my life.  It took two days to examine a comparatively small school, but by doing it in that way the doctor would only get round to each school once in five or six years and the children would probably never again be examined by a medical officer of health.  Although we are now getting an assistant medical officer, I say that it will not be sufficient to examine the children in a reasonable time and I think that the dispensary doctors should be called in to assist.  There have been many complaints about the manifold duties which are piled on to the dispensary doctor, but at the same time they live in the district and have only a short distance to go to the school.  By doing this, the delicate child could be marked out and treated in time.  Although they are very few, these school examinations are very good indeed.  I have seen children suffering from various diseases who were treated promptly in the county hospital.  Their health was very much improved, they got to be fine strong healthy children and grew up, no doubt, into fine, strong, healthy men and women.</P>
    <P>As well as an examination, I think there should be a campaign of instruction in the schools to teach children how to behave themselves in various ways.  There was an item on the programme many years ago which they used to call &ldquo;health and habits&rdquo; and &ldquo;domestic economy.&rdquo;  That was struck <Col N="2519" /> off, but some instruction as to how to behave themselves should be given to children.  If nothing else, they should, for example, be taught the danger of spitting out and running the danger of spreading disease.  It is a very objectionable habit in itself and may be the cause of spreading infection.  The children should be taught also the necessity of cleanliness in the school and at home.  I think these things are very essential if we are to have healthy people.</P>
    <P>At a later stage of life children go to places of amusement.  I cannot imagine how young and old people, particularly young people, can go into packed dance halls and picture houses without running grave risks of infection. If people who suffer from tuberculosis or other diseases are in the crowd, it is very hard to see how all the other people can escape from getting infected.  I believe that many of our dance halls and picture houses are entirely overcrowded at times.  I am not talking at random.  I am speaking from experience.  In my own neighbourhood I have seen several families who contracted tuberculosis and several members of these families were wiped out. I am quite sure that they got the disease in the first instance from getting colds in dance halls or after leaving dance halls.  I know we cannot stop people from going to dances, but we can try to teach them the dangers of coming out in the cold without proper protective clothing.  Youth, of course, will take risks.  Many of the healthiest people I know got tuberculosis because they were too strong and healthy and took no precautions.  There will have to be precautions taken, apart from treatment in sanatoria.</P>
    <P>Tuberculosis is certainly a very great danger and has taken toll of many thousands of lives in this country.  But there is another disease which I would say kills many more people, and that is cancer.  I never realised that fully until I began visiting the county hospital. So far as I can see, the greater number of those who die from 45 years upwards die of cancer, in some cases <Col N="2520" /> internal and in many cases external. What the Minister can do about that I do not know, because it appears that no proper remedy has yet been found for that disease.  I am sure that he will co-operate with the people of any country in any way possible in order to find a remedy for that disease.  I do not know that the medical profession have even discovered the cause of it, but it is playing havoc in this country. I was recently speaking to a man who was home from the United States and he said the position is the same in that country, that from middle age upwards many more die from that disease than from any other.</P>
    <P>I very strongly commend the Minister for what he is doing and for the earnestness with which he is trying to provide sanatoria for people infected with tuberculosis.  His efforts, however, must not stop there.  General hospitals are very badly required throughout the country.  Roscommon is, perhaps, one of the few lucky counties.  We have got there one of the finest hospitals in the country, and possibly one of the finest of its size in any country.  There are other counties not so fortunate and in that way, of course, the necessity for up-to-date hospitals arises.  There is no use in saying, as one Deputy said, that finance should not count.  That is a very nice thing to say, but when it comes to doing these things you have to count the cash.  At the same time, all reasonable attention should be given to general hospitalisation as well as to the provision of sanatoria.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister belongs to a Party who were never in opposition to the Public Health Act. That is a very strong recommendation for him.  That does not apply to all the Parties however.  He has got a good groundwork provided for him.  Everything was not done no doubt, but still a great deal was done.  The foundations were laid and it is pleasing to think that the new Minister is prepared to work on these foundations.  I was very glad to see that he paid a tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, for what he had been doing.  We must bear in mind, however, that Deputy Dr. Ryan was only a short time in that <Col N="2521" /> Department and I think that others also deserve credit.</P>
    <P>There are many people besides the Minister and the officials who are interested in public health The members of the Roscommon Board of Health have at all times been intensely interested in this question.  It is one thing that we always put up money for.  Time and again, the late Reverend Mother Paul, who was matron of Roscommon County Home, asked for various things and I cannot recollect any occasion on which we refused her.  We always made provision for the things which she considered necessary.  When the county hospital was provided we did the same thing.  We are now adding an additional wing for the nurses as we have an additional nursing staff.  I am sure the Minister will be favourable to having better conditions for the nurses. Conditions have improved almost one hundredfold since I first became acquainted with work in hospitals.  The hours may be somewhat long and the pay may not be as good as it should be but, on the whole, I think the nurses are much more content than they were in the past.  The conditions in Roscommon were desperate for a long time.</P>
    <P>As to conditions in England attracting nurses there.  I do not know that that is so much the case as is thought. I know that a lot of young girls who were not able to enter hospitals here went to England to be trained.  Many of them, however, have come home and are coming home.  I do not know that there is a great attraction across the water for Irish nurses and that the conditions generally there are so favourable.  I have met some of these nurses and they certainly were not so terribly impressed with the conditions across the water.  In any event, it is becoming a problem which, I am sure, the Minister will be able to tackle, and, if it involves more expenditure, the State and the local authorities will face the situation.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, a possibility of training more nurses locally.  In Roscommon we asked for permission to train nurses in the county hospital. One of the difficulties was the lack of accommodation for the nurses.  I think <Col N="2522" /> that there could be a good many nurses trained and very well trained in local hospitals.  So far as Roscommon is concerned, I have no hesitation in saying that they would get a training there which would be second to none in the country.  There is an excellent staff there, an excellent surgeon and assistant surgeon, and doctors and nurses of the highest order.  I have no hesitation in saying that the training of nurses could be undertaken in our hospital.  Accommodation for the nurses may be the one drawback.</P>

      <P>I do not tend to pay encomiums to any Minister, but nothing would give me greater pleasure than to say a few words in praise of the Minister in charge of the present Estimate. On behalf of the people of Louth, I congratulate him on his accession to this Ministry.  Those in our county who have direct contact with him, as well as the people generally, are very well pleased that the present Minister is in charge of that most important aspect of Irish life, the aspect of health and, in particular, public health.  Not only has the present Minister proven that he is energetic, to which many other Deputies have paid tribute, but his persistence and efficiency augur well for the progress of the Department under his leadership.  As well as the efficiency which has marked his attention to his duties I think tribute should be paid to his courtesy in attending to various aspects of his work.  I was particularly struck by the manner in which, due, perhaps, to his medical training, the Minister sought not only to relieve the distress of the patients who would indirectly come under his care but, which is equally important, to relieve the distress of the relatives of the patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee has evidently paid little attention to what I have been saying.  I was paying a tribute to the Minister for giving his personal attention, and obviously&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to what Deputy Connolly was saying. Deputy Connolly obviously did not <Col N="2523" /> know that the scheme under which subsistence allowances are given to those who are suffering from infectious diseases and provision is made for their dependents was introduced not by the present Minister but by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.  I was not referring to the dependents' allowances but I was referring to the personal courtesy of the Minister in alleviating the mental distress&mdash;not the pecuniary distress&mdash;of relatives of patients in whom he became interested through my representations. There are large sections in my constituency where there appears to be a high incidence of tuberculosis. Each and every patient of that disease, as everybody must know, considers that he or she is the most urgent case and that as the occasion arises a bed must forthwith be provided or special treatment placed at his or her disposal.  The relatives of such patients are often frantic in their representations that something should be done immediately for the patient.  Most Deputies in the House must, from their own experience, realise that that is so. In respect of all such cases I wish to pay tribute to the manner in which the present Minister&mdash;in his personal capacity if you like&mdash;did what perhaps would be more effective than merely giving pecuniary benefit.  He gave that mental alleviation to the patients' relatives which will be of inestimable value in promoting cures in these cases.  As everyone knows there is, in the case of tuberculosis, a very subtle and insidious action and inter-action between the mental condition of the patient and their dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the allowances for dependents of tuberculosis sufferers under the Infectious Diseases Act, with the operations of which I am quite well acquainted, I wish to point out that in Louth the Minister might do something, if it lies in his power, to speed up the payment of these allowances to the dependents.  There seems to me to be unnecessary delay and undue secrecy, regimentation and red-tape, in regard to the payment of these moneys.  I can understand perfectly <Col N="2524" /> well that the Department desires to protect the people who are in receipt of these moneys from any undue publicity. My experience, on the contrary, is that people so affected who desire to have the payment of these moneys are at no pains to hide the fact that they suffer from this disease.  They make the fact that they are in need of this assistance quite public.  As far as I can ascertain, there does not appear to be any real reason why these allowances should be paid at such a slow rate.  It certainly would be beneficial in many cases in the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk if anything could be done in this matter by the Minister through his Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the attention that the local authorities should pay to the provision of chalets for patients.  I understand that in many cases there is no proper inspection and no proper attention given to the maintenance of these chalets.  There should be some circularisation of the local authorities upon the necessity of making and keeping these chalets habitable so that they can be of benefit to those patients who are using them at present.  To give a patient a chalet which is not waterproof or weatherproof, and make that patient run the risk of further deterioration of his condition, is certainly not a thing that should recommend itself to local authorities who are conscious of their obligations in regard to the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that matter which has been touched upon by some Deputies is the question of the spread of tuberculosis by infection.  The incidence of the disease in County Louth may be due to the fact that there are quite a number of factories in Drogheda and Dundalk.  Although I have no figures on the matter it would be interesting to ascertain the incidence of the disease in the boot and shoe factories in both Dundalk and Drogheda.  It is a matter of some concern to the workers in these factories and to the trade unions.  It was stated by an authority that every sufferer from tuberculosis is liable to spread the infection to nine other people.  If that is so the danger of the spread of tuberculosis in these factories must be a matter of real concern to the <Col N="2525" /> workers.  Some scheme might be considered by the Minister whereby definite cases of tuberculosis would be removed from these factories to prevent the spread of infection.  Such a scheme may be possible.  I know that the workers would be prepared, provided that the State makes some contribution and provided the employers make some contribution, to pay a weekly levy so that their fellow-workers suffering from this disease could be taken out of the factory until they are permanently cured of it. That is a matter of prevention really and I think it is one which should receive the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to hospital inspection.  In this connection the Minister might perhaps consider the present practice.  It is doubtful whether the method now adopted is the best one.  If the inspection of a hospital relates purely to the medical aspect of it, then no one is better qualified than a doctor to carry out that inspection.  In regard to the other aspects, in regard to the conditions under which the nurses and the members of the staff work and the living conditions generally, inspection might more appropriately be carried out by a layman.  A doctor inspecting a hospital is placed in the invidious position of criticising the work and administration of a member of his own profession.  Doctors, like solicitors, are notoriously good trade unionists. For that reason it is unlikely that they will do as well as a layman might do in the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the county hospital in Dundalk.  For years the people of the district have regarded it with something approaching horror.  It is in a very bad state.  Nothing has been done about it.  Recently I received representations in regard to conditions there and I conveyed these to the Minister.  I am certain the matter will be handled in the routine fashion and that in due course a report will be placed at the disposal of the Minister in regard to this hospital.  I am sure that a good deal of criticism can be directed against other old institutions in the country.  I know there are alarming rumours from time to time about these institutions.  I do <Col N="2526" /> not want to be a scaremonger, but I take it that there must be some truth in these rumours.</P>
    <P>I understand it is the intention of the Minister to abolish this institution altogether and give the people of Dundalk a proper hospital.  For that reason I do not intend to dwell at any great length upon the drawbacks of the present institution.  I am sure the conditions there are not due to the present staff.  I am sure it is not their fault. It is, in my opinion, a hang-over from the past.  The position to-day is probably due to a lack of initiative in meeting changing times with new conditions. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that the provision of a proper hospital for Dundalk will receive speedy and prompt attention. I was pressed to talk strongly upon this matter but I think it is better now to leave it in the hands of the Minister. When the Minister has a report at his disposal he can then put it before the House as an example of some of the buildings which have been handed over to him and which are an enormous liability to him in his scheme of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured us that a large number of new hospitals will be erected.  It is inevitable that there will be certain bottlenecks in the provision of these buildings.  Difficulties will be due not so much to a lack of finance as to a lack of labour and materials.  The building trade unions are acutely conscious of the need for hospitals and they will co-operate in every way with the Minister in speeding up his programme. If the Minister will approach the trade unions he will get all the co-operation, encouragement and assistance he needs in carrying out his programme. I would suggest to the Minister that he might examine, with the concurrence of the Department of Finance, the possibility of some scheme of post-emergency credits or post-hospitalisation credits as an inducement to the workers to engage in the building of these hospitals.  I do not want to go into that matter at any great length. I merely throw it out as a suggestion. It may prove useful in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to mass radiography, I have not heard it mentioned, but it is <Col N="2527" /> a very important feature of the prevention side of disease and I think that the Minister and the Department would do well to extend the operations of mass radiography as much as possible. I know there may be a shortage of material and a shortage of skilled personnel, but every effort should be made to see that the idea of mass radiography is extended.  I have had a personal acquaintance with it in Dublin and I wish to pay a high tribute to the doctor and those others who are engaged in doing the work for the Dublin Corporation.  They do it in a very efficient manner; they are very thorough and nothing could be better than the way in which they manage the work.  All that I and others who have noted their work would wish is that it would be extended, in the first instance to the towns, and then to the country districts.  There should be a number of mobile units organised and sent to towns and rural districts.  Perhaps it would be possible in many of these towns and districts to utilise equipment, such as old railway carriages, as depots for carrying out this work of mass radiography.  A suitable type of propaganda should accompany these units.  Not only should they be units for carrying out the technical side of mass radiography, but they should carry a definite message to our people for the prevention of diseases of all forms.</P>
    <P>I should like, in passing, to refer to local bodies.  I am sure the Minister will receive the co-operation of these local bodies.  With the aid of the Minister, they should be able to carry on a programme for the production of better health services than we have had heretofore.  It is undoubtedly a fact that in the past&mdash;not in the immediate past, but in the past of our history&mdash; these local bodies have lagged behind in using the powers they possessed, particularly for the promotion of health; but, under the present Administration, particularly under the Minister for Health, I hope that that idea will finally be superseded by the idea that health is the most important thing that we can have.  If we have not got a sound health service, if we have not got clean living in clean <Col N="2528" /> habitations in clean cities, then we are not building the nation that the best of our race laid down their lives in order to create.</P>
    <P>I shall finish with a slight quotation from a work of my father which, I think, sums up very well the policy of the Labour Party with reference to health, and I commend it to the Minister as an inspiration to him in his work.  Referring to these local bodies in his work, <i>The Reconquest of Ireland,</i> he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Representative institutions should be an expression of the soul of the race and, as the soul directs the activities of the body in a clean or unclean direction, so shall our representative governing bodies make for or against clean living in clean habitations in a clean State.  It is well to remember that the Conquest never interfered with the right or power of the individual in Ireland to grow rich by betraying or surrendering the nation.  It was only against the nation and those who identified themselves with it that the Conquest was directed. Hence, the reversal of the Conquest implies the assertion of the rights and the powers of the community, city or nation over against those of the individual.  The Conquest was in Irish politics the victory of the capitalist conception of law and the functions of law.  The Reconquest will be the victory of the working-class conception, the re-establishment of the power of the community over the conditions of life that assist or retard the development of the individual.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputies who are familiar with the history of this Department will, I think, agree with me that we have seldom listened in this House to a more dishonest speech than that which has been inflicted upon us by Deputy Connolly.  How dishonest it is I hope will appear in the course of the remarks which I have to make.  The Deputy, in concluding, mentioned that hitherto the local authorities have been reluctant to develop their health services and he trusted that henceforward, under this Administration, their future record <Col N="2529" /> would be better than their past one has been.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except to say that all seems yellow to the jaundiced eye. If the local authorities are going to do better in the future than in the past&mdash; and I sincerely hope they do&mdash;it will be because of one of the Acts which was passed by the Fianna Fáil Administration last year in order to enable the local authorities to implement the Fianna Fáil plans for improving the health services of our people.  Under that Act the State assumed financial responsibility for all the expenditure which would be incurred by the local authorities in improving their health services up to the point at which the cost would be evenly divided between the central authority and the local authority.  That certainly is a very much greater incentive to the local authorities to do their duty to their people in regard to public health matters than was given to them by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when it was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote asks the Dáil to provide the sum of £1,355,590 for the Department of Health.  That is a very large sum. I suppose if a Fianna Fáil Minister had been introducing it we should have heard from the Opposition Benches that it is an extravagant sum.  We should have been told that the Minister <Col N="2530" /> was unnecessary, that his staff was unnecessary and that all this £1,355,590 was going to do was to swell the bureaucracy which was battening on the producers of this country.  That is the sort of speech we used to listen to when Fianna Fáil was in power and the present Ministers were in opposition.</P>
    <P>This Estimate for £1,355,590 was prepared by a Fianna Fáil Government. It is introduced into this House by a Coalition Minister.  Notwithstanding statements which we heard from every election platform during the last election that Fianna Fáil had been guilty of wanton extravagance, the Minister has not suggested that there is anything extravagant in this Estimate.  He is, in fact, in the same position as his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, was when he sponsored in this House the Estimate which had been prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government for that Department, in the same position as the Minister for Justice was in relation to the Estimate for Justice, in exactly the same position as the Minister for Education will be and every other member of that Government when they come to present to this House the Estimates which make up the £70,000,000 odd which constitutes the sum necessary to meet the requirements of the Supply Services during the coming year.</P>
    <P>This Estimate must be the occasion of great surprise to many.  Any person looking for consistency would be surprised that a Government dominated by the Fine Gael Party should present such an Estimate.  Any person looking for consistency in the members of the Clann na Poblachta Party should be surprised at a member of that Party presenting an Estimate in which the sum of £2,125 is provided for the salary of the Minister.  Any person looking for consistency in the present occupant of the office of Minister of Health should be doubly surprised because, a short time ago, the present Minister for Health told the electorate that in his view the present salary, the salary which he is now drawing, was at least £10 a week too high.  He has not even suggested to the House that that economy of £520 per year should be made at his expense, despite the fact <Col N="2531" /> that we are saving £500 on cutting down Government advertisements when they are printed in the Irish language, despite the fact that we put into abeyance the Irish Place Names Commission in order to save a similar minute sum.  These other economies when they are related to the propagation of the language are thought to be significant economies but a Minister, representing a Party which made its principal plea to the electorate the fact that a Minister's salary was £2,125 comes in here, and unabashed, presents an Estimate to the House which contains a sub-head providing that sum for him.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as criticising the size of the salary attached to the office of Minister for Health.  If a man is fit to occupy the responsible position of head of any Department of State in this country he is certainly worth £2,125 and is worth, in fact, a great deal more.  I am merely pointing out the shallow hypocrisy of those who, during the last election campaign, made that the basis of one of their principal appeals to the public.  The Minister for Lands smiles; yet he is in the position of a man that his one-time colleague, Deputy Cogan, described as getting away with the fruits of a smash-and-grab raid.</P>

      <P>This Estimate affords an opportunity to review what was done, during its first working year, by the present Department of Health which was set up by the Act passed in December, 1946.  In my opening remarks, I commented on the fact that any person looking for consistency would be surprised at a Government dominated by the Fine Gael Party presenting an Estimate to this House for the Department of Health, because the fact of the matter is that, if the Fine Gael Party had their way, the present Department of Health would not be in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act which established that Department, the first year's working of which is now under review, was passed in face of bitter and unscrupulous opposition by the Party opposite.  The present Minister for Defence, himself a medical man, led that opposition.  In the course of his speech he described the Ministries of Health and Social Welfare as &ldquo;expensive, extravagant and unwanted Ministries&rdquo;&mdash;the reference is to col. 1134, Vol. 103&mdash;which, he said, a little reorganisation, a little <Col N="2533" /> simplification inside the Department, as it then was of Local Government and Public Health, would remove.</P>
    <P>If, Sir, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare are expensive, extravagant and unwanted Ministries, as the Minister for Defence described them a short time ago, why is this Estimate for the large sum of £1,355,590 sponsored by the Fine Gael Party for the Department of Health?  That is a query which, I think, the Minister must answer.  Throughout the course of an extremely long speech, his colleague, the Minister for Defence, piled sophistry upon sophistry and misrepresentation upon misrepresentation in order to persuade the taxpayers that the Department of Health should not be established.  He was followed in that course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Clearly, it is a matter of policy whether a Department of Health should be established or not.  That has been clearly decided by the Dáil and the Estimate now before the House is in respect of the administration of the Department of Health.  The policy has already been established and there can be no question that that was what was decided in the Dáil on the presentation of the Bill and by the passing of that Bill, so that the Deputy cannot go back and tell the House what various Ministers said on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does he not publish the commissioner's report and let the public know about the lax way in which the stores of that institution were handled, amongst other things? But, leaving that to one side, what I am going to ask is this&mdash;why does not the Minister publish the report of the nutritional survey which was initiated by his predecessor, which was initiated in fact by Dr. Ward and was carried on under the supervision of Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister's predecessor, and which has been completed in so far as the most populous area of this country is concerned?  Why does not the Minister publish that?</P>
      <P>The Minister should publish that because the Minister is one of the people who has created a great deal of uneasiness in the public mind as to the prevalence of malnutrition among our people.  Over his own name the Minister wrote that &ldquo;for our people there have been schemes, plans, promises, poverty and malnutrition&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister alleged a short time ago was the condition of affairs in this country.  The report of the nutritional survey is there to show whether that statement of the present Minister for Health was true or not, to show whether his word in relation to matters of public health is to be relied on or not.  The report of the nutritional survey has not yet been published although it has been completed in respect of the City of Dublin.  Why has not it been published?  Is it because that report would give the Minister the lie and would show that, in fact, so far from there being widespread malnutrition in this country, the standard of living of our people from the point of view of nutrition is as high almost as that of any people in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his opening remarks, referred to the problem of hospital deficits.  I was not able to be present on the occasion upon which he was introducing this Estimate.  It was out of no discourtesy to the Minister that I was absent.  I should have liked to have been here to have heard what he had to say on these problems with which I had been intimately concerned for so many years. <Col N="2538" /> However, I have only the newspaper reports to go upon but, according to the newspaper report of his speech, I understand that the hospital deficits have now reached such a figure that practically the whole of the amount which is at present in the Hospitals Trust Fund, or to the extent of at least £10,000,000 of it, is being held to provide for current hospital deficits.  The deficits on existing voluntary institutions seem to be increasing more rapidly than the Hospitals Trust Fund is growing.</P>
    <P>There is, however, as against this, a very grave shortage of beds.  Even to provide one-half of the beds which are urgently wanted, the Minister will have to spend&mdash;he told the House&mdash; £15,000,000.  Where is he going to get that £15,000,000?  It is certainly not in sight and, in so far as it was coming from revenue provided by the sweepstakes, there is some reason to fear that that revenue may dry up.  What then is to become of our hospital programme?  I say &ldquo;our hospital programme&rdquo; deliberately because it was the Fianna Fáil Government which prepared and drafted that programme and had been making plans to implement it. Is the Minister going to continue to freeze the £10,000,000 which, as I have said, is practically the whole of the amount which is now in the Hospitals Trust Fund, in order to meet existing hospital deficits, while beds are so urgently required?</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech spoke about the need for economical expenditure in the hospitals, but what is he doing to enforce the necessary economies?  So far, the Minister's administration could scarcely be described as an economical one.  There were many things at issue between those who had been responsible, before him, for the administration of the Department of Health and one or other of the branches of the profession to which he belongs.  They were at issue because it was thought that the demands which were being made upon the public purse for the services which were going to be rendered were extravagant demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I have said, so far has not indicated, in so far as <Col N="2539" /> his public actions might manifest it, that he is imbued by any spirit of economy when dealing with his professional brethren.  He seems in fact to be in a mood to surrender to them all along the line and then to brag about his generosity at the expense of the taxpayer and of the public purse.  But the responsibility for providing the new hospital accommodation so urgently required is now the Minister's. He has a much better chance of discharging that responsibility than any of his predecessors had.  Materials are more plentiful; labour is in better supply and, so far as funds are concerned, he will not meet with the parsimonious approach from the Opposition in that regard that his predecessor had to endure.</P>
    <P>The urgent hospital requirements of our people are set out in this White Paper which was issued by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  Why does not the Minister, who poses as being most impatient of delay in these matters, who is held up by the Press as a paragon of energy and zeal, get on with that hospital programme? What is holding him up?  Is it the amount of his time which his political peregrinations absorb?  What single new project, in fact, has been initiated by the present occupant of the Ministry of Health since he became a Minister? Every undertaking he has publicised&mdash; the nutritional survey, the regional sanatoria, the proposal to establish St. Kevin's as a post-graduate teaching hospital&mdash;were all planned and developed by his predecessors, and not least among them&mdash;in fairness be it said&mdash;Dr. Ward.  All that the Minister has had to do so far has been to sign on the dotted line, and we all know when he does that he invariably does it with a fanfare of newspaper trumpets. But, apparently, even the ballyhoo with which the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> have endeavoured to put him over on the public does not suffice. Instead of building the hospitals which are so urgently required, the Minister now wants no less than £6,000 to buy a bugle of his own&mdash;or should it be a megaphone?&mdash;in order to tell the people of Ireland what a wonderful Minister for Health has been miraculously given to them.</P>

      <P>I think the £6,000 should provide the Minister with a dozen massed bands, and he and his Press fuglemen or buglemen may blow and blow, but the sick and suffering among our people want an answer to a few simple questions. They want to know when the hospital beds which the Minister undertook to provide for them with the greatest expedition are going to be forthcoming.  They want to know when the new medical services which we had planned are going to be made available to them.  They want to know, and we want to know, why he personally is doing nothing to give them any one of these things.  I say why he personally is doing nothing to give them any one of these things, to give the people the hospitals and the improved services which they want.</P>

      <P>I say &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; advisedly, because if the Minister were not there at all, everything that has been done so far would have been done almost automatically.  It would have been done because his predecessors had prepared the plans and put the machine in motion to give effect to those plans, and those projects would have come along in due and regular course, like motor cars from the assembly line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister&mdash;the Minister who is so boosted in the Press&mdash;done of his own initiative?  What new idea, what new approach to our health problem has he conceived?  What progress in fact has he made in giving effect to the plans and proposals of his predecessors?  These are the <Col N="2541" /> questions to which we want an answer. They were put to him categorically by Deputy Dr. Ryan on Tuesday last and we want an answer to them.</P>
    <P>What, for instance, has the Minister done to bring into operation the provisions of the Health Act, 1947&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Health Act&mdash;in relation to mother and child welfare?  As I have said and would again remind the House, that Act of 1947 was passed in the teeth of bitter opposition from the Minister's colleagues.  Why has nothing been done to give effect to the provisions of the Act in relation to mother and child welfare?  We know, of course, that the Minister's colleagues were violently opposed to the Act.  Has the Minister been prevailed on by the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Lands&mdash;all of whom voted against the proposal to establish a Department of Health&mdash; has he been prevailed upon to shelve the provisions of that measure, to put them, like so many other parts of his programme, into abeyance?  If not, why has he not taken steps to make the provisions of that Act effective? Why has the Minister not assisted the local authorities to draft and make the regulations necessary to bring the expanded and improved mother and child welfare services, for which the Act provided, into operation?</P>
    <P>Of course, it is true&mdash;we all know it is true&mdash;that the Minister has been very busy, very busy indeed, very busy touring the country, showing himself off to his political friends as the strangest piece of flotsam the stormy sea of Irish politics has thrown up in three generations.  Again, I ask what has happened to the draft regulations relating to the mother and child welfare services?  The people are much more concerned to hear about these vital matters than to listen to diatribes about an old man growing fat or growing lazy.  The Minister is not very fat, but he appears to be very lazy in regard to the vital concerns of his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, is reported to have deplored&mdash; and rightly deplored&mdash;the high rate of infantile mortality in this country.  He <Col N="2542" /> wants the people to believe that he is more concerned with that dreadful and terrible problem than any of his predecessors were.  But why does he not give the country some concrete proof that such, in fact, is the case, instead of spending his time composing such scurrilities as he used to tickle the ears of his groundlings in Galway recently? Why does not he devote himself to considering and preparing the draft regulations which the local authorities are waiting for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then, Sir, again, what has this Minister, this young man of push and go, as the Press would have the more gullible members of the public believe him to be, what has he actually done to provide the improved facilities?  I am not talking now about regulations to maintain the health of mothers and children, which the Fianna Fáil Act of 1947 was enacted to ensure. Has the Minister expanded or improved the school medical services?  I doubt it.  I think we might all doubt it.  Otherwise, the Minister would have told us about it, metaphorically clapping himself on the back in the process. What has happened&mdash;and I am not going to repeat myself again, Sir&mdash; what has happened to the survey of the county medical services which was being carried out as a preliminary to <Col N="2543" /> formulating detailed proposals for the introduction of expanded medical and clinical services throughout the country?</P>
      <P>Perhaps the fact is that the Minister is not too worried about that side of his Department.  Tuberculosis is his speciality.  As a politician, he has endeavoured to make a political monopoly of tuberculosis.  He is, in fact, I think, a very dangerous influence, a very malign influence, in regard to that serious problem, because he has placed so much emphasis, undue emphasis, upon it, creating a tuberculosis neurosis throughout the country. &ldquo;Tuberculosis Incorporated&rdquo; he and the clique around him might be called. During the course of the year under review, the present Minister made the prevalence of tuberculosis the basis of a political ramp.  He organised a committee of ex-patients, or alleged ex-patients, to run a private election machine for him, under the guise of this committee.  He was mendacious, unscrupulous and unbridled in his attack upon the administration of the Department of Health during the past 12 months.  Here is what was said about the administration of the Department of Health during the past 12 months.</P>

Am I not entitled to take cognisance of what was being said in the public Press of this country about this Department?  I am asking the Minister who is responsible for this Department to deal with these allegations in relation to it.  I am saying that there are people who believe that the last Government was callous in its attitude towards this problem of tuberculosis. Am I not entitled to ask the Minister whether that is true or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is criticism of the administration.  It has been said that the Government which was in office during the year <Col N="2547" /> under review did not care how many people contracted tuberculosis or how long the people who had contracted tuberculosis or had become infected in the manner described had to wait before getting into an out-of-date sanatorium or how much they and their dependents suffered mentally, physically and financially, or how many died of this preventable and curable disease.  That is what is being said outside; that, in fact, is what was said by a committee of people associated either with the present Minister for Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if the Deputy is trying to assign to the Minister words that he did not utter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  So far as that goes, here is the White Paper dealing with an outline of proposals for the improvement of the public services. Previously another White Paper dealing with the problem of tuberculosis was issued.  That has been described as &ldquo;an exuberant White Paper filled with grandiose proposals or promises of thousands of beds, chest hospitals, allowances for dependents, improvement of dispensaries, etc.&rdquo; and this was all, it was alleged by the present Minister for Health, that had been done during the year the administration of which is now under review.  I am going to say this: that though that has been alleged by the present Minister for Health in an article written and signed by him when he was attached to a sanatorium in this country, he must have known, and those who made themselves responsible for that statement must have known, that under the Health Act of 1947, an Act enacted last year by the Oireachtas and introduced by the then Minister for Health, power had been taken to give to necessitous patients, especially married men, adequate financial allowances to tide them over their illness.  I say when that statement was published by the present Minister for Health in criticism of what his predecessor had done last year, the present Minister for Health must have known that that Act had been passed and that, as I have said, those powers had been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2548" /> I will go further.  I will say to the present Minister for Health that when he wrote that article he must have known that a scheme for allowances was actually in draft.  In draft form it had been submitted to the committees of the several sanatoria of the country, including, of course, the committee of Newcastle, on the staff of which Dr. Browne, as he then was, was assistant resident medical superintendent. This is what I want to know.  What more has Dr. Browne done since he took office in the way of expanding or developing the counter tuberculosis campaign than was done by his predecessor?  Where are the mass radiography, the new health clinics, all the things promised by Dr. Browne in his election address, large subsistence allowances for the sick, improved child welfare services, improved medical services?  That is the question I am asking Dr. Browne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>I am asking Dr. Browne, I am asking the Minister for Health, I am asking the Government, what is being done to improve the mass radiography service.  Deputy <Col N="2549" /> Connolly, who spoke in advance of me, put the same question.  He did not put it in precisely the same terms.  He was trying to extenuate the Government he supports, but I am not extenuating it.  I am criticising it and condemning it for not carrying out the promised programme.  I want to know what has become of the new health clinics we were promised, the larger subsistence allowances for the sick, the child welfare services and the medical services.  These are all questions of administration surely.  What is being done to provide these services?  What earnest have we that anything will be done to provide them before we vote this huge amount of £1,355,590?  Of course we know that nothing will be done and that the Minister will have his excuses.  That is one thing that this Government are adept at, however incompetent they may be in other matters.

If the Government sent the cost of living up, making it harder for people to maintain themselves in good health, instead of bringing it down as they undertook to do, it is the fault of the wicked bacon curers, or more remotely, I suppose, it is the fault of the wicked farmers who want higher prices for their pigs, or it is the fault of the wicked butchers, or, again, the wicked farmers who want higher prices for beef.  It is the fault of the wicked industrialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Just as the Government will plead a dozen excuses and put the blame on somebody else for the things they failed to do, so this Minister, when he falls down on the job, when he has failed to provide child welfare or improved tuberculosis services, when there is no acceleration in the rate at which hospital accommodation is being expanded, when nothing is planned or attempted except what was left cut and dried for him by his predecessor, will have glib excuses. &ldquo;He has not had time to do much,&rdquo; his apologists will plead; &ldquo;there are not the materials,&rdquo; he himself says; &ldquo;there are not the men,&rdquo; we will hear from some of the devil's advocates opposite; &ldquo;he has not the money&rdquo;; he has admitted that himself.

      <P>He could write an article entitled &ldquo;Murder Could Not Be Bolder.&rdquo;  He did not then accept any of these things as a valid excuse, and why should the members of this House, who are called upon to vote £1,355,590 of the people's money. accept them as valid excuses?  He would not even accept as an excuse the fact that a world war was raging around this country, that we were the centre of a conflict, that this island was blockaded and that we could not get materials to build hospitals over those dreadful years.  Now when materials are relatively plentiful and yet hospitals are not being built, what excuse, I ask again, has the Minister now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2551" /> The Minister has decided to curtail the Fianna Fáil hospital programme. He announced that in his opening statement and his excuse is that he has not the money.  I suppose I dare not refer to what the Minister said about the question of money, that money would be no obstacle, a few months ago.  But instead of carrying out the full hospital programme as drawn up by his predecessor after an exhaustive study of our hospital needs, the Minister proposes to cut that programme in half.  Money has now become the dominating element in the Minister's Department.  For want of money we must go short of hospitals; for want of money children must die; for want of money new health clinics cannot be built, women must die in childbirth and babies be stillborn.  For want of money the mentally afflicted cannot procure institutional treatment but must drag out their long and weary pilgrimage through the limbo between sanity and madness.  Yet the Government, of which the Minister is a member with collective responsibility for all it has done, has indicated that it is not in need of money, so little in need of it indeed that in recent months it has given millions away.  We have been told that it surrendered no less than £6,000,000 to make champagne cheaper, to make beer cheaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Yet the Minister told the Dáil he does not know how he is going to keep the voluntary hospitals with their mounting deficits going and at the same time provide for the building of the new hospitals which are so urgently required. Is it not relevant in considering that problem to consider what financial arrangements the Minister's Government have made to enable him to solve that difficulty?  We are asked to vote £1,355,000.  If we had a larger revenue, we could vote more money; we could provide the money for the hospitals and for the deficits at the same time.

      <P>£6,000,000 a year would produce the money necessary to complete the whole hospital programme in five years.  Surely when we are being told by the Minister that it is part of his policy to curtail that hospital programme, when an exhaustive study has indicated that we require to spend at least £37,000,000 on providing the country with the hospitals, the county homes, and the infirmaries which it requires, it is relevant to discuss the fact that the Minister is cutting down the necessary expenditure to £15,000,000.  He has already announced that; he has put that matter in issue in this debate. Surely we are entitled to point out that if the Minister and his colleagues had pursued a different policy he would not have to restrict or curtail expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am addressing the Chair.  I want to say that it is a simple computation.  We require £37,000,000. Six million pounds a year for six years would produce £36,000,000.  The other £1,000,000 I suppose we could scrape up in one way or another and we could then carry out the hospital programme outlined in these proposals for the improvement of the health services. But we cannot do that because the Minister for Health does not want the <Col N="2553" /> money.  Apparently, in the view of the Minister for Health, cheap beer, cheap cigarettes, cheap pictures will do more for the health of our people than good food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the present Minister for Health has been fortunate in taking over this Department at the particular time in which he has taken it over.  Judging by the campaign of publicity which the Minister from the time of his appointment up to the <Col N="2554" /> present moment has engaged in one would imagine that no provision whatever had been made for people suffering from tuberculosis, cancer and other diseases and for diseases of children, when the Minister took over office.  It is quite true that in introducing the Estimate he paid a limited tribute to his predecessor.  He has, however, paraded up and down this country and claimed the credit for providing extra beds for tuberculosis patients, changing the mental hospital in Castlerea into a sanatorium, and various other schemes that were already in the hands of the Department and that arrangements had been made to put into execution. One would imagine that prior to the 18th February and to the Minister coming to the Custom House no provision had been made for the sufferers from the various ailments I have enumerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During one of his excursions down the country the Minister thought fit to make a reference to county homes.  I think that if the Minister had as much experience of local bodies as members on all sides of this House have had he would be very slow and very loath to have made the statements that he made.  One can probably put down to the Minister's inexperience of local affairs the statements that he made concerning county homes.  It is quite true that the structure of these buildings may not be all as we would desire. They were erected long before this State was established.  They were buildings that were handed over to the local authorities throughout this country.  The members of this House who, prior to the coming into operation of the County Management Act, were members of boards of health know the conditions in these county homes. They know with what unceasing care and diligent manner the Sisters of the Order of Mercy looked after the inmates in these institutions.  It is a reflection not so much on the members of the public bodies as on the religious Orders in charge of the patients in these institutions that statements which were made should have been made.  I wonder if the Minister for Health is himself familiar with the diet of the inmates of these institutions? He committed himself to a <Col N="2555" /> statement that these patients are getting nothing but soup three times a day.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are familiar with the running of these institutions and who have had some responsibility in the past for them rubbed our eyes when we heard that statement.  If the Minister had been more familiar with these institutions he certainly would not have committed himself to that statement. I trust that, having committed himself to it, he has been informed of the true state of affairs in these institutions and that when he is replying he will take the opportunity of withdrawing the reflection he has cast on all those who are associated with the internal running of these institutions and particularly the religious Orders who are in charge of the diet of the inmates.</P>
    <P>In connection with the structural alterations of county homes, I would point out that it is not since Dr. Browne came into office that this matter has come under consideration. I am sure that the Minister for Health has read the White Paper that was issued by his predecessor in office.  On page 38 of that White Paper, after dealing with the financing of hospitals, the following passage occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Furthermore, existing institutional accommodation for the aged and infirm, and persons suffering from chronic ailments, is far from being satisfactory.  Improved provision will have to be made in due course for this purpose.  Replacement would, however, mean an eventual additional capital outlay in the neighbourhood of £13,000,000. The work cannot, therefore, be undertaken until the more pressing needs of the acutely ill have been met.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a fair statement of the position. However, without even touching on the county homes the Minister for Health is only able to make provision for £15,000,000 over the next seven years for the more necessary hospitalisation needs of the country.  I am sure that the estimate contained in that White Paper in regard to county homes is a pretty accurate estimate and, if the <Col N="2556" /> Minister wants to make a job of it, he will have to provide&mdash;in addition to the £15,000,000&mdash;the extra £13,000,000 as well.  Statements of that kind, coming from a Minister, are not very tactful and they are certainly not in the interests of public health.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to go into the details of the various measures that Fianna Fáil introduced into this House and put into operation throughout the country to help the aged and the infirm.  I thought that the Minister for Health would have taken the opportunity that this Vote afforded to pay tribute to the various voluntary organisations throughout the country which are doing such good work in connection with tuberculosis.  I refer in particular to the campaign which has been carried on for a number of years by the Irish Red Cross Society.  The Irish Red Cross Society have done good work and they deserve more encouragement from the State than they are at the moment receiving for the work they are doing in endeavouring to educate public opinion in regard to the prevention and the cure <Col N="2557" /> of tuberculosis.  When a Department of State gets the co-operation and the assistance of widespread, well-organised public opinion such as is behind the Irish Red Cross Society advantage should be taken of it.  Any encouragement and assistance that can be given to the members of that society should be given in order to help them to continue the good work in which they are already engaged.  I should like to say also that there are some Departments of State over and above others whose activities, if possible, should not be mixed up with politics.  If that applies to one Department more than to another it applies to the Department of Health.  Health is a matter which concerns every citizen of the country no matter what his political creed may be.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Health wants&mdash; and I am sure he does&mdash;to get the co-operation of every citizen of the State in a campaign to improve the health of the State he should avoid as far as possible being actively engaged on a political tour at the same time as he is carrying out work in connection with his Department.  That has happened on at least one occasion during the present Minister's régime.  I think it is a pity that that should happen in connection with the Minister for Health.  If we want to get the co-operation and the assistance of every citizen of this country, irrespective of politics, I would appeal to the Minister to keep the work of his Department as far removed as possible from active politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan referred the other night to the question of additional sanatoria. I was very interested in the provision of extra sanatoria for patients in Donegal.  Some time ago&mdash;I must admit it was long before the present Minister took office&mdash;a building became vacant in Donegal which would be suitable for housing tuberculosis patients. Steps were taken by the local authority with regard to this matter and negotiations have been carried on between them and the Department for the last 12 months.  The unfortunate part is that the building is still idle and accommodation for tuberculosis patients is still lacking.  A month or six <Col N="2558" /> weeks ago I raised this matter by way of question.</P>
    <P>I was told by the Minister then that there was no undue delay so far as his Department was concerned.  Though he did not state so explicitly, he left it to be inferred that the cause of the delay was due to the local authority. I question that.  I think if the Minister examines the matter he will find that he has got all the assistance, co-operation and help that the public authority could give.  Out of courtesy to the local authority, I sent a copy of the Minister's reply to the county manager.  I have been told that on the very day my Question was down for consideration and answer on the Order Paper, and days subsequent to that, decisions which had been held up for a considerable time were taken.  I do not raise this matter in any contentious spirit.  I am sure the Minister and his Department are as anxious as I am to provide extra accommodation for tuberculosis patients.  I would appeal to the Minister and his Department to speed up their end of the work.  There has been a good deal of correspondence in connection with architects, consulting engineers, central heating and lighting.  If we were really in earnest about making this provision I think a good deal of intermediate work could be cut out.  There are ways and means whereby heating and lighting could be dealt with quite expeditiously.  There are ways and means in which small alterations could be carried out much more expeditiously than they have been in the past.  I trust that, having raised the matter here this evening, something will now be done to bring it to a successful conclusion.  This building to which I have referred is quite suitable for the purpose.  It has been lying idle for the last 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the hospitalisation scheme for County Donegal.  It is some years since the local authority and the members of the Hospital Commission had meetings, discussions, and drew up plans for the purpose of providing a county hospital.  The site has been purchased as long as 11 years. So far we have not got the hospital.  In reply to a Question raised by another Donegal Deputy some time ago the <Col N="2559" /> Minister indicated that it would be necessary, in view of the modern trend in hospitalisation, to prepare new plans, appoint new architects and go over the whole ground again.  Plans were prepared ten years ago.  They were then supposed to be quite up to date.  They were in accordance with hospitalisation schemes being carried out on the Continent at that time.  Very little hospitalisation has been done on the Continent since and I think those plans would be sufficiently up to date for utilisation now.  Had the hospital been completed at that time it would have been considered quite satisfactory. The people would have been amply satisfied with it.  The present approach seems to me to be merely a delaying device.  It is suggested now that, in order to take its place in the queue again, Donegal must go through the whole formula.  I would appeal to the Minister to cut out as much of the trimmings as he possibly can and to provide us with the money so that we can go ahead with the county hospital in Donegal.  Donegal is the third largest county in the State.  It is far removed from the specialists and leading hospitals in the City of Dublin and elsewhere.  We have a very strong claim for a county hospital.  We have surgeons in the county operating in the existing institutions; they are severely handicapped in their work.  If we had a proper hospital with up-to-date equipment the probability is that many lives would be saved.</P>
    <P>Provision was also made in the plans for the erection of two district hospitals&mdash;one in Donegal town and the other in Carndonagh.  I do not know whether plans were actually prepared for these, but sites were certainly inspected. The scheme was in process of examination and preparation when war broke out.  Building ceased completely then.  District hospitals are vitally essential in Donegal and the erection of them should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.  These are the principal matters I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  If he indicates that he is prepared to go ahead with the building of a county hospital in Donegal I can assure him that he will get all the assistance and co-operation <Col N="2560" /> the county manager and the local authority can give him.</P>

      <P>When I heard the Minister for Health announce the details of his Estimate, although I had become accustomed to surprises in regard to the acts of the inter-Party Government since the election, I was more than amazed to hear the Minister speak of a reduction in the amount of finance to be allocated for hospital reconstruction while, at the same time, he made it perfectly clear that the full programme is not to be implemented, with indications as to the reasons for that decision.  During the election we heard from the Party to which the Minister belongs the most wildly exaggerated accounts of the condition of destitution and disease in which the people live.</P>
      <P>We were told that the modest sum afforded for an increase in the salaries of judges and members of the Dáil was preventing hospital construction.  We were told that if the system of finance in this country was changed enough millions could be raised to provide all the hospitals required in a very short time, and that it was due to the negligence of the former Minister for Health and to our outmoded system of finance that the programme had not been carried out already.  We were told also that materials were no bar to hospital construction.  We were informed by speaker after speaker from the new Party platforms that vast amounts of materials had been used for the reconstruction of luxury hotels for tourist purposes, and cinemas.  We, of course, informed the public that the total amount allowed for these uses was some 5 per cent. of all available building materials but, nevertheless, the talk went on that if only they could stop the building of cinemas and the construction of luxury hotels all the materials necessary would be available for this hospital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal point made was that it was simply the act of an outworn Government and the utilisation of an outworn system of finance that was holding back a most magnificent programme of hospital development, when there would be free treatment for everyone in the hospitals.  We were told that we were holding back a vast <Col N="2561" /> system of social welfare services, representing a total amount of £2,000,000 per annum.  Now we see the present Minister for Health imbued very thoroughly with the Fine Gael mentality, which is so evident in all the Estimates that are presented to the House.</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister's introductory statement.  I had occasion to make note of an observation by the Minister for External Affairs when speaking on the question of Marshall aid.  The Minister for External Affairs, on the 1st July, column 2001 of the Parliamentary Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The medical health tables indicate that the majority of the population of this country bears all the signs&mdash;I am not speaking of the upper classes or the middle classes&mdash;of under-nourishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would rather we had no Marshall aid than have any attempt to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the American people or the American Government by making a statement of that kind.</P>

Surely, it is proper for us to discuss the general views of the inter-Party Government on conditions of health in so far as they relate to under-nourishment? Surely, it is a very vital matter for the Minister to advert to under-nourishment when deciding what measures he intends to take for its prevention?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give plenty of examples of under-nourishment in this country.  I am aware there are areas in Dublin City where there is under-nourishment, and it should be the duty of the Minister to see that every measure is taken advantage of to secure that adequate quantities of the right kind of food are procured for the people concerned.  I am referring to the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, implying that what must be a very large majority of the rural population are undernourished. I suggest the statement is not in any way true.  I would like the Minister for Health to tell me whether, in the course of his administration, he has adverted to the figures for malnutrition given in the reports of the medical officers of health for the areas of all Ireland and whether he regards those figures as being grossly inaccurate and as indicating a state of nutrition which, in fact, is far less than it would appear to be.  So far as I can recall in Longford and Westmeath&mdash;to our shame I may admit&mdash;there is some I per cent of the children who show signs of malnutrition.  There are in some counties as much as 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical officers of health may have perhaps too modest a view of what is malnutrition.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he wishes to contradict these reports or whether he claims that they are fairly accurate and whether, in the light of that, he wishes to uphold the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs, that the majority of the people are undernourished. <Col N="2563" /> I would rather see us getting no Marshall aid if we are to secure it by making statements of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat a question put by other Deputies as to whether the Minister intends to publish the report of the inquiry of the Committee on Dietetics.  As Deputy Dockrell indicated, there are undoubtedly areas in Dublin where malnutrition exists and the public should have an opportunity of reading that report and hearing what steps the Minister is taking to overcome the undesirable conditions indicated in that report.  The Minister will be well aware that the consumption of milk in Dublin has largely increased in recent years and there may be other indications that the position has improved in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, in connection with the health campaign he intends to undertake, he has considered that it is desirable that the food voucher system be paid for out of local authority funds, or whether he will not give more encouragement to the issue of food vouchers by continuing Government grants for that purpose. That would appear to be contrary to the general spirit in which the Minister fought the election.  I would also like to ask him whether he has considered that it might be desirable to alter the conditions under which school meals grants are made and arrange so as to provide for a fuller type of meal in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I now come to the White Paper published by the former Government on the reorganisation of the health services. It will be recalled that the Public Health Act provided for mother and child welfare schemes, for the overhaul of all health inspections and the overhaul of all the administration relating to the prevention of infection. The same Act provided for the appointment of dispensary nurses.  I understand it will take some time before the services of nurses adequately trained for this purpose can be availed of.  These nurses have to be trained, not only as ordinary general nurses, but trained to do propaganda work among the people&mdash;trained to go into <Col N="2564" /> their homes and follow up cases of disease or malnutrition.  They have to be people of remarkable character and personality.</P>
    <P>Have the regulations been published yet for the appointment of such nurses?  Have any efforts been made to see if nurses are not available in sufficient numbers that their training is commenced?  Have the conditions being specified for their appointment? Has the Jubilee Nursing Association been contacted to ascertain if it could help in the training of these nurses, having regard to its magnificent work and its great tradition in this country? It would seem to me that the provision of these nursing services is vital to the improvement of health and, in particular, to the improvement of preventive health work of the local authorities, and that the Minister should give particular attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>Another plan made by the previous Government provided for the establishment of health clinics.  I notice that the Minister said very little in reference to that matter.  At present the dispensaries, as the House knows, have an atmosphere relating more or less to the cure of sickness.  It would be a tremendous advance to have health clinics where people would normally come for consultation, where they would receive advice as to the best methods of keeping fit and where they could receive treatment when they became sick.  I hope the Minister will consider that question as being of equal importance to the provision of hospitals. It is quite obvious that in this country the incidence of disease is related to a very considerable degree to the late notification of disease.  People constantly wait too long before consulting a physician and as a result deaths from various types of disease are more numerous here than in other countries.  That is the main reason for the high mortality from certain diseases.  There are, of course, social and economical reasons, but late notification and the lack of desire to acquire modern knowledge on health matters and the treatment of disease is surely a contribution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I should next like to ask the Minister as to whether he considers that in his plan for the prevention and treatment <Col N="2565" /> of tuberculosis, radiography should play a greater part.  I understand that some 20,000 persons were inspected in the Dublin area alone by radiographic examination for tuberculosis during the period of office of the last Government. I understand that there was some difficulty in procuring apparatus and still greater difficulty in procuring travelling vans for carrying the radiographic apparatus.  I should like to ask the Minister how many vans have been ordered and at what dates, and how many are likely to be secured in order that the work of examination can proceed throughout the country and in order that people living in rural areas in very modest circumstances can be afforded an opportunity of being X-rayed, not far from their own homes.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that late notification of tuberculosis is again a contributory cause to the high death-rate. A great many persons could be treated in their own homes provided the housing conditions were suitable if we had more of these vans, more examinations and an earlier attack upon tuberculosis when it is found to exist.  It will be recalled that during the last 15 years the mortality from tuberculosis slightly decreased and at the beginning of the war it rose again.  The Minister for Health did not tell the House it rose in other countries.  As I understand, it fell very slightly towards the end of the war and then it rose again in 1947. The figures quite clearly show that the plans of the previous Government to attack tuberculosis were well conceived and that much good work was done.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he can give us some account of the research work done in tuberculosis and whether the early promise of some useful discoveries has been fulfilled. It will be recalled that the previous Government gave grants for the establishment of a tuberculosis service through the local authorities.  I should like to ask the Minister whether that service is in his opinion operating fairly successfully in the majority of counties.</P>
    <P>One very great contribution to the anti-tuberculosis campaign was the decision of the previous Government to <Col N="2566" /> make grants to breadwinners during the period of treatment.  That would make it possible for persons, who know they have tuberculosis, to undertake treatment whereas before they dreaded the loss of income to their families.  I should also like to ask the Minister whether he can give us some further reports as to the utilisation of B.C.G. vaccine.  I understand that special training is required to make use of the vaccine and I should like to know whether a grant will be given in order that persons can be trained abroad for that purpose.  As I understand it, a very considerable prejudice has been created amongst the English medical profession which has spread over to this country owing to the misuse of a vaccine which was not, in fact, the new vaccine, causing the deaths of some children.  I should like to know if that prejudice has been overcome or whether it still exists and again whether it is proposed to train persons in the use of the vaccine.</P>
    <P>Like another Deputy, I should like to know whether sufficient grants are to be made available for the purchase of the extremely precious drug known as streptomycin and whether any limitation has been placed on the quantity of that drug that can be made available. As I understand it it costs no less than £400 to treat a patient.  That no doubt is a very considerable sum but if it provides a cure for certain types of the disease we should make the money available in full measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of one of his speeches, referred to his dislike of the old public assistance administration in this country.  He spoke rather as if the previous Government had not adverted to that matter and had not studied the problem of ending the red ticket system.  Of course the House and the people of the country know that the White Paper published by the last Government indicated that they considered inaugurating new and more expensive health services over and beyond anything that has been done under the recently passed Public Health Act.  When the Minister says that he disapproves of the public assistance system in general, he almost automatically commits himself to some form of medical insurance such as that <Col N="2567" /> advocated by Sir William Beveridge. Once he wishes to extend free treatment in hospitals or free medical treatment and all that it implies to persons other than on a means test basis, he immediately raises the question of how the money is to be provided.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the previous Government made tentative plans which were to be considered by the Dáil and indeed to be considered by the Government themselves, having regard to their serious intention of improving and extending the scheme of social insurance in this country, to include medical treatment for persons receiving less than £500 per year and for farmers occupying holdings with valuations under £25.  The intention was that persons above that economic standard could take part in a scheme of social insurance and have free medical and hospital treatment if they so desired.  The Minister has, I think, already committed himself to a dislike of what is popularly known as the red-ticket system.  I should like to know whether he has adverted to the White Paper and whether he is now considering an alternative scheme or whether there is implied in his intentions some form of medical insurance.</P>
    <P>In connection with the publicity scheme which the Minister is now going to undertake I hope he will have regard to the present regulations governing the operations of the Film Institute. The Film Institute has a library of films dealing with health matters and has a very limited grant from the Government. Its duties are confined to providing information as to what films can be obtained, keeping a library of films and demonstrating films when asked.</P>
    <P>If a medical officer of health desires, for example, to demonstrate health films, he will find it difficult to secure a showing of films of a kind which would interest the public in general. He will find it difficult to get a sufficient audience in an ordinary cinema hall for the showing of films on purely health matters.  He will find that it is possible for him to form a committee from the local authority, the librarian, the agricultural committee jointly to raise the capital and funds to have a <Col N="2568" /> joint film display of what might be a semi-educational character, but which might include films of an amusing nature for the public; but he will find the administrative difficulties in doing that enormous, and any medical officer of health will be thoroughly discouraged from undertaking such a display because of the administrative difficulties involved and because of the fact that the Film Institute, although it does very fine work, has not sufficient powers to carry out the whole of the administration of a film propaganda campaign itself.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should do what the previous Government might well have done, if they had come back into office, having started the Film Institute and made a grant available, that is, extend the powers of the Film Institute in order that the institute can combine propaganda compaigns for health with the showing of films interesting and amusing to the public and see that all the red tape difficulties are overcome enabling such displays to take place.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I said at the commencement of my speech&mdash;that I was very much surprised by the observations of the Minister on this Estimate.  I had thought when he stood up that we would here some little account of the Clann na Poblachta health plan and I was wondering whether perhaps, for once, one particular plan of that Party was not going to be in abeyance, but, having listened <i>ad nauseam</i> to their speeches off the platforms, I now find that the present plans of the Minister do not conform to the official programme of that Party and that, in this matter, as in others, the Clann na Poblachta programme is in abeyance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the statement made by the Minister as to the amount of money available for the hospitals, I personally felt rather troubled, because one of my first duties was to go to the Minister's Department in connection with the new hospital in Cork.  I should like an assurance from him&mdash;his Department looked for an assurance from us that we would speed up in every way possible the plans and specifications for the building of that hospital&mdash;that there will be no delay with <Col N="2569" /> regard to finance for the building of the hospital.  That is one of the things that I am anxious about in connection with this Estimate.</P>
      <P>Another matter about which I am anxious is that, in a letter I had from the Minister, he states that they had not yet decided on the site for the maternity hospital in Cork.  I understood, at the interview we had with his Department, that the maternity hospital was to be built on the same site as the regional hospital.  Frankly, I can see no reason for any change in that respect.  I cannot see any sense in travelling around looking for other sites and paying exorbitant sums for them, when there is a site available large enough for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The main danger to health in this country is bad housing and, in that respect, the housing programme of the previous Government contributed very largely to ending the condition of affairs which prevailed here before.  I am glad to see that the housing programme is going ahead at full steam, because 90 per cent. of the disease in the country is caused by bad housing conditions, particularly in our cities and towns.  Another factor which contributed very largely to ill-health is the absence of sufficient nourishing fats, and in that respect the policy of the previous Government in the matter of food vouchers undoubtedly supplied a need.  I wonder if the Minister will tell us his opinion of the withdrawal of the food voucher system by the Minister for Social Services.  Deputy Childers, in speaking of this matter, made a slight mistake.  Local authorities cannot now give food vouchers.  They can give increased cash allowances, certainly, but what mattered to the wives and children of the poor was that they received, not cash, but milk, butter and everything else, when it was impossible for them to get them otherwise. We all know what happens when there is a scarcity of money, particularly in the homes of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard any amount of complaints about milk, particularly in Dublin and in Cork, as well.  No doubt the milk situation is unsatisfactory, but it is unsatisfactory very largely owing to the fact that neither this Government nor its predecessor was prepared to allow <Col N="2570" /> to the farmer or producer the cost of production.  That is the whole reason that we have Deputy Dockrell complaining of the quality and condition of the milk supplied in Dublin City.  When you knock out of production the ordinary producer of milk, the man who is trained in the work, and who has spent a lifetime at it&mdash;the supply of liquid milk to a city or town is a trade in itself&mdash;and bring in instead milk produced on a farm on Sunday morning, Sunday evening and Monday morning, the three milkings being put together, sent to the local creamery where it is put into a churn and sent up to Dublin for distribution the following day, you cannot expect to have other than the kind of milk Deputy Dockrell spoke about, milk which goes sour a couple of hours after being delivered.  I hope the Minister will induce his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to do something in that respect so as to secure a sufficient supply of proper milk for the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>There is another matter into which I would like the Minister to inquire.  We know that, at the ordinary auxiliary creamery where the milk is taken in and separated and where the cream is pasteurised and sent on to the central creamery, the man in charge must have a diploma of dairy science.  I wonder what diploma the employees have of the firms that are entrusted with the processing of liquid milk for Dublin City?  I would like the Minister to inquire into that particular aspect of the delivery of liquid milk.  If he does, he will get a rather nasty shock.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a new Minister coming in to a special job and we will have an opportunity, I hope, of criticising his work in that job on another Estimate for Health.  I believe in giving every man a chance to make good.  We cannot criticise or blame a Minister for anything that happened during a period when he was not in charge of a particular Department.  I have no intention of doing so.  But I would like to say that I read with interest the Minister's criticism of the various county homes in the country.  I have been a member of a board of assistance for about 25 years.  I will not say they are perfect.  I would not like <Col N="2571" /> to give here the conditions of affairs as we found them when we first took over. There is an enormous disparity in the condition of affairs now and the condition of affairs when we first took over. I would like the Minister, the next time he comes to Cork, to pay a visit to the county home there and have a look around.  Criticism is all right if it is criticism with knowledge.  Criticism without knowledge is bad.  Criticism of something that has not been seen is the worst of all.  I suggest to the Minister that, before he starts off criticising the administration of county homes in this country, he should at least examine them for himself, see the condition of affairs in them and, having done so, if he finds any flaw, I can assure him, as far as we in Cork are concerned, any flaw he finds in that respect will be remedied at once.  I certainly object to criticism that I consider unjustified.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  I know it has gone beyond the ordinary time for Estimates.  We are not responsible for the fact that this House met only once a week or once a fortnight when the various splinters were being collected and were being bound together.  We are not responsible for the lateness of the period at which the Estimates are being considered.  I am sure it will be admitted that Deputies who get an opportunity of examining a particular Department one day in the year are entitled to give their views on it.  That is the position in regard to this and other Estimates and, as I stated, I have no intention of delaying the House.  I just wished to point out the few matters with which I am concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to pay a tribute to the treatment which has been given, on the whole, to this Estimate by the majority of Deputies.  As a new Deputy and a new Minister, I have been particularly impressed by the objective, critical&mdash;it is quite accepted &mdash;and to a large extent constructive and helpful suggestions which have been put forward by the majority of Deputies on both sides of the House. I welcome those criticisms as it is obvious that no Department can properly <Col N="2572" /> function without full consideration being given to the points which may be raised by Deputies representing constituencies in the whole of our State.  I would like particularly to pay my tribute to the deliberations and helpful suggestions of my predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, and of the other doctor members of the House who did contribute a number of very important suggestions and ideas, which I am certain can be of use to me in the proper running of my Department.</P>
      <P>In dealing with these matters generally, I will attempt to reply, to the best of my ability, to the many queries which have been put forward in the debate.  If, during my reply, I do not refer to questions which have been raised by some Deputies, I would like them to understand that this is so through inadvertence on my part.  I would be very glad, indeed, if they would take up with me the matters in which they are particularly interested and make personal recommendations.  I should be very glad to discuss any of their difficulties with any of the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with the Deputies who have given their views that the mother and child service is an extremely important one and that a proper functioning service such as this can be of tremendous advantage to the community in the provision for us of a healthy nation.  This service could be a particularly vital and important one. The seriousness which I attach to it has been responsible for my action in delaying the full implementation of a mother and child service, without first giving the whole matter of the high infantile mortality rate and the other ancillary matters in relation to it to a child health council for their consideration and their general directions. This council is composed of very eminent specialists in child health.  I feel that the advice of those experts will be of paramount importance to me in introducing a scheme which is likely to be of value and assistance.  I feel a very deep responsibility in the carrying out of my duties as Minister for Health and, therefore, I am not anxious to rush into the implementation of any such highly complicated and quite <Col N="2573" /> controversial scheme for mothers and children.  However, I accept the principle of such a service and intend to introduce some such service.</P>
    <P>There are a few misapprehensions which have filtered through a daily paper, unfortunately, down to a number of the Deputies who were unable to attend in the Dáil when I was making my opening remarks.  The general trend, as delivered by the Deputies&mdash; Deputy MacEntee was one of them, and I think Deputy Childers was another&mdash; covered the question of the axing of the health services.  My impression has been that, in recent days, the reliability of that paper has been successfully questioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently, it is not surprising that the information which they apparently gleaned from this newspaper was incorrect.  There is no question of the axing of any of these health provisions.  Deputy Dr. Ryan in his otherwise extremely accurate speech in this debate, mentioned a figure of £37,000,000 which was proposed in a White Paper by the previous Administration. This was reiterated by Deputy Moran.  He said that that was a proposal put up by the previous Administration. He then said that my figures were the expenditure of some £15,000,000 over a period of ten years. Both those figures are wrong.  The White Paper estimate of expenditure was £30,000,000 and my expenditure is one of £15,000,000 over seven years. This is not all.  They appear to have overlooked the fact that I have said that this position in regard to the provision of hospitals will be reviewed as soon as the position in regard to materials improves and, anyway, in a matter of three years.  As a matter of fact, I do not remember&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;using the words &ldquo;shortage of money&rdquo; anywhere in the whole of my statement in the Dáil.  Certainly, it has not been a consideration in this Government in the provision of hospitals. I would like that to be clear, in the first instance.  It would be easy for me to come into the Dáil and promise £37,000,000 or £30,000,000, or whatever <Col N="2574" /> you like but I have an old-fashioned sense of responsibility and a sense of honesty and a feeling that, if I make a statement, I should be prepared to carry out that statement and fulfil the promise made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan made some remarks about the duties of dispensary doctors, their long hours and their future in the health services.  I agree completely with his criticisms of the conditions under which our dispensary medical officers are at present working and their long hours.  The whole question of the future of our medical services, including that particular question, is obviously a difficult and troublesome one.  Experience from other countries has shown us that the provision of a medical service, including private practitioners and public health service, is one which should not be introduced without the most mature and prolonged consideration.  Other Ministers of Health have introduced such things and have tried to introduce such things. My knowledge is not complete on this subject, but as far as I know, there is not yet a perfect health medical scheme in operation.  There are very severe criticisms to be heard on all sides in regard to what is considered an ideal one, the one in New Zealand.  We should give serious consideration to the matter before we promise the people something which it might be impossible to introduce.</P>
      <P>Little has been said in relation to prevention.  When I went into the Department of Health, I treated the position as if I were treating a patient. I was faced with a health service which was, as a patient, seriously ill. I had to treat the condition which I found in the first instance; the question of prevention must come later, but I can assure the Deputies that it certainly will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan talked about regional sanatoria and asked with regard to the future of these projects. Of course, every single one of them is going ahead.  It is merely a question of whether we adhere to his particular idea of three major sanatoria, or consider the rather more complete decentralisation of these very large <Col N="2575" /> hospitals and so provide nearer home for every section of the people of the country a sub-regional sanatorium which will be completely self-contained, and which will be in a position to give a first class service to the people near their own homes.  These are problems which we are considering at the moment.  We shall arrive at a decision on them in a very short time.  We had a number of criticisms in regard to what has been done.  Deputy Dr. Ryan appears to have a simply fabulous memory.  Over a number of years he remembered the number of beds provided at Peamount&mdash;120; at Newcastle 80, and at Lourdes 43; but then his memory seemed to slip him.  He said that the local authority had been approached in regard to Castlerea and had agreed to hand it over, or words to that effect.  In point of accuracy, that is simply not true.  The authorities at Castlerea were not approached, but I am deeply indebted to the mental hospital authority there for handling it over.  They had not been approached prior to my coming into the Department. Again, he produced for me one of the finest examples that I have yet seen of the triumph of mind over matter and, in fact, over fiction.  He said that when he was in Galway he saw development works for the Galway regional sanatorium going ahead and he wondered what was happening now.  Well, I will tell him.  The development works started last Monday, and when he was down there he saw grass and trees growing, but there was little else.</P>

In regard to the regional hospitals in Cork&mdash;Deputy Corry was worried about Cork&mdash;Galway, and Limerick they are all to go ahead.  Deputy McCann was worried about the Coombe hospital. We propose to go ahead with it.  He was also worried about a genito-urinary unit in the Meath hospital.  We are to go ahead with a genito-urinary unit in the Meath hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;for years. Deputy Dr. Brennan, Deputy Byrne, Deputy Burke, Deputy O'Grady, and other Deputies discussed the question of nurses, of nurses' homes, and the conditions for nurses in hospitals and sanatoria.  Well, as a matter of fact, the local authorities, I think, have a particularly good reputation in regard to these nurses.  I think that the nurses referred to by Deputy Dr. Brennan were the voluntary hospital nurses.  We have no jurisdiction over them, and the conditions under which they work are entirely the responsibility of these hospitals, and any criticisms which are to be made can be directed towards the proper responsible authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to local authority nurses, there is a superannuation scheme, and the working hours are not as suggested by Deputy Dr. Brennan.  What we have recommended is that a 96-hour fortnight should be worked by these girls.  We consider that these are the hours, and certainly no more, that these girls should be asked to work. There are a number of nurses' homes on the priority list for building in Dublin, Limerick, the Drogheda Memorial Hospital, St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire, Mullingar, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore, Portlaoighise, Castlebar, Roscommon, <Col N="2577" /> and Mallow, and also tuberculosis nurses' homes at Peamount, Newcastle, Lourdes, Woodlands, as well as a number of mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the conditions under which nurses have been working for a number of years.  My personal opinion is that the girls are not particularly interested in the purely financial side.  I think that I can pay this form of tribute to them, that if we treat them humanely, house them well and give them rather good reasonable working conditions, with good recreational facilities, we will have no shortage of nurses in Ireland.  The girls are only too glad to work in their own country for their own people.</P>
    <P>With regard to public health clinics, referred to by Deputy McCann, there is in the priority scheme £500,000 to be spent on public health clinics and dispensaries. I am fully aware of the position in regard to dispensaries.  I think that, if my memory serves me, there are about 600 dispensaries and 300 depôts and that only 5 per cent. of these approximate to what are reasonable normal standards of building. That is a formidable task which we have to try to overcome.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of tuberculosis generally, this is a very big problem, and brings us back to what has been done.  As I said in my original statement, we have been able to acquire in Castlerea the mental hospital and in Mallow the district hospital, which has been given by the people of that area&mdash;a very fine self-sacrificing act&mdash;and also Coláiste Mobhi in the Phoenix Park.  Beds already provided in the four months number 373 and we hope to reach the 800 to 900 mark by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to cancer, this I also consider to be a very important and very serious problem.  Most of us are aware of it.  We have set up a council of experts to advise us on what are the best lines to approach this problem.  Meanwhile, as one of our priorities, we have sanctioned the provision of a large out-patients department in St. Anne's Cancer Hospital in Dublin.  That is obviously a preliminary <Col N="2578" /> until we find out the best lines on which to approach this whole problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe and a number of other Deputies referred to the question of juvenile mental defectives.  A total of £656,000 is to be expended on the provision of institutions for these children at Lota, County Cork; the Sisters of Charity, Clonsilla; St. Augustine's, Blackrock, and Moore Abbey.  This will meet to a certain extent the demand for beds and accommodation. As Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out, the demand at the moment is in the region of 6,000, and we are anxious to get accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn referred to the County Louth.  The hospital position in County Louth is particularly bad and we propose to sanction the building of a county hospital of 102 beds and 11 extra beds will be provided in the Drogheda Cottage Hospital.  The County Hospital in Dundalk will be converted into a 36-bed maternity hospital and the fever hospital in Dundalk will be reconstructed.  Similarly, in County Wicklow it is proposed to provide a county hospital containing 60 beds.  It is proposed to provide for ten maternity beds, nurses' quarters and sanitary accommodation in Baltinglass District Hospital and to extend the fever hospital.  In Carlow we hope to provide a regional hospital for Carlow and Kildare.  I think Deputies can take it that working within the limitations, which are purely those of materials and labour, we shall spare no effort to see that every county in Ireland where there is a need shall benefit from this building grant.  They can be assured, so far as I am concerned, that there is no question of any political or any other bias in arriving at my conclusions in regard to the need in any particular area for hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>It seems to me unfortunate that this debate should have been sullied by the interference of Deputy MacEntee who has, I am glad to say, left the House. Until his intervention the debate was kept on a very high level by all sections of the House.  Deputy MacEntee introduced an entirely new note.  He asked a number of questions, purely <Col N="2579" /> mischievous ones, but I shall provide him with some answers, anyway.  With regard to Cork Street Hospital, he asked why I did not publish the report of the inspector.  I ask Deputy MacEntee why he did not publish the report when he was so strongly pressed to do so.  He asked what I had done and said I did little else but talk and get publication in the Press.  As I have said, in four months I have provided nearly 100 beds a month for sufferers from tuberculosis.  If Deputy MacEntee had been sufficiently interested in this problem before he passed to that side of the House, there would be no such problem facing me at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee discussed the White Paper and referred to plans and promises.  He used the word &ldquo;plans&rdquo; 11 times in as many minutes. He said that I criticised the White Paper.  I did not criticise what was in it.  My criticism was directed to the fact that the Dáil unanimously passed the Sanatoria Bill, which became law on the 6th March, 1945, which authorised the Department to provide 2,000 extra beds for sufferers from tuberculosis in three regional sanatoria, and, as I told Deputy Kennedy, the development work started last Monday on the first of these.</P>

      <P>You shelved the sanatoria. That is much more important to us.  Deputy MacEntee talked about his plans and his proposals.  He also said that I criticised at Ringsend and other places the extravagance of his administration.  I most certainly did criticise at Ringsend, all round SouthEast Dublin, and all round Ireland the extravagance of Deputy MacEntee's Administration and I would do it again.  I did not criticise his extravagance in regard to public health, because there was not any.  I criticised the extravagance in regard to aerodromes, aeroplanes, etc.  Those are the things I criticised and will continue to criticise.  A White Paper or any other paper is no good; plans and promises are no good to a sick man.  That is why I am at the moment working on urgent practical matters.  I am not theorising; I am not now planning; I am still working in order to give practical effect to the needs of the people.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee also made another point, a really good one. &ldquo;Did I not know what the previous Administration did.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact I accepted it and I was not making a point of it.  Allowances were made for the dependents of people with infectious diseases.  I was well aware of that.  I heard of it for the first time when I was going down to make an election speech on the 11th February, just prior to the general <Col N="2581" /> election, and I made a point of it.  It seemed to me to be a startling coincidence that these allowances should be introduced a week before the general election and 16 years after Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>

      <P>There is a small point with regard to salaries that I would like to refer to, a point that I hate to waste the time of the House on.  The Deputy however, made a point about Minister's salaries.  I said I would take whatever the salary was before.  The fact of the matter is that I actually never made that promise in public, because, to me, it is a thing about which I would not like to talk, but, as it happens, I do not accept at the moment the full Ministerial salary, and we in this inter-Party Government have adhered to that particular principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the question of propaganda with regard to health.  It is obvious that we will use to the full the cinemas, the radio, the newspapers and talks to the people generally, and in this way I hope that we will build up a positive <Col N="2582" /> health campaign and that it will act as a form of preventative to bring people earlier to the authorities for treatment for their diseases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran made a suggestion about compulsory examination of contacts and a number of other people. I have always considered compulsion of any kind as being a degradation of the intelligence of the average civilised member of any community, and I deprecate the use of compulsion as I did on a former occasion when a highly controversial Health Bill was introduced into this Dáil.  I was not in the Dáil at the time but I opposed it as much as I could outside.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee&mdash;I have to go back to him again&mdash;said that I should spend so much more money, unlimited money.  One of my remarks was that I considered that for the health of the people the provision of houses was nearly as important as the provision of hospitals.  Because in this inter-Party Government there is co-ordination and sympathy between the Ministers, we are able to do our best to fit in and co-ordinate our schemes.  To me it seemed unfortunate that in Deputy MacEntee's Government they could not have arrived at some such form of co-ordination and save to the taxpayers of this country the sum of £58,000 which was poured down the empty drains of Santry Court.  That was one of the fiascos, that regional sanatorium which was proposed in 1945. That amount of £58,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
