      <P>Proceedings for the resumption of part of this holding were instituted last year.  The tenant lodged a petition against resumption and the Land Commission, after full consideration, decided not to proceed further with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister that in this locality there are some 18 small farmers living in a village called Meelick and their valuations range from 6/- to £4 18s. 0d. and that of this land in question approximately 60 or 70 acres would satisfy this congestion if it were taken over.  It is right beside them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that considerable rearrangement and resettlement on lands still remains to be carried out at Kilvine, Irishtown, County Mayo; and, if so, whether he will ensure that this matter is expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This congested estate, formerly owned by Mr. T.H.B. Ruttledge, contains numerous small holdings in Kilvine and the surrounding district.  It is one of several similar estates awaiting preparation for resale. The work of rearranging and enlarging holdings on congested estates in Mayo and the other congested counties has been proceeding, and no opportunity will be lost of bringing these cases to conclusion as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Farmers' Butter Prices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the prices being paid for farmers' butter by manufacturers are entirely inadequate; and, if so, whether he will take steps to have them increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear whether the word &ldquo;manufacturers&rdquo; is intended by the Deputy to refer to butter factories or to firms which use farmers' butter in <Col N="2169" /> the manufacture of confectionery.  I understand that producers of farmers' butter are receiving reasonable prices, proportionate to the quality of their product, from the butter factories.  I do not propose to interfere with the free market which now exists for farmers' butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the buyers on behalf of the butter factories are paid in or about 2/3 per lb. for farmers' butter and that that price is entirely inadequate for reasonably good farmers' butter?  Does the Minister claim that it is fair to allow a small number to take advantage of the fact that farmers' butter is plentiful at the present time, with a view to holding that butter and exploiting the consumer when butter becomes scarce in the winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In further reply to the Deputy, perhaps he is not up to date with the facts regarding this matter. The butter factories did attempt to buy butter at what appeared to me to be a grossly inadequate price.  They did not continue that attempt for long and they are now paying 2/5 a lb.  At the same time, a very considerable number of women who manufacture good butter are selling it direct to the consumer and get full value for their excellent product.  As far as I am concerned, more power to their elbow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a very substantial portion&mdash;in fact, almost all&mdash;of the butter that is being bought by the factories is first-class butter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware, but if anyone sells first-class butter at 2/- I would invite the Deputy to have that person medically examined with the view to committal to a mental hospital.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware, in connection with the rejection by his Department of a scheme to clean and widen the canal in the townland of Murreigh, Waterville, County Kerry, that considerable flooding and loss has occurred to a large number of farmers resident in that area who are unable to drain their lands and if in view of these circumstances he will reconsider the matter with a view to having the work carried out as a minor employment scheme and thereby give these small <Col N="2172" /> holders an opportunity of draining and developing their holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to the following work: &ldquo;The widening and deepening of a watercourse in the townland of Murreigh from the estuary of the Inny River to a point in the vicinity of `The Chapel Cross' &rdquo;.  If so, it is one of a large number of proposals for employment schemes for the same area, several of which are of superior merit, judged by their cost in relation to the number of landholders served, and which, naturally, must receive priority in the winter programme.</P>
      <P>For this reason, there is little prospect of the work in question being undertaken as a minor employment scheme with a full-cost grant, for a considerable time to come, but its execution can be hastened if the landholders concerned are prepared to contribute to its cost under the rural improvements scheme.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported last evening, I had just dealt with the matter of the new council of education which the Minister proposes to establish.  The establishment of that council of education and the carrying out of the undertaking given by the Minister to submit his problems and difficulties to arbitration will shorten considerably what I would otherwise have to say on this Estimate.  The matter of the teaching of Irish has been discussed by previous speakers.  I should say that I agree generally with the observations that have been made to the effect that substantial progress in Irish has been made in the last 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Party in this House and, I think, almost every Deputy in this House is anxious that the Irish language should be revived extensively and that it should be made the spoker <Col N="2175" /> language of the people.  The difference that arises is in regard to the methods&mdash;whether the present methods are suitable and whether the present methods will achieve their objectives. From my own personal point of view I see two substantial difficulties placed in the way of the revival of Irish by the two previous Governments.  The first Government&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;probably for economic reasons, departed from the traditional script.  Undoubtedly that departure presented a difficulty to learners of Irish.  In reading any language one becomes familiar with the appearance of words and, in the script of the language, by looking at a word, a person is able to know what that word means.  By printing Irish in English characters and by inserting a lot of &ldquo;h's&rdquo; all over the place I must confess that I find it impossible, on looking at an Irish word in English script, to know what it means.  One is driven to pronunciation of the word in order to find out what exactly it means. I consider that that was a difficulty that was placed in the way of learners of Irish.  The next difficulty that is placed in the way of learners of Irish is this recent interference with the spelling of Irish.  As I understand from the Minister this new spelling which appears to be universally condemned by Irish scholars has been foisted upon the Department of Education by some authority.  I gathered from the Minister's remarks that it was foisted on his Department without the consent of the officials of his own Department.  I understand that the officials of the Department of Education do not consider themselves qualified to deal with this matter of the new spelling.  I understand that it is their view that they do not want to have any responsibility whatever for it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should make it clear that the Department was not consulted in any way.  The thing was done by Government Order and more or less brought into operation by Government Order.  The Department officials would, however, hold the view, and I certainly would also, that some work had to be done in that particular matter.  I asked to have the situation viewed without prejudice from the point of view that a thing has been done and that we should work from the base and judge from that particular base that has been established, whether we want it or not. I should not like it to be said that officials of the Department do not think themselves competent for this, that or the other particular thing or were not prepared to accept responsibility for anything that might come in their way. I am sure the Deputy does not want to suggest that.  They, like everybody else, are in difficulty in connection with the matter, but we all must be prepared to face up to the situation which exists and work from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  One would imagine that in this very serious matter of the change in spelling no action would be taken by any responsible Minister without the advice of the experienced officials in his Department.  I understood from the Minister in his introductory speech that this system was foisted upon the Department and that his officials will and are now doing the best they can with it.  I accept that as the position.  I am looking at it entirely from the point of view of the revival of Irish.  Reading the Press controversy, listening to people who are more qualified than I am, because I have very little qualification really to discuss the matter, and applying the mind of an ordinary citizen, the mind of a father of a family to it, I believe that this effort to change the spelling is going to do irreparable damage to the Irish language.  I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to withdraw such instructions as have been issued by his Department to put this new spelling into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> His Lordship the Most Reverend Dr. Mageean, on New Year's Day, 1947, at the Ard-Fheis of the Ulster Gaelic League in Belfast, declared with authority that the language is in too weak a state to change the spelling now.  These words were used and that declaration was made at that Ard-Fheis by a friend of the Irish language.  In this House and outside it we talk a lot about Partition and the necessity for its abolition.  We all want to see Partition ended and we all want to do what should be done to end it.  But here under this new spelling of the Irish language we are setting up a new partition, because down here we are teaching a spelling that is not or will not be recognised in Ulster.</P>
    <P>Dr. Dinneen was an acknowledged authority upon Irish and his IrishEnglish dictionary has been recognised as the standard authority for the past quarter of a century.  In the foreword to his dictionary he says that the interests of simplicity as well as uniformity are best served by retaining the traditional orthography.  That is what Dr. Dinneen says.  Yet some unknown authority has foisted a new spelling upon the Department of Education and a new Minister feels that an effort ought to be made to give this new spelling a chance.  I ask the Minister not to fly in the face of what acknowledged authorities have said in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Then the Rev. L. McKenna, S.J., author of the English-Irish dictionary, states in his preface:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The progress of our work brought home to us very forcibly the difficulties involved in any system of simplified spelling.  Little by little our projected simplifications had to be discarded and finally we reverted almost completely to the literary or Dinneen spelling.  Only a few of our projected simplifications remain.  We now regret that we have not jettisoned these also.  To practically all of them, serious objections can be made.  Most people who know anything of the language are fairly familiar with the literary spelling and do not welcome any changes from it. The difficulties which it is supposed <Col N="2178" /> to involve in teaching young people are, we think, often over-estimated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the statements of authorities, people who have devoted their lives to the cause of Irish, and those people are jettisoned, their authority is ignored, and their advice is spurned by some unknown person who says that we must have this new Irish spelling.</P>
    <P>A correspondent writing to me gives me what he terms examples of the hotch-potch that is being made of Irish spelling in this booklet which has been issued to every teacher in the Twenty-Six Counties.  He complains of the new combinations of vowels which are impossible to pronounce.  I do not feel competent to travel very far in this field, but he does draw my attention to the word &ldquo;lugha&rdquo;.  The new spelling of that word is &ldquo;lú&rdquo;, which is pronounced &ldquo;loo&rdquo;.  Now, there is no comparison between the words &ldquo;lugha&rdquo; and &ldquo;lú&rdquo;.  Apparently, this unknown tyrant, because I think tyrant is the only word that can be used, this unknown individual who is in a position to force the Minister for Education and the Department of Education to make a hotch-potch of the spelling of the national language&mdash;this unknown dictator or tyrant&mdash;thought that the letters &ldquo;gha&rdquo; could be dropped entirely.  Otherwise what is the reason for changing the spelling of &ldquo;lugha&rdquo; to &ldquo;lú&rdquo;.  When one looks down the booklet further one finds that they are retained in &ldquo;rogha&rdquo; and &ldquo;togha&rdquo;, and why they are retained is because these words could not be pronounced at all under any new form of spelling that could be invented.</P>
    <P>I think this debate will have served a very useful purpose if it has the effect of getting the Minister to postpone the carrying into effect of this new spelling for, say, a year until the Minister and his Department have an opportunity of fully considering the matter and of discussing it with the friends and authorities of the Irish language who are readily available.  Much money has been spent, and much endeavour has been made, to save the Irish language, and it would be a tragedy if people desiring to save it were responsible for killing it.  I would make that appeal to the Minister to postpone this for a <Col N="2179" /> period of one year, so that the matter may be fully and comprehensively considered.</P>
    <P>What will the position be of any school child who is taught Irish through the medium of this new spelling? For that child measures will be taken by the Minister for Education and the Department of Education to deprive the child of the whole Irish literature that is available in the Dinneen spelling.  Is it fair to the serious attempt that is being made to revive the Irish language that that should be done?  Is it contemplated by those people that all the books that are available, printed in the traditional and in the Dinneen spelling, will have to be reprinted in the new spelling?  I think the matter is too serious for an experiment of that kind.  I repeat my appeal to the Minister to postpone this until such time as the matter has been thoroughly and carefully examined. Why should the Minister be bound? Everyone knows the Minister's interest in the Irish language.  The Minister's interest in it is not of to-day or yesterday. Does the Minister want to go down in the history of this country as the man who destroyed the Irish language by insisting at this particular stage on this new spelling?  The responsibility of the Minister is too serious to do that.</P>
    <P>I admit that I am not an authority, and that I have not sufficient knowledge to speak in this debate with authority, but in speaking I am conveying the views, as I understand them, of people who are qualified to pass judgment.  It is because I am interested in the revival of the Irish language that I want to see no obstacles put in the way, and so I am making these observations and asking the Minister for this short delay so that he will avoid making a tragic mistake.</P>
    <P>Now, on the matter of education generally, I have sensed over a long number of years a completely wrong approach to the problem of education. I do not want to place any blame on Ministers for Education or on the Department of Education, but it is a completely wrong approach by the people generally.  There is the idea <Col N="2180" /> that every person in the country should be educated for a white collar job. That seems to be the general approach: that no matter how clever an individual may be with his hands, and no matter what that individual's attitude may be, the desire is to educate that person for a white collar job.  There appears to be a kind of snobbery growing up that it is not the right thing to be educated as a tradesman, that it is not the right thing to be educated as a competent or capable farmer, but that the right thing should be to educate a person for some clerical position.  I cannot blame the Minister for that nor can I blame the Department but I do think that, as far as the new generation growing up is concerned, they should be taught in the schools how important all these other things are, how much more important they are than clerical positions. In country areas where children are growing up who, in time, will be farmers, a correct system of education would ensure that on the day of the local fair, these children would be at the fair instead of being kept in the schools.  They would be learning something there that would be real, something that would affect them and apply to their work in after life.  But, unfortunately, the idea has gained currency that every person who has any brains at all must be educated for a clerical position.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign, and for many years previous to it, a considerable number of people&mdash; and I am happy to say I was one of them&mdash;advocated free education&mdash;that the education given in the primary schools should be free, that secondary education should be free, that university education should be free and that that free education should include free school books and free requisites.  I know the problem is a big one but it will have to be faced at some stage in the future&mdash;that the cost of the education of children should be the responsibility of the State and not of the parents and that whatever the domestic circumstances, the child of talent will be enabled to go right through from the primary school to the university and even to a post-graduate post, entirely <Col N="2181" /> free of expense to the parents.  I realise that cannot be done now, or in the coming year, but it is an objective that we must hold before us all the time.  I mention it now for no other purpose than to reiterate the views of the Party to which I belong on education generally.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters I want to mention to the Minister in conclusion. One is a matter that has been brought to the Minister's attention already, the matter of women teachers who were compulsorily retired a few years ago.  I am aware that that matter has been brought to the Minister's notice and to the notice of his predecessor. I think I would be doing justice to both in saying that each of them believes and realises that an injustice was done in those cases.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the cases of these compulsorily retired women teachers so that even at this stage a measure of justice may be done to them.</P>
    <P>There are old rules dating back many years governing teachers and one of these antiquated, almost antediluvian, rulings is one which prescribes that a teacher cannot live in a public-house. There are cases where that rule is being enforced by a manager, the result being that a woman teacher is compulsorily separated from her husband. In order to maintain her position she must live apart from her husband who happens to be the licensee of a public-house.  Whatever reasons there may have been in the dim and distant past for that rule, in this enlightened age there should be no necessity for it.  I would ask the Minister to examine that old rule particularly and to ensure that it is removed from the regulations at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Ná bíodh. Deineadh a lán tagairt don litriú nua. Ba cheart a rá, i dtosach, gur cuireadh i mbun na hoibre sin daoine dúthrachta a dhein a gcion féin fé mar ab eol dóibh; agus ba cheart dúinn bheith buíoch díobh, ar an ábhar san.</P>
      <P>Tá mór-chuid dá bhfuil déanta acu inmholta agus cuid mhaith dí-mholta, im thuairimse.  Nuair a chuireann duine nó dream fé litriú teangain do shimpliú, ba cheart caighdeán áirithe amháin a bheith ann.  Is é sin go gcoimféadfaí préamh an fhocail slán. Níor dearnadh san.  An coiste seo, do réabadar préamhacha; agus nuair a dheineadar san, dheineadar dochar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuir i gcás, an focal &ldquo;marbh&rdquo;: tá a fhios againn conus a litrítear é.  Sin é an préamh.  Nuair a thagaimid go dtí &ldquo;marbhú,&rdquo; an gceapfadh aon duine gur fusa do pháiste, nó éinne eile, beag nó aosta, &ldquo;marú&rdquo; do thuisgint níos luaithe ná &ldquo;marbhú&rdquo;?  Deineadh botún ins na préamhacha&mdash;agus sin é an bun-locht atá ar an obair sin.  Mar gheall ar na rudaí eile a dheineadar, nílim ina gcoinnibh.  Na hearbaill sin a ghearradh amach, ní dóigh liom gur locht ar an litriú simplí é sin.  Ach ba cheart cuimhneamh ar seo: níor cuireadh na hearbaill sin isteach chun maisithe.  Bhí na hearbaill sin in úsáid tráth.  Caoga blian ó shoin, chualadh scoláire Gaeilge a rá go raibh na focail <Col N="2183" /> sin go raibh&mdash;ghadh iontu trí-shiollach tráth.  Sin é an cúis a bhí an &ldquo;-ghadh&rdquo; ann.  Thug sé somplaí dúinn &mdash;ní cuimhin liom anois iad.  I gcás an fhocail &ldquo;marú,&rdquo; ní simpliú ach deacrú é sin.  Níl ciall ar bith leis.</P>
    <P>Anois, maidir le ceist na teangan, cá bhfuil ár dtriall?  Cá bhfuilimid ag dul i dtaobh na ceiste seo&mdash;ar aghaidh nó ar gcúl?  Deir eolaithe a chuireann spéis i gcanúnachas nach féidir dhá theangain a bheith comh-bheo agus fé chomhmheas in aon tír amháin ar feadh i bhfad.  Táimid ag iarraidh rud a dhéanamh nár tharla riamh ar stair an domhain&mdash;dhá theangain do choimeád chomh-bheo agus i gcomhmheas sa tír seo.  Ní éireoidh linn. Caithfimid leigint do cheann acu dul ar gcúl.  Má tá uainn an Ghaeilge d'aithbheochaint, caithfimid an Sacs-Bhéarla do thrághadh i ndiaidh a chéile.  Níl ach dream amháin in Éirinn go raibh an léargas ceart acu ar sin.  Bhí coiste ann&mdash;Comhairle Coiste Scoláireachtaí Chontae na Gaillimhe&mdash;agus dheineas tagairt dó anseo anuraidh.  Ceapadh clár le haghaidh scoláireachtaí agus bhí an Sacs-Bhéarla mar ábhar neamhriachtanach. Sin é an léargas cruinn ceart agus an léargas fada, a shabháilfidh an Ghaeilge.  Ní shabháilfidh an clár atá againn fé láthair í.  Tá an Béarla fé mhór-mheas ar fud na tíre. Nílimse ag rá nach bhfuil feabhas mór tagaithe ar an nGaeilge, go mór mór i measc na ndaoine óga.  Bíonn cuid mhaith díobh ag labhairt Gaeilge ins na busanna, mar tá a lán treoruidhthe óga ar na busanna anois gur Gaeilgeóirí iad.  Chím go bhfuil sé mar sin i mo cheantar féin, i gCluain Tarbh, anois, agus sin rud fónta.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mo chara, an Teachta Ó Ciosáin, go raibh cúis na teangain ag dul ar aghaidh go hiontach.  Béidir go bhfuil sí ag dul ar aghaidh, ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sí ag dul ar aghaidh go hiontach.  Más macasamhail don tír an Dáil seo sílim go bhfuil sí ag dul ar gcúl mar nuair thángas isteach sa Dáil seo 16 bliain ó shoin, bhí i bhfad níos mó Gaeilgeoirí sa Dáil ná mar atá inniu.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire agus gach duine go bhfuil spéis aige i gcúis na Gaeilge, suim annsin: más fíor do na heolaithe, nach féidir an dá theangain a choimeád comh-bheo agus i gcomhréim in aon tir ach ar feadh tamaill; a dheimhniú sin againn féin.  I gcás na hEilbhéise, tá ceithre teorainn don tír sin&mdash;An Fhrainnc, an Gearmáin, an Iodáil agus an Astair.  Na daoine atá in aice na dteorann sin, is daoine dhá-theangacha iad.</P>
      <P>Maidir le ceist na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil breis suime ar fad dá chur i scríbhneoireacht agus i gceapadóireacht ins na scoileanna.  B'fhearr liom cloí leis an gcaint agus an léamh.  Tá fáth leis sin.  Nuair a cuireadh an clár nua ar bun roinnt blian ó shoinn, bhí cuid de na cigirí nach raibh ró-chliste ar labhairt na Gaeilge agus bhídís cliste go leor ar scríbhneoireacht agus ar cheapadóireacht.

Bhí an Teachta Seán Ó Ceallaigh (&ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo;) mar Aire agus an Teachta Proinnsias Ó Fathaigh mar Leas-Aire.  Chuireadar an Comhairle Oideachais ar bun agus ins an Chomhairle sin a geineadh an chéad clár.  Níorbh fhéidir leis an gComhairle coiste do chur ar bun chun clár do tharrac amach mar bhí gach duine bhí ar an gcomhairle sin, ach mé féin, ar a theicheodh ach cuireadh an scéal fé bhráid Chumann na Múinteoirí, agus shocraíodar dul ar aghaidh leis an gcoiste&mdash;agus b'shin é tosnú leis an National Programme Conference, mar a tugtar air&mdash;an dream a chuir an chéad chlár ar bun.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this Estimate last year, I expressed the view that no progress could be made in education until we had co-operation between the Minister and the teachers and all sections of the Department engaged in education.  I was not at that time sufficiently optimistic to expect that there would be such a change in the political situation as would make such co-operation possible. The new Minister for Education has indicated that he is going to go all out to establish confidence and co-operation between himself and all sections of his Department.  He is setting up a council of education to advise him on all aspects of education.  On that council <Col N="2187" /> will devolve a tremendous responsibility, and that council will find itself faced with a very heavy task.</P>
      <P>Education is and must remain fundamentally the most important aspect of our national activity, because unless we are determined that successive generations will be better citizens from every point of view than those who have gone before them, and unless we are inspired with that ideal, there is no hope of making any advance.  I am sure it is the hope of this House that those who will constitute the Council of Education will be idealists in the true sense of the word&mdash;idealists who have the highest aim in mind and who are at the same time prepared to face up to the real difficulties they will encounter.  We know that the majority of our people cannot hope to secure what is commonly termed &ldquo;higher education.&rdquo;  I think I might go further and say that, having regard to the importance of ordinary manual labour, it would be undesirable that the majority of our people should aspire to secondary or university education.  One speaker has already referred to the tendency of aspiring to white-collar occupations or vocations.  I think every Deputy realises that if every citizen was to seek a white-collar occupation there would be very few white collars after a while because there would be nobody to do the laundry.  It ought to be one of the guiding principles of those who are charged with the education of the young to inculcate into children a realisation of the dignity of manual work well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard complaints made in this House from time to time of children being engaged in the cleaning of national schools.  In my school days it was the function of the children to sweep and dust and clean schools and keep them in order.  From my own experience I do not think sweeping or dusting the school did any of us any harm in the past.  I think we all got a certain amount of satisfaction out of work of that kind when it was well done.  I think we got a certain satisfaction out of seeing a floor that was dirty made clean by our own exertions. I think one of the first things that <Col N="2188" /> should be insisted upon in regard to primary education is to see that children attending the primary schools are given encouragement from the very earliest ages in brightening and cleaning their own schools.  I think, too, that time should be provided for a little outdoor work, such as attending to vegetables and flowers in a small garden.  Work of that kind gives children some sense of the dignity of manual labour and at the same time promotes a certain efficiency in the performance of that work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there will always be a large percentage of children attending the primary schools who have not in their own homes opportunities of seeing manual work well done.  Many of them come from tenement houses where there are no gardens.  Many of them come from the environments in which one finds none of the things that go to make a home brighter.  Such children should be given an opportunity by means of their own efforts of brightening up their schools.</P>
    <P>I think it is a welcome feature of this debate on education that we do not approach these problems from a Party standpoint.  We approach them rather from the point of view of contributing to the debate what we consider to be the best ideas for the advancement of education.  While the fundamental subjects of the primary schools are the three R's, the formation of character and the instilling into children of a desire to work and a desire to learn are equally important.  I was impressed by the speech made by Deputy Major de Valera last night in which he stressed the importance of building up the character of our children and inspiring them with a sound Christian and national outlook.  We must admit, to our deep regret, that as a nation we have not made much progress in this particular type of education.  We must admit that the Christian principles to which Deputy de Valera referred, while they may be understood by all our people in theory, are very often neglected in practice.  We must admit that there is an absence of charity and an absence of chivalry in dealings between man and man in this country. We must admit that respect for <Col N="2189" /> property does not exist in our young people to any great extent.  During the past week I saw trees planted in a certain locality by a county council.  Those trees had to be surrounded by fortifications which would be almost sufficient to protect a military outpost.  I am sure that every tree planted in the particular county to which I refer must cost at least £20 in providing protection for it.  I do not think that should be necessary in a country where there is a proper system of education.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a tendency towards snobbery and a tendency towards seeking that type of work in which manual labour is not required. There is also snobbery in regard to many matters connected with education. If I were one of those who believed in compulsion I would make it compulsory for children to go barefoot during the summer months.  In the school where I attended as a child any child found wearing boots after the 1st May was ostracised.  If a child was seen wearing boots in the summertime the report went out immediately that that child was suffering from deformed feet, or some defect of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think our attitude towards matters of this kind has been steadily changing.  On the one hand, there is a tendency towards hampering children and towards building up a sort of shelter around them against the realities of life; on the other hand, we have evidence very often of the criminal neglect of children.  All these are problems to which our Council of Education must direct its attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions raised most frequently during this debate has been the question of the raising of the school-leaving age.  From listening to the debate one would imagine that there was only one side to that particular question.  There are, however, on this question, as upon all questions of public importance, two sides.  I think it would be a good thing to raise the school-leaving age provided one was sure that facilities were available to give the children adequate education <Col N="2190" /> until they reach the age of 16.  We must remember that throughout the greater portion of the country we have not a sufficient number of continuation schools or vocational schools which those children can conveniently attend. For that reason I think it would be an injustice both to the parents and to the children to raise the school-leaving age in any area where adequate facilities for vocational, technical or secondary education are not available.  As far as secondary education is concerned I think it would be unfair to compel children to attend any school which is not free or require them to seek education which is not provided free.  In areas where there are not suitable vocational or technical schools, I think it would be a criminal injustice to raise the school-leaving age to 16.  We know there are no facilities in the national schools for teaching children after they reach 14, and that the children's time would be purely wasted.  That would constitute a serious injustice to the children as well as a hardship to their parents.</P>
    <P>We must all realise that for the small farmer and the agricultural worker it does constitute a severe additional burden and a distinct hardship to compel their children to attend school until they are 16, but I am sure that if the education provided was adequate and suitable for the child in after life the parents would make the necessary sacrifice.  It would be wrong to insist on that sacrifice while failing to provide the education which the children require.</P>
    <P>If it is proposed to raise the school-leaving age, the first step must be to provide additional technical or vocational schools.  I do not know what number would be required to cater for all the children leaving the primary schools, but the existing number would have to be greatly increased.  In this connection one of the first things the Minister will have to consider is whether to provide a sufficient number of vocational schools so as to bring them within a distance of three or four miles from each child's residence, or whether it would be found more advantageous to provide some sort of transport system which would enable the <Col N="2191" /> children to be conveyed from the remote rural areas to the larger vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the provision of a transport system would be the best solution of the problem.  There are quite a number of vocational schools throughout the country and many of them are rather sparsely attended. They could cater for a greatly increased attendance if some kind of transport system were provided.  What I envisage is that we would have a vocational school for every seven, eight or nine primary schools, and some sort of public conveyance would travel to each primary school, using that school as a collecting depôt from which to gather the children.  That would be the best solution, because in any type of vocational or technical school nothing is more desirable than to have a fairly large attendance so that you can have a proper staff of teachers and the teachers will have proper classes with which to deal.</P>
    <P>This raises another problem.  Vocational schools are provided more or less on a county basis, and if you are to extend the radius which each vocational school will serve it will be necessary more or less to cover up county boundaries completely and let each vocational school cater for a comparatively large area which might embrace portion of one, two, or three counties. I suppose the Minister is well aware that there are numbers of vocational schools built quite close to county boundaries, and it would be necessary, in order to have a good attendance, to convey children from the adjoining counties.  If those facilities are provided, then and not till then should we consider making attendance compulsory up to the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which the Minister referred to in his opening statement and which is of very great importance.  He said that technical schools are now providing certificates of efficiency and that those certificates are more and more being sought by employers. That is one of the most desirable and most heartening features of vocational education.  Until the ordinary <Col N="2192" /> citizen can see visible signs that the education provided in the technical schools is of value, until he begins to realise that the certificates provided by those schools are not merely a kind of window-dressing, but are, in fact, guarantees that the children have got a sound technical education, we will be making no headway.  When the Minister says that employers are beginning more and more to seek those certificates, that is an encouraging sign that technical and vocational education are making some progress.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable situation that at the present time we have contractors all over the country engaged in the building trade crying out for skilled workers and cannot get them, notwithstanding the fact that we are spending over £7,000,000 on education and quite a substantial amount of that is provided for technical education.  We ought to be able to turn out a sufficient number of skilled workers capable of taking their place in the building industry without serving any further apprenticeship.  If our technical schools are worth anything, they should to able to provide workers fully trained.  That should be one of their functions, having regard to the shortage of houses and buildings of every kind. Skilled workers are urgently required and they should be provided from our schools.</P>
    <P>Another vexed question towards which many Deputies have directed their attention is that of agricultural education.  Rural vocational schools must make their first function the training of boys whose intention it is to remain in agriculture.  At present there is a marked tendency on the part, particularly of small farmers and agricultural labourers, to avoid sending their children to the vocational schools if they intend them to engage in agriculture. If a parent decides to send his boy to a vocational school it is usually because he has the intention of sending that boy further to obtain some job other than agriculture.  To a great extent I believe that this failure on the part of parents generally to appreciate the value of our rural schools as a training ground is due to the fact that up to the present it has not been possible <Col N="2193" /> in the vocational schools to give a really practical agricultural education. As a matter of fact, I think that county committees are finding it extremely difficult to get teachers who have the necessary agricultural qualifications for those rural schools.  That is a problem which will have to be faced and which will have to be solved before we raise the school-leaving age in our rural areas.</P>
    <P>The question of Irish was referred to at considerable length by a number of Deputies.  It is one of the questions which the Council of Education will be called upon to deal with.  I think that there is general agreement that the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish to children who do not understand the Irish language from their homes is extremely dangerous.  I would like to direct the Minister's attention now to a proposal which was laid before us last year in connection with the whole subject of teaching Irish.  Last year the present Minister for Agriculture suggested that the most desirable and the most effective way to advance the Irish language would be, not to make Irish compulsory for the purpose of competitive or qualifying examinations, but to offer an inducement to children by providing scholarships, first from the primary schools into secondary schools for children who have a good knowledge of Irish, and later by providing scholarships from the secondary schools to the university for children who qualify in Irish.  If that suggestion is adopted&mdash;and there should be no difficulty about adopting it now&mdash;I think that it will go further to help the Irish language than any form of compulsion, and I think that it is the most practical suggestion that has been put before this House on this important subject.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested to hear several speakers denouncing the attempt to simplify the spelling of Irish.  I think that those people cannot be serious.  We all agree that Irish has not made very much progress over the last 25 years and anything that would simplify this difficult subject and make it easier should, I think, be warmly supported by everybody who is enthusiastic about the language. <Col N="2194" /> But people who claim to be enthusiastic about it still insist on making it as difficult as it possibly can be made on those who have to learn it. That is typical of the impractical and more or less faddish attitude which Irish enthusiasts have.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in taking up the work as head of this most important public service, to realise that there is a tremendous responsibility on him with regard to the future of our race and the future of our nation.  He has got to ensure, as far as it lies in his power&mdash;and it does lie in his power to a very great extent&mdash;that the coming generation will be worthy of those who have gone before them.  I think that nothing will be more conducive to a sound approach to all the problems and all the difficulties that may face our young people than that they should be given a sound knowledge of the past history of our country.  I am one of those who agreed with Deputy Vivion de Valera when he said that history should be taught, not as a cold objective subject, but that it should be taught with enthusiasm, that it should be taught if necessary even in a propagandist spirit, that we should seek to inspire our young people with the belief that those who have gone before compared favourably with the people of other nations, that our heroes and our heroines compared with the national heroes of other countries and that there is no need to approach history with the cynicism with which it is approached by many so-called Irish scholars of the present day who set out to debunk the great figures of Irish history.  Our educational authorities should realise that unless our young people have a pride in our country's past they will be incapable of facing the difficulties and problems of the future.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle&mdash;Seo ceann de na meastacháin is tábhachtaí a thig romhainn san Dáil seo ó cheann go ceann na bliana agus is maith liom go bhfuil na teachtaí ag cur oiread suime ann.</P>

    <P>Tá muinín láidir agam as an Aire go gcuirfidh sé oideachas oiriúnach ar <Col N="2195" /> fáil d'aos óg na tíre.  Ceana féin, tá a chliú agus a ainm in airde ag múinteoirí scoile na tíre agus is maith an comhartha sin.  Má bhíonn comhoibriú maith idir an tAire agus na múinteoirí níl amhras ar bith nach dtiocfaidh toradh maith dá bharr.  Is trom an obair atá rompu ach is uasal an obair í.  Is uasal ar fad obair an mhúinteora a mhúnluíos intinn an páiste agus a threoraíos é ar shlí an léinn.  Caithfidh sé, fosta, an páiste a stiúradh ar shlí an fhírinne agus an ionracais agus i ngrá Dé agus na gcomharsan.  Is iad páistí an lae inniu fir agus mná an lae amáirigh agus beidh siad mar a hoilfear iad ina n-óige.  Caithfimid a bheith faithceallach fan ghlúin óg atá ag éirí aníos chugainn anois nó tá saol achrannach aimhréiteach amach rompu. Beidh fáilte roimh Chomhairle an Oideachais ar thrácht an tAire air.  Tá daoine thall is i bhfus a rá nach bhfuilmid ag dul chun cinn i gcúrsaí léinn i gcomórtas le tíortha eile na hEorpa. Ba náireach an scéal sin againne a thóg lóchrann an léinn ar fud na hEorpa nuair a bhí an Mhór-Roinn sin faoi dhorchadas.  Ar aon chaoi, is maith an rud go mbeidh comhairle mar seo againn leis an scéal a bhreithniú ó am go ham.</P>
    <P>Tá amhras ar cuid de na daoine go gcuirfidh Comhairle an Oideachais cúl ar theagasc na Gaeilge.  Ní chreidim sin&mdash;ar ndóigh is í ár dteangaidh náisiúnta í.  Is í an tseod is luachmhaire dá bhfuil againn í agus caithfidh sí áit ard agus áit onórach a bheith aici ón bhun-scoil go dtí an ollscoil. Tá mé cinnte nach gcuirfidh an tAire ná Comhairle an Oideachais bac ná creapall ar bith uirthi.</P>
    <P>Chím go bhfuil rún ag an Aire cigireacht ar leith a chur ar bun don Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh maitheas as.</P>
    <P>Anois ba mhaith liom labhairt in éadan an litriú nua ar an Ghaeilge a táthar a chur sa mhullach orrainn gan fáth gan ábhar gan cuireadh.  Ní aithneodh duine ar bith go raibh gaol ag an rud seo leis an teangaidh, an béal beo, a tháinig anall chugainn ón ár sinsear. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mé ag labhairt ar son mhór-chuid Gael <Col N="2196" /> Éireann nuair adeirim nach nglacfar leis an litriú nua seo a chur préamhacha na bhfocal as aithne agus atá ag cur balla agus bábhuin idir Gaeilge an lae inniu agus an teanga a tháinig anuas chugainn leis na mílte bliain.</P>
    <P>Ní héagcosúil teanga tíre le gach rud atá beo.  Fásann sí agus tig craiceann úr uirthi má tá a préamhacha go láidir i dtalamh.  Ach má tógtar aníos as an úir préamhacha an phlanta a bhí i dtalamh gheobaidh sé bás.  Is é a dhalta sin ag an teangaidh é.  Is é an bás atá i ndán di má scaithtear na préamhacha ón ar fhás sí.  Fás na mílte blian an Ghaeilge a tháinig anuas chugainn ón ar sinsear.  Na préamhacha atá aici tá gaol acu le préamhacha na dteangach Ceilteach eile agus ní cóir dúinn scarúint leo.</P>
    <P>Corradh le fiche bliain ó shoin, tháinig foclóir mór Uí Dhuinnín amach. Rinne an Foclóir léanta sin litriú na Gaeilge a shocrú go beacht agus bhí Gaeil na tíre uilig sásta ar ghlacadh le litriú an Fhoclóra sin.  Choinnigh an foclóir sin préamhacha na bhfocal gan truailliú mar tháinig siad anall chugainn ón litríocht.  Bhí litriú Uí Dhuinnín ag cur go dlúth le fogharaíocht na teanga san áit ag fhearr a bhí sí dá labhairt.</P>
    <P>Admhaím go bhfuil mion-athraíocha riachtanach sa litriú ach má níthear athrú ar bith bíodh údarás maith leis. Mholfainn don Rialtas gur cheart daobhtha na scolairí Gaeilge is fearr dá bhfuil againn a thabhairt le chéile le comhairle agus treoir a thabhairt don Rialtas fá cheist na Gaeilge idir litriú agus foirm cheart na teanga.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to ask the Minister if he will hold out any hope that he will do anything for the ex-teachers.  There are some ex-teachers who have served this country well and whose pensions are only £1 a week.  The number is rapidly dwindling. We were led to believe from the promises that were made within the last 12 months that something would be done for these people at a later date. Now we have that opportunity and I hope the Minister will remember these people and the services rendered by them.  I speak not only for those teachers who retired years ago on a very small pension of £1 or 25/- but also on behalf of the teachers who retired within the past 15 years on very moderate pensions.  In some cases their means are just sufficient to prevent their getting an old age pension.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Council of Education will cover the points covered by a circular issued by the Irish National Teachers' Association, who ask that a committee be appointed to inquire into their general conditions and rates of pay.  They maintain that the rates of the increases granted to them within the past year or two were totally inadequate.  The Minister for Education is aware that these men and women ceased work as a protest against the offers that were made to them.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will form a committee, giving the teachers representation, and that they will be able to sit down at a conference table with the Minister and his officials and arrive at some happy conclusion that will be satisfactory to all concerned. I hope that never again will the necessity arise for strike action in order to get the Government to see their point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago I was asked to draw attention to the position of principal teachers in schools where there are four <Col N="2198" /> or five assistant teachers.  The principal teacher of such a school has the responsibility of making out reports of all kinds, about attendance, school meals, and a hundred and one other things, and at the same time has to carry on actual class work.  That means, even if he only takes half an hour a day to make out these reports, that half an hour's additional work is put on to somebody else or that there is a half-hour of slackening down in the education of the children.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has any proposal which will satisfy those who have four and six assistant teachers and who at the same time have to mind their own classes and make out these reports.  I would be glad to know if the Minister intends to do anything to meet them and to make things somewhat more comfortable for them than what they are now.  I will not detain the House any longer on this point except to express the hope that the Minister will meet the teachers in all matters affecting their own welfare as well as that of the children.</P>
    <P>I have heard one of my colleagues on this bench drawing attention to technical education.  He drew attention to the scarcity of housing and he said that the technical schools ought to be able to provide young people who would go into the trades dealing with housing.  I earnestly express the hope that they will be able to do that.  I would not agree with him, however, in saying that two years' attendance at a technical school would make a competent tradesman.  I would not agree with him either that the child who has done two years in a technical school should not serve his time in a recognised workshop where he would have the assistance of skilled men, when necessary.  I stand for young people, after training in technical schools, serving their time in recognised building concerns.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was perfectly right in drawing attention on an Estimate for the Department of Education to the fact that there is a deplorable scarcity of housing all over the country.  Not alone is there a scarcity of housing in the country districts but in Dublin <Col N="2199" /> City the scarcity is appalling.  I often think that we do not give sufficient credit to our teachers, because it is difficult to understand how children coming from the tenements of Dublin, some of whom live with five or six others in a single room, can do their home exercises and lessons in candle light under such terrible conditions. Only a teacher who knows these conditions can tell you what can be expected from such children.  Only such a teacher can make excuses for the children because of the conditions under which they live.  These children are not able to absorb what the teachers wish to impart to them because of the conditions under which they are existing.  I hope that, with our new Government in power, something will be done quickly to remedy that evil.</P>

      <P>Tá an scéim seo ar siúl anois le mórán bliantach ag an Roinn Oideachais agus ba cheart go mbeadh cleachtadh maith acu ar an ghnótha.

    <P>Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire achan rud fan obair mhór atá ghá dhéanamh ag Comhaltas Uladh chun an Ghaedhilg a thabhairt arais.  Cuireann an Comhaltas scaifte páistí go dtí Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill ar feadh sé mhí achan bhliain.  Gheibh na páistí seo óstas ag daoine nach labhrann ach Gaeilge agus oideachas i scoltacha san Fhíor-Ghaeltacht agus is é mo bharúil féin nach bhfuil dóigh ar bith níos fearr ag páistí le eolas agus meas a fháil ar <Col N="2200" /> an teangaidh.  Ach ar an droch-uair ní thabharann an Roinn Oideachais cuidiú nó uchtach ar bith don Chomhaltas ins an obair inmholta atá idir lámha acu. Ar feadh m'eolais ní aithníthear na páistí a chuireann an Comhaltas go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus a ní freastal ar na scoltacha ansin chun &ldquo;aicme scoile&rdquo; a ordú nó ní fhághann na príomh-oidí aon chúiteamh as iad a theagasc nó ar shon an tsaothair a ghlacann siad leo.</P>
    <P>Cinnte má tá an Roinn Oideachais dá ríre fa aithbheodhadh na Gaeilge, caithfear na múinteoirí sa Ghaeltacht a chúiteamh ar son an méid oibre de bharraíocht a ní agus iad ag teagasc na bpáistí seo.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of Irish in the schools, a great many of us felt afraid, in view of the attitude of the Opposition during the late Government's time, that something very detrimental might be done to the language.  However, I feel glad to be able to agree with most of the speakers that we have no fear that under the present Minister for Education anything detrimental to the language will be done.  I believe the question is being examined calmly and dispassionately at present and that the effects of the teaching of Irish in our schools, particularly in the lower standards, is being gone into.  I would be very much surprised if, as a result of this inquiry and investigation, any <Col N="2203" /> very fundamental change were made. I read in the papers recently that the Minister for Education, when speaking at Carysfort Training College, mentioned that British critics had expressed the opinion to him that very fine work was being done in our educational establishments.  That has been my own opinion and my own experience which I have expressed year after year on these Estimates.</P>
      <P>Early in this debate my young friend, Deputy Michael J. O'Higgins, stated that he found there was wide and general dissatisfaction among parents with regard to the effects of the teaching of Irish in our schools. He said that he thought I would agree with him that that was my personal experience.  I must say that my personal experience has been the opposite.  I have found parents quite proud of what their children were doing and what was being done for them in our schools.  As a matter of fact, the majority of parents now, when speaking to you, will boast of their young children being able to speak Irish.  Of course, they probably exaggerate a bit.  The general attitude is one of satisfaction and even of pride.  That is my personal experience. However, as I said, I have no fear that the position of Irish in our schools will deteriorate in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of classes, I hear Deputies from every Party speaking of a class as something that you can make rigid, tie down to a certain figure.  That is not the case. A teacher of infants will probably have very low numbers in the class from the beginning of the school year until the weather begins to improve, probably about the 1st April, and from the 1st April until the end of the school year you will have an influx of new entrants into the school.  The teacher in that way may have a class of 60 or 65.  But at the end of June most of these will pass on to a higher class and that teacher is again left with a class of quite reasonable dimensions.  What can you do in a case like that?  You cannot appoint a new teacher for these new children coming in.  A class of 60, <Col N="2204" /> or possibly 65, will last only for a very short time.</P>
    <P>There is another point arising out of that.  Any teacher that I know of would prefer to teach a class of 50 in a classroom to himself than teach a class of 40, or even of 30, in a classroom with another teacher trying to teach an equally small class.  The hardship on the teachers and the loss to the pupils are very much greater with two classes of 30 pupils working in the same classroom than if they were amalgamated and in charge of one teacher in the one classroom.  I mention this because if, as a result of the substitution of the average on rolls for the average attendance, additional teachers are appointed, immediately that raises a very big question.  Many of the two-teacher schools with just two classrooms will become three-teacher schools and you will still have only the two classrooms, at least until a third one is built.  In the same way, in the larger schools it will probably mean an addition of two, three, or more new classrooms.  That means additional and great expense.</P>
    <P>Most people think that you have only to pay for the extra teachers.  That is not so.  You are putting a tremendous building programme on yourself.  We know how hard it is to get houses erected for the working-classes, the middle classes, or in fact anyone at present, and the problem will be a big one and one that will have to be faced. I cannot see from the Estimates just where the money is going to come from. If it is found that this entails a great deal of additional expense, I wonder if the money can be advanced without bringing in a Supplementary Budget. If the classes are made smaller and if a big building programme must be embarked upon, it means the expenditure of a good deal of money and I cannot see how it can be done or even attacked without a Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>On that point, I make a plea that, if a Supplementary Budget has to be brought in to cope with this additional expense in our schools, the opportunity should be taken to improve the salaries of our teachers and, above all, the pensions of the teachers who went out under the old salaries and who are living in very great hardship, except in <Col N="2205" /> cases where they have children or others earning to supplement their terribly meagre pensions.  That is very necessary both for the teachers and for the pensioned teachers, because the cost of living is undoubtedly higher now than it was when the new salaries were fixed by the late Government.  I understood the Minister for Finance last night as giving an assurance that something in the way of an increase in salaries was meditated at an earlier date than is generally understood.  I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that I have interpreted the Minister for Finance correctly.  Up to yesterday, the impression was that the teachers must wait.  I thought from an earlier pronouncement from the Minister that the teachers must wait.  Must they wait until the date fixed by the late Government for reconsideration of their salaries?  If they have to wait until then, it will be a terribly bad &ldquo;let-down&rdquo; for the teachers.</P>

      <P>I hope that, in view of the high hopes that were raised in the teachers by the promises of all the people on the opposite benches during the election time, the teachers will not be let down, and, above all, that the pensioned teachers will not be let down.  I think there is a good deal of waste in the overlapping of primary and vocational work, the overlapping as it were of the work of two Departments at the present time.  Many technical or vocational schools are doing one, and in some cases two, full year's primary work.  I do not think there is any necessity for that, and I am made more apprehensive by the suggestion that children should be withdrawn from the primary schools at 12 years of age. The majority of our children do not get anything beyond a primary education, which lasts up to 14 years of age.  I fear very much, in spite of whatever compulsion may be tried as regards attendance at school, that, if this idea <Col N="2206" /> of withdrawing children at 12 years of age is persisted in, very many of them, if not the majority, will finish their education at 12 years of age instead of at 14.  I say that because when children leave the primary school to go into a vocational or secondary school they usually have long distances to travel, and hence are not so directly under the supervision of their parents or so directly under the supervision and care of the local clergy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own experience has been that very many children, when they are sent at a young age to a technical school, are inclined to go wild, to play truant, and that very often they are taken from these schools after one, two or three years with scarcely anything added to what they did in the primary school.  I think it would be a much better thing, and I really do not see why it could not be carried out, to have an additional trades room added to every national school, or at least to the principal school in each parish.  If you had one room of that sort it could cater for leatherwork, metalwork and woodwork if the water-tight compartments that exist in our educational system between primary, secondary and vocational were broken down.  I do not see what is to prevent a vocational teacher going into a primary school and giving an hour's instruction there, passing on to another primary school and doing the same there, and then going to a third primary school and giving another hour's instruction there.  In that way you could have three classes by the simple addition of one room to the existing national school, and as well you would have what I think would be a bigger advantage than anything else: you would have the children kept near home under the supervision of their parents and under the supervision and care of their parochial clergy.  I know that many vocational teachers will resist this as thinking that it is something that would be detrimental to their interests.  I really do not think it would be.  I may say that these teachers should, of course, be under the vocational authority, and should be paid at the ordinary rates which they receive in the technical school.  The breaking down which I suggest of the <Col N="2207" /> water-tight compartments must be allowed to bring that into operation.</P>
    <P>I am now going to say a thing which, I fancy, will surprise many, and that is that I do not think we have nearly enough school inspectors.  I should say that I feel certain we have not enough.  The relations between inspectors and teachers have not always been happy, and 20 or 25 years ago, and earlier still, the position was much worse.  In my opinion that was due to the fact that the inspectors could only call into a school on very rare occasions.  When they did come along, they had to try to assess the value of the work done in that school in a single day.  That, of course, was impossible. All they could do was to take a subject, for example, arithmetic, give the children a certain number of sums and if the answer in a big percentage of cases was right, mark the subject of arithmetic &ldquo;good&rdquo;, or they might give a certain amount of spelling and if the answering was satisfactory mark the subject &ldquo;good&rdquo;.  How on earth are inspectors who can only get around once, possibly, in 12 months &mdash;and the senior men at much rarer intervals&mdash;to assess the real value of the work done in a school&mdash;the moral value of the school?  I do not think it can be done.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the system is that the teachers do not get to know the inspectors well, while the inspector does not get to know the teachers well. In the case of lady teachers, anyhow, for the one day over a very long period on which the inspector is in the school, they are working under a strain.  They are not working naturally and are not showing themselves up to the best advantage.  Very often, they are not teaching in the ordinary normal way in which they teach during the inspector's absence.  I think that if there were more inspectors, if they could come in and just watch the work done in a school, make suggestions and come again to see if these were being carried out, and if they were to help the teachers in actual teaching and in the control of the various problems that arise, it would be altogether to the good, and even if my suggestion cost <Col N="2208" /> a little it would, in my opinion, be very wise expenditure.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this debate a plea was made that this Vote should be discussed calmly, and should not be approached at all in a Party spirit.  I think that was an admirable suggestion and one I should like to see carried out. I make the plea that there should be great reluctance to bring about any marked change in education here.  I have taught in every type of school from the most remote country school to the large city school and I know pretty well what is being done in the various types of schools throughout the country.  Not only that, but members of my family have taught in Britain; I have a great many friends teaching there still and I exchange opinions with them quite frequently.</P>
    <P>Having heard their views, I think our work compares extremely well with the work done on the other side of the Channel or probably in any other country.  I think we should be very slow to make any fundamental change in our education and particularly with the educational system as it is.  Of course, in matters of detail it is quite different.  Certain details may need a change and probably do; that is only natural, but to make a fundamental change, to my mind, would be a very great mistake.  I wonder if the people of Dublin, in particular, are conscious of the really satisfactory state of education in this city.  You have excellent primary schools doing very fine work. Then you have secondary schools under Christian Brothers and under nuns. Children of the working classes are taken into these secondary schools and there given an education second to none anywhere, at what is a very nominal cost and in many cases at no cost at all to the parents. There is a personal attention given to these children that is not given anywhere else in the world that I know of. You have our Christian Brothers and our nuns getting children out of working families and preparing them for the Civil Service, for positions under the corporation, and for all public examinations. The children of the very poorest are taken in and looked after at practically no cost whatever.  Then we have <Col N="2209" /> an excellent scholarship system in Dublin.  It is altogether away beyond what is being done in Belfast, for instance, for the people there.</P>
    <P>A plea was made to discuss this question calmly, but no matter what we may say in the Dáil it will not do very much harm.  We are not very adequately reported in the public Press and very few read the Dáil debates. What we say here does not do any great harm, but during an election period, where you have platforms studded over the country everywhere, and where you have people pouring out what, I regret to say, in the majority of cases is absolute lies as to the position of education in this country, trying to make parents discotented, trying to make them believe that the poor man's children are absolutely neglected in this country&mdash;that is a terrible thing. I listened myself to speeches on this very question and you could only expect to hear such statements in Moscow itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have any complaint to make as to the conduct of candidates during the election, it is that we do not hear candidates speak sufficiently often of education.  It seems to me to be a matter that is entirely neglected during election times; no educational programme is ever put before the electors. I do not know what Deputy Butler is referring to but I suppose he has some remorse of conscience owing to what occured in Dublin in 1946 and 1947&mdash;a matter in which he did not come out too well in the eyes of members of his organisation.  When dealing with education our chief consideration should be the child.  When the little one leaves home for the first time to go to school he is filled with wonder, entering, as it were, into a new world. An educational structure should therefore be built up which would tend to make for the training and education of that child.  The framework of that structure perhaps would be a contented body of teachers, comfortable schoolrooms, a suitable school curriculum, a satisfactory inspection system and proper co-ordination of primary, secondary and vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the question of contented teachers.  If there is to be a contented body of teachers, at least two of the <Col N="2212" /> great freedoms promulgated by one of the greatest statesmen the world ever knew, the late President Wilson, should apply to teachers.  That is freedom from want and freedom from fear.  Under freedom from want would come salaries and pensions.  I am afraid that I must complain that since the installation of our own Government in this country the teachers are the one body that has received the harshest treatment of all the servants of the State.  They have received continual cuts from various Governments.  At length they became so disgusted and disgruntled that in a small way a rebellion was brought about&mdash;if I may so describe it&mdash;by a certain section of their organisation. Perhaps it was only because of that that they received a somewhat tardy recognition and somewhat better conditions.</P>
    <P>If you want to have a contented body of teachers, not only must proper provision be made for them while they are on active service but they must also be assured that, when the future comes, proper provision will be made for them too during their years of retirement. At the present time teachers receive pensions on worse terms than any other State servants.  Their pensions have been based on depleted salaries because of frequent cuts. These cuts were never restored.  There are at least 640 women teachers who, under a regulation made by the last Government in 1938, were forced to retire before they reached the maximum number of years which would entitle them to a full pension.  I hope that the Minister will look into that matter and that some kind of restitution will be made to these women teachers for the ill-treatment they have suffered in the last ten years.  Certain of them may have suffered in that way right up to the present time.</P>
    <P>In the case of those teachers who are on pension, their pensions have never been increased even though the cost of living has increased by something over 70 per cent.  It was admitted in 1946 that the salaries paid to teachers were entirely inadequate.  Their pensions are based on those inadequate salaries and are, therefore, bound to be inadequate <Col N="2213" /> also.  When the Minister is making provision for increases in pensions, as I hope he will eventually, I would suggest to him that those pensions should be based on the new salary scale brought into operation on the 1st November, 1946.</P>
    <P>In connection with freedom from fear, under that comes the inspection system, rating, averages, and the marriage ban.  All these from time to time are a source of worry to the teachers.  Perhaps the inspectors themselves are not really to blame, except on very rare occasions where one might have a peculiar individual occupying a post as inspector.  It is the system that is wrong.  No inspector visiting a school once or twice a year, or perhaps once in two years, can ever properly calculate the value of the work that is being done in a school.  Putting a few questions to a teacher on the various subjects in the curriculum cannot help an inspector to mark a teacher in a proper way.  Furthermore, on the day on which the inspector is in that school the normal school work is not done at all.  No inspector ever saw the real work that is done in a school.  Possibly, now that rating has been abolished, relations between inspectors and teachers will be improved.  While the abolition of the average attendance is very welcome, and while it will make better provision for the staffing of the schools in general, nevertheless, in examining the manner in which the new averages are to be calculated, it is quite possible that in some of the large city and town schools, and in some of the rural schools too where there is a high percentage of average attendance, the system may really eventually cause a loss of teachers in those schools.  If the Minister will look into that matter, I think he will find that it may really accentuate the emphasis on big classes in the city schools.  I think myself that the new system of averages will ultimately mean a loss of teachers.</P>
    <P>As regards the marriage ban, this was a regulation brought into force in 1937 under which women teachers were compelled to retire on marriage.  The teachers' organisation has always considered this to be very unfair.  In fact, <Col N="2214" /> I think it is against the moral law.  It is not fair to condemn women either to live in single blessedness all their lives or, perhaps, deprive them of an opportunity of making a good marriage. If a teacher has to resign on marriage, she naturally will not have as good an opportunity of making a good marriage as she would have were she permitted to retain her position. I think that this regulation possibly came to us from across the water.  But they found over there that the regulation did not work out so well and teachers are now permitted to continue teaching after marriage.  Looking at it from the point of view of the child, one can readily understand that a woman teacher who is herself a mother will be in a better position to cater for character formation in the education of the child than will a single woman.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration, too, the fact that these women teachers spend anything from seven to nine years in being trained in the secondary schools, the preparatory schools and the training colleges.  It is rather unfair that after all that they should be compelled to retire on marriage. It may be argued that the place for a mother is in the home but up to 1934 women teachers taught in the schools and I think it will be admitted by everybody that their children were among the best in the land and attained to some of the highest and most responsible positions in the country.  A number of those teachers had entered the preparatory colleges before that rule was promulgated. When they set out on their vocation they never visualised that such a regulation would be brought into force.  At least those teachers should be considered and the regulation should not apply to them.  I would ask the Minister to look into that particular point and relieve that particular section of them from anxiety.  Some case may be made, perhaps, for those teachers who took up this particular vocation after that regulation had been made.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking of a contented body of teachers and freedom from <Col N="2215" /> want and freedom from fear, I must refer to a remark made here by Deputy Lemass when he was dealing with the Estimates.  Referring to the teachers' organisation and its funds, he asked how much money they spent in order to drive Fianna Fáil out of office and he also asked what dividends did the teachers get.  The teachers never asked for any dividends to do what they thought was right.  When the Treaty was being accepted in 1922, the teachers never looked for the concessions which they could get under Article 10, because they believed that their countrymen in an Irish Government would keep faith with them and treat them decently.  We do not look for any dividends now.  When Deputy Lemass says that our funds were used in order to advertise in the Press, I may say that those funds were used with the full authority of the teachers' organisation. A resolution was passed at the teachers' congress, which is the ruling body of the organisation.  Therefore, anything the teachers did as regards advertising in the Press was done with the full authority of the organisation and whatever money was expended, it was money belonging to the teachers themselves.  The Fianna Fáil Party were very glad to have the support of the teachers in 1932, helping to return them to power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the new Minister came into office, the teachers have got some dividends.  He has given us wonderful concessions.  Indeed, one of the teachers at the congress in Bundoran, having read the Minister's <Col N="2216" /> speech, declared that all the resolutions on the agenda could be regarded as null and void, because what they demanded had already been conceded by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to set up a Council of Education.  The teachers have been demanding that for years.  I hope that when he is selecting members for that council he will not appoint cranks.  I trust that he will bring into that council men of fine, broad views. Another great concession the Minister gave the teachers is in connection with the increments for the Dublin teachers who were on strike.  The last Government refused to grant them the increments from the time when they would be legally due.  Seven and a half months were to elapse before they would be paid increments.  The new Minister kindly enough ruled that they would be paid their increments in the ordinary way without having to wait for seven and a half months.</P>
      <P>He also agreed to set up an arbitration board.  I would like to know when it is likely to be established, because, according to the regulation brought in by the last Government, I understand a revision of salaries must take place in 1949.  It would be well if the arbitration board were quickly set up so as to be ready to deal with that.  I trust that arbitration board will deal with the question of salary revision, the conditions of service and pensions.</P>
      <P>As regards pensions, I hope that there will be a retiring gratuity given to pensioned teachers.  In Northern Ireland they have the Black Committee, which would correspond to our arbitration committee; in England they have the Burnham Committee and in Scotland the Lord Teviot Committee.  We hope that the arbitration board that will be set up by our Minister for Education will, in future, be known as the General Mulcahy Committee and that it will do much for the welfare of Irish teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many references have been made to teaching through Irish.  The teachers' organisation almost unanimously agreed some years ago, in answer to a questionnaire, that the present system <Col N="2217" /> of teaching through Irish is wrong.  It is all right to teach through Irish when the home language of the children is Irish, but it has been felt by teachers of experience that the system of teaching children through a language they do not quite understand is what I might call almost ridiculous.  While we are all in favour of the revival of Irish, we hope the Minister will hold an inquiry into the system of teaching through the medium of Irish in order to see how far it is useful and how far it may be wrong.</P>
    <P>Irish will never be revived by allowing children to leave school at 14.  That is just the period when they really understand what they are learning. Our children should be taught in the primary schools until they are 14. Then attached to every school there should be a department where higher primary education could be taught under the care of a special teacher until the children reach the age of 16. Then in every parish there should be a vocational school where the children would be taught until they are 18. Various subjects could be taught through that system and all through Irish.  The children could be taught history, geography, and, in the vocational schools, various arts and crafts in addition to these other subjects.  It is only in that way that we will be able to get the children of our nation properly educated.  When Irish is being taught to them in that manner up to 18 years of age they should certainly have a thorough knowledge of it and be able to go out into the world with a good knowledge of their native tongue.</P>
    <P>Since the advent of the new Government a wonderful change for the better has taken place in the educational arena.  The new Minister has lifted, as it were, the iron curtain that surrounded the education office.  He has met representatives of the teachers in a friendly and sympathetic manner. His work has been highly appreciated by the Irish teachers' organisation, because he has helped in no uncertain way to advance the cause of education in this land which was at one time so famous for the culture and education of its people.</P>

      <P>Sin iad an cúpla focal a bhí le rá agam san teangan i dtaobh an litriú nua.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the discussion on the new spelling of Irish and I find myself in agreement with the new spelling.  In my own experience, in learning Irish, I have found that the dead letters which are to be found in such profusion throughout our language are the cause of very great confusion, especially in the minds of children.  An tAthair Peadar Ó Laoghaire, referring to Irish writers said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the duty of such writers to give us in black and white on paper the real living speech of the people, unclogged and unhampered with strings of adventitious letters whose original phonetic purpose has been obsolete for generations and whose presence, therefore, in the spelling, is a violation of the fundamental <Col N="2220" /> principle which has regulated Irish spelling from time immemorial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that the alteration in our methods of spelling cannot but be an improvement and a help towards the restoration of the language but I feel that hitherto there has not been a proper approach to the revival of Irish.  Children going to school, unfortunately, have come to regard Irish with something approaching terror in many cases. What has been said about trying to pass along knowledge to the young mind through the medium of a language which the young mind does not comprehend is very true.  It surely is a most asinine and unreasonable procedure. Further, it is unreasonable to expect that Irish can be revived by means of coercion, by terrorising our children into learning it&mdash;a totally fallacious idea.  To revive the language we will have to instil in the minds of the youth a love of the language.  Any child, or any grown person for that matter, who comes to gain an acquaintance with Irish literature cannot but develop a love of the language, but any child or person who is forced in any way to learn Irish, which is a difficult subject enough, by means of coercion is bound to become an enemy of the Irish revival.</P>

      <P>I hardly think we should anticipate spending several centuries in reviving Irish.  It is a well-known fact that coercion is the least useful thing where the language is concerned. It is our duty to try to inculcate into the young people a love of this tongue of ours, which must be one of the most beautiful languages in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy de Valera last night, and I think some of his statements betray a totally false grasp of the position of education.  He said that <Col N="2221" /> unless we had the language as the spoken medium&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;economic and social freedom were merely like chaff without the wheat.  I believe that Deputy de Valera was thinking in reverse.  I believe that unless we have economic and social freedom it is useless to talk of restoring the language or of developing our culture.  The Deputy also referred, quite rightly, to the need for telling our school children of the great men of Irish history and of familiarising them with the stories of the heroes of our nation.  He mentioned Padraic Pearse, Thomas Davis and Myles Byrne.  I do not know why he did not mention James Connolly, Michael Davitt and James Fintan Lalor.  I believe that the works of men such as these&mdash;Lalor, Davitt and Connolly&mdash; should be put into the hands of our young people, so that they may see that we did have not alone poets and soldiers in our history but great social thinkers as well, men who were far ahead of their time.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that we should strive towards the aim as set by Deputy Captain Cowan to provide free educational facilities in every phase for the masses of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler stated that education is presently available to children of the working class.  Everybody is aware that that is not so.  The child of the working-class family must, by dint of economic necessity, leave school as soon as it has the three R's and in many cases sooner and go to work in order to provide some little help to keep the family going.  Children of the better off can get a secondary education and university education. That does not conform to the ideas for which Pearse and Connolly strove and laid down their lives.  Education should be fully and absolutely free to all sections of our people and we should strive with all our might, despite the obstacles, to bring about that position in our country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera stated last night also that it might yet be our function to re-Christianise Europe. That is a very noble ideal.  Personally, I think that, if we try to set about here, from this House, the job of applying <Col N="2222" /> practical Christianity in the four fields of Erin, we will be doing much more necessary work at the present time. We hear much talk of Christianity but, unfortunately, we see very little of it in practice.  It is not helpful to indulge in such airy prognostications.  Our task is to see what we can do for our own people and do it to the best of our ability.</P>

      <P>Mhol an tAire dúinn nuair a bhí sé ag cur an Mheastacháin seo os comhar na Dála gan politíocht a mheascadh le cúrsaí oideachais.  Comhairle mhaith abea é sin, ach chuir an comhairle sin ag gáire mé nuair a chuimhníos ar na mblianta cuaidh thart agus conus mar a chuir an tAire an chomhairle sin i bhfeidhm nuair a bhí sé ar na binsí seo, agus na daoine sin taobh thiar de.  Aontuím gur ceart dúinn go léir an Meastachán seo a phlé i gcomhnaí gan aon pholitíocht a tharraingt isteach ann. Dúrthas anseo i mbliana&mdash;agus gach bliain eile go raibh mise anseo ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht&mdash;gurab í an Meastachán seo an ceann is mó ar a labhartar ná aon cheann eile de na meastachaín uile a pléitear.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí an t-Aire ar an dtaobh so bhíodh sé ag síor-ghearán mar gheall ar easpa eolais so mhéid a bhíodh sa ráiteas ón Aire an uair sin.  Ach d'ar ndóigh, is fíor-bheagán eolais a thug sé féin dúinn sa ráiteas a thug sé ag tosnú dhó sa díospóireacht seo. Bhféidir nach féidir é a thógaint air i mbliana, mar níl sé i bhfad ina Aire fós.  Ní raibh de eolas aige sa ráteas, ach amháin go raibh beartaithe aige Comhairle Oideachais do chur ar bun. Níl creideamh ró-mhór agamsa ins an gcomhairle sin ach fanfaimid go bhfeicimid.  Ba mhaith liom a fhios a bheith agam cionus a bheidh an chomhairle chomh-dhéanta agus cad a dhéanfaidh sí nuair a bheidh sí ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>B'fhearr liom an scéal a bheith mar atá.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil na comhairlí sin i dtíortha eile, ach níl ceisteanna sna tíortha sin cosúil leis na ceisteanna atá le réiteach againn anseo.  Níl ceist aithbheochaint teangan acu, cur i gcás.  Thuigeas ón méid adúirt an tAire nach raibh sé chun comhairle do chur ar bun go mbeadh <Col N="2223" /> cead ag cumainn áirithe ionadaithe do thoghadh ar an gcomhairle sin, go raibh sé féin chun na Comhaltaí a phiocadh amach.  Ní mian liomsa aon chomhairle a fheiscint a dhéanfadh scrúdú ar obair na Gaeilge sna scoileanna le fonn an obair sin do chur siar. Sin ceann de na príomh-fháthanna nach maith liom an chomhairle do chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Dúrathas ón dtaobh seo go bhfuil intaoibh as an Aire nua mar gheall ar an nGaeilge.  Arís, fanfaimid go bhfeicimid. Tá súil agam ná déanfar aon athrú ar an gcóras atá ar siúl le 25 bliain anuas chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar theanga labhartha.  Tá dluth baint ag an gcóras oideachais le bás no beatha na Gaedilge go mór mhór bun-oideachas.  Má sábháilfear an Gaeilge, is sna bun-scoileanna a déanfar é sin.  Tá daoine sa tír agus sa Dáil freisin ag ceapadh gur obair in aisce an obair atá ar siúl le 25 bliain anuas.  Tá daoine eile sa Dáil a cheapann nach fuilimíd ag gluaiseacht tapaidh go leor in aon chor, ná fuil go leor déanta agus ghá dhéanamh, agus ná fuil fuinneamh ná sprid ná saothar go leor ghá chur san obair.  Tá bás agus beatha an náisiúin ag braith ar cionas éireoidh le h-obair na Gaeilge sna scoileanna le linn na glúine seo. Má cailltear anois í, tá deireadh léi go deo.</P>
    <P>Chualas roinnt cainte mar gheall ar an nGaeilge mar ghléas teagaisc.  Ní raibh an chaint chomh glórach ná chomh flúirseach i mbliana agus a bhí blianta eile.  Bhí fáth leis sin.  Na daoine a bhíodh ag caint blianta eile, bhí gobán orthu i mbliana.  Cuid de na rudaí adúirt siad, ní raibh tuiscint, ciall ná éifeacht leo.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Breathnach nach raibh an teagasc trí Ghaeilge ar siúl ach i 600 nó 700 scoil ar fad.  Tá an figiúir ceart ag an Aire féin.  Tá cuid mhaith de na scoileanna san sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus san Ghaeltacht. Ní fheadar cé mhéid atá sa Ghalltacht. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cupla scoil i gCondae Luimnigh agus go bhfuil ag éirí leo go seoidh agus go maith agus go bhfuil na scoláirí a múintear trí Ghaeilge chomh maith le scoláirí in aon scoil go mbíonn an teagasc ar siúl trí <Col N="2224" /> Bhéarla acu.  D'éirigh leis na scoláirí san áiteanna árda d'fháil sa Stát-Sheirbhís chomh maith le scoláireachtaí do bhaint amach.  Níl sa chuid is mó den chainnt sin i gcoinne teagaisc trí Ghaeilge ach cur i gcéill, chun cur i gcoinne na Gaeilge féin.</P>
    <P>Bhí troid millteach ar siúl le linn 1925, 1926 agus 1927, agus an dream a bhí riamh i gcoinne na Gaeilge sa tír seo cheapadar an obair do chur ar gcúl ar fad.  Theip ortha.  Ghlacadar le &ldquo;teagasc trí Ghaeilge&rdquo; mar chleas chun an teanga do chur siar, nuair nár éirigh leo é sin do dhéanamh tríd an modh díreach.  Tá daoine anseo adúirt nach raibh aon mhaitheas sa méid oibre a bhí ar siúl ná aon dul chun cinn. Féadfaidh mé féin a rá nach fíor agus nach ceart é sin.  Is iontach an méid Gaeilge atá le fáil ar fud na tíre anois. Na daoine óga atá ar tí an scoil a fhághaint anois, nó a d'fhág le déanaí, tá a bheag nó a mhór de Gaeilge acu uile.  Ní hamhlaidh a bhí 20 bliain ó shoin.  Tá a fhios againn go léir cad é an constaic atá sa tslí agus cad iad na deacrachtaí atá le sárú.  Is í an cheist is mó ná an t-aos iar-scoile sin do choimeád ag labhairt na Gaeilge tar éis na scoileanna a fhágaint.  Más féidir leis an Aire an deacracht seo a shárú, beidh obair mhór déanta aige.  Lá gléas ar a láimh aige cun é sin a dhéanamh&mdash;sé sin an gléas gairmoideachas.</P>
    <P>Tosnaíodh roinnt blian ó shoin ar mhúinteoirí Gaeilge d'oilúint arís. Nuair a bhí an Teachta Ó Deirg ina Aire, do chuir sé cúrsaí ar bun chun múinteoirí speisialta d'oilúnt chun dul ar fud na tíre ag teagasc na Gaeilge dona daoine fásta sna gairm-scoileanna agus sna buíonta fé na Coistí GairmOideachais. Is dócha go bhfuil 50 nó níos mó ag obair anseo agus ansúd ar fud na tíre anois agus tá súil agam go leanfar den scéim sin agus go leanfar d'oilúint na múinteoirí sin chun go mbeidh níos mó díobh le fáil in gach aon chontae agus gach aon choiste gairm-oideachais.  Ní amháin go bhfuil orthu an Ghaeilge do mhúineadh ach tá orthu dul imeasc na ndaoine óg leis agus feiseanna, aeríochta, cuirmeacha ceoil, drámaí agus mar sin do chur ar siúl agus na daoine óga do bhailiú le chéile chun an sórt sin oibre do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> Léas sna páipéirí tamall ó shoin go raibh an tAire ag cur suime speisialta in obair an Ghúim.  Ní fheadar an fíor é sin nó nach fíor ach léas amhlaidh, agus ba mhaith liom cloisint uaidh cad tá beartaithe aige a dhéanamh i dtaobh an Ghúim.  Tuigim go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra le sárú anois maidir le cúrsaí clódóireachta agus gur deacair na leabhra atá idir lámh ag an nGúm do chur i gcló.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a lán leabhra scríofa ag scríneoirí go bhfuil cáil is clú orthu.  Tá na leabhra seo ag an nGúm le blianta anuas agus ní féidir iad do chur i gcló.  Admhaím san am chéanna go bhfuil obair fónta déanta ag an nGúm ó cuireadh ar bun é ach tá easpa abhair deá-léitheoireachta Gaeilge ann fé láthair agus ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire in iúl dúinn cad tá beartaithe aige ina thaobh.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from the same constituency as myself intervened in this debate.  He gave the impression that he believes that the system of education which was in operation under the old national board was better than the one we now have.  He considered the standard of education then was higher than it is now.  He quoted the President of University College, Cork, in proof of the correctness of his statement.  We have been dealing with the standard of education in the national schools and the Deputy was dealing with that.  I would be surprised if Professor O'Rahilly ever committed himself to the statement which was attributed to him.  In any case, universities do not deal with pupils from national schools, but with pupils from secondary schools and university professors or presidents of constituent colleges of the National University would not be in a position to judge of the standard of education in the national schools from the students they are accustomed to deal with.  Therefore, I do not think that the evidence adduced for the higher standard which is alleged to have existed in the time of the national board, as compared with the standard that exists under the system of education we have devised for ourselves here, can stand examination.</P>
    <P>Then there was another old chestnut <Col N="2226" /> produced by Deputy Seán Collins about the illiteracy in both languages. We have often heard that here before. It was a pity that that old chestnut was produced again.  I think it was unworthy of the speaker who made the statement.</P>

      <P>As education is the hallmark of progress in the world, it is only proper that it should occupy a most important part in the debates in this House.  It was gratifying to hear in the last few days so many Deputies speaking in the native tongue.  That is a happy sign that the Irish language, instead of dying out, is beginning to revive.  I believe that is so.  For years past there was a bone of contention between the Minister for Education and the national teachers throughout the country.  We are very glad to know that that has been brought to an end and that the teachers feel that something is going to be done for them. After all, if you have not tranquillity and peace in connection with education you will make no progress.  One of the principal things needed for that is a contented teaching profession.  I believe that we shall have that under the new Minister, because he has a humane outlook upon things, and that is what is needed for the purpose of bringing people together and bringing about harmony amongst different people.</P>
      <P>To my mind, one of the first drives needed urgently is one to provide proper schools throughout the country. I am glad to say that the progress made in school building in the last few years was very satisfactory, but it will have to be intensified so that we shall not have one bad school in the country. In some places the schools are nothing more than cowsheds.  A cow would be insulted if it were put into one of these places.  It is a disgrace to see children coming into a hut of a school in wet clothes and having nowhere to dry them.  They have either to put their clothes on the desk or on the floor.  In every school provision should be made for the drying of the children's clothes on wet days.  Often the children have to wear their wet clothes for the whole day in school.  It is time that should be brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about education. Some say that it is going back &mdash;that it is not as good as it was 30 or 40 years ago.  On the other hand, some say that it is going forward.  I am satisfied that it is making fairly satisfactory progress; at least I do not <Col N="2228" /> believe that it is going back.  I believe, however, that a new spirit is growing up not alone in this country but in other countries which is not good for the future of the world.  But, as regards education in the three R's, I believe that the children are as well educated as they were in my school days.  For the last 15 or 20 years, however, our people have not shown that moral courage which was shown in the past.  There are very few fixed principles.  Very few people, when they give their word, keep it.  They will break their word if an opportunity occurs.  I remember a time when a man would not break his word for anything.</P>
    <P>Then in the courts throughout the country we find perjury committed. That would not be tolerated 20 years ago.  I am satisfied that there is wholesale perjury throughout the country. I am sorry to have to say that, but it is the truth.  Even judges have commented upon it on several occasions.  These are things which will have to be tightened up.  I think the teaching profession has a big job in front of it in order to get down to what is needed.  What is wanted is a good groundwork, teaching a man to be a man.  Another thing that is needed in order to bring education to a proper level is to dovetail primary and vocational education.  In every school there should be a big classroom where children from 12 to 16 years should be taught such things as needlework, woodwork, engineering, etc.  I believe that a large number of extra teachers are required for that purpose.  In my county we have two or three centres where vocational education is carried on fairly satisfactorily, but that is not the solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>After all, only a fraction of the children of the ordinary people of the country go to these schools.  It means a journey of ten or 12 miles for them on a push bicycle.  A lot of them go there not so much for what they learn as to have a good time going and coming back.  I would like to see the children over 12 years of age who attend the national school getting practical instruction in woodwork.  A teacher could come to the school a <Col N="2229" /> couple of times a week and conduct a woodworking class for the boys.  There could be nothing more useful than to have farmers' sons and the other boys attending a national school given instruction in woodwork.  Later in life they would be able to put that knowledge to good use in the making of gates, carrying out repairs to a house or even in building out-offices.  I think they would be able to do that if, say over a period of from one to three years they had received instruction from a vocational teacher when attending the national school.  That would be of immense importance to the nation because it would help to make our people thrifty and handy.</P>
    <P>As regards education in general, I am satisfied that the ordinary school children throughout the country are not getting the opportunity for a proper education.  They have not the same opportunities as the children attending national schools in the bigger towns and villages where you have the nuns and the Christian Brothers and where, in many instances, you now have vocational schools.  Therefore, I think it is true to say that 80 per cent. of the children who attend the small schools in the rural areas get very little education, certainly not enough to fit them for suitable positions in life.  Steps should be taken to give the poor man's child the same opportunity as the child of the well-to-do man gets.  I do not believe in provision being made to give a higher education to a few children, mostly to those whose parents are fairly well off, so as to fit them to get into the Civil Service or into some other position of the kind.</P>
    <P>The children in the country districts are not getting half a chance.  They have brains galore, but for the want of a little help their talents are not being developed as they should be.  They are not able, because of a lack of money, to get that higher education which their talents entitle them to.  I want to see every man's child getting the same chance.  Millions of pounds will have to be spent and perhaps thousands of teachers employed if all our young people are to get a proper education.  It is our duty to see that it <Col N="2230" /> is provided.  We know that many people who have plenty of money can afford to send their children to the best schools.  Some of those children go on for the professions later, but very often they take many years to get through simply because they have not the brains.  They are not as clever as the children of poor parents who may be living in a cottage beside them.</P>
    <P>In my county a parish priest has taken steps to provide vocational instruction for the children in the area. He got a couple of those Nissen huts and had them erected beside the national school in which cookery and other useful subjects are taught.  The result is that the housewives in the parish area attend those classes and are now being prepared to cook good meals.  In the past the majority of them were not able to do that.  They had the teapot stewing on the fire from morning until night and that was all that was there for the husband when he came home in the evening after a hard day's work.  All that has now been changed in this little parish which is one of the most progressive in the country.  There is not a cottage around there now in which good meals are not provided every day in the week.  In addition, woodworking classes are conducted on two or three days a week for the boys who are getting instruction that will prove very useful to them later in life.  It will mean that they will be able to do a lot of their own work on their farms, and that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>The county that I represent was pretty foremost in making a big drive for the revival of Irish.  I am satisfied, however, that there is no enthusiasm behind the drive.  That is due to no fault of those who undertook the revival of Irish in the county but rather to the opportunists who came there 20 or 15 years ago.  When the Gaelic revival started 30 or 40 years ago some excellent work was done for Irish in the county.  Later, a number of those opportunists came into the county and they were not long in it until they had cashed-in on the language revival.  Some came from Donegal and from Clare.  They rushed helter-skelter on to every platform <Col N="2231" /> shouting about the Irish language not for the purpose of spreading the language but getting a good job for themselves. The moment they got the job we never heard of them again.  They were shouting and bawling until they got the job, and then there was silence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of them in the vocational schools, and then they were handsomely rewarded for about six months' shouting.  I know how they were digging in the right direction with the two feet.  I agree that we should treat the members of the teaching profession well, but we should ask the members of the teaching profession in return to keep out of politics.  One of the worst things that can happen to this country is to have the teachers in politics.  I do not care whether they are on my platform or the other.  They have a good job and if they mind it they can do good work for the nation. If the children see that the teachers are mixed up in politics and are appearing on one platform or the other, how can they have any respect for them?  I know that some teachers in my county have often given a good walloping to some children because their politics were not the right politics.  I am not saying that many teachers did that, but a few did.  I would like to see the Irish classes in my county put on a proper basis and the language revived.</P>
      <P>In the County Meath we are paying teachers simply for doing nothing. You may have three, four or five attending an Irish class at night-time, but unless there is dancing as well you will have no attendance at the classes. Many of those teachers are drawing money for doing nothing.  That is not their fault.  I am satisfied that the people are as good to-day as they were 20 years ago if only the spirit was there.  It is that desire of cashing-in and getting a good job that has killed the revival of Irish as far as my county is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county should be the very foremost in the Irish language movement because there were brought up to that county from Irish-speaking districts of Donegal, Connemara, Clare and elsewhere <Col N="2232" /> purely Irish-speaking migrants. I am satisfied that instead of the language being revived as a result of the creation of these colonies, it is rapidly dying out and I am sorry to say that in many of the colonies a new language is growing up which I do not like at all. I should like Meath to become the pivot of the revival of the Irish language movement.  A vast amount of money was spent in bringing these colonists to the county for the purpose of furthering the revival of the language&mdash;at least I hope that was the purpose and that it was not merely to maintain the number of voters for certain Parties.  It looks more like that than the revival of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in the present Minister for Education we have a real democrat, one with a proper outlook, nationally and otherwise.  We shall have a contented teaching profession under him and when we have a contented teaching profession, I am satisfied that our children will get a proper education.</P>
    <P>Life in the coming years, we all know, will be more than ever a struggle and one of the chief tasks confronting us is to stop emigration.  So far as I can see emigration will mean the death, not alone of the Irish language but of the Irish nation, because most of these people coming back bring bad ideas and a false outlook which is injurious to Christian ideals.  They usually exhibit a superiority complex which has sometimes a very bad influence on those who remained at home.  In the public-houses and at the crossroads, with plenty of money in their pockets, they try to flabbergast those unfortunates who have not been outside the country but I am satisfied that these people who left the country and boast so much of their travels, are not fit to wipe the boots of those who remained at home.</P>

      <P>We have had a fairly wide discussion over a large number of points on matters connected with education.  I am grateful for the spirit in which that discussion has been carried on and particularly for the atmosphere of good will that has been displayed to myself as the Minister dealing with the Estimate in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been complained by Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain that he did not get much information from the statement I made when introducing the Estimate.  I can quite appreciate that. No one appreciates more than I do how much was left unsaid, or had to be left unsaid, in the statement I made to the House when introducing the matter, because I am more keenly aware than perhaps any Deputy in the House is, except possibly Deputy Derrig, of the enormous amount of ground that has to be covered and reviewed before anyone can hope to stand up and in a comparatively short Parliamentary statement put into proper perspective those things that must be put into perspective if we are to understand where educational policy is leading, who those people are who must control and guide it and the obto understand where educational policy is leading, who those people are who must control and guide it and the objective towards which it should be directed.  Certain questions of various kinds have arisen as to what we have done for the teachers and as to what extent promises of one kind or another <Col N="2234" /> have been kept, or not kept, as the case may be.  These are questions that will inevitably arise in the aftermath of election and a change of Government. I would like to say, with reference to any suggestion that has been made about anything that I have promised to the teachers or about anything that, I have done for the teachers, that I myself am not conscious of having done anything for which I particularly deserve credit.  I am not conscious that I have failed in any way to face up to the implementation of any promises made to the teachers.  I am not cognisant of any specific promises that were made.</P>
    <P>In facing up to the work of the Department of Education I have set out to try to get clear in my own mind what the function of a Minister for Education&mdash;the political head of the Department of Education&mdash;is.  I am not yet quite clear as to what it is but I am shaping towards moulding a decision in my own mind in regard to that matter.  I do not regard myself as a leading educationist and I do not regard it as any function of mine to become a leading educationist.  My primary function is to deal with the educational establishment which is here, to take the moneys that are provided by the State here and see that these are used to the best advantage and that the Department itself is moulded in such a way as to be an inspiration and a help to those in the country who must be regarded as the educationists; that is, the men and women who stand in our schools and teach our classes and who are trained and educated to the work of teaching and who carry out that work with devotion. It has been stated that conditions in this country are different from conditions in other countries.  Therefore, it has been said, some of the things we are proposing to do are wrong and are not necessary.  If there is one thing that stands out in my mind as marking the difference between this country and Great Britain or Northern Ireland it is that in this country the people who are the real educationists and the people to whom we must look to forward and organise and improve education are away in the background. <Col N="2235" /> They are not known by name.  They do not appear on public platforms. They do not appear on committees. In Great Britain and Scotland you have local councils of education in respect of every little county and shire. On those councils educationists sit down side by side with the representatives of trade and industry and the representatives of the ordinary people and discuss openly educational problems that come before them.  In that way the people know who their leading educationists are.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a situation in which we are going to change the organisation of our educational machine in that particular respect.  In my opinion we must move in that direction by making it clear, first of all, that those who are the actual teachers in this country are the people who must guide and direct and be the ultimate force in strengthening the development of our education.  In a general way I have indicated the lines along which I am going in present circumstances. At the present moment I am engaged in the task of setting up a council of education.  Deputy Cowan considers, as do some others, that that council should be directly representative of a certain number of organised educational bodies in the country.  I have indicated the reasons why I do not think that would give us the kind of council for which we are looking.  I want a council of people who stand out pre-eminently as educationists with a general broad experience in the various spheres of education in the country, and not bearing a label as belonging to this particular body or that particular body.  I want a council of people who will inspire confidence that they are the people who have had experience in some particular branch of education; that they are competent by that experience, by their disposition and by their character to sit down in complete harmony and co-operation with others to review the entire field of education in the country; and who will be in a position to exchange experience and judgment in such a way as to bring the whole road over which the normal people of the country may expect to travel from the educational point of <Col N="2236" /> view under review and to ensure that at every rung of the educational ladder there is a proper direction based on the fundamental fact that education must ultimately lead to an adult population who will carry out the various avocations of their natural lives with competence, with dignity and with character based on a truly Christian foundation.</P>
    <P>I have discussed with many people throughout the country this particular problem.  The more I have discussed it the clearer I have become as to the first radical work that the council of education must do and the more I am satisfied that I am travelling along the right road.  I appeal to Deputies to give me my head in this matter and to wait until I set up my council and see what it will produce after it has been at work for a year or two.  Part of their function will be to find out whether they as a council are organised on the best and most appropriate lines. Various bodies have come to me suggesting that they should have representation on the council.  When I discussed with them the problem they realised that there is a wider point of view than perhaps the view they held. There are details in connection with the matter which I do not think it would be profitable to discuss at this stage.  We could spend quite a long time here discussing how we would set up such a council of education.  We could take the various classes of teachers and the various organisations connected with them.  If we attempt to set it up in a representative kind of way, in my opinion we would have too big a council and we would have a council scattered over too broad a field. I want a council concentrated on the real kernel of the education problem in the country.</P>
    <P>A question has been asked as to what has been done for the teachers and what is going to be done for them in the future.  In anything that has been done for them my attention has been mainly directed to the primary schools during the short time in which I have held office.  Anything that has been done has been done in order to streamline the relations between the Department and the teachers and to free the teachers from the irritations <Col N="2237" /> which have proved so obstructive to educational work and which come between them and their complete devotion to actual education.  Other matters are still under consideration and will require a certain amount of attention. As I said before, I regard the Department and the inspectors as having one main function.  That is to assist the teachers to do their work.  Therefore, I am trying to remove the irritations and the friction and to free the teachers, as Deputy Palmer said, from fear; in other words, I want to give them what Deputy Palmer asked for them&mdash;namely, freedom from fear.</P>
    <P>The inspectorial system has been criticised.  Deputy Lynch of Cork criticised the method by which the system of inspection is carried out.  Other Deputies criticised the inadequacy of it.  I am prepared to admit that a closer touch between inspectors and teachers would have very good results. I understand that elsewhere the term &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; has fallen into abeyance and it has been substituted by &ldquo;director&rdquo;. The particular individual goes into the school as a director, a helper and an adviser rather than as one who goes in with a notebook to criticise. I hope that when certain things are done we shall have a chance of reviewing the situation more fully in the future in order to establish a more harmonious relationship between the supervisory officers, the Department of Education and the teachers.  I hope to establish a relationship where the supervisor will appreciate that his function is to help and stimulate and I hope that in time the teachers will come to realise that that is the spirit in which the so-called inspection is carried out.</P>
    <P>On the question of salaries, Deputy Butler seemed to issue some kind of challenge that something had been left undone in that matter.  When the change of salaries was brought about at the end of 1946 it was stipulated in the provision then made that there would be a review of salary scales not later than November, 1949.  Beyond whatever special things may arise in the meantime, I have not in mind that there would be a general review of the primary teachers' salaries between this and 1949, but I have in mind that the arbitration body that would act as a <Col N="2238" /> permanent piece of machinery, arbitrating in matters of salary or conditions of service for the primary teachers, would be set up possibly towards the end of this year, so that there will be plenty of time to have whatever considerations that are to be reviewed fully reviewed before the period contemplated in the last scheme will have concluded and, whatever changes in conditions of service or salary are going to be introduced, the teachers will be quite clear with regard to what these are by September, 1949, so that there will be no lag in any change that will then take place.</P>
    <P>The question of the pensions of teachers, as I have said in reply to a Parliamentary question, has had very careful attention and I have put certain proposals before the Minister for Finance.  It ought to be easy to understand, having listened to the discussion on the Budget and the presentation of the picture of national finances that the Minister for Finance has had to put before the Dáil, that there are hesitations in taking decisions that affect pensions over a fairly large scale, but there is nothing that it is within our capacity to do that we will not do, and no time will be lost in the doing of it.  Whatever we can do to ameliorate and improve the conditions of the teachers will be done.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of talk with regard to the position of the language in the schools.  As I understand it, the criticism is with regard to method.  We have had talk about compulsory Irish and I think it has been made clear that by compulsory Irish a lot of people mean teaching through the medium of Irish.  Some people say that we ought to hear no more about compulsory Irish.  That was said, I think, in relation to people criticising the fostering of Irish in the country.  I do not think that you will hear the end of the talk about compulsory Irish in relation to the fostering of Irish until you put the facts of the situation broadly and openly before our people.  There are two things that can be done with Irish&mdash;Irish taught as an obligatory subject in the schools and Irish used as a medium of instruction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> Whatever doubts any Deputy may have with regard to the use of Irish as the language of communication or of instruction in the schools, I think it is definitely accepted that the national language will be an obligatory subject in all schools.  I have heard no dissenting voice from any part of the House with regard to that.  Where a conflict occurs is as to the use of Irish as a medium of instruction. Deputies have spoken about the teaching of infants through a language which they do not understand.  The modern theory apparently is that in the infants' schools the children are not taught at all; there is no question of teaching them reading or writing. There is a question of teaching them speech and habits of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In order to clear the situation for myself and everybody else, I have asked two primary inspectors, together with an inspector of the secondary schools and an inspector of the technical schools to report under certain headings to me after an examination of a fairly wide sample of primary schools.  I have asked them to report what is happening in the primary schools in all the classes from the infants up in regard to the use of Irish as the language of communication.  I was quite clear that the inspectors who had been in touch with this work could tell me what the situation was in relation to the actual facts as well as in relation to the instruction and the regulations that were in force.  But I said that I did not want that.  I wanted them to go to the schools for a month and stand in the schools where the work was being done and have consultations and discussions with the teachers.  They could in that way refresh their minds, observe what was being done there and report on the facts.</P>
    <P>In associating a secondary inspector with them and an inspector from the technical schools, I did that in order to broaden the outlook of those who were accustomed to the insides of the primary schools.  At times I have suggested that there ought to be a focal point <Col N="2240" /> from the primary to the secondary schools and on to the universities; that there ought to be a review of what had resulted from the teaching of Irish in the primary and secondary schools.  I felt that by combining the secondary and technical inspectors with the primary inspectors we would get a broader and more balanced view of things.  In an inspection carried out over a month, 14 counties and two cities have been visited.  Schools that are excellent schools, together with poor and middling schools have been examined.  The examination will be concluded at the end of this month.  I hope then to be able to give information to the House about the situation in the schools as a result of that inspection and what modifications or changes I propose to bring about in schools for the year that will begin after the holidays. It might be thought that it might be proper to leave to the council of education matters of this kind, but I regard the particular work of the council of education in its initial stages as being a broader and a higher one than a mere examination of what is the position of Irish in the schools and of what should be done in regard to it. I hope as a result of this examination to clear the minds of many people, both in this House and in the country. Some doubts have been raised in their minds as to whether the work in the schools has been done right or done wrong; whether the children are being injured in any way or not.  I think that a type of examination of this kind will give us a picture of the situation in a more precise and competent way than would a committee set up of people who were interested in Irish.</P>
    <P>We can look at the situation in a detached and technical way and we will then give to the people who are interested in it a clear base line, a clear state of affairs to criticise and to suggest changes in.  I feel, whether people will be satisfied or dissatisfied after that, that the present situation is too nebulous to ask anyone to examine it or express opinions upon it. Whatever steps we will take as a result of this review, it will clear the situation and provide a situation more prepared for criticism and examination of a constructive and effective kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> There has been a considerable amount of discussion about the new spelling; I think that nothing could be simpler than getting a satisfactory way to criticism the new spelling.  A book has been published by the Stationery Office following an examination and a decision by a committee of the translation staff here specially set up to do it.  The rules that have been adopted are clearly set out and words, or at any rate sample words, showing any changes in the spelling that have been made are given in the small vocabulary covering about 50 octavo pages of this book.  I have had discussions with people who disagreed with this new spelling.  I have met representatives of Comhaltas Uladh who have discussed the particular position of the Donegal and Six-County areas and I must say that I have found it very easy to discuss the matter with them. They were people who understood the difficulty, who were constructive in their approach and who were clear in their objections, but I think that I satisfied them that the progressive and systematic way to face the problem that is there&mdash;and there is a problem&mdash; is to take the proposals that have been set out now and to watch them systematically for the next year or two.  I have indicated, and the House is aware, that at the time I took over the Department of Education, arrangements had been made with publishers throughout the country to have books printed in the new spelling for the first and second classes of primary schools, to be brought into operation this year at the beginning of June and progressively from next year two more classes would be brought into the scheme and so on as the years went on.  There could be nothing but confusion if I did not let that system go ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the spelling should be adopted to the extent to which it was adopted and that the plans made to prepare books for Class I and Class II should be gone ahead with this year and for Class III and Class IV in the following years. We will watch carefully and I am open to suggestions and discussions with anybody concerned with the writing of Irish as to any of the spelling there <Col N="2242" /> that should be changed or any of the rules that should be changed.  We will see these readers in operation in the early classes of primary schools within the next year or two.  We are dealing with a living language and none of the people who spoke here to-day were troubled in any way as to how to spell it.  We are dealing with a living spoken language; we are taking children in the infant classes where Irish, to whatever extent it is taught, is taught nothing of reading and writing and the books which they get into their hands will be books, a substantial part of which will be in the spelling agreed upon by everybody.  I saw about 18 months ago a note from the International Labour Organisation regarding some publication of theirs dealing with maritime matters which had been published in two editions, one in English and one in American.  I do not know if anyone in Ireland would have difficulty reading the American edition.  Someone said here to-day dealing with our very difficult spelling &mdash;I think it was Deputy Cowan&mdash;that when you look at a word you would have to pronounce it to know what it meant.  When you are dealing with a living language it is the living language that sounds in your mind as you read.  Those of us who read Irish are not troubled by the spelling of Northern Irish, Connaught Irish or Munster Irish, because the eye travels along the line looking at the page, at the whole landscape, rather than at the individual letters.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything at all in the suggestion that has been made so dolefully by one or two people here to-day that any change in the spelling of Irish is going to kill the language.  It might kill some of us older people if we had to learn the new spelling, and guard against the slips in spelling that we might make.  It is very difficult to get any person to change his style of writing.  We would have difficulties about it, but the same difficulties do not apply at the point at which this new scheme is being applied.  I have seen letters in some of the evening papers and other papers about the new spelling and they were <Col N="2243" /> certainly written by people who never heard Irish pronounced in their lives. Do not let us make difficulties for ourselves and excite the minds of people who do not know anything about it by talking about our fears on the matter. The question I put is, if there is anything in this book you object to, where is the word in these 50 pages which you object to and how do you think it should be spelled or where is the rule which you object to?  I do not think that it is necessary to mobilise the Irish scholars or anybody else to examine what is wrong in this book that should be corrected.  I believe that a couple of years will do it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Breathnach said when he stated that he wants to have preamh an fhocail kept safely. These are matters which intelligent discussion and careful discussion can put right in time.</P>

A situation has been created.  I am not complaining about the people who created the situation. I am not disparaging the work that has been done by the translation staff on this booklet.  They were asked by the Government to do a particular thing and they did it.  It was done without reference to the Department of Education.  That is just a fact that I mentioned.  It is there, and it was done at any rate with a good intention. It was done by the translation staff with goodwill and with a very considerable amount of experience. It was not done in the way that I should like it to be done.  There are things which, I suggest, ought to be changed here, but I do not want to butt in and say: &ldquo;We are not going to change that right away.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with becoming a research student in this matter.  I am simply concerned with the fact that we have this booklet, that arrangements have been made with publishers to produce certain books which are to be used in standards 1 and 2.  As to research in this matter, we had people talking about the 17th, 18th and 19th century to-day, and I mentioned myself about Father O'Leary telling us all about it in 1910 or 1911, when he explained that when he started to write he felt that with the old spelling, with its adh, agh, <Col N="2245" /> etc., the Irish language was struggling under a spelling at that particular time like David under Saul's armour and how he settled it.  Father O'Leary said he would have to &ldquo;tosnú ar an gceann agus ar an earball a bhaint díobh agus ar an mbolg a ghearra astu.&rdquo;  That was in 1911 and the process has been going on since.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne mentioned many from Osborne Bergin down to Seán O Cuiv, whose work was very well known to any person acquainted with the modern Irish language.  We all saw them at their work.  We all knew there was a problem and the thing is not to make our problem any bigger than it is.  The problem has been reduced to rather simple proportions from one point of view by what has been done.  We have been given 50 pages of words which have been spelt.  Let us see who knows a better way in which they could be spelt.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I have done this. In addition to its having been arranged that the books for standards 1 and 2 should be printed and circulated for the years 1948-49, it was also decided that the books for standards 1 and 2 programme for the years 1950-51 would be printed also in the new spelling. That would involve that, either at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year, certain texts would be put into circulation by the printer.  I have thought it better to postpone that, so that the texts for the intermediate certificate for 1950-51 will be in the normal spelling that has existed up to the present, because I thought that it would be desirable before the printing of the more advanced texts would be undertaken in the new spelling that we should give the next year or two years, with the assistance of what is happening in the primary schools, to critics and to people of all kinds to see what kind of changes should be brought about in the present proposals before the scheme is carried so far as the printing of the more advanced texts. That is a matter which I hope we shall come back to at some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Breathnach and other Deputies made reference to the size of classes and to the difficulty that I felt long ago in talking about these matters here.  I entirely agree and I am still <Col N="2246" /> concerned with the size of classes, particularly in the larger centres of population. Complaint was made that in the larger schools some of the principal teachers have to spend a lot of their time teaching.  One of the things I have done is to make arrangements in the cities under which additional viceprincipals can be appointed.  Therefore, that situation will be eased and it may help the teaching position.  I quite agree that in some schools in the City of Dublin there are classes, not only of 50 or 60, but of 70, 80 and 90. I fully appreciate the difficulty under which the teachers labour and that when they make comparisons with other places it must be a source of irritation to them when they consider their own position.</P>
    <P>I referred previously in this House to the report of the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland where, in paragraph 76, they say emphatically that no more than 30 pupils should be allocated to each teacher.  &ldquo;There are, moreover, certain special cases where the number should be less than 30.  In a one-teacher school covering the agerange five to 12, the maximum should be 25, and in classes for backward or retarded children the maximum should be 20.&rdquo;  The matter was discussed at a congress in Great Britain recently. Arising out of the discussion there, not an educational paper, but <i>The Economist,</i> discussed the matter, pointing out that the importance of small classes is so great that people in Great Britain will send their children to school and pay for them to go to certain schools rather than send them to free schools where the classes are larger.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those parents, who would be ready in the interests of social equality and in the face of crippling income-tax to support their local schools may well give up the attempt when they find a classroom filled to capacity by 40 youngsters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the people in Great Britain are going to hold up their hands in horror and pay for the education of their children rather than send them to schools where it is free simply because there are 40 pupils in the class, I do not know what they would say about the conditions <Col N="2247" /> so far as children in Dublin are concerned. This economic paper emphasises this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The official view, which is surely wrong, appears to be that small children can be taught in hordes, but that older children need more individual attention.  The experience of private schools, where expense matters less, is all the other way: the bottom forms are almost always small.  Only when teaching becomes more complicated and the claims of examination and of real scholarship demand it, is there again an acute need for smaller classes.  If, because of its cost, or because of the shortage of teachers, some classes must have over 30 pupils, surely the bulge should be at the gregarious period of a child's development, leaving the first stages and the last to be dealt with in smaller groups?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think if anything characterises the position in our schools in the cities it is that the young people are taught in hordes.  The really big classes are among the infants.  The fact that there is a second language to be dealt with here emphasises the fact very much that a review of that position requires to be made.  I hope to do it at the earliest possible moment.  It may mean additional teachers and additional school rooms, but these things will have to be faced if we are not going to have a very serious weakness at the foundation of our education.  I feel that if the conditions under which primary education is given are not conditions that inculcate a sense of dignity and of order in the pupils, then we are launching them into the higher classes lacking something which can most effectively and usefully be taught in the lower classes.  Unless discipline and order are inculcated at the earliest stages in the primary school, you are not going to have it in the school at all.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Hickey, I think, who charged our educational system with being a class system, that is that the poor man's child did not get a fair do. I think that is hardly fair.  It may be difficult for the children in the rural areas to get the advantage of a secondary school education by reason of the <Col N="2248" /> fact that, even if they are able to get scholarships, they may find it difficult to take advantage of them.  There are, in every part of the country, scholarships from the primary to the secondary school for children who can, through examination, show that they have a certain amount of talent.  In every county we have county council scholarships from the secondary schools to the universities.  It is a matter for public opinion and public understanding to see that these channels are widened if it is necessary to widen them.  I doubt, however, if there is any real talent in the country that does not find its way along a fairly open path.  There is sufficient organisation on the teaching side and on the side of local bodies to see that that path is widened and that talent is helped along.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that one of the really serious complaints with regard to the educational system here is that so many mediocre people find their way into the universities.  However, that is a matter that it is well to have mentioned.  I am glad to have it mentioned but I think it is unfair both to our people as a whole and to the educational system as it exists at present to say that it is a class system.  I do not think it is at all. I am particularly surprised at the suggestion coming from Cork, because I know of no place where the educational path is more open.  The people there have excellent primary and secondary schools, and the university is at their door.  As I say, I know of no place where the educational path is more open to the talented poor child than it is in Cork City.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made as to what might be done with regard to extending the school age, improving the curriculum at the end of the primary school course and making it more in keeping with the wants of our country.  It has been suggested that too many people find themselves in whitecollar avocations&mdash;that they would be better off and happier and our country more normal and prosperous if they found their way into trades or other avocations than office ones.  I said when introducing the Estimate that a <Col N="2249" /> considerable amount of consideration had been given to that matter and that the Committee on Juvenile Employment, which is sitting at the present time under the chairmanship of his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, had indicated in an interim report that they were going to recommend an extension of the school-leaving age, and that that would involve a report upon what the curriculum ought to be.  I mentioned that a Departmental review of the situation generally with a view to seeing how the educational system can or should be developed here indicated that it was quite possible that arrangements would have to be made to branch off children at the age, say, of 12½ years, some into the secondary side&mdash;those who were more academically-minded&mdash;and others, less academically-minded, to be branched into schools where they could get, as well as a general education, a technical education of one kind or another. These are problems that will have to be dealt with straight away.  They cannot be effectively considered until we get the report of the Commission on Juvenile Employment, and I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to say before very long that he has got it.</P>
    <P>There are many kinds of problems awaiting decision and, considering the atmosphere in which this debate has been carried on, I have no doubt that with the goodwill to the general problem that has been shown and the readiness to face up to various aspects of that problem, we shall improve the situation of education in the country generally and make both the objectives, the spirit and the methods that have been employed, more generally known to the people of the country as a whole so that they will have full confidence in the system and, by understanding all the details, may be able to help more than they are at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he intends to make that branching off at 12½, irrespective of the standard of efficiency which the child has reached at that age?  At 12½, a child may have only reached 4th standard efficiency.  Is it contemplated that the <Col N="2250" /> branching off should take place at 12½ irrespective of the standard of efficiency attained?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only an amateur in these matters but even as an amateur I would endeavour to see that a child was not regarded as having passed the primary education standard until he had attained a certain amount of knowledge.  Twelve or 12½ years of age is regarded as the normal age at which the foundations of education that are regarded as primary education should be completed but I think anybody would understand that there would be backward children who might have to remain in the primary atmosphere until they were 13, 13½ or 14 years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which the Deputy has made brings me to the question of the backward child.  I think Deputy Dr. Brennan had intended to say something in regard to this matter.  It is a question which has had some consideration from us already.  I think some Deputy spoke about certain classes being divided up into bright children and dull children and about one particular teacher being kept in charge of the bright children and another in charge of the dull children.  He wanted a change about so that the teachers would have a varied experience of all types of classes and so that the dull children might have the benefit for a period of the teacher who had been teaching the bright children.  I do not think the problem is as simple as that.  There are children who are definitely backward without being of the kind who should be treated in a separate institution. My own instinct is that where backward children have to go to a day school, they should not be separated from the ordinary children they would have to meet during play hours or at home, that they should be kept as closely in touch with normal children as possible but that there are schools where separate classes should be arranged for children that are subnormal. There may be schools where something is systematically done in <Col N="2251" /> that way but I do not think the problem has been faced as a definite problem yet and I feel it should be so faced.  There are certain institutions where subnormal children are kept who are resident in the institution but there must be quite a large number of subnormal children scattered throughout the ordinary schools, children who could be very much improved and made useful citizens if they were specially regarded as subnormal and dealt with in special classes, although as special classes in the middle of one of our ordinary large schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, a number of Deputies dealt with certain aspects of the encouragement of Irish.  I was asked by Deputy Ó Briain what was going to be done with regard to <i>An Gúm.</i>  We are all concerned with the encouragement of Irish writers and the publication of attractive and useful reading matter, without which interest in the reading of Irish cannot be maintained after the school years have been finished.  I have not been sufficiently long connected with the Department to have reviewed these matters, but it is my intention to review the whole question at the earliest possible moment in regard to the expenditure on Irish, to see that it is used to the best possible purpose and that the expenditure is concentrated on focal points from which we may expect the greatest possible developments.  There may be in some Deputies' minds certain questions in regard to that expenditure or any aspect of that work which they would like to have discussed.  There has been no reference to it in this discussion except the question in regard to <i>An Gúm,</i> but if there are any questions which Deputies would like to put, they might put them in the form of an ordinary Parliamentary question.  I may or may not be in a position to answer them, viewing the position as a whole, but I shall be very glad to give any information I can with regard to our attitude to these organisations and societies.  As I indicated in my opening statement, I have not yet walked the farm as a whole but if there are particular matters in which Deputies are interested, if they would put down questions or would come to see me personally <Col N="2252" /> I should be very glad to give them any information I can.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given no explanation or no justification for the economies announced by the Minister for Finance in the Vote for the Department of Education, including the very substantial economy of £25,000 in the provision for the cleaning of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as economies are concerned, in view of the amount of money that is called for from the taxpayer, I want to try to economise in any possible way I can during the year without inflicting any hardship on the people who by their services and their work, are upholding the general scheme of education in the country.  When we consider the bill which has to be met this year, I do not think it too unreasonable to allow the cleaning of schools to remain in the same position that it had been in all through the past.  We provided the same amount for the cleaning and upkeep of schools this year as had been provided for the last ten or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>

I do not know for how many years the amount spent on the cleaning of schools stood at the figure at which it stood last year but we are going to spend in this year as much money on the cleaning of schools as was spent last year.  Deputy Derrig was, as Minister, preparing a considerable increase in that expenditure but when we had to look around to see where we could trim our sails a bit in order to bring down the very considerable bill which the Minister for Finance had to handle, I did not think it unreasonable when he said to me: &ldquo;If you clean the schools as well this year as you cleaned <Col N="2253" /> them last year, will that not be good enough?&rdquo;  I had to say to him that I entirely agreed.  We shall be doing fairly well if we are able to clean the schools as well this year as last year.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I asked a question with regard to the extension of the school meals scheme.  That does not come within the Minister's ambit in this Estimate, but I would like to stress the point.  Some years ago certain schools were scheduled as being in Gaeltacht districts and as being entitled to benefit under the school meals scheme.  In certain areas in County Kerry, South Kerry particularly, there is the anomaly of a school benefiting under this scheme while a school in the next parish in a similar poor and congested district is not entitled to avail of the scheme.  I would like if the Minister would consider that matter and have an all-round extension of the school meals scheme to all districts, whether they are Gaeltacht or nonGaeltacht districts.  The children attending schools in congested districts are entitled to all the benefits that can be provided for them and I think this scheme should be examined fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Health.  In so far as it might be considered a matter affecting the Gaeltacht, I have indicated that I propose to set up a separate inspectorate for the Gaeltacht. If I find in the review of the situation that would be thus brought about that there are schools in the Gaeltacht area that are not included in the Gaeltacht school meals scheme at present, I will see that the Gaeltacht scheme is extended to them.  But, if it is a question simply of schools in poor districts, I would ask the Deputy to raise that matter with the Minister for Health whose Vote carries the school meals Vote, whether it is for the Gaeltacht or any other area.</P>

      <P>The whole question of vocational schools has been under review.  I have been asked in one case to give permission for the sale of one of these vocational schools that was built and is no longer used. There are a number of areas where there are vocational schools in which the classes are very small compared with the number of teachers.  There are certain areas, at any rate, where it is suggested that there has been a development of vocational schools at a greater rate than the requirements would warrant.  One of the ways in which we thought there might be less spending than was contemplated in the Estimates as prepared is in the building of technical schools.  There will be a saving in that way but I will undertake very carefully to review every case of a technical school building which is required and to see that there is no development held up in any area of a kind that would help the people to improve their local economy and to get the training necessary to help them to do the local work in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that particular matter there are a number of areas where there has been a very useful extension of vocational and technical training, that is, in small rural areas where itinerant teachers have attended.  In some of these areas there has been a desire to build, say, one-room schools where an itinerant teacher can give instruction in woodwork, metalwork, cookery, dressmaking, or anything like that. There are a number of these places where they are waiting for materials to get ahead with the building where the woodwork for the doors, windows and floors has all been done locally by the students who have been holding classes in barns or other temporary buildings <Col N="2255" /> nearby.  I will do everything possible to stimulate and encourage people who are developing in that particular kind of way.  But where it comes to a question of bigger and larger schools, where the cost is high and the material difficult to obtain, there may be a delay this year.  I will undertake to discuss each of these cases on the merits and to see that, where there is real initiative, real progress and the possibility of development and a close knitting of the proposed educational establishment with the local life, nothing will be allowed to delay or impede a development of that kind.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £765,609 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which <Col N="2258" /> will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; and No. 12 of 1946).</P>
    <P>Contrary to the opinion of many the work of the Department of Lands in this country is of the utmost importance. The Irish Land Commission of to-day is the successor of the Congested Districts Board, the Irish Land Commission and the Estates Commissioners which were established under British occupation in this country to deal with the question of congestion and the granting of ownership of the farm to the farmer.  Since our own Government was set up here that work has gone on sometimes slowly, sometimes accelerated but, nevertheless, aiming at one goal.  That goal was, and is to-day, the relieving of congestion, the raising of uneconomic holdings to economic standard, and the placing of as many people as economically possible on the land and making each man complete owner of his own holding.</P>
    <P>Despite the activity of my Department for the last 26 years there still remains an evil in our midst which has to be eradicated.  I am referring to the congested areas, that lie particularly along the western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry.  That does not say that pockets of congestion do not exist in a great many inland and eastern counties besides.  I want to bring to the notice of the House that it is the policy of the present Government to place in first priority the ending of congestion and the raising of uneconomic holdings to economic level.</P>
    <P>When I took office on the 18th February last, I found that owing to a &ldquo;close-down Order&rdquo; on the acquisition of land in the midland and eastern areas where the Land Commission <Col N="2259" /> must look to form a reservoir of land out of which they can come to the relief of the classes I have mentioned, there was no land on hands.  Since this restriction Order was imposed the amount of land then on hands gradually disappeared in the form of migrants' holdings, allotments, etc., and to-day there is none on hands worth mentioning.  Shortly after I took office, with the permission of the Government, I removed these restrictions and my Department is now forging ahead with the work of acquiring land for our statutory purposes.  The problem of acquiring land is slow.  Each particular case, whether acquisition or resumption, must be examined carefully by the commissioners and before a decision is reached they must be thoroughly satisfied that no injustice is being done to the person from whom the land is being acquired or resumed or that the Constitution is being violated.</P>
    <P>Once land is acquired it is not always an easy matter to prepare a suitable scheme of either giving the land to allottees in the form of additions to their present holdings or blocking out a farm into complete holdings equipped with fences, gates, dwelling-houses and out-offices, suitable for a migrant. Building materials are still in short supply but I am looking to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to my assistance in this matter.</P>
    <P>Now, I will turn to another aspect of our duty&mdash;the user of land allotted as new holdings or additions to existing holdings.  As I pointed out to Deputy Ormonde in reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 25th instant, those who have been allotted holdings by the Land Commission and who have not used them according to the terms of their agreement will receive short shrift at my hands.  In the congested areas there are thousands of small farmers trying to eke out an existence on perhaps three or four acres of wretched land, sometimes reclaimed from the moor, who would gladly use such lands if they were given a chance to do so.  I have the greatest contempt for the spirit of the person who was allotted a holding of land fully <Col N="2260" /> equipped with nice dwelling-house and out-office, fences, etc., and who did not think it worth his while to work the land as he was expected to do because he gave his signature to do that when signing the agreement with the Land Commission.  I might say here at this stage that it has never come to my notice that a small farmer who surrendered a holding in a congested area and who was granted a migrant's holding has ever used his land badly.  This is a pointer to the commissioners as to where they should seek for the best type of person to whom a holding should be allotted.</P>
    <P>Now I do not want my attitude towards the above type to be confused with my attitude towards a different problem of user of land&mdash;that is, the person who got an addition to his existing small holding.  In such a case I hold that it is the holding that got the addition rather than the farmer and, for that reason, should not be separated from it, and while it is deplorable that additions should not be worked according to the terms of the agreement I realise fully that in many cases those who have been granted additions through some unforeseen circumstances may have to sublet the additions.  It is the aim of the Land Commission to raise uneconmic holdings to an economic standard by way of additions and it is quite obvious that the taking back of that addition creates two problems at once.  The first is, who is to get the addition, and, secondly, a new uneconomic holding has been created thereby.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are, I presume, anxiously awaiting a statement on policy from me.  It might be summed up in a few words&mdash;that congestion is an evil which we must at all costs try to eliminate and to which I intend to devote all my energy during my term of office.  Side by side with that&mdash;the twin brother of congestion&mdash;is the question of the small uneconomic holdings. These two questions go hand-in-hand and will receive first priority in the future.  Some people regard the Land Commission as an all-devouring monster going around seeking farms they can devour.</P>
    <P>Such is not the case.  I know quite well that almost all farmers do not like <Col N="2261" /> to give up their land but, at the same time, we do not acquire without giving compensation according to the law laid down here in this House.  In order to relieve congestion we must acquire land somewhere and, naturally, we have to look to the big farms to do so. We will also acquire or resume small holdings if they become non-residential in areas where the general run of holdings is small and needs enlarging.  It is not the intention to resume or acquire holdings that may be non-residential at the moment through the owner having to seek employment elsewhere temporarily because of the poverty imposed on him by the smallness of such holding.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate itself, the provision for travelling expenses is increased by £1,000 in view of increases in bus and rail fares and in the rates of subsistence and mileage allowances and also in anticipation of the filling, during the year, of some of the vacancies on the inspectorate and survey staffs.</P>
    <P>Last year's Estimate under sub-head I proved to be in excess of requirements. It is difficult at the best of times to forecast what the Land Commission may be in a position to spend on estate improvement works in the year ahead.  In present conditions, with building activities still restricted by the shortage and increased cost of materials, it is particularly hard to say in advance what the requirements will be under this head.  The reopening of land acquisition activities within the congested districts counties will, from now onwards, be reflected both in the amounts required for the purchase of tenants' interests in holdings resumed by the Land Commission on Congested Districts Board estates and in the expenditure on estate improvements.  It is to be expected that last year's expenditure, which amounted to £222,871, will be exceeded during the coming 12 months.  The Estimate is, therefore, repeated at last year's figure of £254,800.</P>
    <P>Such changes as appear on the remaining sub-heads hardly call for particular comment.  The most noticeable is that under sub-head N, in which there is a reduction of £3,250 in the <Col N="2262" /> amount sought for advances to provide funds for the maintenance of embankments. Requirements under this sub-head are liable to vary from year to year, and the sharp decrease this year is explained by the fact that exceptional provision was included last year for particular works then under consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general work of the Land Commission during the past year, there are very creditable achievements to report in the important fields of post-division and tenanted-land work.  The Land Commission have been concentrating their efforts on the accumulation of arrears arising out of the uncompleted division work of past years, and on the tenanted land estates.  Last year's work has achieved a record output of 16,354 holdings and allotments revested in the tenants and allottees compared with the output of 10,192 vestings during the previous year.  This represents satisfactory progress, but it still leaves arrears of some 58,000 holdings of tenanted land awaiting revesting in the tenants as well as some 37,000 parcels of untenanted land yet to be vested in the allottees. The clearing off of these arrears constitutes an essential task for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the unvested parcels of untenanted land, the allottees who have made good, and have faithfully observed the conditions of their agreements, are entitled to be finally established on their parcels within a reasonable time and these cases should be cleared out of the way before the resumption of land division operations adds too heavily to their number.</P>
    <P>Of the unvested tenanted-land holdings a very big proportion, including some 15,000 holdings on estates of the former Congested Districts Board, will require enlargement, rearrangement or improvement in some way such as housing, drainage, fencing and road accommodation.  While these holdings and parcels remain on hands they involve the Land Commission in problems and responsibilities and draw upon the Department a mass of correspondence which has the effect of seriously retarding productive effort. The situation can be relieved only by <Col N="2263" /> final vesting and it is my intention to see that the vesting drive is vigorously pursued so as to secure that the pressing burden of arrears is substantially reduced in as short a time as possible.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the congested areas, and particularly on the old unsold estates of the Congested Districts Board to which I have already referred, set the Land Commission its most important task in the sphere of land settlement.  My personal knowledge of the appalling conditions still prevalent in many parts of the West leaves me in no doubt as to the shape which our future land settlement programme should assume.  It must have for its primary object the relief of congestion wherever it exists, but chiefly in those districts in the West where the necessity is the greatest.  This work for the relief of congestion has, in the past, suffered too many delays and interruptions. It depends, of course, on the acquisition of suitable land in sufficient quantities as well as on an adequate supply of building materials, and the most recent hold-up of the war years has led to a progressive decline in the acreages acquired and divided each year.  The year just closed has resulted in the division of some 13,500 acres. The area acquired during the year was 9,741 acres.</P>
    <P>Investigations should, from now onwards, begin to show a return in the shape of completed acquisitions of land in the congested districts counties, particularly as a legal difficulty which existed for some time in relation to the resumption of land by the Land Commission has been removed.  But the lands available in the congested districts themselves are quite insufficient for the needs of the situation.  If a serious contribution is to be made to a solution of the problem, such lands as can be acquired outside the congested areas will have to be utilised to the maximum extent for the accommodation of migrants.  The position arising from the continued hold-up of land acquisition outside the scheduled congested districts has been under consideration by the Government and they are satisfied that the extent and urgency of the congestion problem <Col N="2264" /> demand that there should be a further relaxation of restrictions.  It has been decided that the Land Commission shall from now on be free to proceed with the acquisition of land which can be used entirely or almost entirely for the relief of congestion by migration or for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that lands are going to become available for division immediately.  Land acquisition cannot be made a rapid process.  The Government's decision, however, does mean that the way will be cleared for further progress to land settlement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the assistance and cordial co-operation of all Deputies, no matter to what Party they belong, and I am particularly addressing this to the Opposition, as my work can be severely hampered by Deputies who may wish to score over their colleagues in their constituencies.  As I have already said, my Department has a big job of work in front of it and it is only by the greatest co-operation from all Deputies that we will succeed in eliminating the evil of congestion and small uneconomic holdings which has been handed down to us as a loathsome legacy from the dark days of our history and to remedy which some of our bravest men in the past, foremost amongst them Michael Davitt, of my own county, have given their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in the concluding remarks of the Minister for Lands when he sought the co-operation of all Parties in helping him to solve this problem.  It just reminded me of the old proverb that often the best advice came from the greatest offender.  I have not got up here to waste the time of the House or of the Minister reminding him of the statements he made as a member of the Opposition, criticising his predecessors and the Land Commission in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear him stating that the relief of congestion is his primary objective and the main plank in his policy.  It would be strange, of course, if it were otherwise in view of the fact, about which I am sure everyone is satisfied, that the primary aim of all Land Acts from 1903 to 1939 was to relieve congestion.  A great deal of good and useful work was done in that <Col N="2265" /> connection, but a great deal yet remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I stated here last year and in previous years that while congestion may be relieved to a considerable extent, so far as the problem in the West of Ireland is concerned it is never going to be solved by land division alone.  It would be quite impossible to do so.  I do not intend to remind the Minister of any of his statements in the past and anything I have to say on this Vote will be as helpful as I can make it.</P>
    <P>I am very interested, and have always been, in land acquisition and division.  Like the Minister for Lands and numerous others in the West of Ireland, I live amongst people who were crushed by landlordism and whose economic conditions, previous to the Land Acts and subsequent to them until relief was brought were, to describe it mildly, nothing short of shocking and intolerable.  I remember when unfortunate people living on four or five acres of land had to work all the year round for the local landlord before they would get their wages, which were very small indeed&mdash;7/- or 8/- a week, and not for a 48-hour week either but in most cases for a 60-hour week&mdash;their rent was deducted and their wages not paid until it was deducted. Considerable relief was given in that way by the old Congested Districts Board, which did great work. When this State was established, the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners, as they were then called, were merged into one body known as the Land Commission.  I always considered that that was a mistake and that the Congested Districts Board should have been left to deal with the congestion problem, to take all matters regarding congestion into consideration and to be given a free hand to relieve it by means other than land division.  I would like the present Minister to consider the establishment of some body on similar lines, even within the Land Commission; to have a certain number of the Land Commission personnel who understand the problem; a certain number of officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and of the Department of Fisheries, to come together and try to <Col N="2266" /> hammer out what would prove to be the real solution of the congestion problem in the West of Ireland, because unless industries are established in the towns in close proximity to where the congestion is nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>The very fact of removing what to my mind would be only a handful of the congests to the Midlands and the East would not at all solve the problem.  It would still be fairly acute.  Unless something is done about the decentralisation of industry, no matter what decision the Minister and his Department make, I feel that in 25 years from now or perhaps less there will be a much greater flight from the land than there has been during any previous period, by reason of the fact that the generation growing up now is looking forward, and rightly so, to much better conditions.  When you take out a number of people and set about rearranging the holdings, the most anyone could do for the people left behind is to give them holdings of about 15 acres or at most 20 acres of land that could not be regarded as of being superior quality. I do not believe that they will be content to remain on holdings of that kind unless they have quite near them some industry that will absorb a great many members of the family.  You want to have both the land and industries to maintain the standard of living which they would like to have, as otherwise believe they should have, as otherwise they would seek it in other parts of the country and in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not very long in office but I am sure that he is sufficiently long there to have ascertained from his Department what is the approximate area of land available for acquisition in the whole Twenty-Six Counties for the relief of congestion.  It may be a difficult question for him to answer, but certainly a Department that is established for 45 years should be able, I think, to give him that information.  I am sure that they can get him information as to the number of congests and I would like to know what is the definition of a congest.  In certain parts of the West a congest is defined as a person whose valuation is under £10 while in other parts of the West a congest is defined as a person with under £15 <Col N="2267" /> valuation.  The Minister is nodding his head; perhaps he is disagreeing with what I am saying, but that is my belief and understanding of it.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of the West of Ireland, if an estate becomes available, any person who has a valuation of over £10 is not considered.  In the eastern portion of Galway the standard is raised to £15 and I believe that the same thing applies to Meath, Westmeath and the Midlands.  I do not think that there should be such discrimination at all.  I know very well the difficulty there is when an estate is acquired where congestion is.  The duty of the inspector preparing the scheme is to take all the tenants for about a mile radius and to try to bring them to the same standard of valuation.  Often he has to keep below £10 valuation and often £5 valuation.  I think that it should be the same for the entire country. There should be no £10 level for one part of Ireland and £15 or £20 for another.  I think that they should all be taken on the same plane because, after all, in many instances the valuation is not the real criterion of an economic or an uneconomic holding.  In parts of my county&mdash;and I am sure that the same is true in the Minister's own County of Mayo&mdash;land is very highly valued, as highly as £2 an acre, but a very small part of the holdings could be regarded as economic.  This is in spite of the fact, strange as it may seem, that it is impossible to plough this land even with a steam engine as it is rock almost to the very surface.  In other parts of the country there are very small valuations for very fine land. Perhaps it was because that land was reclaimed and its condition when it was being valued 100 years ago was very poor and that by work and reclamation it has been brought up to its present standard.  Consequently, I think that the inspectors should not take valuations at all times as being the true indication of an economic or an uneconomic holding.  Instead of taking the figures before him it would not be too much to ask him to inspect the holding; it is very seldom that they do that.</P>
    <P>I was asking the Minister if he had information as to the amount of land available for acquisition and also the <Col N="2268" /> number of congests.  If he has, has there been any period of time estimated for the acquisition and division of land?  I have heard Ministers of previous Governments giving a certain period within which the job would be completed.  But, having proceeded to do the work, they found it was not possible to do it in the prescribed limit of time.  The amount of land available for acquisition now is very considerably contracted.  Therefore it should be somewhat simpler to estimate the period of time.  I have heard it stated, not authoritatively, that the Land Commission think that land division could not be completed inside the next 50 years.  I hope the Minister anyhow will gather his officials round the conference table and see that that is accelerated anyhow, because the sooner we have this problem settled finally the better.</P>
    <P>When times are normal, I cannot understand why it should take any longer than at most ten years to solve the problem.  When I say ten years, I think I am not setting any impossible task before the present Minister or any other Minister.  We are 43 years at it now.  Undoubtedly a lot of fine work has been done but for what remains I think ten years should be the longest period and that it should be completed within that time.  I think the Minister should set a target for his Department as to the number of acres to be acquired and distributed each year.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear the Minister state that it is proposed to continue the migration scheme from the congested areas to areas where land is available.  I expect that he will continue it on similar lines, if not on improved lines, to those initiated by Fianna Fáil.  I expect that it is proposed to continue the assistance to migrants by way of grants for cropping, stocking and equipping their holdings. I hope there will not be any economy practised in that connection.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ascertain from the Minister what is to be the policy of the Land Commission in regard to employees on estates that will be acquired. Will the Minister continue the same policy&mdash;that they should get first preference in regard to holdings? <Col N="2269" /> There is a difference of opinion as to whether or not that should be the case. I hold that people who have been in permanent employment on estates over a considerable number of years are entitled to first preference because they are being deprived of their livelihood. It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Why not give them some cash compensation?&rdquo; I think the easiest way to compensate them is to give them a holding of land. If, at a later stage, they feel that they are incapable of working it, unlike in other cases, there should be no restriction placed on their selling the holding to some other person approved of by the Land Commission.  In the case of people who fail to make good, I think that would be the easiest and the best form of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should there be a line of demarcation drawn between a person like that who gets a holding on an estate and a migrant, let us say, who gets a holding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many instances, the migrant who gets a holding is a person who has been accustomed to the working of land.  He need not migrate if he does not wish.  He will not be forced to do it.  The allottee has no option or alternative.  That is what I am advancing as a reason and I think the Minister will see the justification of it &mdash;that they are not in the same category; that they are on quite a different basis altogether.  I heard the previous Minister say that in many instances these people were failures.  Admittedly, a number of them were.  I have known some employees myself who were failures when they were given a holding.  But, of course, they had no capital going into the holding and that was their great difficulty.  They were kept on there and were not permitted to sell the holding and the holding continued in a half-worked or half-derelict condition.  I expect that was one of the reasons for the passing of the 1946 <Col N="2270" /> Land Act.  If they were permitted to sell their holdings to people approved of by the Land Commission, I expect it would have helped to solve that problem much more easily and effectively.</P>
      <P>A good deal of discussion has taken place here from time to time about the size of holdings.  It was argued, I think quite rightly, that a number of the holdings allotted were too small. In my opinion, a holding of 22 or 23 statute acres is insufficient for any person to make a living on it.  Of course, a good deal depends on the locality.  A holding of 23 statute acres convenient to a good market town, if it were properly worked as a kind of market garden, would perhaps be fairly economic. But, when you go out three, four or five miles into the country, a 23 statute acre holding leaves a person in the position that he is neither a labourer nor a farmer.  I believe that a holding of anything less than 40 statute acres is not capable of giving a fairly decent livelihood to the occupier, no matter how intensively he tries to work it.  I am sure the Minister understands that and that he would not feel very content to try to eke out an existence or livelihood on a holding of 23 or 25 statute acres.</P>
      <P>As regards giving assistance to allottees, I should also like to take that point up with the Minister.  Under the previous régime, when houses were being built in the West of Ireland people generally got about £200 and, in come cases, £240 to build a house and out-offices.  At that time, of course, materials and labour were very much cheaper than they are at present.  I am asking the Minister if it is his policy to increase the assistance in proportion to the increased cost of building.  A grant of £200 now, or even one of £250, is not at all sufficient.  It is barely half enough to erect a house and out-offices. I do not think it would be possible to get a dwelling-house and out-offices built for £500 now&mdash;as good a house and out-offices as were built for £250 previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another snag that was always there with the Land Commission, namely, that in a number of case <Col N="2271" /> they gave a full free grant, while in other cases they gave a certain portion of the assistance by way of a grant and the remainder by way of an advance.  I never could see any justification for that differentiation at all.  I always thought that, when one person was entitled to the full amount by way of a grant, there was no reason why his neighbour should have to pay interest on an advance and be denied the same right as the other.  The Land Commission will answer that by saying that the holding can afford to bear the advance. I think it would have been much better and much more satisfactory if, instead of doing it that way, they placed a rent or an annuity on the holding at the outset that would enable them to give all the building assistance by way of a grant instead of having it segregated in that way, because that method caused nothing but the greatest dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  It has been the policy of the Land Commission to make advances available to persons getting building grants from the Department of Local Government.  The maximum advance was £80, or ten times the unrevised annuity, whichever was the lesser.  I think that now, with the increase in the value of land, the £80 advance should be increased to £140.  Even with the £235 from the Department of Local Government to build a house, it would take at least the additional £140 to build a decent dwelling-house. It may be argued, of course, that the farmers are well off and that they have several million pounds in the banks and all the rest of it, but that is not a matter, of course, to be discussed on this Estimate.  I would like to hear it debated, because Deputy Corry has stated here on several occasions that, whatever money is on deposit in the banks, it took a great many people to earn it, and that if it was divided over them it would be found that the amount per head would bring the total down to a pretty small sum and make it look very insignificant.  I would like the Minister to consider that&mdash;I am sure he knows quite enough about it&mdash; and have the advances increased.</P>
    <P>Now as regards houses and out-offices, good houses and good out-offices <Col N="2272" /> were built by the Land Commission and by the Congested Districts Board. They were good, of course, considering the period in which they were built and were suitable enough then.  They represented a big advance on what the people had been accustomed to, but we have become more modern in every respect and we now hear a lot about the proper lay-out of a dwelling-house and out-offices.  The houses and out-offices that were built ten, 20 or 30 years ago are, in my opinion, not up to the required standard at the present time.  I think a great deal more care should be taken in the planning and lay-out of houses and out-offices so as to bring them as near as possible to what the Department of Agriculture would consider to be a proper residence and out-offices for a farmer.</P>
    <P>We have the same figure in the Estimates this year as we had last year for the improvement of estates and for the acquisition or resumption of land.  If the Minister comes in here at any time with a Supplementary Estimate for the acquisition or resumption of land or the improvement of estates, I can assure him that he will have my full cooperation and support in doing so. When work on the improvement of estates was carried out, in many instances a good deal was left undone.  It was a source of torment to every Deputy to find that when certain improvements were carried out and when certain estimates were set aside for doing the work that when the money allocated was expended, the estate was left just about three-quarters finished.  I think there should be nothing like that in future. No matter what length of time it takes to do the job properly, it should be finished and completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned something about the vesting of holdings.  It was a happy knack in many instances with the Land Commission in the past to vest a holding that had not been properly improved in order to put the tenant out of bounds so that he would have no further claim on them for having the proper and necessary improvements carried out.  I hope that state of affairs will not be continued.  Take road making, for instance.  In the preparation of schemes for the allocation <Col N="2273" /> of estates, the inspector goes in and drafts out his scheme.  He outline a road from one public road in perhaps halfway on the estate.  He then goes to the other public road and brings in the road so far, but the road on the estate is left unconnected, with the result that if the residents on it want to have it taken over by the county council they find that the fact that it is an unconnected road is the big snag. In the carrying out of such work, if you go to the Land Commission and ask them to have the road run right through they will tell you that they will not go to that expense: that the roads that they are making are suitable for Land Commission purposes.  I think that is not the proper way to look at it.  I think they should make the road through and through and not be putting the county council to the trouble perhaps at a later stage of having to acquire land compulsorily in order to connect what, in many instances, might be a very important road.</P>
    <P>The improvement of bogs is another matter which I wish to bring under the Minister's notice.  For a period I suppose of 40 years, the Estates Commissioners, the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission, since it came into existence, have taken over bogs but they have never carried out any proper improvement works on them.  They have just lock-spitted the allotments but no drainage has been carried out.  They lock-spitted the roads through the bog but they never made them and yet they expect people to go there, open up turbary and carry on turf production.  Many of the bogs are there undeveloped and uncut.  I imagine that that was one of the things which the Land Commission could have been doing during the emergency.  I mentioned it in previous debates on this Vote, that they could direct their attention to doing work that they had left unattended and neglected, very useful work, in bringing bogs up to a better state of development to enable people to cut turf on the allotments for which they are paying annuities.  In other parts of the country you have cases where they divided large estates and promised the tenants, even some of the migrants brought very long distances, <Col N="2274" /> that they would provide them with turbary allotments.  Although the turbary is there quite convenient to them, nothing has been done to provide these people with the allotments they require for their domestic fuel supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his opening statement that when he took over office the Land Commission had no lands on hands with which to proceed.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister can do anything about it but I do know that for a number of years they had been negotiating for the purchase of land and its acquisition and, while they could put forward the excuse that there was a close-down Order during the emergency, I understand that, as far as the West is concerned, that close-down Order was removed a considerable time before the present Minister took office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the delay in coming to a decision.  I have a number of cases here of estates where acquisition proceedings took place and still, seemingly, no decision has been given.  I have the estate of Mrs. H. Howard, the lands of Abbeygormian, Record No. S8982, County Galway, where the objection to acquisition was heard in October, 1947.  That is eight months ago.  I imagine in that case the Land Commission should be in a position to have the decision announced.  I have another case on the Daly estate, Record No. S3736, the holding of Helena and James Glynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection against the resumption of one holding was heard in 1941 and the objection in the other case was heard in June, 1947.  The decision was reserved and nothing has been heard of it since.  I think that is an unduly long time to take to come to a decision. There are a number of other cases which I can quote.  There is a holding <Col N="2275" /> on the very same estate, the Daly estate, the holding of F. and W. Burke.  These people have been waiting for the land for 22 years.  Their landlord's estate was divided in 1926 and they were told that this land would be taken over immediately and that they would get it.  They are both residents of the village of Curragh, between Kilconnell and Ballymacward. Proceedings in that case were taken, the case was heard and the objection was overruled away back in 1941.  I cannot understand why a decision has not been given in that case and something done by way of redeeming the promises made to those people at that time.  I presume that the decision was reserved or postponed, since this close-down Order was revoked, because of the decision pending in what was known as the Fisher case.</P>
    <P>Then there were the lands of Eyrecourt Demesne.  The objection was heard also in October and the decision was reserved.  There is also the case of the estate of Miss Ethel Dillon, Clonbrock Demesne, containing 434 acres. An announcement appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on the 17th February, 1948, that the price, in default of agreement, would be £5,000.  The Land Commission are presumably proceeding in that case but so far nothing very tangible has resulted.  No scheme has been prepared or no investigation has been carried out.  I think the Land Commission have no excuse now in coming to decisions in all the cases I have mentioned. The withholding of decisions is unfair, not merely to the people who are expecting land but it is in a degree unfair to the people who have objected because when the decision is reserved for such a long period they are not in a position to put their heart into the working of the land as they might otherwise do.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal from time to time that in cases where land is badly needed the Land Commission should go in and purchase land in the open market.  That was advocated by Deputies who are now supporting the Government when they were in opposition on this side of the House. I wonder is that going to be the policy <Col N="2276" /> now?  Personally I hope not because I think it would be a very dangerous policy to follow.  I think it would increase the price of land very considerably. I have never known a case except one in which the Congested Districts Board many years ago went into a public auction and bought land. They did so because there was a considerable amount of land there and there was a considerable area adjoining it which was in their hands.  They held that by taking both forms, it would enable them to prepare a better allocation scheme.</P>
    <P>We also have heard in this House, on many occasions, about this thing they call political interference with the Land Commission.  The Minister presides there now and that is one of the things that I would like him to come out with if there was any political interference either by Ministers or even Deputies with the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear all about it.  In fact, I would like if there could be a day set aside specially for a discussion on that matter and that we could go back for a considerable number of years.  Nobody more anxiously awaits a discussion of that kind, if it were possible to bring it about, than I.  Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933 puts it outside the power of a Minister to interfere in the acquisition or division of land.  I should like to know if it can be suggested that the Minister's predecessors interfered in the acquisition or division of land.  If they did, I am sure the present Minister will not spare them&mdash;and I do not expect that he should.  But I know there was no such interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933 will not be altered or set aside. Remember, we all have our wellwishers and our favourites, but I think that nothing would bring worse dividends politically than interference of that kind.  I saw a certain amount of it before the Land Act of 1933; I knew what happened, and that was one of my chief reasons for giving full support <Col N="2277" /> to the insertion of that section in the Land Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for the Department of Lands on previous occasions we had a considerable amount of oratory from the Minister for Agriculture, in which he roundly denounced the having of the annuities under the 1933 Act.  He said it was sheer dishonesty; that it was unfair to the tax-paying community to have them carrying half of what should be the normal annuity on a holding. I hope the section of the Land Act of 1933 that deals with that will not be amended and I hope the Minister for Agriculture, if he tries to put it across at a Government meeting, will be strongly resisted by the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To what section is the Deputy referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not quote the section, but it is in the Land Act of 1933, as the Minister very well knows. If I were to go to the Library, I am sure I could bring it up and quote the relevant section.  That is the danger I see&mdash;going back again to fix the normal rent and make the tenant pay in full. It is more dangerous now than at any other time, because land purchased now will be purchased at a price that, in my opinion, will be much above its normal value, and if the allottees have to bear the annuity in proportion to the purchase price it will be a very grave hardship on them.  Some future Government will have to come to the rescue and again institute what was enacted in the 1933 Land Act.  I am saying that in all sincerity, because I have a very good idea of how the Minister for Agriculture can use his oratorical powers denouncing what the Fianna Fáil Government did in 1933 and how he will insist&mdash;that is, if his statements in opposition mean anything&mdash;that you revert to the pre-1933 position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time like this, when there is a hunger for land, people desiring land will take it at any price.  They will take it at almost any rent that will be fixed.  I am quite sure there are a number of them who would take land at a rent of £3 an acre and, when they have it for ten years, they will come to the Land Commission and to Ministers and Deputies saying that they cannot carry <Col N="2278" /> the burden much longer.  To ensure that that burden will not be placed on them, I ask the Minister to pay attention to what I am saying and not pay any heed to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, who may want to have that state of affairs brought about again.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I do not believe land acquisition and division will fully solve the congested problem. I firmly believe that unless this matter is tackled from other angles than through the division of land, that problem will remain acute, and very acute. I suggest the Minister should set up a special section of his Department on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board to go into the whole question of congestion.</P>
    <P>He has made a fairly clear statement that the relief of congestion is his primary object.  I would like to know what is his policy with regard to landless men who are applicants.  Are they to be completely overruled?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are provided for in regulations, not by law; they are provided for in the regulations under the Land Act.  They are placed about sixth on the list, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the Minister proposes to interfere with them, but this is what I hold, that if the relief of congestion is the Minister's primary object, landless men should not look forward in the vain hope of being provided with holdings of land, because that is all it has meant for a number of years.  Landless men are told they are provided for in the Act and in the regulations and that they may get holdings at the discretion of the Land Commission Inspector.  But very few of them have got holdings and I think it would be just as well for the Minister to take his courage in his hands now and disillusion them, because if he is in earnest in solving the congested problem first, he will find there will be no land available for landless men, and in my opinion there is no use in holding out a vain hope to <Col N="2279" /> them that they are likely to get land.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I intervened in this debate not for the purpose of being critical but for the purpose of being as helpful as I can and for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of fully clarifying his policy.  I assure the Minister that any steps he thinks fit to take in tackling the problem of land division, either by way of acquisition or resumption of land, I shall be quite prepared to support any Supplementary Estimate he brings before this House in order to accomplish that task within the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the policy as announced by the Minister particularly as I represent a constituency which has been affected in the years of the emergency by the closing down on land division.  I am glad that the Minister has removed that restriction and that his main concern will be the relief of congestion.  In my constituency&mdash;and I am sure this applies equally to other parts of the country&mdash;there is a very serious problem. There you have men with holdings completely inadequate to enable them to earn a decent livelihood.  In different areas there are numbers of small holdings like that piled up against large and sometimes unworked estates.  It does seem to me that, if we are to redress the harm done over the centuries, the question of providing a proper holding of a sufficient economic size should be one of the first considerations of our State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in agreement with a good deal of what Deputy Beegan has said in relation to this question of land division. In the last 25 years since 1923 we have had a native Government.  Yet we are still discussing in this Parliament the question of relieving congestion and providing land for landless men.  We are still discussing what is the proper size of a holding to enable a man to live in decent comfort.  We are discussing as to whether it should be 30, 35 or 40 acres.  I am amazed to find this problem so far short of solution after 25 years.  It is a matter upon which I feel very strongly.  As the last Deputy has said, there has been too <Col N="2280" /> much delay in the carrying out of acquisition and the implementing of decisions to acquire.  Apparently that is the result of the commissioners being a more or less independent body exercising quasi-judicial powers and holding a definite quasi-judicial status. Whether they have wrapped themselves up in a bundle of red tape, or whatever the cause may be, there is a considerable time-lag between the decision to acquire a particular estate and the implementing of that decision.  I think it is regrettable that that should be so and I trust that in the future this matter will be speeded up.  In many cases estates have been divided and allotted to particular allottees under a sort of caretaking system during which they served a probationary period.  In those cases years sometimes elapse before those allottees become owners of their holdings.  I think that is a wrong system and I think it is a bad system.  It has a bad effect on the men who suffer under this probationary period and who are neither the owners of the land nor who have any degree of certainty that they will evenually become the owners.  That destroys their security and it destroys some of those fundamental principles for which many of our leaders fought in the past.</P>
    <P>I think the ideal type of land division is the splitting up of estates into holdings of proper sizes amongst those people who are to benefit.  Once the division has taken place I think the holders should own the land and work it without interference.  I am very glad that the acquisition of land will commence in the Midlands.  There is a serious problem there.  I trust that the Minister will endeavour to get away from the basis upon which land was divided in the past.  I regret to say that land division was concerned with the particular colour of the applicant. I do not know whether Deputy Beegan spoke with his tongue in his cheek but he had the gall to stand up in this House and suggest that there had been no political interference on the part of the last Government as far as land division was concerned.  There has been considerable such interference.  Time and time again estates were divided and allotted to applicants simply because they were nominated by the <Col N="2281" /> local Fianna Fáil cumann.  A system of patronage had been built up.</P>

      <P>A system of patronage has been built up by the previous Administration, particularly by the Minister for Lands, who utilised the power of dividing land throughout the country to further the interests of his own Party.  I know that in the years before the war, when acquisition did take place, an entire parish in LeixOffaly changed its political views overnight simply because of the division of an estate.  Lists of names were sent up to the Land Commission by the local Fianna Fáil cumann and, on the say-so of some local Gauleiter, some men got land and some of the most deserving got none.  I know that is a serious accusation.  I trust that some spokesman of the last Administration will deal with it.  Deputy Hilliard asks for names.

It is occupied under the conacre system by a businessman in Galway.  Twice that estate has been promised to the local farmers in the last five years.

    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have land division, we should be sincere about it and division should not take place merely amongst the followers of the administration in power.  Above all, that maxim enunciated by the former Minister about land going to Fianna Fáil followers should not be followed by this Government in relation to its own followers. Until that even-handed policy of dividing land and giving it to men who deserve it, irrespective of what their <Col N="2283" /> politics may be, is adopted, we will never get back to a proper moral standard throughout the country.  Deputy Moylan may laugh.  I hope he will have some contribution to make to the debate and will explain many of the things which trouble the ordinary people throughout the country.  The sooner we turn our backs on this disgusting policy of patronage applied to land, the better for this country, and I commend the Minister for the policy he has enunciated.</P>
    <P>I realise that he has set himself a very high aim because he has to restore the confidence of the people living in congested districts that they will get land because of their claims and not because of whom they know.  He will have to do that, first of all, and, secondly, he will have, by the manner in which he regulates his Department, to ensure that such a division as he decides upon is carried out quickly, that the eventual vesting of lands in the deserving people who are to get them is carried through as quickly as possible, and that what I have described as the probationary period for which a man is allowed to be a caretaker on the land, apparently at the mercy of different officials, should be as short as possible.  He will have to deal with these two matters which are of considerable importance.  I do not know what view I would take of Deputy Beegan's suggestion that the Land Commission should enter the property market.  I assume that in connection with that, as in connection with many questions, much can be said on both sides, but let us put first things first.  There is in this country some land&mdash;it may not be much&mdash; which should be divided.</P>
    <P>There are certain estates which, for one reason or another, are not being properly worked, which should be better worked and which should be divided amongst deserving people, and I trust the Minister will concentrate on matters like that which are of primary concern to the ordinary small farmer. I welcome the new approach of the Minister to this entire question of land division and, as I say, I trust we shall get away from the policy of political <Col N="2284" /> interference with land division which has done much to shake the confidence of the people in it.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out how free the inspectors were left.  I always believed that the most deserving person got the land.  When a Deputy is elected, he is not elected for a certain section in his constituency. He is elected to serve every section, irrespective of their political views, and that has been my outlook on public life.  I would not like to see a man getting a holding unless he was entitled to it and capable of working it and doing himself and the nation justice. Under the 1933 Land Act, as Deputy Beegan has pointed out, the then Minister divested himself of any power whatever to acquire or divide land. That power was vested in the Land Commission, and, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, that commission had the sole right to acquire land.  They were really the independent referees. They went on the basis of the inspectors' reports as to who should get the land and who was best entitled to it. <Col N="2285" /> The position is that if any Minister wanted to carry on as the previous Fine Gael Minister carried on, he had complete power up to the time the 1933 Land Act was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has decided to acquire land and divide it, for any words of mine could not express the urgent necessity which exists for land division, especially in County Dublin.  We have a very acute problem of uneconomic holders who are definitely an asset to this nation, who keep the Dublin market going; they work hard, a number of them are, what you might call, model farmers working under very adverse circumstances.  Many people of that kind are hardly in a position to carry on; they show their industry by paying up to £20 for conacre and surely they are worthy of sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that I want to deal with is the size of the holdings.  That is a point which has been very much debated in the House over a number of years.  I still hold that it is better to give a man from 35 to 40 acres, or we will say 35 acres, in North County Dublin than to divide the 35 acres between two men, because it means that a man with 35 acres will be very near having an economic holding, especially being near a good market, and there will be the possibility that he will employ other people to assist him.  If you divide it between two men, however, you have the opposite argument and you have a man who is neither a labourer nor a farmer.  You are leaving him in mid-air and he will not be in a position to employ labour. It is better that a man should have at least a reasonable holding and he is better for the nation than the man who has a small holding.  In County Dublin you have the position where some small dairy farmers try to keep cows on only 22 or 23 statute acres of land.  They are going out through the country looking for land as, though they may have only a few cows, they have to keep a couple of horses and other things and the whole thing is uneconomic.  Others who have 10 or 12 acres are neither farmers nor labours.  They try to farm for a part of the year and for the <Col N="2287" /> rest of the time they try to get work on the roads or other subsidiary work in order to try to carry on.</P>
    <P>Another point&mdash;and it is a sore and hackneyed subject for a number of years&mdash;is the question of Land Commission roads.  I do say, with all due respect, that the nearest approach to making roads by the Land Commission, both under a native Government and as far back even as the days of the old Congested Districts Board, was the making of what you might call prairie tracks.  In certain districts they came along and got boulders or stones and put them on the road and they covered them with any old sand, in many cases out of the nearest adjoining sand pit.  They left the road so that two carts could barely pass, or maybe two lorries but only with great difficulty. They were not concerned with making a proper road but only a prairie track and they even allocated the holdings along it to people who lived on that particular estate or farm which was being divided.  During my four years in public life I have been making representations with regard to these prairie tracks because people are under very severe hardship trying to bring farm implements on these tracks such as tractors or binders which get stuck in the road.  Umpteen of them in County Dublin go back to the old days of the Congested Districts Board and I must say that I would like to see that policy changed.  In support of what Deputy Beegan has stated, if it is possible to put these roads in a proper condition, even if it requires the amendment of the Act, they should be handed over to the local authority after they have been properly repaired.  I would ask the Minister to try as far as possible to have this done and to see that when his Department is dividing land in future they give up making these horrible prairie tracks which we have had experience of throughout the country over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear what the Minister has to say regarding the revesting of holdings.  I was not here for his opening address unfortunately.  A number of farmers in North County Dublin and South County Dublin are <Col N="2288" /> still anxious that their holdings should be revested.  While I am on that point, I would like to say that I feel that there is a lack of cohesion between the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works with reference to this drainage scheme. In the old days when there was any drainage to be done the Congested Districts Board carried it out, especially minor drainage schemes.  I know that we have the rural improvements scheme and other means of carrying out drainage now, but sometimes the trouble with them is that while five or six people agree to get the work done, others disagree, with the result that the five or six people who are anxious to have their land drained are hampered and held up by the people who do not want it done and who, through mere ordinary disagreeableness, will not help their neighbours. The Land Commission, even at this stage, should try to have cohesion.</P>
    <P>The land is theirs.  They should take some interest in land that is badly flooded.  This matter should not be sent from Billy to Jack.  The land belongs to the Land Commission. Drainage is the function of some other Department.  There should be some cohesion between the Departments in tackling work that is long overdue.  A number of Land Commission inspectors were put on other work during the emergency.  The country is settling down again and we are away from war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that drainage should be the concern of the Land Commission and that they should press the responsible Department to have land drained.  There are a number of examples of flooding in County Dublin <Col N="2289" /> and I would like to see something done about it.  In regard to landless men, is it the policy of the present Minister to deprive enterprising landless men, of whom there are cases in County Dublin, who have acquired ten, 12, 15, 16 or 20 acres of conacre for tillage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean who have taken it on the 11 months' system for tillage.  Some of the people to whom I have already referred carry on market gardening and they work four, five or ten acres.  They ordinarily would be classified as landless men when they would not be on the Land Commission register as being the tenants of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I want to find out what is the position regarding these men.  I believe these men are worthy of special consideration especially those who have shown enterprise and have taken land in conacre.  They are worthy of sympathetic consideration. The Minister will have no power, but the Land Commission should at least consider these men as suitable tenants.</P>
      <P>I have had some inquiries made from time to time as to the possibility of the Land Commission increasing the grant for the building of houses.  Deputy Beegan dealt with that grant.  I have heard replies given in this House that it was a matter for the Department of Local Government but I would like to have a definite statement by the Minister for Lands that he would give a specific grant outside the grant given by the Department of Local Government which, in the old days, was £200 or £250.  £200 will not do very much now.  The Minister for Lands should consider making a definite statement as to the amount of money he would give towards building houses and outhouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission inspectors, in addition to interesting themselves in land division and revesting, should interest themselves also in seeing that the holdings they revest are handed over to the tenant in a reasonable condition. I mean, if there is anything <Col N="2290" /> that it is within the power of the Land Commission to do for the particular tenant, especially a new tenant, in improving his condition, such as the provision of a roadway to his house, drainage, and various other things, they should at least report that that work should be done.  They should not try to side-track the responsibility by merely revesting the holding and leaving it at that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of water on land, we have another problem in North County Dublin and portion of the south county.  The Land Commission have sunk pumps here and there on certain holdings throughout the county.  I am given to understand that they are not anxious to continue that policy.  I believe that is a very essential work.  It is not right that cattle should have to drink polluted water.  When the Land Commission are dividing a holding they should make sure that there will be a proper water supply for cattle and, if there is not a proper water supply in existence, they should make arrangements for a pump to be sunk or water laid on.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers in County Dublin have to draw water a long distance for their cattle, especially in dry seasons.  In respect of a number of the holdings that have been revested in County Dublin and in respect of which rent is still being paid to the Land Commission, the Land Commission, who is still in charge of the land and the landlord of the land, should at least assist the tenant in providing water for stock.  I know that these things are all very expensive to provide but they are very reasonable things to ask for and the Land Commission should interest themselves in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in South County Dublin which, I suppose, the Minister might say concerns the Department of Agriculture.  A certain type of fern, growing on lands in the South County Dublin, is poisonous to cattle.  I am dealing with one specific area, Castlekelly, in the Bohernabreena district.  Ferns growing on some of the lands that are under the Land Commission have killed cattle, especially <Col N="2291" /> at certain times of the year.  I know this is a very big problem but it is well that the Minister for Lands, who is new to the job, should know all about these things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question down to the Minister for Agriculture on this matter and he told me he had fixed the price to allow a reasonable margin of profit to those producers who employ efficient methods of milk production. I do not consider that the Minister could state that the milk producers supplying Cork City area are inefficient. This is a pretty long-drawnout trouble with us and, in view of statements made by previous Ministers, we went to the trouble of endeavouring to get accurate costings. Apparently, the present Minister is following the previous Minister's lead and refusing to get costings of milk production on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We handed over a bunch of our farmers' records to Professor Murphy, of University College, Cork, and I have here&mdash;and the Minister's Department has had since January last&mdash; possession of those costings.  They were carried out jointly by the Milk Producers' Association of Cork and the Cork University.  When I state here that the price allowed for home-grown feeding stuffs on those costings was £5 per ton for hay and £1 1s. 0d. for mangolds and turnips, I think the House will agree with me that the costings basis was taken as low as possible.  I do not believe that any farmer here listening to me could produce either hay, mangolds or turnips at that price, or ensilage at £2 a ton.  Those are the bases on which these costings were made up.  The costings were very carefully gone into and anyone who knows Professor Murphy's standing as a costings expert will have to agree that he is more than careful in his work.  We <Col N="2292" /> had to do that because, unlike other industrialists, we have no costings board or prices commission to go before. I know the Minister's opinion of a prices commission and I will not quote it to-night for him, though I have it here.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Cogan on the Adjournment Debate on the same day as I had these questions down, 13th May, the Minister told us that he wanted to see the farmers getting a good profit and wanted something more.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to make of agriculture an industry in which those engaged in it who employ labour will be able to pay their workers a fair wage.  It is a source of humiliation to me that the agricultural worker in this country who, in my judgement, is the most highly skilled worker we have, should have the figure of 55/- a week associated with his name as a minimum wage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the Minister in that.  How does the Minister go about getting a good wage for the worker? The cost of production of milk for the winter months, as found by Professor Murphy, is 26.70 pence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The three figures I am quoting were added on by agreement with Professor Murphy and they are as I have given them.  He could not put those into the costings.  Does the Minister state that he is not prepared to allow the farmers anything for farm management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2293" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, without allowing for the three items, which he said do not appear in the English reports on costings and for which, therefore, we had to take agreed sums. If the Minister holds that the farmer should get nothing for management, nothing for interest on the capital involved and nothing for insurance against disease in cattle, he is going to bring in a new law for the farmer as against every other industry.  The figures I have quoted are 26.70 pence&mdash; 2s. 4.70d.  How does the Minister provide for the increased wages that he says the agricultural labourer should get and how does he provide for the farmers' profit and all the rest of it? I am not concerned with the grass months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the genius on my right get a little more sense? Against the farmers' costs of 2s. 4.70 pence, the Minister allows for October, November and December 2s. 1d.</P>
      <P>The farmer can, therefore, fatten at 3d. per gallon of a dead loss if he is fool enough to produce milk for liquid consumption in the city during those months.  For January, February and March he receives 2/3.  He is at a loss of only 1¾d. during that time.  He receives 2/- during the month of April which leaves him at a mere loss of 4¾d. I am not finding any fault with the Minister's summer prices.  I consider that they are fair and that they allow a fair margin of profit to the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure any farmer here that if he sends his milk to the city for those five months of the year and places his contract at 40 gallons a day he will have roughly about £100 <Col N="2294" /> profit at the end of the five summer months.  However, let him stop there and sit down and live on the £100 for the next seven months because if he sends milk to the city at the rate of 40 gallons a day for the 12 months of the year he will find himself at the end of the 12 months at a dead loss of £13.</P>

      <P>That is what has left the agricultural community who supply milk to the cities in the position they are in.  That is why the city people are getting what I consider a very unsatisfactory milk supply.  The farmer cuts his losses as well as he can.  If I am a farmer supplying 40 gallons of milk a day to Cork City I am going to supply as little as I can during the winter months and cut my losses.  I am pretty well aware of the situation and the people on whose behalf I speak are well aware of it too.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this particular matter.  The Minister should get the cost of production for the grand cows he talks about in Glasnevin; bring it up here and quote it against the figure given by Professor Murphy, if he dares.  There are sufficient stocks of milch cows being kept by State institutions or semiState institutions in this country to enable us very easily and quickly to obtain the cost of production of milk. The man I am concerned about is the <Col N="2295" /> man whose duty it should be to supply the city with 40 gallons of milk on Christmas Eve as well as 40 gallons in the month of June.</P>

      <P>We are facing that condition of affairs.  We expect from any Minister for Agriculture in this House at least the cost of production plus a fair margin of profit just the same as any other industry is getting.  The Minister's figures are not giving that for several winter months.</P>

      <P>I want from the Minister a change of heart in this matter.  I want him to go into these figures; to consider them carefully, and to state in this House the incentive there is to the farmer to supply milk to Cork City or even to Dublin City from the month of October until the 1st May on the figures that he has given here.  The more the farmer supplies during these months the greater his losses will be. These figures, I might say, were compiled before the recent increase in agricultural rates and wages.</P>

      <P>For the Minister's information I would inform him that an <Col N="2296" /> extra 5/- per week in wages represents ½d. per gallon in winter-production milk.  I hope that the Minister will be reasonable in this matter.  I expect it from a Minister holding power in this House by the support of those who claim to represent the farmers and who claim to hold the balance of power in this House to-day.  I expect that they at least will see that the Minister is reasonable and that he will give justice to the farmer who earns it hard. There is no job at the present day more difficult or tougher than farming. The farmer who has to keep a herd of cows and who has to keep a herd of cows and who has to supply winter milk for fluid consumption in the city has a tougher job than most men.  I am looking for justice for that man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister for Local Government.  I asked the Cork Milk Board, the board who were kind enough to say that they would come to see me.  I spent the whole morning with them and, during the whole of the discussion, they never once mentioned that in Cork there was this strange practice that you made one contract for the winter months and another contract for the summer months.  Of course, you could pour the milk down the sewer, too.  Why do not the Cork milk suppliers make 12months' contracts?  It is on that basis that the prices are fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never done.</P>

    <Col N="2297" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done in Dublin.  It has always been done in Dublin.  In the whole of the forenoon's discussion that I had with the Cork Milk Board we discussed little else than the prices for summer and winter supplies, the man who supplied for all the 12 months and the man who came in in the summer when there was a surplus and got out in the winter&mdash;all this was canvassed.  I think Deputy Corry will agree that there was no question of limiting the discussion.  There was no indication to the board that they were unwelcome or that they were looked upon as trespassers. On the countrary, they were made welcome and invited to say whatever they had in their minds.  Yet nobody mentioned this remarkable practice of a winter and summer contract.</P>
      <P>The prices are fixed in respect of the Dublin milk supply area and the Cork milk supply area at a different level for different months, the object being to give, over the 12 months, to the man who makes a contract with a distributor to supply, say, ten gallons per day winter and summer, a certain level price.  In varying the price from month to month, the aim is to bring the summer price rather lower than it might ordinarily be brought and the winter price rather higher, so that the man who goes to the trouble of maintaining a constant supply all through the year will receive a higher proporation of reward for his effort than the man who comes into Cork with grass-produced milk and never presents himself during the winter months when the production of milk is comparatively difficult.  I do not know anything about third five-months' contract or seven-months' contract. I can assure the Deputy that I shall have the matter closely investigated at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Without delay.  I guarantee to the Deputy that I shall have that matter investigated closely and at once.  When we come to the costings, the House will notice that Deputy Corry is uninterested in the costings for the production of summer milk.  I understand that this distinguished economist&mdash;and he is a highly distinguished economist&mdash;Professor Murphy, produced the costings <Col N="2298" /> to which Deputy Corry referred for winter milk.  I understand he has bent his mind to working out the costings of summer milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder when these costings will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister publishes the ones for Glasnevin for which we are paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be delighted to see them when they are published, and I shall be interested to discuss them with the Deputy here.  The Deputy refers to Professor Murphy's costings and, subject to the reservation that I am not at all satisfied that any system of agricultural costings in this country can, of their nature, give a reliable picture, taking Professor Murphy's costings and the open and frank way in which Deputy Corry has put them before the House&mdash;no concealment, no deception, all the figures quoted&mdash;you will find he has overlooked one little trifle.  Calves are credited in the account here at £1 apiece.  Surely Deputy Corry is not selling his calves for £1 apiece now.  Does he not realise that there has been a change of Government and that he does not have to cut their throats and throw them in a ditch any longer?</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry asked, in that melodious voice of his, what was the Minister doing for the farmers, for whom he expressed such fearful solicitude. I will tell him.  Increasing the price of their calves from 10/- apiece to £5 apiece.  If you reckon that out on the lactation of a 500-gallon cow, if the Deputy will take a stump of pencil and figure it out, he will find that it is nearly 2d. per gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You fixed the 500-gallon cow all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He will find that the Minister in three months appears to have done more for Deputy Corry's colleagues in the Cork milk area than Deputy Corry's colleagues in Dáil Éireann did for him in 15 years, and I am not nearly finished helping Deputy Corry yet.  I shall make quite a rich man of him if he works hard in the <Col N="2299" /> years that lie ahead.  I have nothing to add to the answer which I gave Deputy Corry to the question he asked me on the first occasion.  I do not think he has been entirely disingenuous in quoting Professor Murphy's costings. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that Professor Murphy's figure is 22.7d. net and Deputy Corry estimates certain elements of cost that Professor Murphy left out and adds them to that figure.  But the result is not Professor Murphy's costings, but Deputy Corry's costings.  I direct the attention of the House to the figure in Professor Murphy's costings of calves at £1.  If Deputy Corry is selling his claves for £1, he is an awfully silly man.  I am sure he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the question of when my Department is going to put itself in a position to set costings before the House of a similar nature to those, the answer is that I doubt if we will ever set costings like those before this House, because, while not for a moment questioning the good faith of Professor Murphy who has given to this matter time and trouble, as have many distinguished statistical scientists in Great Britain, when all is said and done I know my neighbours in rural Ireland just as well as the statisticians in Cork University or Wye College in Great Britain know them, and when I contemplate sending out 50 inquirers to 500 of my neighbours in rural Ireland to ask them 100 questions about their daily avocations and when the answer is brought back to me, after <Col N="2300" /> correlation and calculation, does any Deputy think that I will get a result that any sane man will commend for the consideration of his colleagues?</P>
    <P>Let me give the House this instance in conclusion.  A distinguished and well-intentioned man recently waited on me in my Department with a deputation and told me that he regretted to inform me that he had discovered, with the assistance of a costs accountant of standing, that it costs 7d. to produce an egg.  I said to him: &ldquo;My friend, at the present moment the women of Ireland must be all going mad, because they are selling eggs for 3d. apiece and they seem to like it. He said: &ldquo;Suppose I produce the costings and evidence to an officer of your Department and any costs accountant you care to employ and they tell you they cannot quarrel with these figures and that this contention that it costs 7d. to produce an egg is correct?&rdquo;  I stated: &ldquo;I would send for my colleague, Dr. Browne, and ask him to certify the pair of them and remove them to Grangegorman.&rdquo;  If costings produce that result, costings are a cod.  I am not prepared to say that now, because I am examining the matter and I have an open mind.  But I cannot yet see a system of costings over which I am prepared to stand.  If I can find such a system, I will put it into operation.  Until I do, I cannot make a case in this House on costings in which I myself do not believe.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, June 1st.</P>
