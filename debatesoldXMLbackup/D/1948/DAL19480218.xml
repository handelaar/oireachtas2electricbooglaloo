      <P>Go dtoghfar an Teachta Proinnsias Ó Fathaigh chun bheith ina Cheann Comhairle agus go rachfaidh sé i gceannas na Dála anois.</P>
      <P>Sa mbliain 1932 a céad-toghadh Proinnsias Ó Fathaigh ina Cheann Comhairle ar an Seachtú Dáil agus toghadh é i gceannas ar gach Dáil ó shoin i leith.  Thug sé sásamh do gach páirtí sa Teach.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na Teachtaí go léir ar aon intinn liom agus go ndéanfar é thoghadh arís d'aon-ghuth.</P>

Gidh gur minic, béidir, nár réitiómar lena chéile ar rudaí beaga, tá a fhios ag gach aoinne sa Tigh seo go bhfuil cion agus meas againn ar Phroinnsias Ó Fathaigh.  Táimid go léir deimhnithe go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall i gcomhnaí chun Cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do gach aoinne, agus dá bhrí sin, cuidím go fial leis an rún a tairgeadh anseo.</P>

    <P>To my fellow-Deputies I am sincerely grateful for having re-elected me for the seventh time as Ceann Comhairle. I count with confidence on your co-operation in my discharge of the duties of the office, for without goodwill and that co-operation the post would become impossible.</P>

      <P>Ón uair a chuaigh an Teach ar athló, fuaireamar uile scéala bróin faoi bhás triúir a bhí ina gcomhaltaí linn anseo an tráth sin: Séamus O hAodha, Teachta do Cheatharlach-Cill Dara, agus Máirtín O Rodaigh, Teachta do Shligeach, a cailleadh sarar scoireadh an Dáil; agus Éamon O Cuagáin, a bhí ina Theachta do Chill Coinnigh sa sean-Dáil agus a bhí ainmnithe ina iarrthóir don Olltoghchán, a cailleadh tar éis dáta an scoir.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar anam an triúir acu.</P>
      <P>Ba mhór an méala dúinn go léir an bás obann a fuair Séamus O hAodha le linn an Toghcháin.  Teachta dúthrachtach dícheallach ba ea é a chuir spéis chruinn oilte sa talmhaíocht agus is mór an chailliúint dúinn an t-eolas agus an chomhairle ealaíonta praiticiúil a bhí aige ar cheisteanna talmhaíochta.</P>
      <P>Is boichte-de suíocháin tosaigh an Tighe seo freisin bás Mháirtín Uí Rodaigh agus Éamoin Uí Chuagáin. Sean-chomhalta cáiliúil den Teach seo ba ea Máirtín Ó Rodaigh.  Fear módhúil, cúirtéiseach ba ea é a bhí oilte i gcúrsaí Stáit agus a thug seirbhís dílis don Dáil, agus bhí meas mór ag gach Páirtí agus ag gach Teachta air.</P>
      <P>Sa mbliain 1944 (míle naoí gcéad dachad a ceathair) a tháinig Éamon Ó Cuagáin inár mease anseo, agus, ón lá a toghadh é, ghlac sé páirt ghníomhach i gcúrsaí díospóireachta na Dála. Do réir gach dealraimh, bhí réim sontasach párlaiminte i ndán dó, ach thug gearr-thaom tinnis an bás air.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá Gearóid Mag Canainn, Cléireach na Dála, tar éis éirí as oifig ó bhí an cruinniú deireanach den Dáil ann, toisc an teora aoise a bheith sroichte aige.  Ar an ábhar sin fágadh an Teach in éamais seirbhísí oifigigh a raibh dlúth-bhaint aige ó thus le hobair an Tí agus a bhí ina phríomh-oifigeach ann le hocht mbliana anuas.</P>
      <P>Bhí Gearóid Mag Canainn tráth ina oifigeach do shean-Bhord na gCeantar gCúng.  Thug sé suas don phost sin sa mbliain 1920 (míle naoi gcéad agus fiche) le dul ar fhoirinn na Céad Dála. Sa mbliain 1922 (míle naoi gcéad fiche dó) ceapadh ina Leas-Chléireach don Dáil é, agus thug sé seirbhís sa bpost sin go dtí gur hardaíodh é chum bheith ina Chléireach.</P>
      <P>Is maith is eol do Theachtaí a bhí ina gcomhaltaí den Dáil le linn téarma fada oifige Ghearóid Mhig Canainn feabhas na seirbhíse a thug sé, a chúirtéisi a bhiod sé i gconaí agus a ionraice a chruthaigh sé ag freastal dó ar a dhualgais uile maidir leis an Teach agus gach duine faoi leith ann.  Is deimhin liom gurb áil le gach éinne na blianta fada faoi shonas a ghuí dhó i ndiaidh a chuid oibre.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, tá sé d'onóir agam an <Col N="19" /> Teachta Eamon de Bhaléra a mholadh mar Thaoiseach.  Ní gá dhom cur síos go mion nó go sonrach ar a bhfuil déanta aige d'Éirinn, mar tá sé sin i mbéal na ndaoine.</P>
      <P>Ag labhairt dhom ar an rún seo thar ceann Dáil-Cheantair ina bhfuil Gaeltacht mhór, tugann sé áthas faoi leith dhom an Teachta Eamon de Bhaléra a mholadh, as ucht a spéise sa nGaeilge agus an ardmheas agus an cion atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta air.  Tá a fhiúntas mar rialtóir agus mar threoraí stáit cruthaithe don saol fódhlach, agus chruthaigh sé na dea-threithre atá ann le linn an uabáis bá mhó a thit riamh ar an gcine daonna.  Thairis sin is é an fear ceannais is mó a bhfhuil lucht leanúna aige sa tír seo agus sa tigh seo.</P>
      <P>Má 'spáin toradh an toghcháin aon rud thar a chéile, spáin sé gurb é an Teachta Eamon de Bhaléra an duine a theastaíos ó mhuintir na hEireann mar cheann orthu, agus má glactar le mo mholadhsa, beidh Dáil Eireann ag déanamh mar is toil le náisiún na hEireann sa mbaile agus i gcéin.</P>

Ní gá domsa cur síos a dhéanamh ar a thréithre mar tá sean-aithne agus <Col N="20" /> sean-eolas air ag gach duine sa Dáil. Chruthaigh sé a uaisleacht agus a sheasmhacht i gcúrsaí saoirse; tá eolas deimhin aige ar chúrsaí oibre na tíre seo, ar chúrsaí talmhaíochta agus ar chúrsaí lucht oibre.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfhuil aoinne sa Dáil is fearr a dhéanfhadh an obair atá rómhainn anois sa Dáil.</P>
      <P>I move that John A. Costello be nominated as Taoiseach.  In doing so I feel that I am doing a thing which is the forerunner of a new spirit in this country.  We have expressed our sorrow in this House to-day at the deaths of three men who were a great loss to the Dáil and a great loss to our frontbench&mdash;Deputy Hughes, Deputy Roddy and Deputy Coogan, each of whom in his own way made a great contribution to the work of this House.  In their passing and in the events that have since taken place some of us can see the Hand of God tracing a new chapter in the history of our country.  James Hughes, in particular, gave a message to us in this House.  He supported that message that he had for us here and that he had for the country with as clear-minded a sacrifice of his life as that of any of those who sacrificed themselves for Ireland's liberty and well-being in the past.  The night before he went out to speak at an Irish fair to Irish farmers of the message that he had his friends tried to prevail upon him not to go but he said that he had a duty to perform.  &ldquo;As for my life,&rdquo; he said to his brother, &ldquo;you have no power over it; the doctor has no power over it and I have no power over it.  That is in God's hands.&rdquo;  The message that he went out to preach was the message he had preached so often here&mdash;the harmony that lay between the animal and the plant and the soil and the climate; the harmony that made it possible for the farmer to take from the soil of this country what gives us our sustenance and the things that go to build up our cities and our towns. He saw that, and he preached of the harmony in the animal and the plant and in the material soil of our country which required to be studied and examined and found out so that great production might be brought from that land for our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> This is a House that has from time to time gone through very difficult days, and which, as a Parliament, can stand comparison with any Parliament in the world for the high manner in which its business has been conducted, no matter under what great strain it may have laboured.  If hard words have been spoken on odd occasions in this House I feel that the hardest words that were ever spoken here were spoken to James Hughes when he was speaking on his agricultural subjects. Just as there is a harmony between the animal, the plant, the soil and the climate, which he felt it his duty to preach, there is a harmony between men's minds that has to be studied reverently and worked for as assiduously as any harmony that God established in the soil of the country we live in.  I feel that harmony to exist because of the reactions that have come from the country as a result of the recent General Election campaign and because of the movement in people's minds that has made it possible for a number of Parties to say that they are willing to sit in the council chambers of the nation, willing to form an inter-Party Government in harmony and in reverent thought for their responsibilities and their duties to their country, as against the ideas that have been preached contrary to that harmony during this recent election campaign.  I feel we are working, with sacrifice, with goodwill, with faith and with hope to establish a fruitful harmony among men of various attainments, various callings and various outlooks for their country.</P>
    <P>In offering John Costello as nominee for Taoiseach I am offering a man who has been selected in that spirit by a number of groups in this Parliament. His selection has been not a question of bargaining but a manifestation of that spirit which is deep in our tradition and deep in our faith.  In these days when a stricken world is looking back to the Christian faith and is feeling that if it only could re-grasp that faith and bring that faith to the inspiration of the work of the various nations and to the energising of their powers, something would be done to restore the world, I feel that there is <Col N="22" /> a move in this country to realise what it is the Irishman and Irishwoman hold as a faith and that a sincere and successful effort is going to be made to see that that faith is translated into good works for the glory of God and for the benefit of our country.</P>
    <P>In moving that the nomination of Jack Costello as Taoiseach be accepted I salute Deputy Costello.  I salute him for the character and ability that has pointed him out so clearly to a number of groups in the House and in the country as the man to hold together and to bind that spirit and to lead it to achievement.  I salute him for that and for the sacrifices of varied kinds that he is making in turning his back on his professional life and professional work&mdash;a sacrifice of mind in addition to many other sacrifices&mdash;in order to preside over that great experiment. I salute also the men who have come together in discussion to decide that, at a time when Ireland's spirit wants to be rekindled in its faith and Ireland's work wants to be directed in that faith, they are prepared to set up, however difficult the times, a Government that will preside over the work of this Dáil and look after the interests of the nation and that will, at the same time, point out by its example that it is only by every class and every creed and Party in this country working together and bringing the full of their capacity to the work of the country that this country can get on.</P>
    <P>I do beseech those who challenge us in various ways that we cannot work together and that we cannot stay together to hold their judgments. Criticise us in any way you can and show us the better ways of doing things but we are asking you to give us Deputy John Costello as Taoiseach because by making sacrifices of various kinds he is stepping in to encourage men of various Parties to sit down together and face whatever difficulty arises, politically, socially or economically in Ireland these days.  I have the greatest confidence in asking this House to accept the nomination of Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion.  I think the results of the recent <Col N="23" /> election and the verdicts of the people on the issues submitted to them render it unnecessary to explain any act of the Labour Party in seconding this motion. We in this country have deliberately elected under our Constitution to provide for a system of Parliamentary government on the basis of proportional representation and the fundamental basis of proportional representation is to provide for representation in the Dáil of numerically substantial cross-sections of our people. It follows, I think, from that that if we are to have cross-sections of our people represented in the Dáil, we ought to contemplate as a corollary to that development cross-sections of our people being represented in an inter-Party Government.  It is true that this country has not so far had inter-Party Government. We have had for the past 26 years one-Party Government but, considering the nation's economic position and reflecting on the economic, social and agricultural maladies which afflict it, one can see no special virtue in one-Party Government.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party, having regard to the results of the election, have decided, therefore, to vote for the establishment of an inter-Party Government, to pool the nation's wisdom and the nation's energies for a policy of national reconstruction, for national regeneration, which the nation has been often promised but of which it has not yet had even a glimpse.  We want under an inter-Party Government to strive to organise the resources and the enthusiasm of the nation, to build a new Ireland, an Ireland that will keep Irish men and women in Ireland, that will give them a decent living at home, that will harness their energies and enthusiasm for the task of building up an Ireland of which this Parliament and those who made this Parliament possible can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are voting, therefore, for what in our circumstances may seem an experiment in inter-Party Government.  But, inter-Party Government is not new to mankind.  In some of the bestgoverned countries in Europe inter-Party Government has given the peoples of those countries an incalculably <Col N="24" /> better standard of life than our people can enjoy here.  If one considers the small countries in Northern Europe and Switzerland one finds there examples of a decent life well worthy of emulation by our people.</P>
    <P>Inter-Party Government, therefore, is a form of government for which nobody need apologise with the examples of good government which can be quoted of small countries in Europe with which we are reasonably comparable.  The Labour Party is voting for this motion to give inter-Party Government a trial in this country and we will strive here, if this motion is carried, to give to our people something of the fullness and sweetness of life which inter-Party Government has given democratic people in other countries with which this country is comparable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the newest Party in this House, I rise to support the nomination of Deputy John A. Costello as Taoiseach.  The task of the elected representatives of the people after an election is to construe from the results of that election what was the will of the people.  In the election which has just concluded, the people by 750,000 votes to 500,000 votes clearly indicated that they wished to terminate the virtual political monopoly which has existed for some 16 years.  That was the clear direction to this Parliament.  In addition, the people who voted for the different Opposition Parties gave a mandate to those Parties in respect of certain matters of policy which were common to all those Parties.  Therefore, in this respect, too, the people indicated their will clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which, I am glad to say, is above Party politics in this House and in the country.  All Parties and the people are unanimous in their desire to reunite the nation and to undo Partition.  I trust that every member of this House at all times will be prepared to co-operate with whatever Government is in power in order to end the unnatural and completely unjustifiable partition of our nation. That is one matter which is above Party <Col N="25" /> politics and upon which the people are unanimous.</P>
    <P>There is a number of urgent problems that require to be dealt with, problems of vital urgency if this nation is to survive. Chief among these problems are: emigration, rural depopulation, the fall in agricultural production, tuberculosis. To deal with these problems it is necessary to put the interests of the nation above Party politics.  Possibly through tiredness, possibly through over-confidence created by too much power, the Government which has ruled the destinies of this country for a number of years has failed to heed the warnings that have come from every responsible quarter in this nation concerning these problems.  It, therefore, becomes imperative to seek a remedy elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The ultimate political objective of the Party which I have the honour to represent in this House is the reintegration of this nation as a republic, free from any association with any other country, save such association as may be freely entered into by the will of the people.  We cannot, however, claim that in this election we secured a mandate from the people that would enable us to repeal, or seek to repeal the External Relations Act and such other measures as are inconsistent with our status as an independent republic. These, therefore, have to remain in abeyance for the time being.  They are the ultimate aims of Clann na Poblachta and I trust that, at the next opportunity, the people will express their support for this policy and give Clann na Poblachta a mandate to carry it into effect.  I also trust that the other Parties in this House will see the wisdom of pursuing such a policy.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I am prepared to co-operate with the other Parties in this House in order to lift public life out of the rut of Party politics and to deal with the problems that threaten the very life of this part of our nation.  We as a Party do not abandon, waive, mitigate or abate in any respect any portion of our policy.  We merely agree to co-operate with other Parties in giving effect to those portions of our policy upon which there is common <Col N="26" /> agreement.  We shall do so honestly, frankly and to the best of our ability, because we believe that that is what the nation wishes us to do and because we believe that is what is best for the nation at this particular time.  We shall, however, maintain our identity and policy as a separate Party and organisation.</P>
    <P>I have the pleasure of knowing Deputy Costello as a colleague for many years and I have no hesitation in recommending him to this House as a man of honour, of integrity and of ability, well fitted to fill the high position for which he has been proposed by the leaders of the two largest Opposition Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The wish of the vast majority of the people as expressed at the General Election just gone by, I think, leaves no doubt in the minds of anybody what form of Government we should have in this thirteenth Dáil.  My Party and I regard the result of the General Election as a vote of censure on a Party that had an over-all majority here and that failed completely to do the things for which the people elected them, things that they should have done and that they could have done.  Nobody in this House is unreasonable enough to expect unreasonable things or impossible things from any Government, but the result of the recent election was definitely a vote of censure on the Fianna Fáil Party for not ending some of the evils and some of the national ills which exist in our midst.  It was a vote of censure particularly on them by the agricultural community for the mismanagement of our basic industry, agriculture, and the many other things connected with it, such as drainage&mdash;a mismanagement which resulted in a flight from the land and a mass emigration from this country unprecedented in its history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, the Clann na Talmhan Party is supporting the proposal that Mr. John A. Costello be elected Taoiseach.  In doing so we believe that inter-Party Government can do great things for this country and I have not the slightest doubt that these things will be done if Mr. Costello is placed at the head of the Government <Col N="27" /> in this House.  He is a man of outstanding ability and we shall all pull together and give him our fullest support in the effort to remedy some of the evils and the ills which exist in this country and to end which not the slightest attempt has been made for quite a long time.  For that reason, I recommend Deputy Costello to this House as the best, most suitable and fitting candidate for the position of Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of this Party, we feel it our duty to give the country an opportunity of being governed by an inter-Party Government. We feel in doing so that we are interpreting the wishes of the people who cast their votes in the elections. We realise that an inter-Party Government is in the nature of an experiment but it is the one way we see at present by which Irishmen of different political Parties can come together, in a spirit of goodwill, to co-operate for the welfare of the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this nation.  I am going to vote for Deputy John A. Costello because I believe he is a man eminently suitable for the highest compliment that can be paid in this country; he is a decent man and he comes of decent people. But, Sir, the House seems to have forgotten one of its most important duties to-day.  The House was supposed to feel doomed by the result of the General Election.  I think it necessary to interpose for the purpose of saying: &ldquo;Doomed be damned&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil is going out and thanks be to God.  I welcome that development because by the action which Dáil Eireann will take to-day, in the name of the Irish people, it will reassert before the world that this country depends on no individual for its existence as a sovereign and independent nation.  I do not experience the slightest trepidation in staking my confidence on the ability of a group of men drawn from various walks of life in this country to form a good Government for our people and to do now the things that urgently require doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that Deputy MacBride contemplates <Col N="28" /> a long postponement of some objectives near his heart, but I am more optimistic than he.  I believe there are events marching in the world to-day in the forefront of which I hope our old friends, the United States of America, will take their stand, and friends, who for us are new, in so far as they have recognised before the world the right of this part of our country to be free, and who I hope will shortly acknowledge the right of the remainder of our country to be rejoined with us&mdash;the British people.  In that movement I foresee the building of a true citadel of liberty where, with every sovereign nation in the world, our nation will be charged to take its place or stay in isolation at the choice of our own people.  For my part, I hope that when that choice falls to be made Ireland, a good soldier in the cause of liberty down through her history, will take her place with those nations who seek to defend the liberty of the world from the greatest threat that has ever challenged it since history was first written.  In accepting that invitation, we may see a sovereign, independent and United Ireland delivered from the nauseating frauds of a dictionary republic sooner than we anticipate.  Call that sovereign State republic, or what you please, sovereign, independent and standing on its own feet it will then surely be; and it will not owe its existence either to the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> or the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica.</i>  We are choosing the difficult way.  We are rejecting to-day the facile freedom dependent upon the rule of one man for the complex and difficult liberty of a Parliamentary democracy operated by those who love their country more than they love their Party.</P>
    <P>There will be pessimists who will hope that we shall fail, but there will be more of those pessimists among the enemies of Ireland outside Ireland than will be found within the country itself because those who hope that we shall fail will hope to see established before the world the fact that Irish people are unable to govern themselves unless led by the paternal hand of a leader. A long history proclaims that that is not true.  What we do here to-day will <Col N="29" /> demonstrate not only to our own people but to all who hate this country that, at a time when one small nation after another in the Europe in which we live has lost its freedom and surrendered its destiny into the hands of one man, this small nation confidently and courageously takes its liberties out of the hands of one man and places them in the safe keeping of a group of democrats who believe that Parliament under a democratic Government is capable of carrying this country through any perils that may confront it in the future.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that those who will constitute this Government of to-morrow must face that task in the knowledge that they are presented with as formidable a task as has ever been presented to an Irish Government in the past.  But my recollection strengthens me in the belief that a Government of Irishmen serving Ireland will be equal to whatever perils may cross our path.  Generations of our people have undertaken the impossible in the past.  They have not failed to date.  Fianna Fáil has left after it a task so formidable for its successors as to daunt all except those unafraid of the impossible.  No merit in any individual here will give him the courage necessary to face his undertaking, but the memory of what has been done in the past will give us faith to face the future in the belief that we can succeed.</P>
    <P>In that faith and under the leadership of Deputy Costello I hope to see a Government formed to-day upon which the generations of the future will look back as the turning point not only in this country but in Europe&mdash;as the day on which a small nation faced with the choice between one-man government and true democracy chose democracy and proved to be right.</P>

      <P>When this chapter of Irish history comes to be written it will carry as its title &ldquo;The Downfall of De Valera&rdquo; because responsible historians of the future will attribute the main cause of that downfall to the desire of the outgoing Taoiseach to concentrate all power in his own hands and to his refusal to share with other Parties the <Col N="30" /> task of building up this country.  We all know that no democratic nation depends for its existence or its future upon the whims of any one man.  Outside that group that the Taoiseach has formed around himself we know there are men in this country who love freedom and justice.  We know there are men in this country who are determined to make a success of government of the Irish people by the Irish people.  The election which brought into existence this 13th Dáil was an election called without justification and in a sense of utter irresponsibility.  Just as King Herod sought to destroy an Infant rival so Eamon de Valera sought to destroy a new Party in the field.  He failed to destroy that Party completely but he has succeeded in destroying his own. When I tried to instil into the mind of that senile delinquent, the Minister for Local Government, some sense of responsibility and when I reminded him of the danger of a mid-winter election which would inflict a grave injustice on a large section of the rural population by depriving them of their right to vote I was told by that gentleman that I was suffering from cold feet.  He will have plenty of time now to cool his own feet and I suppose that to-day he bitterly regrets that he did not try to cool the feet of his chief when that gentleman started pawing the ground looking for fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken a stand consistently in this House since 1939; I have never deviated from that stand.  I believe that this is a democratic country.  I believe that under the system of proportional representation which is enshrined in our Constitution and which the Taoiseach is unable to uproot from that Constitution, every section of the people has a right to send its representatives to this House and the system of proportional representation provides that each section shall get representation in proportion to the amount of support which it receives from the electors.  Now, I want to ask the Fianna Fáil Party for the last time: if a Government is formed by the majority of this House, will the Fianna Fáil Party be prepared to take their place in that Government and co-operate in it as a Party?  I do <Col N="31" /> not believe in a Government confined to one Party.  I believe in carrying the system of proportional representation to its logical conclusion and having in this country a Government of all Parties.  The Fianna Fáil Party, in recent weeks, through their Leader have frequently declared that they will not co-operate with other Parties. They have frequently declared that they will not take office until they are returned to power as one Party.  But, during his political career, the Taoiseach has eaten enough of his own words to choke an elephant and it would not do him any harm if he were to eat his words again and agree to come into a Government under the leadership of Deputy John Costello.</P>
    <P>This nation is facing one of the most serious periods in its existence. Economic problems of the gravest nature confront us.  The solution of these economic problems demands that the best brains in the nation and the best brains in the House should be concentrated upon the tasks of government. The solution of these problems demands the whole-hearted co-operation of the Parties represented in this House.  I read in one of our leading daily newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent,</i> an article which endorsed the view which I have so frequently expressed.  In that article the paper said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely it is well worth trying how far this country can get by pulling together rather than by pulling against one another.  A national Government, and by this we mean a Government in which every group, including Fianna Fáil, should be represented, would command that respect, confidence and goodwill which will be so valuable an asset in the work that has to be taken in hand.  No Party has got a mandate from the people; but all Parties have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All Parties have been instructed by the people in the clearest possible way to co-operate, inasmuch as no Party has been given a majority.  For weeks the song has been dinned into our ears: &ldquo;Dev can do everything better than <Col N="32" /> they can&mdash;yes, he can&rdquo;, but the people have answered: &ldquo;No, he cannot&rdquo;, and the people having so answered, I think it is desirable that Fianna Fáil should accept the will of the people and should co-operate in a really and truly national Government representative of all Parties.  I am making that plea in a spirit of sincerity, in the sincere desire to see the best thing possible done for this country.  Some may say that that is an idealistic proposal.  I do not think that anybody, even their worst enemies, will describe the people who run the <i>Irish Independent</i> as starryeyed dreamers.  They are practical men and, having made a sound suggestion, I hold that we would be wise in adopting it.</P>
    <P>The advantage of an all-Party Government is that you can have the experience and assistance of all Parties. In addition to that, an all-Party Government, representative of all Parties, has a definite unifying influence.  We need that influence in a nation such as ours, in a new State such as ours. Other countries, older countries, with long traditions of self-government can indulge in the pastime of Party strife. But our country, struggling as a small democracy in the most difficult period of the world's history for democracy, cannot afford the luxury of Party strife.  Through the unifying influence of all being joined together in the one Government we can help to strengthen the national fabric.  We can give confidence to minorities, particularly the minority who are still excluded from the control of our national Government. We can help to inspire confidence amongst those people by showing them that we are capable of doing justice to and giving the fullest possible rights to every minority.</P>
    <P>We have to be logical in regard to this question.  If you claim to have the right, as the Fianna Fáil Party claimed for the past 16 years, to exclude every other Party from the Government, it would be only a small step to go further and exclude minority Parties from the Dáil.  If minorities have a right to representation in the Dáil, in the national Parliament, they have an equal right to representation in the <Col N="33" /> Government.  The people who rule in the totalitarian States would probably say that a Government in which all Parties have representation is fantastically idealistic.  We have found that in all the democratic countries it has worked, and there is no reason why the idea which I am putting before the House will not work.  There is no reason why a Government representative of all Parties cannot work effectively for the solution of our national problems.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the confidence of our people should be established.  It is desirable that the co-operation of every section of our people should be secured.  It is not desirable that the Government which will be formed to-day will have to face an organised opposition whose aim will be to discredit it in every possible way.  That would not be in the best national interests.  We can, if we are wise to-day, lay the foundation of a system of Government which will endure, a system of Government which will be as typical of our country as the system of Government that prevails in Switzerland and that has been so long associated with Switzerland is typical of that country.  That system has succeeded in Switzerland for many years.</P>
    <P>There are two logical courses before us.  We must adopt either this idea of representation of all Parties or abolish the system of proportional representation. The two things do not fit; the system by which the people elected a Dáil, the system of proportional representation, does not fit in with the idea of Party Government.  We must abolish either one or the other and I am hoping that to-day we will, for all time, abolish the idea of Party Government in this country.</P>

      <P>As a newcomer to the House, I realise that in speaking now I am incurring grave risks. Through lack of experience, I may be in danger of wandering in my remarks. Not being accustomed to Parliamentary procedure, I shall have to rely more or less on chance that I shall keep within the rules of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> As an Independent, I rise to make a last-minute appeal for unity.  I do so by the direction of the Party that put me forward in the election.  In deference to the wishes of the members of that Party, I make an appeal for an all-Party Government.  It is obvious to everyone that, as a result of the election, no one Party is in a position to form a Government.  In the circumstances, a Government must be formed by a combination of two or more Parties.  Obviously, an all-Party Government would have a decided advantage over a Government formed by a number of Parties.</P>
    <P>The position before the country to-day is serious.  The prospects of-its survival, if the spirit that has remained since the civil war is carried on, are not very bright.  Those who have the future of the country at heart take a very serious view of the conditions that now exist.  I do not think I could do better, in order to bring the seriousness of the position to the notice of the people, than by quoting an extract from the Lenten Pastoral of Most Rev. Dr. McNamee, Bishop of Ardagh:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Concomitant with the continued stream of emigration, and, scarcely less menacing to the future of our country, the extraordinary rush in recent years to sell out houses and lands and to abandon homesteads that had been a family possession and pride for generations....  For these grave threats to the very existence of the nation, the rising tide of emigration and the steady flight from the land, some remedy must be found and found quickly.  Otherwise we shall have to resign ourselves to the dark pessimism of those who hold that Ireland is already a dying nation, bereft of faith in the future and the will to live.  If that were so, it would matter little what our political status would be, or by what political designation it would be called.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those few words put very clearly the seriousness of the position with which this House is faced.  It requires courage and self-sacrifice to face up to that position but, with goodwill among all Parties, there is no reason why our difficulties should not be overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> I make a last minute appeal for peace in the hope that the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, will even now give the word that will put his Party in with other groups in the formation of a national Government.  I am doing this by the direction of my constituents.  I hope no one will say that this is impossible. Where there is a will there is a way. There is no reason why this should not be done.  If it is done, we can face the future in a happy mood, in the thought that Ireland will have the services of all her sons in the trying period that lies ahead.  I would be glad if the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, will assure the House that he and his Party will be willing to throw in their lot with the other groups.  Failing such an assurance, my directions are to vote for the formation of a Government composed of all the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be the consequences of the proposed alignment of Parties, it will definitely be the result of our proportional representation system.  Proportional representation was introduced here many years ago.  Theoretically it is sound and, down the years, it has been accepted as a good method of election.  It has, indeed, become part of our Constitution. That was no hasty decision; it was a decision arrived at after many years of experience.  The people were appealed to, to return a strong party Government; but the election did not result that way.  I submit that that position is due largely to the principles embodied in the system of proportional representation, which has been stabilised in our Constitution.  Yet, I believe that what was good for all the years up to now, what was accepted as democratically sound, even if it is inconvenient at such a stage as this, should be accepted as a good, sound method of representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the election has created a situation here which is not entirely unique.  Similar situations developed in the past.  They have been met in various ways; on some occasions they have been met by the major Party <Col N="36" /> forming a Government with the assistance of smaller Parties.</P>
    <P>This occasion is unique in so far as the smaller Parties have combined and, having a majority, have determined to form a Government.  All that is quite within the rights conferred by the Constitution.  It is the outcome of the system of proportional representation which aims at giving representation to minorities.  If that principle be right at the beginning, then its embodiment in its entirety is also right if smaller bodies come together and, as such, carry on the government of the State. The only thing that creates a sensation on this occasion is the fact that that proposition&mdash;the logical and reasonable conclusion to our system of election&mdash; is now for the first time being put into effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly of Cavan has made an appeal that all Parties should combine at this stage.  That, of course, would be the ideal position, but, remember, an Opposition is always required, no matter what form of Government you have.  I am not at all satisfied that a unanimous combination of all Parties would, in itself, make the best Government.  I realise, however, that we are dealing with a situation at the present time that may call for extraordinary valour.  It has been stated by responsible people not only in this House but outside of it&mdash; by people inside and outside of England and outside of Europe&mdash;that a very extraordinary situation exists in the world at the present time.  We see the menace there is to Europe which, apparently, is going to be the battle-field.  That battle-field has been prepared by countries outside of Europe.  We see the internal position in the case of our next-door neighbour &mdash;England.  We see how her financial foundations are tottering and are being shattered in the present crisis.  We have our leaders&mdash;the Pope, the Irish Hierarchy and other responsible people &mdash;teaching us and telling us of the menace that confronts us.  Perhaps, this is the time when such a gesture should be made for the first time in the history of this State-the gesture to have a Government representative of all Parties so that we might be able <Col N="37" /> to meet that menace.  To the simplest person, that menace must be obvious. I am not suggesting that at any time of crisis in this country Parties have not combined to indicate that they were prepared to act as a united force to meet any menace that might arise. Should such a situation develop in the future, I have no doubt unity will again make itself manifest.  I say that because there are men in the different Parties in this House who have already given evidence of their unselfishness and of their willingness to sacrifice themselves in the interests of their country.  They may be divided for the time being on Party policies, but where this nation's interests are concerned we can say to the world that they are not governed by foreign or by international interests.  Our interests are entirely controlled, and centred in the defence of our country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this juncture I may sound the note of appeal and of warning that we are going to have an experiment in Government.  It might also be well if we had a further experiment by one group, representative of all Parties, but perhaps one experiment at a time is sufficient.  Members of this House have to interpret, according to their lights, the authority which they received when they were elected to it. I have to interpret mine.  I have been returned to this House as an Independent Deputy.  I recognise full well that I was returned by a majority of people who have Fianna Fáil leanings.  They returned me contrary to the advice of the leaders of Fianna Fáil who, quite definitely, did me a serious wrong, as far as they were concerned, by refusing me an investigation.  I have no leanings towards the Leader of Fianna Fáil, but my personal feelings in the matter must be sunk in spite of his effort to destroy me and to malign me, and to put an imputation on my character and on my children's characters.  I worked for years in Leitrim and outside of it in the building up of Fianna Fáil and, in earlier years, of Sinn Féin, yet in spite of all these implications a sufficient number of people who still believe in Eamon de Valera as Leader and in his Fianna Fáil policy repudiated his advice and <Col N="38" /> backed my return as a member of this House.  Their ambition, however, is that Eamon de Valera should still be Leader.  Personally, I do not think so, but I must interpret the wishes of the people who elected me and I am going to give expression to them to-day.  I am, accordingly, going to vote for Eamon de Valera.  I am not asking too much, I think, if I support the claim put forward by Deputy O'Reilly, of Cavan, namely, that the Fianna Fáil Party should take the same view as that expressed by the Deputy and enter into an agreement with the other Parties at this stage.  I suggest they should do that in view of the present world situation which is so serious.  The suggestion is that they should agree on the formation of one common Government for this country, thereby setting an example to the whole world.  If that were done it might have the effect of creating a better feeling amongst those countries which are now drifting so widely apart and are preparing for the next world war.  Such a gesture, if acted upon, might have a very good effect indeed.</P>
    <P>The new proposal made on behalf of the different Parties for the formation of a Government is quite within the Constitution and in accordance with the method of election enshrined in the Constitution.  It is really a good experiment, and I hope it will be successful. I have no animosity towards that proposal. As I have said, I believe that the policy of Fianna Fáil was good.  It was fundamentally good.  It gave us a secure Government and encouraged industry. It encouraged, as far as possible, enterprise, and did its best within the limits of the resources of this State, to provide social services for the most necessitous sections of our people.  If it is possible for another Party to do these things better, then I say welcome to that new Party.  I will watch with interest the setting up of a joint programme by combined Parties in this Dáil.  If that policy is generally sound, if it can protect and develop and give the necessary stimulus to our agricultural and industrial production, if it can improve upon the present position, it will be a God-send.  I hope it will improve, above all things, one section <Col N="39" /> of the community whom I represent&mdash; for whom I have always spoken, but my words have fallen on deaf ears in this House&mdash;the victims of the conquest in the past, the refugees who were driven before the Cromwellian and Elizabethan conquerors.  They have never been redeemed from their position, and shame on the national Governments for their neglect.  There is no country that has not, as its first consideration, given attention to the refugees. The people who were driven from their homes in the early conquests back into the bogs of Connaught, Clare and Kerry have been neglected. There is a lot of patriotism and drumbeating now about the Six Counties and the neglect of the partitioned part of the country, but more necessitous and more imminent was the necessity, according to justice, to attend to the wounded soldiers or refugees driven from their homes by the conquerors in the past, under terrible conditions, and their successors forced to live still under terrible conditions.</P>
    <P>If a Party forms a Government here that will embody a scheme to deal with that national outrage, it will receive from me sincere sympathy and help.  As things look, with a proposed government grouping of Parties coming to power, I will watch with interest their programme.  I will watch to see how far they can embody schemes to make better conditions for the people who are poor and have been neglected.  In the meantime, I repeat that the policy of Fianna Fáil has been sound and has given confidence and proper results. Many people will be sorry if they are turned out of office, as they were well led, generally, in national and international matters.  I have had to complain of Deputy Eamon de Valera's treatment of me, but it is no reason why I should say he has not proven to be a worthy leader of this country.  In so far as public opinion goes, judged from the size of his Party, he is still regarded as the first preference as leader.  It is a pity that he cannot see his way, after all these years, to sacrifice his will by having his Party included in any Government that may be to-day born.</P>

      <P>I feel that the electorate who voted for me and supported me did not give me a mandate to approve of Deputy Costello's selection as Taoiseach.  At the same time, I have respect for that selection, and if Deputy Costello is approved of as a Taoiseach for this nation in this Parliament, I shall do my utmost to co-operate with his Government and so make it possible for each Ministry under his control to do good work for the nation.  I personally do not approve and did not intend to support Deputy Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach, as in supporting him I feel that I would have supported the Leader of a Government which had neglected my constituency for the past four years.  Several speakers have referred to emigration and to the neglect of the land.  I regret that, in so far as my constituency is concerned, nothing has been done, and there has been a wholesale flight from the land and from the countryside, particularly in the poorer and remote districts of South Kerry.  As far as I can see, Government Ministers resident in Dublin consider Dublin as Ireland. They forget that we exist and that there are such places as Kerry, Cork, Clare and Donegal.  Remembering what has happened in the past four years, I could not personally support Deputy Eamon de Valera as representing that régime and that Government. However, I have to bear in mind that a large number of people who sent me here would wish me to support him and, in deference to their wishes, I shall support him.  I regard myself as their servant from South Kerry and I am simply acting on their behalf and on behalf of the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I join with Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Maguire in appealing to Deputy Eamon de Valera, if he can still see his way to do it, to join in a national Government.  This inter-Party system is something new.  It is not correct to call it &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; Government, the proper name for it is a group system, a sort of bargain system, putting forward a national programme for all Parties to back, irrespective of the Party to which they belong, selecting the ablest men in each Party.  If that can be done, it will be a <Col N="41" /> great day for this country and this Parliament. I make my appeal to all, in a spirit of conciliation and goodwill. Whoever is Taoiseach, I shall be faithful to his Government and assist him on behalf of the people who sent me here and I hope that the new Government will show results and be an asset to the nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Reilly, of Cavan, struck a new note and gave expression to a thought which was running through many minds as well as his own.  When Deputy Cogan was speaking and asked Deputy Eamon de Valera if he were prepared to share in a national or coalition Government he shook his head in dissent on two occasions.  Are we to take that shaking of his head to mean that he is not prepared to come into a coalition or national Government and that he is standing by the speeches he and some of his followers made during the election campaign, that he would share responsibility with no other group or section?  If we could have an assurance from him on that point, it would clear matters before the whole country.  I would ask him to give expression to his thoughts as well as shaking his head in dissent and say what he meant by it when Deputy Cogan asked him if he would share in another Government.  If we can get from him on that point what his views are for the future Government, it will clear the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I support to the full the <Col N="42" /> nomination of Mr. Costello and I congratulate the groups on having a man like him to go forward, a man who has made great sacrifices and given up his prospects in his profession for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope, with other speakers, that no matter what Government is in power, they will do something to stop the flight from the land and the emigration from the cities; to prevent those men who are discharged and who have been discharged from the National Army within the past two years from finding a new home across the water.  I think that something ought to be done in that direction.  As far as I know, the Government have failed miserably in their intent to deal with the unemployment brought about by the discharge from the Army. There is no use burying our heads in the sand and feeling that everything is well and that prosperity is here.  Prosperity is not here.  Depression has set in, unemployment has become too plentiful to be good for the country and the British Passport Office is beginning to get busy again.  I think that no matter what Government is in power, if they fail in their duty to give employment, and remunerative employment, to their citizens, they have failed hopelessly.  I support the election of Deputy Costello as Taoiseach and will give him every help I can, with the other Parties, to bring prosperity to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my deep appreciation of the honour that has been conferred upon me by the vote which has just been taken.  This position was not sought by me nor wished for by me in any way.  I would like to make it clear to this House and to the country that I lent neither my name nor my personality to any political manoeuvre.  I consented to this nomination at the request of a number of Parties who felt that the interests of the country required that there should be an inter-Party Government and that the Prime Minister of that Government should occupy a position in political life detached from the controversial bitternesses of the past.  It was in response to the urgent desires of all those Parties that I laid aside my own personal interests in order that this should come about.</P>
      <P>I feel that there are very onerous tasks in front of the new Government which must now be formed.  I will have to shoulder serious responsibilities for which I am in no way fitted.  At the same time I am quite confident, from my contacts and knowledge of the men who are joining in this Government, that everybody will work for one purpose and one purpose alone, namely, the good of all sections of the people.</P>
      <P>I know, too, that there are on the benches opposite me men of patriotism, honesty and courage, and I think that the country expects from them that they will give this new Government support and help and if that is accorded to us I think we can look forward with some hope and considerable confidence to the solution of some of the more pressing evils which afflict our country to-day.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Dáil adjourn until 7 o'clock this evening.</P>

    <P>I intend to assign Deputy William Norton, if approved, to the Department of Social Welfare and also to nominate him to be the Tánaiste; Deputy General Richard Mulcahy to the Department of Education; Deputy Seán MacBride to the Department of External Affairs; Deputy Joseph Blowick to the Department of Lands; Deputy James Everett to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; Deputy James M.

Browne to the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather surprising that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity given to him by this motion to inform the Dáil and the country on many matters upon which information is required.  I am sure he is aware that many statements made during the election campaign by representatives of the various Parties forming the Government Coalition have aroused considerable anxiety in the country.  It is desirable that that anxiety should be relieved, if it can be relieved, as quickly as possible.  We are told there have been no bargains but it is, I think, not a secret that many discussions have taken place between the representatives of the various Coalition Parties in the past few days and, following these discussions, vague general statements were issued indicating the matters upon which agreement was reached.  I am quite sure that the Taoiseach or the Deputies whom he is proposing to nominate as members of the Government cannot hope to keep secret any <Col N="50" /> of the other matters that were discussed in those negotiations, if they have a bearing upon public policy.  It is clearly desirable that the fullest possible information should be given as quickly as possible upon the matters concerning which anxiety exists, anxiety which can be relieved, if at all, only by a clear statement of the Government's intentions.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may help the Taoiseach or Deputy Mulcahy, whoever is the most authoritative spokesman of the proposed new Government, by asking some questions.  We are told, for example, that this Government is not a coalition Government, that it is an inter-Party Government.  I want to know, is it intended to convey a distinction?  So far as the public are aware, the members of the Labour Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party, the Clann na Talmhan Party and the National Labour Party have joined with Fine Gael to form a coalition Government under a Fine Gael Taoiseach.  Whether that Government is intended to act, as Governments have acted here in the past, with collective responsibility, is a matter about which some doubt has been created by the emphasis upon the term &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;. Is it intended that this Government will have collective responsibility, that the members of it will each have responsibility in public and to the Dáil for every act of every member of it? That is the obligation, as I understand it, of the Constitution and it certainly has been the practice here in the past. It may be that this term &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; is intended to convey something different from a coalition.  If so, that fact should be stated.  Up to the present the term &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; has been used, apparently, merely for the purpose of avoiding the use of the word &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why those who have joined with Fine Gael to form a Government should object to being described as being in coalition with Fine Gael but, if they do so object, will they tell us why?  If it is intended to convey that there is a difference between a coalition Government and an inter-Party Government, then, what precisely is the difference?  It has been suggested that the use of the term <Col N="51" />&ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; means that collective responsibility will not apply, that the Government will not meet as a team of Ministers to consider the matters that will inevitably come up for decision and to arrive at decisions in the normal way after discussion; that, instead, the members nominated from the different Parties will be merely representatives of their Parties and will be unable to give any decision at Government meetings until they have consulted their Parties.  If that is intended to be the meaning to be attached to the term &ldquo;inter-Party,&rdquo; that should be made clear because it suggests a departure of a major kind from our normal constitutional practice and the normal method of good government.</P>
    <P>It may be that the term &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo; is merely used as a means of deceiving people as to what exactly is taking place.  I think that cannot be so because it has been given such prominence in the publicity statements issued to the Press and in the course of the discussion here this afternoon that it seems that the members of the proposed Government and the Deputies who support them attach some importance to it.  What is that importance? Are the persons proposed as members of the Government becoming members of a Cabinet which will have collective responsibility?  Will they be able to act upon their own judgment and after consultation with their Cabinet colleagues or will they be required by the arrangements that were arrived at in the secret discussions to report back to their Parties and get the approval of their Parties before intimating a decision to Cabinet meetings?  That is one question which I think should be answered.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies opposite have adverted to the fact that considerable significance has been attached to the emphasis which they have placed upon the term &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo;.  If they are not aware of it, then I am making them aware of it and I am asking them to explain precisely the manner in which it is proposed that this Government, when elected by the Dáil, will act.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters <Col N="52" /> upon which I think it is very desirable that a speedy declaration of the policy of the Government should be made.  I will put the question of industrial development first because it is the activity with which I was personally most closely associated.  This is, so far as we know up to the present, a Fine Gael Government with certain members of it drawn from other Parties in coalition with Fine Gael.  The Fine Gael industrial policy in the past has left this country a legacy of ruined mills and derelict factories.  There is perhaps a justifiable anxiety that history is going to repeat itself.  Those who took the responsibility of putting a Fine Gael Government again into office, and a Fine Gael Deputy again into the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce, should assure us that they have got some undertakings in these secret negotiations that history is not going to repeat itself, in that regard, that the policy which Fine Gael applied when they were in office before is not going to be applied again and that we shall not have another record industrial decline which was not remedied until Fine Gael was removed from office in 1932.</P>
    <P>This Government has taken over a country which has a strong and growing industrial organisation.  It is, I think, desirable to put on record that we almost alone&mdash;I think there is one other country besides Ireland&mdash;have already achieved an expansion in the volume of industrial production greater than pre-war.  There are many, very many thousands of workers in industrial employment who got that employment by reason of the industrial policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government, who want some assurance, and who should get some assurance, that the policy which gave them their jobs, and which brought into existence the industries in which they are employed, is going to be maintained.  I know that some of them think that the mere fact that many of these new industries were established under Fianna Fáil auspices and were regarded as proof of the success of the Fianna Fáil policy, may engender hostility towards them in the minds of the Fine Gael members of the proposed new Government.  I think that if that policy is not going to be <Col N="53" /> followed, if there is to be no change in the general industrial position, it is desirable that a clear statement to that effect should be made soon.  I should have thought that the Leader of the Government would have realised the necessity for such a statement and would have taken advantage of this particular motion to have made it to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are at the present time a very large number of proposals for the establishment here of new industries on the files of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There are a number of new factories building at the present time and many new factories scheduled to begin this year.  Because of doubt as to the policy of the Government that might result from the election, many of these plans are going slow. Naturally enough those who have taken the responsibility of promoting and financing them, have been disposed to mark time until the elections were over, until this meeting of the Dáil had taken place and the personnel and the policy of the Government were known.  They will continue to go slow and mark time with their plans unless they are given through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, or some authoritative spokesman of the Government a clear statement of policy that will encourage them to go ahead.  They will require an assurance on the question of protection.  It is, I admit, true that many industries do not require protection now.  Probably in the circumstances that will exist for some years ahead, protection of the kind given before the war will not be necessary in many cases but no person will undertake to finance a substantial longterm industrial project, unless he has some assurance that, if international conditions change, and if the economic circumstances that existed before the war reappear, he will get the assistance of protection from the Government.  It is on that matter that doubt exists and I am sure every member of the proposed Government and every Deputy in the benches opposite realises there is reason for these doubts having regard to the inglorious record of Fine Gael in the industrial field when they were previously in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The same remarks apply to agriculture. I was not merely Minister for Industry and Commerce but also Minister for Supplies during the war, and since the war came to an end, I have carried on the functions which were formerly those of the Minister for Supplies.  One essential commodity concerning which I have had most anxiety during recent months was wheat.  Everybody in this House knows that we had a very bad wheat harvest last year.  The total yield of the wheat crop delivered to the flour mills was only half the yield of the previous year.  The circumstances which reduced our yield affected the harvest in all countries so that we had very considerable difficulty in arranging for the importation of wheat in sufficient quantities to maintain the present bread ration.  It is only in the present week that arrangements were concluded, or were brought almost to a conclusion, that satisfied me that the wheat ration was safe until the end of the cereal year.  I use the word &ldquo;cereal year,&rdquo; in the international sense, that is until the end of June.  It will probably be safe after the end of June, assuming that the international wheat agreement which is now being negotiated, is successfully concluded and assuming that we ourselves grow the maximum acreage of wheat possible.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the anti-wheat policy of Fine Gael and to the prejudiced opposition to wheat growing of the proposed Minister for Agriculture, I think the House should get some assurance that the necessary inducements to ensure the cultivation of the maximum acreage of wheat this year will be given.  Unless we grow the maximum acreage of wheat&mdash;and that is a matter that has to be determined in the next few weeks&mdash;there is no possibility of abolishing the bread ration after next harvest.  It might even be difficult to maintain the existing ration although the provisions of the international wheat agreement would appear not to be unfavourable to us from that point of view.</P>
    <P>It appears obvious from present facts that we cannot hope to abolish bread rationing unless we ourselves <Col N="55" /> produce in this country substantially more wheat than we produced last year.  Our experience has been that it cannot be ensured without, not merely considerable price inducements but also some element of compulsion.  We were always anxious to get rid of the element of compulsion but up to the present we were unable to effect production here of the quantity of wheat necessary to satisfy our own requirements, without it.  If it can be secured without compulsion, well and good, but clearly there is a responsibility on the new Government to take all steps necessary to ensure that we shall get the maximum acreage of wheat grown, because on it depends the possibility of getting rid of bread rationing after the next harvest.</P>
    <P>The same applies as regards sugar. Again we have to take into account the fact that the proposed new Minister for Agriculture was a strong opponent of the policy of growing sugar beet for manufacture into sugar in this country. I do not know if any assurances have been got from him by his proposed colleagues in the new Government that he will change his outlook.  It is true that there is available in stock enough sugar to maintain the ration until the next sugar beet harvest.  There is enough, and a little over, because it was necessary always to carry a certain working stock against possibilities of delay in the manufacture of sugar such as occurred in previous years.  It is possible to buy sugar.</P>
    <P>It is true that the world sugar situation has improved and it is now possible to buy sugar for dollars at a price which is comparable to our own or to buy it for sterling at a price higher than our own.  It is, I think, desirable that the supply of sugar should be increased so that the ration can be either increased or rationing abolished altogether.  Measures to that end can be taken quickly if the Government is prepared to make available the foreign exchange required in order to purchase sugar abroad.  But there is no possibility of getting enough sugar to fill all our own requirements unless we produce the bulk of it ourselves; and that is dependent upon the policy the Government <Col N="56" /> is going to follow in relation to this matter of growing sugar beet.</P>
    <P>In the case of butter it will be in the memory of some Deputies here that when Fianna Fáil came into office our dairying industry was on the point of extinction and it took very substantial Government subsidies and other measures of a rather drastic kind to revive the dairying industry in the years before the war.  During the war butter production declined for causes which are, I think, well known to responsible Deputies.  I am glad to be able to report that in the month of January, 1948, the total production of butter was more than double the production in the month of January, 1947. If that improvement in production can be maintained it should be possible at an early date to increase the present six-ounce ration.  Deputies may scoff at the present butter ration but let them not forget that it is the largest in Europe.  So far as most of our rations are concerned they are larger than in any other country in Europe.  If the new Government can maintain as good a record as that during whatever period they are in office they will have something to boast about when they relinquish it.</P>
    <P>What I have said about the anxiety in the minds of the public arising out of the past records of some members of the proposed new Government and the recent statements made by some new members applies particularly in the realm of finance.  We have had a number of crazy and hazy ideas voiced on public platforms by people who pose as experts in public finance.  There is no sphere in which reaction can be quicker than in the sphere of finance where hazy and crazy financial ideas are concerned.  Very real damage can be done to this country in the immediate future if the idea gets abroad that this new Government is committed through any secret understanding to apply any of the ideas advocated by some of the spokesmen of the Coalition Parties during the election campaign. Clearly it is desirable that anxiety on that score should be removed&mdash;if it can be removed&mdash;by a clear and unequivocal statement from the proposed new Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The fact that Deputy Mulcahy is to be Minister for Education is at least some assurance that a policy hostile to the revival of Irish in the schools, as has been expressed by some of his new colleagues, is not likely to be the policy of the Government of which he is now a member.  I hope, however, that he will give a clear indication as to that fact at the earliest possible moment because there are, as he knows, in his own Party members who are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. Deputy Mulcahy will be honest enough to admit that there are many people who are not as fluent in Irish as he is but who are nevertheless sincere in their desire to promote the revival of Irish through the schools; and I think there are many people who are, perhaps, as fluent as he is who are not. The Deputy's taunt really goes wide of the issue.  He knows that there are in his Party people who are hostile to the idea of reviving the Irish language.  He knows that his Party was supported in the election by newspapers which are hostile to the revival of the Irish language.  He knows that the Labour Party is indifferent and Clann na Poblachta hostile to the revival of Irish through the schools.  It is obviously desirable that the policy of the Government in this respect, if the Government has a policy, should be made known as soon as possible.</P>

They are now the cock-shots in this Dáil.  They have taken not merely office but responsibilities and they are going to be held to their responsibilities as far as it is in our power so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of Deputies who were elected because of their ability to parade before the public defects in our economic organisation and social <Col N="58" /> system, but who gave very little indication of any ability on their part to plan constructively in order to remedy those defects.  They will not be able to get away with it now.  Every single Deputy opposite, responsible and irresponsible, is going to be held to account for what this Government does or does not do.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite are perhaps forgetful of the fact that they have now acquired the dignity of membership of a Government.  They are still inclined to behave like a lot of paid hecklers at a public meeting. You must remember that you have now acquired not only dignified offices but also responsibilities.  On these questions you are accountable to the Dáil in the first instance and to the public in the second instance.  You will not escape these questions which are being asked here by either interruptions or laughter.  These questions will continue to be asked until they are answered.</P>
      <P>There are other matters of supply concerning which I would like to make some comment.  So far as tea is concerned there is at the present time enough tea in the country to abolish rationing.  The problem there is a financial one.  Tea, as the Deputies know, is heavily subsidised.  To abolish rationing would mean an additional Government subsidy of close on £1,500,000.  The tea is there.  So far as I have had responsibility for ensuring supplies in this country I can say now that there is enough tea in the country to abolish rationing, or to remove many of the restrictions upon the use of tea, or to increase the present ounce-and-ahalf ration to two ounces.  Any step taken, however, to release more tea at the present price is going to involve a very heavy additional subsidy and that is a problem for a Government which has committed itself to a reduction in taxation of £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is not true so far as petroleum products are concerned.  In the sphere of petroleum products new difficulties are now arising which may be of serious import to us in the course of the year.  Some restrictions have been <Col N="59" /> imposed on the shipment of petroleum products from the United States of America.  Apart from exchange difficulties, which were limiting purchases in that quarter of the world, a scarcity has developed everywhere and my successor as Minister for Industry and Commerce will need to give the problem very urgent attention.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other problems which I am leaving to him.  Most of them are problems resulting from the fact that efforts to accumulate stocks have been rather more successful than otherwise.  In particular I want to refer to fuel.  We have on hands a very large stock of American coal.  At the present rate of disbursement there will still be large stocks on hands next winter.  There is about a ten years' supply of firewood at the present rate of usage.  In that regard a particularly acute problem is now coming to a head. There are a large number of people engaged in this business of felling and hauling firewood.  Many are Army officers and soldiers who spent their gratuities on the purchase of lorries. That business must stop if for no other reason than the physical difficulty of finding further storage space for timber. All the storage space rented by Fuel Importers, Limited, is full.  If this hauling of firewood must cease then these men have no other haulage business in which they can legitimately engage.  It may be that a suggestion will be put forward to amend the Transport Act so as to give them the right to engage in public haulage of other kinds.</P>
    <P>If that is done a much more serious problem will arise in relation to our railways.  I saw statements made by some of the Coalition Deputies during the election to the effect that the railways were making vast profits for their private shareholders.  The railway system of Córas Iompair Éireann last year lost £1,000,000.  If there is any substantial expansion in the number of lorries engaged in the road haulage of merchandise the future of the railway system will be in very grave jeopardy.  There is, therefore, no easy solution of the problem to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> A similar situation exists in relation to turf.  It is true that turf is still rationed, but it is rationed solely because of the subsidy arrangement. The price of turf in the eastern part of the country is subsidised.  The justification for the maintenance of the subsidy was that turf was rationed in that area.  In the rest of the country turf was unsubsidised and unrationed. Now there are ample supplies of turf and rationing could be abolished, subject to the adjustment of the price or the subsidy arrangement relating to price.  There is, however, in the dumps of Fuel Importers Limited enough turf at the present rate of distribution to last until the winter of 1949.</P>
    <P>I think that my successor will be very relieved to know that he has no immediate fuel supply difficulties to encounter.  But he will have problems to meet in relation to stocks which have been accumulated and which constitute a safeguard for the people of the country.  Perhaps these turf dumps and timber fuel dumps may be a useful reserve to have in the event of some interruption in coal supplies from Great Britain such as might follow if there was a strike in the British mines.  But it is necessary to remember that they will not keep indefinitely.  Turf deteriorates, and timber deteriorates even more rapidly than turf, and, clearly, the stocks must be disposed of before they become useless.</P>
    <P>I note in the rather vague and generalised statement issued on behalf of the coalitionist Parties that they are proposing to embark on a housing drive, upon arterial drainage, and upon the building of hospitals and sanatoria. I want to tell them that, so far as these activities are concerned, the only thing they have to do is to stand aside and let the work go on.  All the necessary legislation has been passed, all the plans have been made and work is in progress.  They will be able to show at the end of whatever period they are in office considerable development in the housing programme, in the construction of hospitals and sanatoria and in arterial drainage if they merely do not interfere with the work in progress. They will certainly need no new legislation <Col N="61" /> or no new financial arrangements to ensure that activities in these fields will proceed to the maximum extent to which the resources of the nation permit.</P>

      <P>On the contrary.  I say that all the plans have been made and all the legislation has been passed to permit of the production of houses at the maximum rate of which the building industry is capable.  There is a limiting factor which might engage the attention of the Government.  Perhaps this Government will be able to do something more about it than we were. The limiting factor is skilled labour and the limitation on the supply of skilled labour is very largely due to the restrictive apprenticeship rules operated by the craft unions.  In a number of these trades the rate of admission of apprentices to the crafts is not sufficient to replace the existing number of craftsmen, assuming a normal life of 20 or 25 years for skilled craftsmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.  I was speaking of dwellinghouses.  At present work is proceeding at the maximum rate which the building industry is capable of undertaking.  If there is expansion in the output, it will only be because of expansion in the resources of the building industry and, particularly, its resources of skilled workers. There are, of course, some supply difficulties left.  Cement was a particular problem and is still a problem.  In our time we succeeded in establishing here two cement factories.  These factories <Col N="62" /> were designed with a capacity considerably in excess of the estimated requirements of the country in regard to cement.  In fact, we had over a number of years an export trade in cement. Now, however, the demand for cement has expanded to a stage at which the total capacity of the factories is inadequate to meet it.  Clearly, their capacity must be increased.  There is little prospect of importing cement from abroad.  If cement could be got, it would be very much dearer than the home-produced cement.  But cement is a scarce commodity throughout the world and the only certainty of an increased supply will follow upon expansion of our own production.</P>
      <P>The cement company operates now under a licence given under the Cement Act.  I think the company is quite willing to have that Act repealed and to operate any other industry without special facilities.  I think my successor will be able to induce the company to expand the capacity of its plant, or, alternatively, to make arrangements with somebody else to establish additional factories.  Clearly, there will be a restriction on the quantity of cement available for some time because, with the best will in the world, it will take a number of months, perhaps more than a year, to build a new factory and to get it into production.</P>
      <P>What I have said about housing applies also to the building of hospitals and sanatoria.  Again, all the legislation has been prepared, the finances have been arranged, the plans have been made and the work is on, and there is little to be done by any Minister in that regard except to let that work proceed.  That is true also of arterial drainage.  The Brosna drainage scheme is ready to be begun.  Work is, I think, about to start in the near future.  The plans for five other catchment areas have been made.  The necessary financial arrangements for the implementation of some of these plans have yet to be completed, but no doubt a Government that can reduce taxation by £10,000,000 in one year will have little difficulty in providing the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that part of the programme of the Government is the inauguration of a social insurance <Col N="63" /> scheme.  Let me say again that a great deal of work has been done in the preparation of such a scheme and the scheme is in fact ready for drafting. I do not suggest that the Government will necessarily adopt the scheme which the Fianna Fáil Government prepared, but, in so far as the preparation of the scheme involved not merely decisions as to the amount to be paid in benefits and the amount to be collected in contributions, but also the administrative arrangements to ensure the most effective execution of the scheme, all that work is done and there should be no reason whatever why a comprehensive social insurance scheme should not be produced in the form of a Bill to the Dáil before the summer.  Certainly, if there had not been a change of Government, it would have been produced before the summer.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters to which I should like to refer, but other opportunities will offer.  These are the matters upon which I think it is desirable that there should be a concise statement of the policy of the Government as soon as that policy has been determined.  I am assuming that these discussions or negotiations or bargainings that went on during the past week related to these important matters and not to the trivial question of who would be Minister for this or who would be Minister for that.  If they did deal with these matters, then the result of these discussions or bargainings should be made known.  If, in fact, they were purely concerned with personalities and the allocation of posts in the Government to the different Parties, then the sooner the Government consider these major issues of policy the better, because it is desirable that a clear statement should be made.</P>
    <P>One matter upon which all the Parties in the coalition are agreed is that the duties imposed under the Emergency Budget for the purpose of financing food subsidies should be repealed. I hope it is the intention to repeal them straight away.  I think it would be quite unfair to the public if they delayed repealing the duties until later in the year.  It may be argued that any financial changes of that kind should be <Col N="64" /> effected at the time of the annual Budget.  But they were not imposed at the time of the annual Budget and, clearly, the Parties who have formed the coalition have committed themselves to the immediate repeal of the duties.  I trust, therefore, that arrangements will be made to have the necessary resolutions submitted to the Dáil at its next meeting.</P>
    <P>That is what all the members on the benches opposite have undertaken to do.  They must not fall down on that first and main undertaking which they gave and the only one upon which they are apparently all agreed.  They have a financial problem if they do.  I presume the desire will be to maintain the food subsidies.  These subsidies produced a 3 per cent. reduction in the cost of living in the interval between August and November.</P>
    <P>I note that some Deputies opposite think it is possible to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent.  I shall be very glad to see proposals of that kind.  I hope the Parties opposite will be able to implement that undertaking.  Personally, I shall be more than pleased if they reduce the cost of living by 10 per cent.  I think it would be a complete impossibility for the Government to take any action that would effect a 30 per cent. reduction in the cost of living in this year.  The Deputies opposite say it can be done and, presumably, they will try to do it.  It is difficult to see how they are to do it if they are going to withdraw the food subsidies financed under the Emergency Budget. If they are not going to withdraw the food subsidies, the cancellation of these taxes which they have undertaken must, presumably, be followed by the imposition of some other taxes if the Government is to finance the subsidies out of revenue.  I am assuming that a financial expert such as Deputy McGilligan is represented to be would not adopt, even if his colleagues would allow it, the reckless course of meeting current expenses by borrowing.</P>
    <P>There has been a change of Government, and the Government must expect to be criticised.  I think I can undertake that the criticism we will give will be constructive criticism.  We have the <Col N="65" /> advantage of having been in office for a long number of years and we know a great deal of the working of Government Departments.  We know a great deal about the economic and social conditions of the country, and the criticism we will give of the Government's acts or proposals will be informed criticism. Our criticisms will all be designed to improve these proposals, if they are capable of improvement.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that responsibility of office will knock some of the harebrained ideas, which were circulating in the course of the election, on the head.  If that is not so, we will only have to expose the fallacies on which they are based, or their impracticability, if they are submitted for the serious consideration of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The electorate have spoken and have decided the election in a form which made this change of Government possible. It is true the Fianna Fáil Party got more Deputies elected than all the other organised Parties added together, but Deputies opposite have chosen to interpret the result as giving them authority to form a Government and they have done so.  We are not complaining; I am making no complaint about it; that is the normal working of the democratic system, and we who took a primary part in enacting the Constitution under which we work are not going to complain in the least if that Constitution is used to the detriment of our Party.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that every Deputy&mdash; every Independent Deputy and every member of the smaller Parties that have joined Fine Gael in this coalition &mdash;did what he thinks is right.  We will assume that, at any rate, until the contrary is shown.  If those Deputies have any explanations or excuses to give, they do not have to give them to us here.  Any excuses or explanations they may have to give can be given elsewhere. We do not want to hear them. Let them not waste the time of the House by expressing them here.</P>
    <P>I heard one Deputy saying that the Fianna Fáil Government was handing over a country which is bankrupt.  That is not true.  You are getting a country sound in every way&mdash;sound nationally, economically and financially.  It is a <Col N="66" /> country with a high international status and with good relations with other countries.  There is no immediate problem which the Government has to deal with arising out of our national position.  We can claim we have left this country a great deal better than we found it.  Our industries have been expanded; 100,000 more people are employed in industry.  Our agriculture has experienced difficult times during the war, but the fact that rural constituencies gave the Fianna Fáil Party an overwhelming majority is proof that the farmers are satisfied with our agricultural policy.  Our financial position is very strong, our credit is very high and it would be a very bad day's work for the country if the adoption of any of those hair-brained schemes that were advocated during the election should undermine that strong credit position.</P>
    <P>We are leaving you this country in good shape.  There are problems to be faced.  Some will be difficult of solution and some will tax the ingenuity and the ability of the Government to the limit; but intrinsically the country is all right. That is the way you are getting it. Make sure that you hand it back that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that some portions of Deputy Lemass's speech were somewhat provocative, I do not propose to take up any of the challenges that he has thrown out here to-night.  If he wants these challenges to be taken up, opportunities will offer.  He may rest assured that these challenges will be taken up and anything that requires to be answered will be answered effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government was formed for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to do something for the good of the country.  I welcome Deputy Lemass's offer of constructive criticism.  In the few words I uttered this afternoon, after I had been nominated as Taoiseach, I asked for the patriotic cooperation of Deputies on the opposite benches.  I think the time is so difficult, and the circumstances of the country are so serious, that we all should, for a while at least, cease to play politics.  We have just had a general election in which we told each other exactly what we thought about our own <Col N="67" /> policies and what we thought of each other.</P>
    <P>It may be that Deputy Lemass is right, that this country is in good shape.  We will not know that until we get the facts.  Deputy Lemass asked why did I not make a statement of policy here to-night.  I agree with him that it is urgently necessary that this Government should, at the earliest possible moment, make a statement of its policy.  It will do so.  We have been 15 years in Opposition.  The Party opposite has been 15 years in power.  Until we know the facts&mdash;until we get them from an examination of Departmental records&mdash;we will not know the problems we have to face, or the methods that will have to be adopted.</P>
    <P>A number of Parties in this country, after the General Election, came together, having put before the electors their varying and various policies and ideas.  The various Parties who have formed this Government have sought to find, and have found, numbers of points on which they can completely agree.  This Government has been formed on the basis of full agreement on all those points.  Any points on which we have not agreed have been left in abeyance.</P>
    <P>That has been made perfectly clear and, if Deputy Lemass thinks that there is any anxiety to be allayed in this country, the fact that we are here, having formed a Government, with Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, the National Labour Party and the Independents, and that in that group, with varying degrees of policy and outlook, we have been able to find such a measure of agreement as astonished us on fundamental points of policy, is something that can allay the fears of the country about which Deputy Lemass is so much concerned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will hear them in due course.  I do not want to play politics here.  I am not in this Government for political purposes.  I am not here to get any advantage out <Col N="68" /> of political office.  The ideal that I have placed before me here, the only reason why I consented to act, is because there is a group of patrietic Irishmen, working on democratic lines, agreeing to do what they believe is necessary to be done, and what was not done by the last Government.</P>
      <P>I do not care whether Deputy Lemass calls this a coalition, an inter-Party Government, or anything else.  He can call it what he likes.  A group of Parties has come together and found agreement.  That is an experiment, if you like.  It shows this country, at all events, what Fianna Fáil tried to delude the country about, that it was not possible to form a Government from members of Parties with different policies and different ideas.  We have at least shown this country that there can be some other Government instead of Fianna Fáil and that in itself is an achievement.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to stand the light of every searching criticism that all the Deputies opposite can bring to bear on our actions, on our policy and on the result of our actions.  We are seeking for that criticism, and we do not intend in any way to try to evade it.  We have the idea of a group Government, if you like, an inter-Party Government if you like, but at the basis of all that is this, that there has been found amongst all those Parties common agreement and a common policy.  We propose to do the best we can to implement that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass had a sneer, of course, at the industrial policy of Fine Gael.  I am not standing here to defend Fine Gael, but I defended Fine Gael for 15 years.  Deputy Lemass said that the Fine Gael Party was dead.  It is very much alive.  I do not want to enter into those controversial matters nor do I want to enter into matters that were the subject of discussion on the Government's industrial policy, the effects of that industrial policy, its cost to the poor people and the new rich which they had created.  The people will learn of our industrial policy.  It is a policy on which we are in complete agreement in this Government. I hope that the result of that <Col N="69" /> policy will be to give decent conditions to the worker, decent wages to every worker and a fair return to those people who put their capital into Irish industry.  No decent Irish industrialist has anything to fear from this present Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass wanted to know what was the policy of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to wheat, beet and the rest.  He will hear that in due course.  It will be the policy of the Government.  Deputy Lemass wanted to know were we going to be a group Government or a Coalition Government. We are not evading our constitutional responsibilities.  Deputy Lemass doubtless is aware that Article 28 of the Constitution makes it imperative for every Government to be such a Government as must meet and act with collective authority.  No Government can be formed within the Constitution, or act within the Constitution, unless it meets and acts with collective authority.  This Government will do that.  It is an Irish democratic Government, composed of men whose sole object is not to get anything out of Party politics, or office or profit or power, but who are here to do what they can for the Irish people, acting within the Constitutional limits and in the spirit and letter of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As regards our agricultural policy, the policy that we propose to put into operation when circumstances permit, will be the policy of our late colleague, James Hughes.  That is our ideal.  It is on that that our agricultural policy is framed.  Everyone knows what that is.  Deputies can criticise it if they like. They can bring the most searching constructive <Col N="70" /> criticism to bear on it, or, if they like, the most destructive criticism; but one of the fundamental principles on which this Government is formed is that there can be no prosperity for this country, no reduction in the cost of living and no such thing as the maintenance of a proper standard of life in this country unless agricultural production is stepped up, and stepped up immediately.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the boast made by Deputy Lemass, and notwithstanding all that, he said, had been done, the agricultural industry has gone nearly into decay.  We propose to bring it out of that, to bring it back where Paddy Hogan had it when a change of Government took place.  At all events, that is the basis of our agricultural policy.  If there are any anxieties about that, then they can be allayed by what I have said.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through any of the other points that were made.  I welcome the information that was given by Deputy Lemass from his knowledge of one Department over a period of 15 years, as well as the outline he gave of the problems with regard to supplies, petrol and the existing conditions with regard to wheat and so forth. We could get all that information tomorrow, but still we are glad that he gave it to us.  When we know the facts, then we will know the problems that we will have to meet.  Every member of the House may be assured, and the country may be assured, that we will bend our energies to do what is right and proper to solve those problems.</P>
