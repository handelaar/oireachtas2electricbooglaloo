      <P>It is proposed to take the business as set out on the Order Paper in the following order:&mdash; Items 3 and 1.  Might I suggest that we adjourn for an hour between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock for lunch?  The continued reporting is hard on the staff and I think such an adjournment would be advisable.  I am sure the House will agree.  Might I also suggest that at 2 o'clock questions be taken instead of at 3 o'clock, in order that there will not be two interruptions of business?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to draw your attention.  Yesterday evening I had an amendment on the paper to Section 9 to make certain increases in pensions. You ruled that out of order.  I see in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> this reference to it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Captain Cowan (Independent), speaking to an amendment he had tabled to increase old age pensions to a maximum of 26/- a week, said he was seeking leave to withdraw it owing to technical difficulties which had been explained to him.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as being unduly finicky about the manner in which the Minister is putting this Bill through, but it was invariably the custom when an important measure of this kind was before the House that the Minister in charge of the Bill, when a section was called, made a statement explaining what was in that section.  We find on this Bill that the Minister has not done that once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no recollection of any such practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I have no recollection of a statement being made on every section of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that so far as definition and such like sections are concerned there is no necessity for an explanation, but where it is proposed <Col N="2056" /> to amend Acts, as Section 25 proposes to do, it has been customary for the Minister to make a brief explanation; otherwise, we are assumed to take this Bill just as it appears on the surface.  That appears to be the attitude the Government Party are taking up.  They do not want to explain and they do not want the people to know what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather odd that Deputy MacEntee is the only Deputy in the House who cannot understand this section.  The Deputy is probably suffering from loss of memory.  He ought to ask his colleague on his left what the explanation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what is in the section all right, but the Minister is too lazy to do his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been customary for the Minister to explain each section but, of course, Deputies who may not know what a section means are entitled to ask for an explanation of it.  Whenever that was asked in connection with this Bill so far, I explained the position.  The purpose of this section is to extend the insurability ceiling for non-manual employment from £250 to £500 a year, thus bringing the limit into line with national health insurance.  My predecessor introduced a Bill extending the limit for national health purposes to £500 to cover persons employed at a rate of £500 per annum, and I am doing the same on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say you are casting your net wider in order to tax more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would almost have to bring in a blackboard and chalk to explain things to Deputy MacEntee. Somebody ought to take him over the kindergarten stage in respect to Bills. I am going to preserve insurability under the Unemployment Insurance Act for persons who pass out of insurance when in non-manual employment if their remuneration exceeds £250. That was the 1920 limit.  I am extending that now to £500, because £250 makes no sense to-day in respect to unemployment insurability, but, of <Col N="2057" /> course, the Deputy has the privilege of voting against the section if he does not like it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this section, in fact, make any change in the existing situation?  Is it not a fact that people are at present getting the rates of benefit set out in paragraph (1) of the section, that is, men of 18 years of age or over are getting 22/6, women of 18 years or over are getting 18/-, boys are getting 11/6 and girls 9/-?  Is that not the existing position according to the memorandum which the Minister has circulated himself?  If it is the existing position, why does this Section 26 appear in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 does in respect to unemployment insurance benefit what the previous section does in respect to national health insurance benefit, namely it consolidates statutorily cash supplements with the basic benefit and it ensures to the insured contributor in future that his right to unemployment insurance benefit is enshrined in law and is not subject to all the vagaries which are inevitably associated with cash supplement Orders made under an Emergency Powers Act which has a limited lifetime and is capable of revocation at any time.  This consolidates the benefit and gives the insured contributor, as a matter of statutory right, not revocable except by amending legislation, his basic benefit plus a cash supplement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can understand this section, it is one of those <Col N="2058" /> petty moves of the Department of Finance to take the few shillings that may be paid out during the time this Bill is going through.  If this section were not there, the Unemployment Insurance Fund would be a few shillings stronger by the time the Bill becomes an Act, but the Department of Finance have insisted that between the 1st July, and the date of the passing of the Act, anything that is paid out by way of cash supplement will be refunded to the Department of Finance.  I think that in order to strengthen the hand of the Minister in future, in dealing with the Department of Finance, we should protest against this section and try and leave funds like the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the National Health Insurance Fund in as reasonably strong a position as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing means practically nothing.  The Unemployment Insurance Fund is in a more affluent position now than ever it was before.  The amount involved is relatively small having regard to the wealth of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is little more than a book-keeping transaction.  The amount involved is relatively negligible, especially having regard to the state of the Unemployment Insurance Fund at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is trifling, but the point I make is that the Minister went to the trouble of getting the draftsman to draft this section and to bring it before the Dáil in order that the grasping Minister for Finance should get these few pounds out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The Minister should never have put in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputies who have been going up and down the country preaching about the widespread unemployment that existed in the State during the last five or six years have taken note of what the Minister for Social Welfare has now admitted, that the Unemployment Insurance Fund was never so affluent as it is to-day.  That means to say, in fact, that there never has been a lesser draw on the Unemployment Insurance Fund than for the past five or six years.  That is why it is affluent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came into office we found the fund heavily indebted to the Exchequer.  It is now in a position that the Exchequer can come in and collect via the Minister for Social Welfare the few pounds which are covered by Section 27 of the Bill. Deputies who have been in this House for some time are beginning to learn a few things, and the Minister also is beginning to learn a few things.  He now admits that there was no unemployment in this country when he took over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is necessary to repeat all the arguments because we will have a repetition, I am sure, from the Minister as to certain new principles laid down for social welfare that should be enshrined in any future book that is written on the subject and that this is all necessary in order to give a man a right to insurance. He has already pointed out that Section 26 is right so that a man is quite all right under Section 26.  It is only, as was pointed out on the previous section on the contributions, a case of exacting a certain levy from the employer and the employee in order that the Minister may give them increased benefits by way of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions. It is hardly necessary, then to go over all the arguments again, but we feel on this side of the House that the contributions should have been left as they were until the comprehensive scheme.  I do not want to be misunderstood. I agree with what the Minister <Col N="2061" /> said, that anybody who brought in a comprehensive scheme, whether a Fine Gael Minister, a Labour Minister, or a Fianna Fáil Minister, would have made it, as far as possible, contributory and would have therefore had increased contributions.

      <P>I have a question on the Order Paper regarding Section 28. It asks with relation to the classes of employed persons mentioned here, to state what the amount would have been if the contributions had been payable at the rate prescribed in Section 28 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1948, and what on this basis the total amount of the contributions payable under all heads would have been.  In fact, I am trying to find out from the Minister&mdash;and I assume that he will give me the information this afternoon&mdash;what exactly the people to whom the table in sub-section (1) of Section 28 applies are going to have to pay every year under the new proposal.  I calculate that they will have to pay £250,000 or in other words, an additional taxation of £250,000 on the people.  That is what the House is going to decide if it decides that the section as it is at the moment is to stand.  Before the section is put to the House, the Minister should tell the Deputies exactly how much he is going to collect in additional unemployment insurance contributions from those to whom the sections apply.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies of this House to the fact that a lot of amendments have been ruled out of order on the Bill for various reasons. Many of them are out of order for the reason that private Deputies may not move an amendment which imposes a charge, actual or potential, on State funds.  Amendments, for instance, in regard to the alleviation or the abolition of the means test or for the raising of the age limit from 14 to 16 years in regard to children's allowances or for the giving of widows' pensions under 48 years are not in order.  I understand, too, that urban benefits in certain cases are greater than rural benefits and that certain Deputies want to extend the benefits to a mile outside the urban area.  All these amendments would obviously involve a charge on State funds and are, therefore, out of order.  When an amendment is out of order it should not be debated.  What happened yesterday in regard to Deputy Cowan's case was that the amendment was debated even though it was out of order.  The Minister may be asked to accord certain concessions, but the amendment cannot be accepted by the Minister.  He has to move his own amendment, but the other, not being moved, cannot be accepted.  The amendments in order are Nos. 2, 7, 11, 15, 16 and 21, in addition to the Ministerial amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am going to do.  What the Minister has done here is to provide that certain houses owned by local authorities outside an urban area or a county borough will be considered as within the county borough or urban area for the purposes of this Act.  The difficulty I can see is <Col N="2067" /> that in an urban area houses may be built within a quarter of a mile of the boundary.  Under this Bill those people living in those local authority houses within a quarter of a mile of the boundary will be entitled to receive the increased rates of benefit but people living between these houses and the boundary in other houses will not be entitled to receive the increased rates. I can see that that will cause some trouble for the Minister.  My reason for putting down this amendment was so that the Minister would consider the matter and, if possible, arrange an area so that it will include the people in the houses he has in mind and include at the same time those other people who may live between those houses and the boundary.  I think that if the Bill in its present state stands, it will cause a considerable amount of grievance, because one individual living, say, a quarter of a mile outside the boundary will be entitled to benefit, while another individual living in a different type of house 200 yards outside it will not be entitled to it.  I would suggest that if the Minister were to accept the principle of my amendment and extend the area in such a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I say, in support of what Deputy Cowan has said, that he has pointed out that difficulties may arise?  The fact of the matter is that difficulties have already arisen. <Col N="2068" /> Take for instance the Donnycarney area.  One side of the road there is in the city area and the other is in the county area.  The result is that certain people are being deprived of all forms of benefits.  They are being deprived of widows' and orphans' pensions and tonsilar treatment which has recently been passed by the Public Health Department.  We are now anxiously awaiting an extension of the boundaries so that those people who have been removed from the bad housing conditions in the centre of the city to a municipal housing scheme further out and who have been losing benefits for the past month or two will be catered for.  My attention has been drawn to this matter by some of the individuals concerned and I would, therefore, urge the speedy extension of the boundary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to overcome a problem which has manifested itself in many places but more particularly in Cork than in any other part of the country.  I refer to the giving of the same benefits to those people living in corporation houses. The main purpose, as I understand it, is that these people are subject to city rates in almost every respect&mdash;they pay city prices for their food and they pay city rents.  I should like to support other Deputies in asking the Minister to extend it further because it is only piecemeal legislation as it stands. Problems will arise and probably have risen already.  People who are living probably not as far out as some of those corporation tenants are also subject to the same rates and standards of living as these people in the corporation houses.  The sooner the Minister extends the same facilities and rates to these people, even though they do not live in corporation or council houses, the sooner he will completely overcome the problem with which he is faced.  Land is certainly becoming scarcer in urban areas and cities.  This is probably due to the building programme <Col N="2069" /> pursued by Fianna Fáil.  Less houses to the acre were built than existed on these acres before for the reason that the original houses were considered uninhabitable and probably unhealthy because they were too congested. Through industrial expansion in cities and in towns building space and accommodation for houses are becoming dearer and scarcer.  Apart from building by corporations, private builders&mdash;who at some date will probably be able to let their houses to poor people outside urban areas&mdash;will also be moving out of the city.  These people would then come under the benefits of this section if it were extended to people other than corporation tenants.  As it stands it is most desirable and absolutely essential that corporation tenants benefit to the extent they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am breaking entirely new ground on this section.  I put this section in the Bill mainly to meet the case of two working-class areas in Cork which are slightly outside the city and where the persons concerned get employment assistance at rural rates.  They do not get it at urban rates; they get it at rural rates.  I put this amendment in to remedy that grievance which, as Deputy Corry admits, has been extant for the past ten years.  Not even the thunderous attacks of Deputy Corry on the Fianna Fáil Government could induce them to do what I am doing in Section 32.  I am meeting specially the case of those folk who reside in these two working-class areas in Cork.  That is being met for the first time after ten years' agitation. I do not think Deputy Cowan's suggestion is possible of reasonable implementation because one knows where the boundary exists.  One knows where the boundary ends in a town or city, but a mile from that place is a rather difficult line to draw.  If you draw a line on a purely lineal basis you may discover that mathematically you bring in one person at one end of the table while another person at the other end of the table is outside.  Everybody knows where the boundary of a town or urban area is, and I think that is the best line of demarcation <Col N="2070" /> for the purposes of a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is possible to meet the problem in the manner suggested by Deputy Cowan.  It could, of course, be met in another way, but I cannot meet the Deputy in this connection. It is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and for the local ratepayers and residents.  If a local authority extends the boundary it can bring in all these people within the scope of this Bill.  That is really the best way in the long run.  I am meeting this problem now because it is an old problem.  For ten years it has defied solution.  I am meeting it frankly and openly.  I am doing more than that.  I am saying that where any local authority builds houses outside its own area the folk who reside in those houses will be regarded as residents of the area of administration of the local authority.  Deputy Cowan wants to get a kind of blanket scheme for paying these rates of unemployment assistance benefit to folk who reside outside a town or outside the jurisdiction of an urban council.  The most efficacious way of doing that is by getting the local authority to extend the area of its jurisdiction.  That would bring these people in.  I think I am going a very substantial distance in meeting the problem in this manner and I am sure the Deputy realises that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section, line 8, the following words: &ldquo;The fact of his misconduct or the fact that he left his employment without just cause must be established by independent evidence and beyond any doubt whatsoever&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple amendment.  The effect of it is to provide that where it is alleged a person has been guilty of misconduct or that he has left his employment without just cause, that must be established by some independent evidence beyond the statement of the employer.  I think that is reasonable. Where the matter has to be determined it should be determined in a <Col N="2071" /> judicial way.  Where there is any doubt the benefit of that doubt should go to the applicant.  I am sure the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if Deputy Cowan had practical experience of a court of referees he would realise the difficulty of accepting an amendment of this kind and the impracticability of implementing it.  The position is that under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, unemployment assistance officers determine whether or not an applicant is disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance.  The applicant has a right of appeal to a court of referees comprising an independent chairman and representatives of employers and employees.  He is afforded an opportunity of appearing in person and giving evidence as to the facts of his case.  The court of referees examines the evidence so submitted and makes a recommendation based on whatever evidence is available to them.</P>
      <P>I do not quite understand what Deputy Cowan means by his reference to independent evidence, because, as the Deputy realises, it might be completely impracticable to secure independent evidence.  For instance, you might have the case of an employer who employs one man.  There might be a dispute between the employee and the employer, and, arising out of that dispute, the employee might be dismissed. What can one do in a case like that to secure independent evidence? Or you might have a case of an employer who employs a number of persons in a building but, as a result of an interview with, or an altercation with one employee in one portion of the building, the employee might be dismissed.  There is no other person present.  What can one do in a case like that?  Or you might have a case in which an employee is brought to the manager's office and asked some questions; a wordy fracas may develop between them and the employee may be dismissed.  There are only two people present.  How can one get independent evidence in a case of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides, and the traditional practice has been, that if an <Col N="2072" /> employee is dismissed he has an opportunity of bringing his case to the court of referees.  The chairman is an independent chairman.  The court comprises the chairman, representatives of the employers and representatives of the employees.  They hear the evidence and, on the basis of that evidence, they form an independent judgment as to whether the employee was dismissed with or without just cause. I think that is a fair way of meeting the problem.  Anyone with experience of a court of referees cannot deny that in all cases which come before the court the tendency is to give the unemployed or dismissed worker the benefit of whatever doubt exists.  In view of what I have said, I suggest that Deputy Cowan will realise the impracticability of implementing this amendment.</P>

      <P>The only effect of the amendment would be to make sure that the court does come down on the side of the dismissed man.  The evidence, as I visualise it here, need not necessarily be oral evidence.  It may be certain facts which would in the ordinary way be considered as supporting one side rather than the other. I must admit that I have not a personal knowledge on this matter but I have some knowledge of the machinery of appeals.  I have had from time to time to do with such appeals and I did feel that certain decisions were unjust. Because of that I thought the position might be met in this way by putting the court in the position that, unless there were some independent evidence to support the employer's allegation, the issue would be resolved in favour of the applicant for assistance; and, <Col N="2073" /> if there was any doubt at all, that that doubt must be given to the applicant for assistance.  That is an ordinary principle governing matters in all sorts of civilised tribunals.  In more than 90 per cent. of the cases that come before such tribunals that principle is actually applied.  The object in putting down this amendment is to ensure that the court would be bound by those principles.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 39 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 13 (1) (c) of the Principal Act shall be amended by inserting &lsquo;five years&rsquo; in lieu of &lsquo;three years&rsquo; wherever the latter words occur.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to extend the number of years over which the contributions can be calculated.  The present period is rather short and extending it to five years would cover a number of cases of hardship that I have in mind.  If the Minister would consider it, I would be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was doubtful as to what exactly was intended.  As drafted, the amendment does not meet whatever purpose the Deputy has in view, from what she has said just now. At present, three years is regarded as the average period for ascertaining the paid contributions for the purpose of qualification for benefit.  If that is made five years, the average extends over five years and it does not seem to me to make any difference.  It could be two, six or ten years, but as drafted the amendment would still require you to take the average.  Deputy Mrs. Crowley apparently considers an average over five years is better than one over three.  I do not know if that is based on any research, but I suspect it is not.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is probably thinking of spreading the qualifying contributions over five years, but that is not secured by the amendment.  An amendment of this kind would mean taking a step in the dark.  I do not know what the effect would be on applicants for benefit, and I am sure the Deputy does not know either.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crowley discussed this amendment with me and I thought she had covered her point.  A person <Col N="2075" /> who is paying his contributions may change into some self-employed position for two years and then go back for a year and die, and his widow is not covered, as at present he must have paid an average of 26 for three years. Under the amendment, if he pays an average of 26 for five years he would be qualified, so he could be away for two years out of the five and still qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the consequences of this would be and I do not think anyone else does.  The effect of the amendment is that, where a person is insured for four years prior to the date of death or the attainment of 70 years of age, he must have 130 contributions paid or deemed to have been paid for the previous five years, instead of 78 contributions for a period of three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever evidence the Department has is against that view. If the effect of accepting the amendment would be to make it more difficult to get the pension, I am sure Deputy Ryan and Deputy Crowley would not desire to press the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on that interpretation, which I think is correct in the way the amendment is put down, is it not obvious that a person getting 130 stamps for 2½ years out of five could be away for 2½ years and still qualify, whereas under 78 he could be away only for 1½ years out of the three?</P>

      <P>I have no information on that, as I am sure the Deputy has not, but the Departmental evidence is against the view that this is an improvement, from the point of view of the claimant.  The position is that, in addition to contributions paid, an insured man is credited with contributions in respect of weeks of sickness or unemployment.  Considerable inquiry is necessary in any case to establish availability for but inability to obtain employment for the period of three years to make up the average of 26 contributions.  So far as the Department is concerned, since these Acts came into operation in January, 1936, only 182 claims for contributory pensions were rejected because the average test had not been satisfied. Over 12 years, only 182 claims had been rejected because the average test, that is, 78 contributions in three years had not been satisfied.  I am not so sure that the return would be as good under this amendment, and the Department is definitely of the opinion that the acceptance of the amendment might worsen the position from the point of view of the applicant.</P>

I was wondering if the Minister at this stage could himself evolve some arrangement in the shape of an alternative type of qualifying test which would meet the case Deputy Crowley has in mind.

If a <Col N="2077" /> person has ten contributions in the first year, ten contributions in the second year and 26 in the last three years, the total is 98, and he qualifies, as at present.  Then take the reverse of that&mdash;the person who, in five years, has 52 contributions in the first year, 52 in the second, ten in the third year, ten in the fourth year, and five in the fifth year.

He contributed to the widows' and orphans' pension for seven, eight or ten years and dies after being five or six years out.  He has not contributed during the time he was drawing his pension.

    <P>This amendment might take a long time to explain and any oral explanation would be inadequate.  In substance, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, so far as contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are concerned, nobody in the future will get a contributory pension which will be lower than what he or she would get in the form of a non-contributory pension. This matter was adverted to on the Second Stage.  I undertook to meet the problem.  It is done by this amendment.</P>

      <P>What a confession&mdash; that this Bill had been drafted in such a way that a person in respect of whom nothing was paid for pension would get more than a widow whose husband had <Col N="2081" /> paid for a pension.  I wonder whether really the Bill was not intended to be a blister upon those who are members of the contributory side of this scheme. I have all along suspected that the Minister for Social Welfare does not like those people who pay for their own pensions, that he has been concerned to indicate to them that they might as well not make any provision for their widows and children, that they might allow, if they can, their insurability to lapse.  At the same time, in trying to justify other sections of this Bill, he has been talking about the desirability of getting back to proper insurance principles.  That is the reason why, of course, under these principles, we have already decided to impose increased contributions on members of other schemes and that is the reason why, I assume, that in due course, when we come to consider Section 42 of the Bill, under this part we are going to impose additional rates of contributions upon persons who are insured persons for the purposes of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. I do think, Sir, it is a strange commentary upon the way in which this whole business has been handled by the Minister for Social Welfare that he should have to come in here and admit that, for the first time, on the Second Reading of this Bill, that dawned on him, as a result of representations which were made, I think, from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The grounds are that the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund, established under the 1935 Act, pays out contributory and non-contributory liabilities without any distinction.  If the moneys in the fund are at any time insufficient, the pensions investment account meets any deficit there is and if there is any surplus it goes into that account. The Deputy's amendment provided that the moneys in the pensions investment account shall only be applied to contributory liabilities.  The effect of that clearly would be to stop the source of income for non-contributory pensions. The Exchequer, therefore, would have to meet any deficit for non-contributory pensions, and clearly that would impose a charge on public funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did speak yesterday on what the Minister was doing with the moneys in the Pensions Investment Account.  He himself has admitted that my charges were true&mdash;that he has taken £450,000 this year out of the pensions investment account to pay non-contributory pensions.  I am going to suggest that, having done that, he ought to be content if he is not going to make restitution to the contributors whose funds he is taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely he is not going to be so unscrupulous as to ask the Dáil to impose the additional burden provided for here in Section 42.  I suppose it is futile to ask the Minister to disclose to the <Col N="2087" /> House what additional income he expects to derive from the increased rates of contribution.  I suppose he is not in a position to disclose that to the House, and I assume that he is not worried about it.  He has made up his mind that this traffic, so to speak, will bear an increase of 50 per cent.  In any event, the insured contributors have no option in the matter if the Dáil decides that it is going to increase the rates of contribution on employed persons by 50 per cent.  That is the end of it, and they will have to pay and look pleased about it.  Whether they will or not is another matter.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the shocks which the people are going to get when these contributions begin to be collected is that they will then realise that by reason of the additional impost in Section 42 as well as the imposts in other parts of the Bill, they are going to have to pay an increase of 6d. per week and will get nothing for it.  When they realise that they will not have as high an opinion of the Minister for Social Welfare as some of his supporters have.  In any event, we ought to know how much this is going to cost the people.  I am not so certain that the Minister has taken the trouble to find out how much these increased contributions are going to bring him in.</P>

      <P>I want again to press the Minister to be less coy and to be less secretive than he has been in relation to this and other parts of the Bill, and to disclose to the House what exactly this is going to cost.  Now, if I give figures the Minister will say that I have confused myself in relation to the significance of the figures.  I quite admit that, as a private Deputy, I have not behind me the resources of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a private Deputy dealing with this matter, and I am trying to bring out, for the information of the House, some facts which the Minister ought to disclose but which, for one reason or another, he is reluctant to mention.  I have a calculation, an imperfect one, <Col N="2089" /> an approximate one, but it is the best that most private Deputies could do. I find that under this Bill an additional £250,000 will be taken every year from persons who are contributors under this scheme.  That figure may be much too low or much too high. The only person who has any precise estimate about this is the Minister. Why does he not disclose that to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They will pay £250,000, and that represents more than a farthing in the lb. on sugar.  The Minister would not have the hardihood to put a farthing in the lb. on sugar. The Minister, when he was a Deputy, used to say that we were too niggardly in relation to our social services.  He <Col N="2090" /> used to say that the cost of living was too high.  Here he is definitely increasing the cost of living.  He cannot deny that.  He is increasing it in precisely the same way as it would be increased for every working-class family if an additional farthing was put on the lb. of sugar.</P>
      <P>What I am really concerned about is to try to get the Minister to be less reticent, to disclose to the House what this will really cost.  He says we will have the information at 2 o'clock.  If so, the information must be in his possession and why will he not divulge it?  What is he afraid of?  We are back to this position, that the Minister, admitting he has not got the information now, did not take the trouble to calculate how much this will cost the workers.  He slammed on the additional 2d. a week on them and 2d. a week on their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a succinct way of expressing it and I am glad the Minister desires to be helpful to that extent.  This increases the rates of contributions by 50 per cent. and the Minister did not worry to find out how much it will cost the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of expedition I was prepared to let what Deputy MacEntee said pass, but if the section is not agreed to I feel I should make some reply.  Under this section we are doing what is being done under other sections, namely, we are consolidating the cash supplement with the basic benefit and giving the people a statutory right of entitlement to the new rate of benefit.  That will not depend on a cash supplement Order under an Emergency Powers Act having a limited life.  We are giving people a statutory right to their increased rates of benefit.  That is enshrined in a statute which cannot be interfered with in the same way as a cash supplement Order.  Any attempt to interfere with these benefits in the future will necessitate a Bill which will have to pass through five stages in this House, and which will have to go through the Seanad as well.  We will pay these <Col N="2091" /> benefits on an unassailable basis from the point of view of political practicability. The workers, the employers and the State will pay an increased contribution for those benefits which are now being assured as a matter of right and not as a concession to the workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee asked for information. He will get it at 2 o'clock, and if he wishes he can talk on this section until 1 o'clock.  He will have the information an hour later.  He can resume then with all his actor-like talents on what the cost of this will be to the various people who contribute to it. The workers know that it will cost 6d. a week.  The Deputy wants to suggest that it will cost £250,000.  Surely figures of that kind are meaningless. Nobody will pay £250,000.  The aggregate may reach a certain figure, but the worker knows what he has to pay and that he will get benefits as a statutory right in the future.  Over and above all, he knows that this Government will make available £2,500,000 more for social welfare schemes, a thing which the Fianna Fáil Government did not do when it was in office.</P>

      <P>The heading of these tables is &ldquo;Second Schedule&rdquo; and later on, on page 24, you again have &ldquo;Second Schedule&rdquo;, which is rather confusing.  Apart from that, the Minister has reiterated that this will give widows and orphans a statutory right to those extra benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory right the Minister refers to is conferred on the widows and orphans by Sections 39 and 40.  This section is making the contributors pay.  There is no reason why one should be consequential on the other or why one is necessitated by the other.  The only reason for this section is that the Minister wants to make the employer and the employees pay for these extra benefits that he is giving the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2092" /> I do not think he should attempt to confuse the minds of Deputies here by trying to get Deputies to believe that if they do not vote for this section, widows and orphans will not have a statutory right to the increased pensions they are getting.  They would have a statutory right to them under Sections 39 and 40.  Anyway, the contention which the Minister has made that they have not a statutory right at present is rather thin.  They have it by Order and the Minister knows that no Order can be revoked or changed in any way before a motion to that effect is laid on the Table of both Houses. I do not know that any Government would feel strong enough either against its own supporters or against the Opposition or these two combined, to attempt to amend an Order so as to lessen the amounts that widows and orphans are getting at the moment. The Minister knows very well that these cash supplements would continue no matter what Minister was there, until replaced by something better.  The &ldquo;something better&rdquo; that should have replaced them is the comprehensive scheme about which so much has been said.  The Minister refuses to give the figures which have been asked for by Deputy MacEntee as to what this is going to cost.  He says the workers know what it is going to cost them, that employers know what it is going to cost them, and that old age pensioners and widows and orphans are going to get more.  Surely to goodness the Minister should not treat the Dáil with such contempt that he refuses to give Deputies here information to allow them to calculate what will be the entire cost to contributors, to the Exchequer, and to all concerned, of this entire piece of legislation.  He has refused to give this information all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it would not take his officials more than two or three minutes to get the figures, but evidently he does not want to give them to the Dáil.  He wants to maintain the picture of the £2,500,000 a <Col N="2093" /> year, which we were able to show would mean an extra expenditure by this Government of only £600,000 for two years.  It is like a farmer saying to his family: &ldquo;Oh, we shall have plenty to eat for the next two years, because we shall eat the hens when they do not lay and then we shall eat the cattle, the pigs and so on.&rdquo;  What is going to happen, however, when the Widows' and Orphans' Fund has been raided so far as it can be raided and when the contributors have paid these extra amounts?  We want to get these figures from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I want to be reasonable with the Deputy in the line he has taken.  I am only sorry that his attitude has not been infectious and that some of his colleagues have not been impregnated with the same kind of reasonable approach to the problem. Let us deal with a few of the points the Deputy has raised.  He says that there is a Second Schedule on page 17 and there is the description &ldquo;Second Schedule&rdquo; on page 24.  The Second Schedule on page 17 means the Second Schedule to the Principal Act, and the Second Schedule on page 24 means the Second Schedule to this Bill.  I hope that clears up any misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I had in mind was that if anybody had to quote the Second Schedule to this Bill when it becomes an Act, it may be confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks up page 17 he will see that the words Second Schedule are in inverted commas.  The Deputy said that in fact contributors had a legal right to the additional payments under the Cash Supplements Order because nobody proposed to revoke it.  That may be the Deputy's simple approach to the problem, but what he has got to remember is that the workers of this country remember Emergency Powers Order 83.  The Deputy has apparently forgotten that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that it is much better from the point of view of the workers to have their rights enshrined in an Act than that they should have them conceded under an Order which is revocable by the Government, so easily revocable that the Government need not go to the trouble of coming into the House and getting a Bill passed through the five stages necessary before it is enacted by the House, apart from whatever delaying action the Seanad may apply to the Bill.  From the workers' point of view, I do not think it is challengeable that it is much better to have their rights under an Act as compared with having them under an Order.  It is the fact of having their rights under an Act which makes sure that any Government in future is going to have a tough job before the benefits can be reduced.  As Deputies know, the Cash Supplements Order is an Order which the Government may revoke or modify at any time.  They cannot do that so easily once these rights are enshrined in a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already accepted Sections 39 and 40 which protect that right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the increased contribution we are bringing back the existing Acts to the stage under which the whole finances of these measures were raised in the well-known way of contributions from workers and employers, with grants from the State. This is putting the whole matter back <Col N="2095" /> on an insurance basis.  Deputy Ryan will admit that is the normal way to approach a problem of this kind.  In all the discussion on this Bill he has been very careful to conceal that he himself did not approach it in this normal way.  I suspect the reason is that the cash supplement is a legacy from the detestable food voucher <Col N="2096" /> scheme conceived at a time when the wages of the workers were pegged to a very low level.  In normal circumstances such as are operating now, I think every Deputy will acknowledge that the desirable thing to do is to finance the Acts in the way in which they have been financed, for the last 35 years in some instances.</P>

      <P>This is the section which created the anomaly that the Minister, by an amendment to Section 40, has corrected.  When we were discussing Section 40, I mentioned the fact that it was rather extraordinary that the Minister had to wait until the Bill came before the House before he became aware of the position which would obtain under Section 44 in respect of a widow's non-contributory pension as compared with the position which would obtain under Section 40 of a widow in receipt of a contributory pension.  I deplored the fact that the Minister was so ill prepared that he had to await the discussion of the Bill in this House before he became aware of that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>That is what the Minister said when I raised the matter on Section 40.  I have here the Minister's introductory speech dealing with Part VI of the Bill and I cannot see in the Minister's speech introducing the Bill any reference to Section 40 or Section 44.</P>

      <P>But the reply was made after Deputy Dr. Ryan, as reported in column 1639 of the Official <Col N="2099" /> Reports for Wednesday, 28th July, drew attention to the fact that an anomaly would exist.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another anomaly is that, according to this Bill, in certain cases if a widow gets a non-contributory pension she gets more than if she were contributing.  This is very bad.  I do not say that a non-contributory pensioner should get less, but I do say that a contributory pensioner to get less is very bad.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Dr. Ryan said after the Minister had introduced the Bill.  The Minister, in his introductory speech, did not draw attention to that anomaly, but what Deputy Dr. Ryan said was followed up by something which Deputy Keyes said, and I grant that the Minister, in reply, referred to Deputy Keyes' speech, ignoring Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech, and said that he would have the matter attended to.</P>
      <P>I merely rise to point out that it is rather regrettable that an important measure of this kind should be introduced into this House without the Minister being fully aware of what the consequences would be of an important provision in the Bill.  He was not previously aware of the fact that the section we are now discussing would, if the position were not corrected, have created the anomaly which Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out, and which I regretted when dealing with Section 40.</P>

      <P>You would imagine at this stage of his life Deputy MacEntee would be almost inured against the churlishness and childishness which he displays in discussing an important Bill of this kind.  I told the Deputy that we realised that once we made a certain change in the non-contributory section of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, this alternation, which has already been made, would be necessary. In order not to hold up the Bill and to enable the House to get it at the earliest possible opportunity in advance of the summer recess, the Bill was circulated, I having decided that I would take in the amendment on the Committee Stage and that is being done.</P>

      <P>There are millions of things I did not say in my introductory speech.  The debate lasted two days on the Second Stage.  I gave Deputies an explanatory memorandum and I am glad of that, but it has not produced much effect on Deputy MacEntee. Still, I gave it to him, hoping to enable him to understand the Bill.  No doubt, Deputy Killilea is more intelligent than Deputy MacEntee.  I issued an explanatory memorandum and I explained the provisions of the Bill.

I want to tell Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Killilea that under Section 44 we are increasing widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions very substantially.  Deputy Killilea represents what might be described as a rural constituency.  He knows the problems of the people in rural areas and the problem of the widows and children in rural areas.  Let me tell him what we are doing for them under this Bill.  Under the Fianna Fáil Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act a widow with one child in a rural area gets 11/6.  She is getting 16/- under this Bill.  Where she has two children she gets 12/6 at present; we propose to give her 22/-.  Where she has three children she gets 15/- at present; we propose to give her 26/-.  Where she has four children she gets 17/6 at present; we propose to give her 30/-. Where she has five children she gets 20/- at present; we propose to give her 34/-.  Where she has eight children at <Col N="2101" /> present she gets 27/6 under Fianna Fáil legislation; she will get 46/- under this Bill.  Where she has ten children she gets 32/6 under Fianna Fáil legislation; she will get 54/- under this Bill. That is a pretty substantial improvement, as Deputy Killilea will admit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's conception of non-contributory pensions was a very pauper-like conception.  When I quote these figures of what they got under Fianna Fáil, bear in mind that they include the cash supplement.  We are giving now, basic benefit, cash supplement and what, in most cases, is a 75 per cent. increase in the non-contributory pensions.  That is a good job.  Deputy Killilea can assure all the widows in his area that they are going to be better off under this Bill than before.  As I said earlier, there would not be enough white horses to lead the Deputy to his residence if this were a Fianna Fáil Bill doing this for widows and orphans under the non-contributory Acts.</P>

Their sole <Col N="2102" /> purpose is to defray the cost of the non-contributory pensions.  The total amount which is going to be brought in will be about £820,000 or £850,000, I do not know which, and the Minister says that the annual cost to the Exchequer of the proposals regarding non-contributory pensions will be in the neighbourhood of £860,000.  I am perfectly certain, knowing the Minister's technique, that he put the highest figure he possibly could on the additional cost of the non-contributory pensions.  That is what he did and he is going to take that £860,000, not out of the pockets of the income-tax payers nor of the motor users or anybody else, but out of the pockets of the insured workers.</P>

It has been the invariable practice when a Minister introduces a Bill and proposes to make an important amendment in it to mention that fact when he is introducing the Bill.  The Minister, however, pleads that in this case he has departed from that practice. I take leave to say that the reason the Minister for Social Welfare did not mention the fact that he was going to bring in this amendment is that he was not aware that it was necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The time when, and the circumstances in which, Ireland became associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations, together with the authority whereby such association was entered into, and the nature, extent and obligations of such association at <Col N="2106" /> any given date in the past are matters of history.  I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my attempting to deal with these matters now.  In so far as the Deputy's questions refer to Ireland's present Constitutional position, I would refer him to the reply I gave him in this House on the 28th of last month.</P>
    <P>Ireland's association with the Commonwealth of Nations depends on the factual position.  This factual relationship, upon which our association is based, depends on the reciprocal exchange of concrete benefits in such matters as trade and citizenship-rights, the principle of consultation and cooperation in matters of common concern and on the many ties of blood and friendship that exist between us and these other great nations whose populations include so many of our own people.  Our association with the nations of the Commonwealth is a free association, which, by virtue of its very freedom, could be determined by unilateral action.</P>
    <P>The question whether Ireland is a Republic is purely one of nomenclature which I am not prepared to discuss. Ireland is, by its Constitution, a sovereign, independent, democratic State, in which all powers of Government derive, under God, from the people.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for the replacement of the existing Malahide Boys' National School by a new school.  The Department has been in correspondence with the manager in the matter for a considerable time and a suitable site for a new school has been offered by the manager. The local contribution to be provided in the case and certain issues in connection with the leasing of the site have, however, still to be settled before the Department will be in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of the new school.  Every effort will be made to have the case brought to issue as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>The accommodation in the Malahide Girls' National School is adequate for <Col N="2112" /> the attendance, and I am advised that the premises are in reasonably good condition.  It is not proposed, therefore, to replace this school by a new school.</P>

      <P>I should be glad to take steps that would in any way bring about a closer relationship between our people and those of the partitioned counties.  Rather than the exchange of representatives, I feel that a much more useful purpose would be served by the establishment of direct contact on matters of mutual concern between the two Governments.  Accordingly, I should be willing, at any time, to meet representatives of the Belfast Government for the purpose of discussing matters of economic co-operation which might be of benefit to Ireland as a whole.  I feel that direct contact on such matters would be preferable to contacts through representatives.  The distance between Dublin and Belfast is a short one.</P>
      <P>While, as indicated, I should at all times be prepared to discuss matters of mutual concern with the Belfast Government and should welcome an opportunity to do so, it must be clearly understood that any such contact would be without prejudice to the clearly stated attitude of this Government, that a continuance of the unnatural division of our country is a violation of Ireland's national sovereignty and of the elementary democratic right of self-determination. In so far, however, as co-operation on economic matters may be of assistance in minimising the effects of Partition and in bringing about a better understanding between those in <i>de facto</i> control of the Six Counties and ourselves, I should welcome it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is prepared to carry out an experiment in a suitable area whereby farmers employing paid labour for land improvement schemes would be recouped 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. of the labour cost, the scheme to be confined to classes of farmers genuinely unable to afford the payment of supplementary wages for such work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In a scheme of land improvement, such as is suggested by the Deputy, it would be necessary to identify farmers genuinely unable to afford the payment of supplementary wages for improvement work.  Inquiry into each individual's means to elicit that information would be objectionable both from the farmers' point of view and from mine.</P>
      <P>Under the Farm Improvements Scheme, grants are equivalent to 50 per cent. of the estimated labour cost of approved works and there are considerably more applications than can be accommodated with the funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> This indicates that the present rate of grant is sufficiently attractive, and, in these circumstances, I am not prepared to initiate an experimental scheme of the nature suggested.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be founded on a misconception of what I said in winding up the Budget debate.  I then indicated that I had decided not to adopt, for this year's Budget, the bad system of taxation by retrospective legislation, but that such a course might be necessary should prices not be reduced.  I went on to say that I thought the community was entitled to a reduction in prices and that traders could help a movement of breaking prices by using the reserves which, in considerable amount, they still possessed.  It is not much more than two months since I made these statements, and the Deputy will appreciate that a full estimate of the position is not yet practicable.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that great hardship is caused to these men who are pronounced to be medically unfit and who, at the same time, are precluded from getting any allowance, owing to this means test, and will he not admit that something should be done to alleviate the hardships of numbers of these men throughout the country?  If, under one machinery, the machinery of the Army Pensions Board, these men are declared to be unfit, and, under another machinery, are debarred from receiving any allowance, there is a miscarriage of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind the whole scheme of special allowances is to alleviate such cases of hardship.  It was welcomed and acclaimed by every section of this House.  The scheme of special allowances is for medal holders who are incapable, by reason of infirmity or old age, to earn a living, and it is designed to bring their incomes up to a certain minimum.  I think the Deputy, and Deputies generally, would agree that the idea of the scheme would be completely dislocated if means were to be ignored and these special allowances given to people who happen to have medals and incomes of £10,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind the case of a lorry driver who was declared medically unfit.  He has a wife and four children and has no means whatever, but, simply because he got a temporary post in a garage for three <Col N="2121" /> months last year, the investigation officer reported against him, and he was debarred.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a wife and three children, this scheme makes provision for bringing the income up to £129 per year, but the whole scheme is based on the fact that the person is incapable of earning money, owing to old age or health condition.  If the evidence is that the person is capable of earning money, you are going in direct conflict with the legislation, and, on the facts stated by the Deputy, that is the position.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Letterkenny is in one of the areas classified &ldquo;F&rdquo;, getting its electricity from Northern Ireland, and that, as a result, the charges for industrial electricity in Letterkenny are 40 per cent. more than those in any other part of the State?  Would the Minister, in view of that, not consider investigating this whole matter, with a view to redressing this hardship in regard to &ldquo;F&rdquo; areas, of which Letterkenny is one.  It is very unfair and very hard to understand. If it is a question of having to charge for electricity for industrial purposes an amount 40 per cent. in excess of that charged in any other part of the State, it should be very easily justified.

      <P>The nature of the mother and child service to be provided under the Health Act, 1947, and the consequential staff and organisational changes to be made in existing health services will be determined on consideration of the report of the Consultative Child Health Council which is considering this matter.  As the Deputy is probably aware this council has been established for the purpose of giving advice on the measures which may appear to be likely to prove most effective for the improvement of the health of children generally or of any class or classes of children and in particular for the reduction of infant mortality.</P>

The qualifications and list of duties for these nurses have been fixed for some time and local authorities were recently requested to consider the appointment of additional public health nurses where required.  In view of anticipated developments in health services and the consequential increase in the number of nurses who will be required for these services, the making of improved arrangements for the recruitment and training of nurses has been under consideration and preliminary consultations with the statutory nursing bodies concerned have taken place.

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>One important factor in connection with this Bill that <Col N="2128" /> appears to have been overlooked by Deputy MacEntee is that it does provide the sum of £2,500,000 for old age pensioners and widows and orphans during the next financial year.  That, after all, is the test on which it will be examined in the country.  During the Budget debate there was considerable criticism of the fact that provision was made in the Budget of only £600,000, and it was suggested that that would mean a negligible increase in old age pensions.  Under this Bill, £2,500,000 is to be paid and that is a good instalment by the Minister within a very short time.  The Minister has stated very clearly, and it has been stated by Deputies on this side of the House, that this is only a temporary measure to tide us over the period until such time as the comprehensive scheme is available and I think it ought to be examined and considered on the basis of that explanation and that guarantee by the Minister.  I do suggest, with all due respect to Deputy MacEntee, that he has weakened considerably the contribution he could make to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will say that he has weakened considerably the contribution he could make on this section by his approach.  Naturally, I am worried when I see an experienced parliamentarian like Deputy MacEntee making such tactical errors.  I had hoped that I would gain some inspiration, some knowledge, from the approach that an experienced parliamentarian like Deputy MacEntee would make to this section.  His contribution was condemned, and, as I said before the adjournment, it was clearly an artificial contribution.  He made an extraordinary statement.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the criticism of Deputy MacEntee.  The Minister has read out a list of benefits that will accrue under this section <Col N="2129" /> to widows in the rural areas.  I think Deputy Killilea agrees that, so far as his area is concerned, the provisions of this section, when duly implemented, will substantially reduce the hardships of a very large number of widows in his area.  It is on those grounds, and those grounds only, that I support the section.</P>

      <P>I do not understand why Deputy Cowan should have been so disappointed with the contributions which I have made to the discussions on the various provisions of this Bill, and in particular on the provision that we are dealing with, because I think I rather deplored the fact that, having regard to certain undertakings which were given to the people, the Bill does not go far enough.  They are not getting the means test abolished or the pensions that were promised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  I deplore the fact that Deputies who were elected to this House on the plea that they would abolish the means test have steadfastly refused to bring any pressure to bear on the Minister responsible to get him also to honour the pledges which, like them, he made to the people in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, of course, like the curate's egg, is good in parts and very bad in other parts.  This is one of the parts which is reasonably good.  We have endeavoured, however, to get the Deputy who has sat down to try and get rid of the parts which, to my mind, are bad.  The Minister gave us some information when introducing the Bill as to the cost of this particular section. He was much more informative in regard to what the section was going to cost the Exchequer than he has been up to this as to what giving effect to the section is going to cost the insured workers of the country.  However, we have had the statement from the Minister that the annual cost to the Exchequer of the proposals regarding non-contributory pensions will be in the neighbourhood of £860,000.  Of course, that is only a half-truth and is intended to deceive, because these proposals are going to cost the Exchequer <Col N="2130" /> nothing.  The figures which I elicited to-day in reply to Parliamentary Questions 4, 5 and 6 prove that.  He said that the proposals would cost the Exchequer £860,000, but to offset that the Minister proposes to collect £319,000 more from the persons who have contributed under the national health insurance scheme, that he proposes to collect £251,000 more from the people who have contributed under unemployment insurance, and that he proposes to collect £219,000 more every year from the persons who have contributed under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme, and as we know he is taking £450,000 from the contributors to pay the non-contributory pensions in this year.  The three figures which I have given&mdash;£319,000, £251,000 and £291,000&mdash;total £861,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when introducing the Bill, told us that Section 44 was going to cost the Exchequer £860,000.  I am showing that it is going to cost the Exchequer nothing by reason of the fact that not only is he increasing the rates of contributions for all the persons who come-within the scope of these various social insurance schemes, but, that he also is withholding £860,000 odd which at the moment the Exchequer pays over by way of cash supplements.  That is where he gets the money.  In so far as my contributions to the debate on the various sections of the Bill have been disappointing to Deputy Cowan, they have been disappointing because I have tried to point out to him what he and those associated with him were doing when they went into the division lobby in support of the Minister on previous sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal briefly with the racket that Deputy MacEntee has been endeavouring to maintain about a tax on the workers. I do not need to travel again over the ground that I have already covered.  It is sufficient to say that every additional contribution which a worker pays will go into the pool.  That will ensure to him a statutory right to scales of benefit portion of which at present depend on the whim of the Government in power.  His rights and title deeds to higher rates of benefit will be enshrined in this measure and they cannot be reduced unless the Government are prepared to run the gamut of introducing an amending Bill and going through five Stages in this House and facing the Seanad as well, with all the possibility of public agitation in the meantime.  We are giving, therefore, to insured contributors entitlement to a scale of benefit better than they have to-day from the standpoint of security.</P>
      <P>You cannot discuss this Bill without adverting to what it does in an overall sense.  You cannot discuss it section by section and consider one section as apart from the others.  This is what the workers will know, and they will not be blindfolded by what Deputy MacEntee or others may say, that under this section a non-contributory widow in a rural area with one child will get 4/6 a week of an increase.  If she has ten children she will get 21/6 a week of an increase.  That will go into the pockets of non-contributory widows and orphans.  That is a valuable concession.</P>
      <P>They will appreciate this Bill and I doubt whether there will be found in the country a worker who will not gladly welcome the benefits conferred on him and the fact that £2,250,000 will go in the form of improved social services. There is not a worker who will question any request to him by legislation to pay an additional contribution for the benefits which under this Bill are now being stabilised in a statutory manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I ask the Minister to consider that the section provides that a widow will receive an allowance if she has attained 48 years and has not attained 70 years. If she is under 70 and has one child under the appointed age she will receive a pension.  There is undoubtedly a big gap in respect of the widow who is under 48 and has no child.  I would ask the Minister to extend that section so that all widows will receive a pension. Take the case of a young woman whose husband has died or has been killed.  She is left in the position that under this measure she is not entitled to a pension.  Could the Minister include all widows under 70 in this section?  I know it will cost some money, but it may not be so very much.  The difficulty is that if she is not to receive this non-contributory pension what will she do?  How will she live?  I would much prefer to be in the position of having a statutory right to receive this non-contributory pension.  I think she is just as entitled to it as if she were over 48.  I do not know why the 48 has been mentioned.</P>

      <P>Under this section I propose to make a radical improvement in the position.  At present a widow under 55 can only qualify for a non-contributory pension if she has a child not more than 14, if absent from school, or 16 if attending school.  When the <Col N="2133" /> child reaches 14, if the widow has but the one child, within six months from the date of attaining 14 the child goes off and by reason of that fact the widow goes off the State pension list as well.  Under this Bill I am bringing down the qualifying age for the widow's pension, a childless widow's pension, from 55 to 48.  By doing that I am making approximately 7,000 widows at present not entitled to a pension eligible for one and it will cost £210,000 to do that.</P>
      <P>I quite sympathise with the point Deputy Cowan has made and I can travel a good deal of the road with him. I still have £2,500,000.  If I give more here I shall have to take it away from some other place.  Out of the £1,000,000 going in respect of improved non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, £210,000 will go to qualify the additional 7,000 widows.  That is as much as I could do this year.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Cowan's sympathies in the matter of bringing down the qualifying age.  I hope that will come in due course.  At the moment I am constrained to say that my £2,500,000 is absorbed by this Bill.  If I am to yield anything I can only do it by taking benefits from somebody else.</P>
      <P>This non-contributory section is a pretty-well balanced section.  We not merely modify the means test, but we permit a widow to earn something and receive gratuitous payments; we set up benefits, reduce the qualifying age and increase the amount of the pensions. The whole thing hangs together and I am sure the Deputy will agree that I have tried to do the best I can to spend the money in a way that will confer the greatest benefits on the widest number of persons.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that a widow under 48, without dependents, would be entitled to unemployment assistance?  I thought that under the Schedule a widow without dependents in a rural area would be entitled to 8/6 a week.</P>

      <P>The wife of an insured contributor can get a pension automatically when her husband dies.  A woman whose husband was not an insured contributor may apply for and <Col N="2134" /> qualify for a non-contributory pension. She is not eligible at present for a non-contributory widow's pension unless she has one dependent child, not over 14½, or not over 16 if attending school. If she is a childless widow under 48 she will not qualify for a non-contributory pension.  She may qualify for a contributory pension, but that depends on how the husband stood for insurances purposes under the National Health Insurance Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister is once again on his mythical £2,500,000.  He knows he has not got that money. There is a sort of undertaking in the Bill that in the next financial year increased non-contributory pensions will be paid, but the Minister is merely going to pay that out of the money he has stolen from the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund and other sources.  He has not the £2,500,000 and nobody is aware that, in fact, whatever services are contemplated would cost £2,500,000. The Minister had better stop that type of propaganda.  People are doubtful about what they will get out of the Bill, certainly so far as the workers are concerned.</P>

Under this Bill a widow's children by her first husband will qualify for these allowances.  If she marries again and again and again, all the normal children will qualify in the matter of their entitlement to the allowance.  If the Deputy's amendment is carried then children born after her last husband died&mdash;a long time perhaps, after the last husband died&mdash; will also qualify.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the trade agreement between the Government of Ireland and Great Britain which was signed in Dublin on the 31st day of July, 1948, and copies of which were laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement, which was signed last Saturday by Mr. Atlee, the British Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government of Great Britain and by myself on behalf of Ireland, can be described as a graft or modification of the trade agreement of 1938 which was entered into by the British and Irish Governments.  The conditions in which the agreement of 1938 was negotiated and entered into and the conditions subsisting as at the time when the present agreement was negotiated and entered into were fundamentally different in very many respects.  In 1938, although the war clouds were gathering, fairly normal economic conditions subsisted nevertheless in the world.  There had, of course, been abnormal relationship in economic matters between this country and Great Britain for some six years prior to entering into the agreement of 1938 by Ireland and Great Britain.  The trade agreement of 1938 was one of three agreements which were brought <Col N="2139" /> before the Dáil and subsequently ratified by it.  That trade agreement was recommended to this House by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Deputy Lemass, as an agreement which was, I think, entirely unconnected with the other two agreements.</P>
    <P>The agreement was stated by him to be one which stood on its own; another agreement put an end to the financial and economic disputes which had been going on between the two countries for some six years prior to the agreement. The trade agreement was recommended to the Dáil and to the country by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce on its merits, having no relation to or connection with the economic war.  The agreement was entered into between Ireland and Great Britain in just the same way as any agreement entered into between two international States.  Deputy Lemass then warmly recommended the acceptance by the Dáil and by the people of the trade agreement he had negotiated or helped to negotiate.  If the warmth of his recommendation of that 1938 agreement was then justified, or has since been justified by the results, there can be no doubt as to the warmth of his acceptance of the present agreement which I have the honour to recommend to the Dáil and to the people to-day, because in every respect the present agreement represents a marked advance on the proposals embodied in the trade agreement of 1938.  In recommending this agreement to the Dáil and to the people, there is no necessity for me to overstate the advantages which will be derived from its operation in future or to exaggerate the benefits which we believe we have secured under it.  We have, I think it can be contended, secured for the first time in our history a guaranteed market at remunerative prices for every species of agricultural produce which can be produced on the land of Ireland.  We have assured for our farmers stability in that market, in our best market, at remunerative prices, and we have not merely maintained our powers of protecting, safeguarding and advancing our own industry, but we believe that we have increased those powers and the weapons <Col N="2140" /> necessary to secure the rights of our industrial concerns and to increase further industrial productivity in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the conditions which exist now and which have existed for the past six months or more are totally different to those which existed in 1938.  Conditions in international trading at present and for some time past are vastly different to what they were in 1938.  In the intervening ten years a complete metamorphosis has been effected in world conditions, world trading and in the methods adopted in connection with the maintenance and advancement by each nation of its own international trade. Those conditions had, of course, to be met with and taken account of by us in our negotiations and conclusions.</P>
    <P>Before I give the House some detailed consideration of the specific agreements that have been entered into, I would like to direct the attention of Deputies and their earnest consideration to some of the conditions subsisting at the time we entered into these negotiations and concluded this agreement.  In 1938 we had a position where the great industrial nations of the world were in active competition with each other for the world markets. Ordinarily, competition regulated prices and quantities and international trade generally, and in that year and for some years previously the purchases on these international markets were made by private buyers and the inter-action of the ordinary economic forces resulted in the necessity for persons selling their goods having to face free competition.  In these particular conditions, tariffs, quotas, quantitative restrictions, and all the other paraphernalia of industrial competition had free play and were of full importance.</P>
    <P>All these conditions of international trade in this part of the world have now changed.  There is no longer free competition; there is no longer the position where private buyers are buying in the markets or private sellers selling in the markets.  The position has been reached that bulk purchasing has taken the place of private buying <Col N="2141" /> In Great Britain, with which we are most immediately concerned, the Ministry of Food purchases in bulk all the goods entering into Great Britain which are required for feeding Britain's population.  The Ministry of Food purchases in bulk on behalf of the State all the requirements of the State.  In those conditions, the question of tariffs ceases to have the same importance as it had before.  The last Government, when they negotiated the 1938 agreement, were very largely concerned with preferences and tariffs for our agricultural and industrial goods. We were faced with and we will have to face the position that what matters most are prices and quantities.  So far as it was possible for us, we had to get from the one purchaser which now exists in Great Britain the best price for our industrial and agricultural products that we could obtain and entry into the British market at the best possible prices and under the most favourable circumstances for the great bulk of our industrial exports.</P>
    <P>In 1938, the main object of the negotiators of that agreement was to secure free entry on the British market for our industrial and agricultural products. It was not without its irony that, although Article 1 of the agreement of 1938 appeared on its face to give that free entry for our industrial and agricultural products, the apparently clear meaning of that Article has not been conceded in practice for some time past.</P>
    <P>The contention was put forward that, although a free entry was guaranteed under Article 1 of the 1938 agreement, that free entry only referred to such goods as were allowed by Great Britain to be exported from Ireland into Great Britain.  At all events, I shall have a few remarks to make on that article later on and I refer to it here incidentally merely to draw attention to the two main purposes which were stated by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to be his objects and the objects of the then Government in negotiating and securing the trade agreement in 1938&mdash;to secure free entry to the British market for our industrial and agricultural products and to ensure the right of the Irish Government to take measures, by way <Col N="2142" /> of tariffs and other restrictions, to protect our native Irish industries.  Those were the first two objects and, as was stated here, in the making and acceptance of the trade agreement those two objects had been achieved.</P>
    <P>We, of course, wish for the fullest freedom of entry for all our products at present into the British market.  We also desire to maintain our right to protect our Irish industries.  We were, however, faced with a difficulty which the last Government had not to face, the difficulty in connection with the changed circumstances due to world conditions, bulk purchasing succeeding private buying, free competition gone, tendencies towards freer international trade and the fact that in the intervening period since the war the trend of world ideas on world trade has undergone a very substantial metamorphosis. It would perhaps not be true to say that the general trend of economic thought is towards free trade, but I think it is true to say that the push for many of the great nations trading in the world is towards freedom of trade.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of their desires, these countries, particularly the United States of America and Great Britain, have entered into international commitments limiting their powers of putting on tariffs, quotas and other quantitative restrictions, freezing tariff rates and preferential rates of duty, and other matters of that kind, and also endeavouring to set and settle, if possible, certain principles which will govern and regulate international trade as between them.</P>
    <P>That trend found its most significant expression from our point of view in two international agreements, one of which was negotiated last year and one this year.  The first was the general agreement on trade and tariffs which was concluded at Geneva last year and was entered into, I think, between 21 States.  This country was not a party to that agreement, but Great Britain was.  We have to keep very firmly in our mind in connection with any negotiations which we carry on in reference to our trading that at some time it may be to our advantage to adhere to that general agreement on trade and tariffs to which up to the present moment we <Col N="2143" /> have not in fact adhered.  We have, unfortunately, also to take into account the fact that Great Britain is a party to that and that that agreement entered into last year at Geneva by Great Britain has by its provisions an impact of an important character even on the 1938 agreement as it stood before we negotiated a modification of the agreement which is before the House to-day.</P>
    <P>The second international trade agreement which may have important consequences from our point of view is what is known as the Havana Charter. The Havana Charter for an international trade organisation was drawn up this year and we had a representative there who signed on behalf of this country.  That Havana Charter, of course, at the moment is not binding upon this country, nor have we adhered to it or adopted it.  But, the principles embodied in that charter, even though they are not binding upon us, and in the Geneva general agreement on trade and tariffs have their effect on any parties negotiating an international trade agreement to-day.  We have, as it is important that I should state here at the outset, a very great interest in the Geneva agreement, the general agreement on trade and tariffs, because of its effect on our potentialities in reference to protection of our own industries and in reference to such agreements as we have with Great Britain for free entry into their market and such agreements as we have or may have with Great Britain for free entry of her products into our market Great Britain is our most important customer.  The main effect of that general agreement for trade and tariffs which was signed last year at Geneva is to prevent any margins of preference existing as on April, 1947, from being increased, and any new preferences from being created.  We being a State associated with the States of the British Commonwealth, have, and must continue to have, the greatest possible interest in the preferences and margins of preferences that have been given and accorded between the States who are associated in that community of nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We must take note, <Col N="2144" /> therefore, of the fact that under this Geneva agreement margins of preferences cannot be increased and new preferences cannot be created. We must see that, so far as possible, the preferences which we secure by virtue of our association with those States and by our international agreements with the State members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are not adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The Geneva agreement prevents Great Britain from increasing rates of duty on goods of non-Commonwealth origin without at the same time increasing to a corresponding extent the rates of duty on Commonwealth products of the same character.  In practice this means that if at any time in the future Great Britain should decide to exclude undue imports of non-Commonwealth agricultural products it may be necessary for her to depart from the conditions of free entry which Commonwealth countries and Ireland at present enjoy.  Consequently, although the trade agreement just concluded gives Ireland contractual rights to duty free entry for all agricultural products, the Irish Government has made the British Government aware that if circumstances should arise they will be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the waiver of Ireland's rights to free entry to the extent necessary to counter competition harmful to the interests of Ireland no less than to the interests of Great Britain.  That position is strictly reciprocal, should we find that, in respect of goods to which we have granted free entry here from Great Britain, it is necessary for us to increase the import duty on goods coming from countries other than Commonwealth countries in order to protect our markets from being flooded with those goods or for other reasons. If we increase that duty at a time when we have become parties to the Geneva agreement then it will be necessary for us, if we are parties, to increase correspondingly the rate of duty against British goods.  We would take into sympathetic consideration the difficulties thereby created for Great Britain.  As I say, the obligations that arise from this Geneva agreement are strictly reciprocal.  All, so far as we are concerned, that is involved in the <Col N="2145" /> matter by way of obligation upon us is that if Great Britain finds herself in the position I have indicated we will give sympathetic consideration to her difficulties.</P>
    <P>The matter has been still further complicated by an international agreement which Great Britain entered into with the United States of America&mdash; Article 9 of the loan agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America.  Before that loan was negotiated Great Britain, in order to curtail dollar expenditure, had been endeavouring so far as possible to take her imports from soft currency countries as distinct from those areas where the currency was against her, namely, hard currency areas.  As a result of this Article 9 of the loan agreement, Great Britain was required to apply non-discrimination in its import policy so that it would not be possible for Great Britain to grant import licences for goods from soft currency areas unless, at the same time, similar import licences were granted for similar categories of goods from hard currency and dollar areas. That affected this country to the extent that Great Britain was unable to take from Ireland goods of categories which, if taken generally, would involve a draw on her dollars and hard currency reserves.  Those were considerations which affected us in our negotiations with Great Britain and which rendered it difficult for Great Britain to give concessions which we asked for and to which we believed we were entitled and which, in fact, Great Britain was willing to grant if she could but was prevented from granting by her international commitments over the last few years.  These international commitments had resulted in the situation where practically the entire of our industrial exports from this country, certainly for the last 12 months and probably for longer, were denied entry into Great Britain except under an import licence which was granted very grudgingly and only in respect of very limited categories of goods.</P>
    <P>The third big change which has taken place in the intervening years from 1938 to 1948 has reference to our <Col N="2146" /> adverse trade balance.  When the 1938 agreement was being negotiated the adverse trade balance between this country and Great Britain was such as not to cause any anxiety or certainly very little anxiety.  In the intervening period the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.  The balance of payments between this country and Great Britain has, in recent years, become completely disordered.  When we took office some months ago and became aware of the actual position in regard to the adverse trade balance and the nature and the alarming extent of that adverse trade balance it was one of the problems that gave us the greatest possible cause for dismay.  We felt that it was essential, if this country was to retain its economic stability, that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of trade and to try and restore order into our disordered balance of payments.  That was one of the big factors that we had to keep before us during our negotiations with Great Britain.  I am glad to say that we have been able to achieve agreement, embodied in the agreement that is before the House, as to the methods by which we will be enabled to deal with that very alarming and very urgent problem.</P>
    <P>The next factor that operated was the position that was in existence in connection with supplies.  In 1938 the markets of the world were, speaking generally, buyers' markets.  In recent times, and while we were negotiating, the world markets were sellers' markets.  In 1938, when goods were on offer, it was possible for Ireland when negotiating a treaty to use our willingness to buy certain goods from Great Britain and certain categories of industrial products as a bargaining counter.  The situation is now reversed. The goods which we need, and urgently need, for the maintenance of our economy are extremely scarce and in many instances impossible of procurement. What was in 1938 a bargaining counter has now become a concession to be sought.  We could undertake in <Col N="2147" /> 1938 to buy certain goods from Great Britain instead of buying them elsewhere, and use that undertaking for the purpose of getting advantages and preferences for our own products and for our own exports.  We are now in the position of being short of materials and capital goods&mdash;coal, steel, cotton, yarn, machinery and other commodities. Instead of agreeing to buy these goods from England as against some other country and so using that as a bargaining weapon to extract from Great Britain concessions for our products, we were in the position of having to seek for these urgent requirements for our own industrial economy. In addition to that, very considerable changes have taken place in the value of money.  The purchasing power of money has fallen to a very considerable extent, and where in 1938 a particular protective tariff was adequate to protect an industry here that tariff can no longer be said to be sufficient for the purpose for which it was originally imposed.  Those, in general, were the conditions we had to face in negotiating this agreement.</P>
    <P>In the agreement as finally settled and signed these difficulties are reflected and, I believe, very largely resolved.  The first article of the agreement deals with our agricultural industry.  It is hardly necessary to restate what has been asserted so often, and which is a fundamental plank in the policy of this country, that our agricultural industry is the basis of the entire prosperity of this country; and that, unless we have a prosperous agriculture, we cannot have a prosperous industrial economy.  It was, therefore, our desire and our main effort to secure for our farmers free entry at remunerative prices to the British market for all our agricultural products. This agreement in Article I and its annex secures for our agricultural industry a prospect of such a prosperity as that industry has never known before.  It assures for the farmers that they can now settle down to work in the sure knowledge that they have four years at least, and probably an indefinite period, during which to plan their industry; that they can export everything they can produce or grow upotheir <Col N="2148" /> lands; and that every single item of that produce and that growth can be exported to Great Britain at remunerative prices.  In so far as there was any clog upon our agricultural industry by the 1938 agreement, that is all removed.</P>
    <P>In Article 1 of the agreement the desire of both Governments is stated and clearly expressed.  The wish of the Government of the United Kingdom is stated to be to obtain increased quantities of cattle, eggs and potatoes and to resume as soon as possible the traditional imports from Ireland of bacon, butter, fat sheep, lambs and other agricultural products.  Great Britain is, therefore, desirous of taking as much of our agricultural produce as we can ship, and the agreement provides that those products that are exported to her shall be taken at prices which will remunerate our farmers for their labour. The agreement also recognises the desire of the Irish Government to increase our exports and to provide increased supplies of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>There is an annex to the agreement into which I do not propose to go in detail.  The Minister for Agriculture will, if necessary, give a complete explanation of every detail in that annex. It is sufficient, I think, for me to say that the annex to the agreement sets out the arrangements which will govern the quantities and prices during the next four years of our principal agricultural products&mdash;our principal exports to Great Britain of cattle, carcase meat, canned meat, poultry, eggs, bacon, butter, fat sheep, lambs and potatoes.  With regard to cattle exports, I would like to make just one or two comments by way of explanation.</P>
    <P>The general desire in this agreement is to achieve at the earliest possible moment the position where we will be able to export to Great Britain at least as much as we exported before the war. In 1930 we exported 294, 193 fat cattle and 424,359 store cattle, a total of 718,552 to Great Britian and the six north-eastern counties.  In 1939 we exported only 133,907 fat cattle and 565,850 store cattle, making a total of <Col N="2149" /> 699,757.  In 1947 we exported 51,915 fat cattle and 336,492 store cattle, a total of only 388,407, which is about half what was exported in 1930.</P>
    <P>What this agreement, therefore, envisages is that we should export fat cattle to the extent of more than three times the number exported in 1947 and store cattle to the extent of one and a half times the number exported last year.  The decrease in our export of cattle was due to a number of causes into which it is not necessary now to enter.  It was due to the lack of feeding-stuffs. Possibly it was also due in very large measure to the bad price which was being given for our cattle on the British markets.  We have got rid of that bad price.  We have got rid of all obstacles to the Irish farmers exporting to the full limit of their capacity all the cattle that they can produce at remunerative prices.</P>
    <P>When we were elected as the Government there was a somewhat extraordinary position existing in reference to the prices that were given for our fat cattle and the prices that were procured on the same market by cattle bred by the British farmer.  The position as regard that was that we had the custom of sending over to Great Britain, two months before the cattle were slaughtered, store cattle which were fattened and finished on the lands of Britain.  These cattle, which might be conveniently referred to as Anglo-Irish cattle for the sake of contrast and to make the position clear, were sold; they were of the same quality, in every respect the equal of cattle bred, born and finished in Ireland&mdash;Irish cattle fattened in Ireland. The Irish animal and the Anglo-Irish animal stood in the same market, in the same condition and in the same class, but the Anglo-Irish animal secured differntial treatment to the extent of 5/- per live cwt. a greater price than that given for the Irish animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And does so yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  There is a confusion between the two five shillings and that is what I want to clear up.  That 5/- which existed when <Col N="2150" /> we came into office has been taken away.  When he became Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon discovered that there was that differential price as against our exports of cattle which subsequently became fat cattle.  He endeavoured to have that removed.  He discovered that the price was going to be fixed at a certain level at the end of March if something was not done about it.  He proceeded to England with a view to securing the removal of that differential.  He did not succeed in getting its removal at that time, but he succeeded in getting a postponement of the fixation of the price at a particular figure agreed to last November. By this agreement that differential completely disappears.</P>
      <P>There is in the agreement a reference to 5/-, but that has nothing whatever to do with the differential I am talking about, but it has been used in an endeavour to suggest that the differential which existed until we got it taken off under this agreement has not, in fact, been taken off at all.  The 5/- mentioned in the annex to this agreement has reference to a subsidy given by the British Government to encourage the production of fact animals by their own farmers, British farmers.  In reference to that particular matter we took the line from the start that that was British domestic policy in regard to their own live-stock policy; that we were not going to interfere with British policy in regard to their own farmers, in the manner in which they were treated or subsidised or helped in the production of their own cattle, any more than we would allow Great Britain, British farmers or the British Farmers' Federation to interfere with our live-stock policy in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not seek in any way to interfere with British policy in regard to encouraging the production of fat animals by giving them a subsidy of 5/-.  That is the 5/- which remains.  We never asked for it to be taken away. The differential between Anglo-Irish and Irish cattle is gone.  That 5/- has gone completely.  It did not go until we got it taken away by this agreement, and it is in the annex.  That is the 5/- which has been misused.  An endeavour <Col N="2151" /> has been made to bedevil the situation and to suggest that this differential was not taken away.  It has nothing to do with the differential that I am talking about.  That differential between Irish and Anglo-Irish has gone.  We never sought to interfere with the British Government's live-stock policy, any more than we would have let them interfere with ours.</P>
    <P>In one of the clauses of the annex, Clause 6, the reference to 5/- has nothing to do with the differential in the price of the fact cattle I have spoken about.  But even in that respect we got a concession.  The British are entitled to subsidise their farmers for their own purposes in any way they like in pursuance of their own policy, just the same as we would be entitled to do it. But the British did agree that that 5/-which was in existence at the time we were negotiating this agreement should not be subject to an excessive increase. That is a concession which we obtained. That is the meaning of Clause 6 of the annex.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go any further into this agreement so far as agriculture is concerned.  It would be difficult to see what we could have obtained for our cattle industry, our agricultural industry in general, which we have not obtained.  There is no limitation now upon our farmers. There is nothing to stop our farming industry, our agricultural industry, from prospering in a way it never prospered before.  For the first time they now have under this agreement an opportunity, by hard work and increased production, of securing not only prosperity for themselves but prosperity for the whole country.</P>
    <P>If we can increase our agricultural products in the way that this agreement gives us an opportunity of doing, and which we hope will be done, then we shall have an opportunity which we never had before of increasing the real wealth of the country and, by increasing that, we can increase the standard of living of our people.  We can also, by our additional exports of agricultural products, go as far as it is possible to go to redress our disorderly <Col N="2152" /> balance of payments.  That aspect was neglected by the last Government.  We have cured that neglect.  We have now secured for our farmers advantages never secured for them before.  We have secured an opportunity for increasing the real wealth of the country and the standard of living of our people.  We have a means by increased exports of our agricultural products of redressing our adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <P>So far as the industrial end of this agreement is concerned, we have, I may claim without exaggeration, also made considerable advances.  Article 2 of the agreement which is before the House deals with the situation to which I have already referred of our disorderly balance of payments.  It is not necessary for me to give those figures; they are alarming and they must be known to everybody.  Article 2 is devised to enable us further to deal with that problem and to deal with it urgently and effectively.  That article is expressly stated on its face to be an article designed to safeguard Ireland's external financial position and to achieve and maintain stable equilibrium in its balance of payments.  The scheme underlying that article is this: that we will prepare here in this country a list of goods which are being imported from the United Kingdom and which, under Article 5 of the 1938 agreement, were allowed to be imported into this country duty free and we, having prepared that list, will consult with the British Government on that list, with a view to seeing which of these goods we desire should be either excluded, or subjected to import duties for the purpose of redressing our adverse balance of payments.  It will be open to us when this consultation takes place and the list of goods which up to this were allowed to enter this country duty free as a matter of contractual right to the British Government is examined and agreed to determine which of these goods shall be subjected to quantitative restrictions or import duties.  Then it will be for us to impose these quantitative restrictions or import duties for the purpose of redressing our adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> Under this article, so far as the entire of the goods scheduled to Article 5 of the 1938 agreement are concerned, which, until this agreement was made, we were bound to admit into this country free of duty and of quantitative restrictions, all that range of goods may now be subjected to quantitative restrictions or import duties for the purpose of redressing the balance of payments in accordance with the procedure laid down in the article.  We are anxious to redress the balance of payments. We regard it as a very urgent problem, a very necessary problem to be dealt with.  The British share our view on that.  Consequently, we can by virtue of this article secure that a large percentage of the goods mentioned in Article 5 of the 1938 agreement will no longer enter this country duty free.</P>
    <P>If we are able to manufacture them here by our own industrial machinery or by any new industries that may be started, that is all to the good.  The explanation given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was recommending warmly the provisions of the 1938 agreement to the House and to the people, was that a very wide range of the goods which we were bound by Article 5 to allow into the country duty free were of a type which, so far as he could see, would not likely be manufactured here in future. I think that the position has changed since that time and at all events we shall be entitled under the next article &mdash;if we can, and I hope we will be able to do so&mdash;to start industries which will provide our people with the goods mentioned in Article 5 which were duty free.</P>
    <P>We are bound under the proviso to Article 2 not to discriminate against British goods, unless there is agreement otherwise, and where quantitative restrictions or import duties are imposed by our Government on the import of goods from Britain, we undertake that corresponding action will be taken in respect of like goods imported from any other country.  In other words, if we impose quantitative restrictions or import duties on goods covered by Article 5, then we are to act in like manner in reference to goods from other countries&mdash;the United States, or Switzerland, or even coming <Col N="2154" /> from any of the Commonwealth countries. These are the provisions of the second article of the agreement.  These are the objects for which Article 2 of the agreement was devised by us for the purpose of redressing our balance of payments.  Incidentally, it will give us a weapon that did not exist under the previous agreement for maintaining our existing Irish industries and perhaps also for creating new industries for the production of the goods mentioned in Article 5 of the former agreement.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be obvious that where Great Britain had, as she had under Article 5 of the trade agreement of 1938, a contractual right to send in goods of the wide variety and of the class set out in the schedule to Article 5, free of duty and free of quantitative restrictions, the very existence of that right would contribute, in the circumstances that have existed here for some years back, to disordering the balance of payments as between Great Britain and Ireland. Where there was a right given to Britain to send goods here free of duty we had to take these goods without the imposition of a duty or quantitative restriction.  These goods coming in here were bound to have an adverse effect on our disordered balance of payments. This article redresses that particular evil which has come into existence within the last few years.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the agreement also refers to Article 5 of the 1938 agreement, the article dealing with the free list.  I have already pointed out that under Article 5 of the 1938 agreement, a large variety of goods of different classes was entitled to be sent here from Great Britain, without duty and without quantitative restrictions, was entitled to entry free of duty and of quota or other restrictions.  Under the article, as now agreed, we are entitled to put duties on those goods mentioned in Article 5 to the extent of 40 per cent. of the 1938 value of these goods in the schedule.  We are entitled to select any particular classes of goods that we wish from that schedule and to put tariffs on them.  In view of the fact that the first part of the schedule deals with a variety of goods or stuff such as <Col N="2155" /> are hardly likely ever to have been produced by manufacturers here, the net result of this is that taking the 40 per cent. value limit imposed by this agreement, we will be entitled to tariff practically the entire free list for the purpose of protecting our existing industries and creating new industries if we can.  I think it will be generally admitted that that is a very substantial advance on Article 5.  It is to be said that negotiations had been going on for some months prior to the agreement now before the House between officials of the Irish Government and the British Government with a view to securing something like what has now been secured by Article 3 of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The position had been reached that the British were prepared to ease up on their contractual rights under Article 5, but no formal agreement or concluded agreement had been arrived at when we took office.  The matter was under discussion but no agreement was, or apparently could have been, reached in reference to the free list. We agreed in the agreement now before the House that the goods and commodities mentioned in the schedule to Article 5 of the 1938 agreement can be subject to import duty, custom duties, quantitative restrictions, quotas and all the rest of the paraphernalia, without consulting with the British Government and even without prior notification.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the agreement is one which is of some very considerable importance.  The first clause of the article deletes from the 1938 agreement sub-clause (ii) of Article 1 and sub-clause (ii) of Article 2.  Under the 1938 agreement, eggs, poultry, butter, cheese and other milk products, dead guinea fowl and game birds had free entry into the British market only until the 20th August, 1940.  That contractual right ceased under the agreement on the 20th August, 1940.  As a matter of fact the right was continued by the British Government without any obligation upon them to do so, but they could, of course, at any moment have ceased to give the benefit to this <Col N="2156" /> country of free import of those commodities.</P>
    <P>Under the present agreement we have contractual rights for the period of the agreement, for four years, to free entry to the British market of eggs, poultry, butter, cheese and other milk products, dead guinea fowl and game birds subject to one proviso which has relation to the Geneva agreement which I referred to at the outset of my observations. That proviso declares that if the rates of duty on eggs, poultry or butter&mdash;it will be noticed that the proviso does not apply to cheese or other milk products&mdash;of non-Commonwealth origin imported into the United Kingdom should at any time be raised above their present level, any consequential duty imposed on similar products of Irish origin in order to comply with the general agreement on tariffs and trade shall be such as to maintain the margin of preference which they previously enjoyed.  The meaning of that is that if, under the provisions of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, the duty on eggs, poultry or butter of non-Commonwealth origin was increased at any time we should be entitled to the margin of preference which we now enjoy.</P>
    <P>The second clause of this article deals with a matter which was the subject of considerable differences of opinion between the Irish Government and the British Government.  Article 1 of the agreement of 1938 was, of course, the most important article of that agreement. It provided that our products, either industrial or agricultural, should enjoy entry free of customs duty into the United Kingdom.  In clause 1 of Article 1 of the 1938 agreement there is reference to the Import Duties Act of 1932 and the Ottawa Agreements Act of 1932.  Those Acts were passed following the change which had taken place in British tariff policy in 1932 when duties were imposed upon goods coming from foreign countries into Great Britain but goods of Commonwealth origin&mdash;and Ireland was included in that description&mdash;were given certain preferences and other concessions.  In 1932 certain nations associated in the British Commonwealth came to an agreement, an <Col N="2157" /> economic and trade agreement, and so secured for each other certain preferences. During the economic war between 1932 and 1938 we lost the benefits of these Acts mentioned in Article 1 of the 1938 agreement, the Import Duties Act, 1932 and the Ottawa Agreements Act, 1932.  The object of this clause of Article 1 was to give us those benefits which we had lost during the economic war.  We were to get free entry into the British market.  That clause has been construed both in practice and in theory by the British Government that goods from Ireland, whether industrial or agricultural, which are in fact permitted to enter into Great Britain will be admitted duty free, but that there is nothing in this clause of Article 1 to hamper the power of the British Government or Parliament to prohibit the right of entry of Irish goods into Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I must say that when I first came to consider the problems which we had to tackle before going to England when preparing our case for our negotiations with the British Ministers, that interpretation came as a complete surprise to me.  It is the most important article from all points of view in this agreement of 1938.  Its importance can be judged from the fact that I think only in the next Article 2 is there contained any other undertaking by the Government of the United Kingdom.  In Article 1 the Government of the United Kingdom undertook to allow these goods, our produce, entry free of customs duty into the United Kingdom. In Article 2 the Government of the United Kingdom undertook that in reference to certain goods enumerated in the schedule of the agreement there should be a preferential rate of treatment. I am giving a shorthand description of the article.  Those are the only two undertakings by the British Government in the entire agreement.  Every other article of the agreement starts &ldquo;The Government of Éire undertake&rdquo;. It is the same throughout every other article in this 1938 agreement.  The undertakings are all undertakings of the Irish Government and in only two clauses are there any undertakings by the British Government.  In respect of the one that matters, Article 1, where <Col N="2158" /> they undertake to allow free entry to our produce by the interpretation placed upon it by the British Government, it only meant free entry if allowed to enter.  We controverted that interpretation.  It was not possible to reconcile our points of view.  But we thought that it was not fruitful for this country that we should continue the controversy on that particular matter and that we should get the best we could, having regard to the circumstance in which we found ourselves that this agreement was so drafted that it was capable of that interpretation, however much we disagreed with it.</P>
    <P>That interpretation has been put into actual practical effect by the British for at least the last 12 months and our industrial products have been prohibited entry into the British market over a very wide range of commodities.  Any industrialist with an exportable surplus of Irish manufactured goods during at least the past 12 months had to seek from the British Board of Trade a licence to export from this country the goods which he was manufacturing here, notwithstanding that Article 1 of the trade agreement of 1938 was supposed to have given free entry of articles into Great Britain.  We argued the opposite interpretation.  Let us say this, that at least the British point of view was arguable and at least ours was arguable.</P>
    <P>What were we to do in that set of facts?  That was the only clause in this agreement worth anything.  Every other clause in that agreement was an undertaking by the Irish Government to give something to the British.  What were we to do?  We decided that we would do the best we could in the circumstances. We agreed to Clause 2 of Article 4 of the agreement now before the House.  The British were perfectly prepared to give us a formula in any way that we desired which would reconcile our points of view or state our points of view or state what was in practice intended to be done.  We felt, however, that it was essential for us to maintain the interpretation which we contended was the proper interpretation of Article 1.  Accordingly, we declined to agree to any form of words which should be taken in any way to suggest that we adopted or agreed to or <Col N="2159" /> recognised the interpretation put upon that article by the British Government or their advisers.</P>
    <P>We did get, however, something for our manufacturers and we have, I am very glad to say, got something of very considerable importance for them.  The British Government, through their representatives at the conference, stated the position to us that, owing to their international commitments, chiefly owing to Article 9 of the loan agreement with the U.S.A. and the Geneva agreement, and also because of the difficulty in connection with currency and balance of international payments considerations, they were unable to grant our industrial products the rights of free entry which we believed and contended were guaranteed in Clause 1 of Article 1 of the 1938 agreement. They were, however, prepared to go this far&mdash;that to the extent to which they were enabled or permitted, having regard to currency difficulties, balance of payments difficulties and international commitments, they would allow the fullest imports from this country into Great Britain of all our industrial products.  They specifically agreed&mdash;it is not embodied in this agreement expressly, but it was given to me by a person whose word I was prepared to take&mdash;that no domestic consideration would be allowed to enter into the consideration of what industrial products from this country would or could be permitted into Great Britain duty free and without a licence. They were prepared to allow every item of goods into Great Britain which would not involve them in international difficulties by virtue of their international commitments or force them, if goods of Irish origin were allowed into Great Britain, to allow goods of other countries freely into Great Britain.  They would allow all our goods to go in unless in doing so they would have to permit entry to similar goods from countries where hard currency conditions existed.  Subject to this, and allowing no considerations of domestic policy to govern or guide or affect the matter in any way, they would allow in as much industrial exportable <Col N="2160" /> surplus as we had to be exported to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, Clause 2 of Article 5 of this agreement was agreed upon and it recognises that both States adhered to and did not in any way depart from their respective interpretation of Clause 1 of Article 1 of the 1938 agreement. Perhaps I should read the clause in its entirety and explain it.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland contend that under Article 1 (1) of the trade agreement of 1938 the Government of the United Kingdom have undertaken to admit without quantitative restriction the goods to which the article applies, which contention is not accepted by the Government of the United Kingdom: nevertheless and without prejudice to the respective views of the two Governments with regard to the interpretation of this article the Government of the United Kingdom undertake to review forthwith and from time to time the quantitative restrictions imposed on the importation into the United Kingdom of goods grown, produced or manufactured in, and consigned from, Ireland (and not normally subject to bulk purchase by or on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom) with a view to facilitating so far as possible their importation from Ireland, and subject to the need to safeguard the external financial position of the United Kingdom and to achieve and maintain stable equilibrium in its balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The general purport of that article can be summarised in that phrase: &ldquo;With a view to facilitating so far as possible their importation from Ireland.&rdquo;  The British Government undertook to review forthwith and from time to time the quantitative restrictions which they had imposed.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that that review has in fact taken place and that a considerable range of commodities has been agreed upon between the two Governments comprising goods which may be exported from this country to Great Britain without being subject to quantitative restrictions.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has succeeded in having that list agreed upon. <Col N="2161" /> It is not a final list.  It will be reviewed from time to time.  But the list which has been so far agreed upon, and of which details can be given if necessary, at all events in outline, and of which details in particular have been given to the manufacturers concerned or their representatives, will disclose that a very considerable advance has been made.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right to say that the undertaking given in Clause 2 of this Article 4 on behalf of the British Government has been honoured completely in the spirit and in the letter.  They undertook that no domestic consideration would enter into their consideration of what goods we should be entitled to export to Great Britain free of quantitative restrictions.  They have examined the list of goods which officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, under the direction of the Minister, submitted to British officials.  They have examined it not in any niggardly spirit but with the idea of letting in everything they could so far as the commitments to which I have referred permitted them.  It is right that I should pay at least that tribute to the manner in which the approach has been made to the undertaking embodied in Clause 2 of Article 4 which I have just read.</P>
    <P>Article 5 does, in fact, constitute another advance upon the situation as it existed under the trade agreement of 1938.  This article deals with the giving of preferential treatment to our goods. It assures for our products treatment not less favourable than that given to similar products from Commonwealth countries.  That assurance or guarantee was not contained in the 1938 agreement.  The 1938 agreement merely guaranteed freedom from duties under the British Import Duties Act, 1931, and the Ottawa Agreement Act, 1932. But Great Britain did, herself, get under the 1938 agreement a guarantee of most favoured Commonwealth nation treatment which was given under Article 2 of the agreement of 1938, sub-clause (3), for goods entering Ireland.  There was no similar guarantee in respect of Irish goods entering Great Britain.  That guarantee is now given by Article 5.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> There is one other matter in this agreement to which I should like to refer&mdash;the remaining matters are, I think, of detail on which it is not necessary to spend any time.  Article 12 of the 1938 agreement provided that the review of tariffs which was contemplated in Article 8 of the agreement by the Prices Commission should be held first upon the classes of goods for which the Government of the United Kingdom requested early consideration.  Under Article 6 of the present agreement that provision is deleted.  That Article 12 was an article which was regarded as highly obnoxious, particularly by persons engaged in industry in this country.</P>
    <P>It gave the Government of the United Kingdom the right to direct the priority in which the Prices Commission would consider cases submitted to them.  It is now replaced by the clause which states that &ldquo;the review provided for in this article shall be carried out in such order of priority as may be agreed in consultation between the two Governments,&rdquo; and Article 12 of the agreement is completely deleted.  Article 6 also provides that in reference to certain supplies of which we were in need there should be added to Article 16 of the agreement of 1938 the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake to make available in the year 1949 not less than 1,570,000 tons of coal, domestic coke and manufactured fuel.  As regards future years, the Government of the United Kingdom undertake to make every effort to meet any demand in excess of this quantity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Clause 4 of that article deals with the importation of motor cars to specified values.  Under the 1938 agreement motor cars of a value of £750 or more could be admitted here without quantitative restriction.  The clause in this present agreement provides for substituting £1,300 for that £750 so as to favour those people who are engaged in the motor assembly industry.  The agreement is to last for four years.  The agreement of 1938 is to operate with the additions, modifications and provisions made by the present agreement. I recommend to this House and to the <Col N="2163" /> people the acceptance of this agreement. As I said at the outset, I wish neither to exaggerate the benefits secured by this agreement nor to overstate what has been achieved.  The agreement, as it is written, is one thing.  The agreement as it is operated is another thing.</P>
    <P>The benefits which will be derived by the people of this country, whether they are engaged in agriculture or manufacturing industry, will depend upon the spirit in which this agreement is worked.  It was negotiated and evolved in a spirit of friendliness and in a spirit that recognised the difficulties that had to be faced and overcome. Each side fought their own case hard. Each side maintained their own point of view and each side finally came to the compromises which are embodied in this agreement.  It is, as I stated when I returned to this country having initialled the heads of this agreement, an agreement of a type that is made between friends, with which both parties are satisfied and with which neither has a grievance.  The present Leader of the Opposition and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, when recommending the last agreement for acceptance stated that these trade agreements were matters of give and take.  I agree with that description but I wish to add to it what I have already said&mdash;that the benefit which will be derived from this agreement for this country and also for Great Britain will depend upon the spirit in which it is worked in the years to come.  So far as we are concerned we fought our case and fought it hard and they fought their case and fought it hard too.  We fought it in a friendly fashion and left as friends.  It is in that spirit that we believe that this agreement will be honoured and worked in the future and for that reason we believe it will bring great advantages to the agricultural and industrial community. That ends, I think, anything that I have to say for the moment on this agreement.</P>
    <P>There is a matter to which reference should be made because it grows out of the negotiations which took place in <Col N="2164" /> London for this agreement.  It has, in fact, no reference whatever to the trade agreement; nor does the trade agreement in any direct way, at all events, impact upon the matter to which I have referred.  The question of our future expenditure of hard currencies, so far as it involved drawings on the sterling area reserves, was brought forward for discussion by Sir Stafford Cripps, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The result of that discussion was given in the communiqué which was issued at the conclusion of the negotiations.  It is, perhaps, well that I should read it to the House so that Deputies may have their recollections of this part of the communiqué refreshed.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to the matters covered by the formal arrangement it was agreed that pending clarification of the amount of assistance to be received from the United States of America under the European Recovery Programme, the Government of Éire would continue to effect the maximum economy in expenditure of hard currencies and would not exceed the level of expenditure during the first part of 1948.  The Government of Éire will use its utmost endeavours to obtain the maximum amount of aid available under the European Recovery Programme with the object of ensuring as far as practicable that their recourse to the sterling area pool for hard currencies will not involve any ultimate drain on the pool.  The two Governments will keep in close contact with reference to the above arrangements and, in particular, will consult as to the provision of Éire's essential requirements of wheat and coarse grains.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise in regard to these currency arrangements that they are in no sense a part of the agreement which is the subject matter of to-day's consideration.  The understandings agreed upon regarding the use of the sterling pool and other currency aspects were not a consideration so far as either side were concerned in the bargain regarding trade matters.  The discussion on the currency problem took place as a matter of convenience <Col N="2165" /> because our Minister for Finance was there and other Ministers of the Government were present; the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was there and anxious to deal with this very important and very urgent matter from our point of view; and it is for that reason that the discussion on the dollar situation took place at the same time as the negotiation for the trade agreement took place.  At the time of these negotiations, and as Deputies on the opposite side will probably be aware, for a long time previously the British Government was very gravely concerned at the drain on the sterling area reserve of gold and dollars and this anxiety was shared&mdash;naturally shared&mdash; by all members of the sterling area.</P>
    <P>On the 1st January, 1948, these reserves amounted to £512,000,000.  At the 31st March, 1948, they had increased to £552,000,000, but the accretions represented in that figure were not recurrent and, since then, there has been a progressive reduction to a figure of approximately £500,000,000 at the end of June of this year.  Sir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer, informed us that in the view of his Government the level of the reserves should not be further reduced during the period of Marshall Aid and that the reserves must be maintained at their present level in the interests of the sterling area as a whole so that, at the end of the period of aid, sterling would be sufficiently strong to meet any difficulties and readjustments that may arise.  Having regard to our interest in the financial strength of the sterling system we cannot quarrel with that policy.  In the light of that situation we agree to do our utmost to avoid calling on these reserves to meet our hard currency expenditure.</P>
    <P>As a participant in the European Recovery Programme our position is different from that of other sterling area countries like India, Australia, New Zealand and others.  In order to get the utmost for our dollar requirements to make it possible to finance our essential imports from the dollar area, or other hard currency countries, it became essential that we should take advantage of the so-called Marshall Aid, even though it took the form of a loan and not a grant.  Although we <Col N="2166" /> have not abandoned our representations that we should receive it by way of grant as well as by way of loan, we have decided that we must in our own interests accept the loan, if no other assistance by way of grant is available.</P>
    <P>In the course of these discussions dealing with hard currency problems it was recognised by the representatives of the British Government that until we knew definitely what our European Recovery Programme allocations would be we must continue to draw from the sterling area pool.  They did ask, however, and we did agree that we should not increase the level of our dollar expenditure in anticipation of Marshall Aid which could not be guaranteed.  The level of our net dollar expenditure during the first part of 1948 was a little under £1,000,000 a month.  If the amount of American aid which we can receive is greater than that level that limitation of our dollar expenditure has no significance but, in pursuit of the policy of maintaining the sterling area reserve, we ought not to draw dollars from the pool to a greater extent than that which we will be able to replace out of European Recovery Programme loans, or grants, if we get a grant.</P>
    <P>In discussing the level of our hard currency expenditure, which is covered by the formula embodied in the official communiqué, we pointed out to the British&mdash;and they accepted the point&mdash; that our purchases of wheat and coarse grains should not be included in any measurement of our expenditure in relation to the first part of 1948.  If we are able to cover our grain requirements either under European Recovery Programme allocations or by purchases outside the Western Hemisphere there will be no need for concern but, if in default of such solutions, we have to seek dollar provision for our grain requirements from the sterling area pool that will be a matter for consultation between ourselves and the British.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to point out that these matters of currency and approach to the sterling area reserves of dollars and gold have nothing whatever to do with the trade agreement that is before the House.  I thought it proper to refer to the matter here to-day because <Col N="2167" /> I think Deputy Lemass did, on the discussions on my Estimate, make some reference to the question as to what I meant when, at a Press interview, I stated that our anxiety as regards our dollar position had been allayed.  In order that there should be no mystery about that matter I thought it proper to take this opportunity of making the statement that I have just made. Strictly speaking, it is not relevant to the present discussion but I refer to it in the light of the fact that the two discussions took place at or about the same time, and that we discussed our dollar position with the representatives of the British Government while we were in London discussing the trade agreement which is before the House to-day.  I thought, therefore, that it might be proper to refer to the matter in this connection in order that there should be no mystery about it, that there should be no false statement put abroad about it and in order to make it absolutely clear that the statement I made that our anxiety about dollars had been allayed was true and correct in substance and in fact.</P>
    <P>Having made these remarks on the subject of our dollar position, I would like to revert to the business before the House and to recommend for the unanimous acceptance of the House the agreement that we have arrived at.  It is not an agreement that could be referred to as an ideal agreement. There is no such thing as an ideal agreement in this world.  All agreements consist of compromise and give and take, but this agreement, on that basis and in the spirit in which it was entered into, is a good agreement, worthy of the acceptance of this House and of the people.  It is an agreement which gives substantial hope for good results and increased prosperity in the agricultural industry of this country in the years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil is asked to ratify this agreement between the Irish and British Governments, there are certain questions which obviously arise.  The first is whether there are any important features of the agreement which are so objectionable as to <Col N="2168" /> justify us in rejecting it.  The second is whether a better agreement could have been made, and would rejection of this agreement result in the negotiation of a better agreement later.  In this particular case there arises also the question whether our position would be better or worse if we had no agreement, no general comprehensive trade agreement with Great Britain in force under present circumstances, apart from temporary arrangements of limited scope.  Taking those three questions in order, I want to deal first with the objectionable features of this agreement.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach will deny that there are objectionable features.  May I say that in my view by far the most objectionable feature of it is the fact that it is based upon the agreement of 1938?  The Taoiseach said I recommended to the Dáil the ratification of the 1938 agreement and on that account would presumably welcome this modification, this improvement, of that agreement.  I have on many occasions in the past, here and elsewhere, as a Minister and Deputy, expressed my view that the trade agreement of 1938 has long out-lived its usefulness.  It was made, as the Taoiseach admitted, in general world trade conditions entirely different from those now prevailing and it is, in fact, unsuitable to present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will pardon me for intervening.  I made a mistake in the course of my remarks on Article 3 and I wish to correct it.  I think I did say as regards Article 3 that we would be entitled to impose, for protective purposes, quantiative restrictions on goods mentioned in the Schedule.  I should not have referred to quantitative restrictions.  It is only duties, and I wish to correct that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the most objectionable feature of this agreement, in my view, is the fact that it is what the Taoiseach described as a graft on the 1938 agreement.  The Taoiseach has, I think, a wrong conception not merely of the attitude of Deputies on this side of the House to the 1938 agreement but of the nature of that agreement itself.  It was made in 1938 in relation to the circumstances <Col N="2169" /> of 1938 and was expressed to operate for three years, being terminable after three years on six months' notice.</P>
      <P>We have long held the view that it should be terminated and the feature of this supplementary agreement to which I wish to direct the attention of the House is that, while it is still true to-day that we can terminate that agreement and escape from the difficulties which it causes or may cause for this country, we will not be able to do it to-morrow, because, if this supplementary agreement is ratified by the Dáil, then that original agreement upon which it is a graft, the 1938 agreement, becomes binding for a further period of four years and will not be terminable by our unilateral action during that period.</P>
      <P>The objection to the maintenance of the 1938 agreement was not due solely to the attitude taken by the British in regard to their obligations under Article 1.  The objection was to the general nature of the agreement which was determined by the conditions of the time, all of which have changed, as the Taoiseach pointed out, in considerable degree.  There are also objections to the details of this agreement, to the proposals regarding the price of cattle, to the limitations contemplated upon the sales of cattle to more remunerative markets outside Great Britain, to the limitations on the sales of carcase and tinned meat and other matters to which I will refer later.  Whether these objectionable features of the agreement are sufficient to justify the Dáil in rejecting it, or sufficient to justify us in asking the Dáil to reject it, is a question which will very largely be answered by the explanations which will be given in the course of this debate and the replies given to specific queries which we have to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could a better agreement have been made?  I think the answer to that question must be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach and other Ministers who constituted the delegation that negotiated the agreement gave interviews to Press representatives at conferences prior to the negotiations.  During the course of these Press conferences they <Col N="2170" /> indicated what they were seeking to obtain and what they regarded as reasonable for the British to concede.  In the main, they did not get what they proclaimed they were seeking and on that account the agreement must be admitted by them to be less favourable than they had considered it reasonable to except, and presumably on that account we must decide that a better agreement was possible.  I am not by any means convinced, and I do not have to tell Deputies opposite of my lack of conviction, that the rejection of this agreement by the Dáil, the defeat of this motion of approval, would result in the negotiation of a better agreement later, if those negotiations were to be undertaken by the same Ministers.</P>
    <P>Would we be better off without an agreement at all?  This is a point on which I have expressed my opinion frequently in public and in private.  It is a personal view of my own.  It may be that some of my colleagues would feel that circumstances require that we should have some general comprehensive trade agreement with Great Britain, but for myself&mdash;and I have some knowledge of the matters which arise in this connection&mdash;I cannot conceive any circumstances in which the absence of a comprehensive trade agreement in the present situation would leave us worse off than we are with an agreement.  I can conceive that, in fact, it would leave us much better off in many respects.  We can to-day get into that position.</P>
    <P>We have still got the power, under the 1938 agreement, to terminate it by our own action.  By giving the notice contemplated in the agreement, we can bring it to an end in six months' time. The ratification of this amending agreement will deprive us of that power for four years.  I make the case in favour of leaving the position one in which there would be no comprehensive agreement as against the ratification of this amending agreement and the consequential maintenance of the 1938 agreement on the basis of two facts, facts which, I think, cannot be seriously controverted.  The first is that for the next four years, the period during which the British Government <Col N="2171" /> will be bound by this agreement, as well as the Irish Government, the agricultural products which we will have to export, the agricultural products which we are exporting now or can conceivably recommence to export within the next four years will be in worldwide scarcity and little difficulty is to be anticipated in selling them remuneratively somewhere.  The second fact is that for our industrial products the agreement does not go nearly far enough in removing the impediments which now exist, either to the expansion of our export business or increased productivity at home.  Clearly we would have a much freer hand, so far as the development of internal industrial activity is concerned, without an agreement of this character.</P>
    <P>If I am right in these two facts, right in the assumption that so far as our agricultural exports are concerned, we are still in a seller's market and in a position to secure profitable sale, regardless of any trade agreement with Britain, and that that is likely to continue for four years, the period for which the agreement is expressed to run, and if we have not got, in consequence of the provisions of this agreement, a sufficient defence on the industrial side, then there is some case to be made for giving us that liberty of action both in the direction of an export business, and in the development of internal industrial activity which the absence of a comprehensive agreement would imply.  Every trade agreement involves some restriction on our liberty of action, either in the matter of directing our export trade or developing our own internal resources.  This agreement involves such a restriction, and so did the 1938 agreement.  If we can get, in present world conditions, all the advantages in external trade, which this agreement purports to give us, without the agreement, and at the same time enjoy the liberty of action which the absence of the agreement implies, then there seems to be a case for considering it. I do not know whether the Government has considered it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach was quite frank with the Dáil in his <Col N="2172" /> account of the history of the events which led up to the negotiation of the agreement.  He had to base his case on the assumption that we, who negotiated the 1938 agreement, still favoured its retention.  That, as I have said, is not the case.  Shortly after the end of the war I personally, in discussions with Sir Stafford Cripps, then President of the Board of Trade &mdash;and officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce in more formal negotiations with British representatives&mdash;made it known to the British Government that the 1938 agreement was no longer acceptable to us, that we wished to terminate it and to replace it by a new agreement with greater relevancy to post-war trading circumstances or to have no such comprehensive agreement at all until something like stability had returned to world trade.  The British were not anxious at that time either to negotiate a new agreement or to accept our point of view regarding the termination of the old agreement without replacing it by a new one.  At the time of my first discussion with the President of the Board of Trade, it was an anticipation of difficulties likely to arise in the future which prompted our attitude. During the course of 1946 the anticipated difficulties emerged from the provisions of the agreement, and we found its maintenance becoming increasingly irksome.</P>
    <P>Some of the commodities which were specified in the free list had begun to be manufactured in this country during the war and various proposals for the manufacture of other commodities in the free list were being submitted, but were delayed because of our inability to give any assurance of protection against dumping at any time in the future, so long as that article of the trade agreement was maintained.  During the course of another visit to London, I again raised the question of the trade agreement with the President of the Board of Trade and intimated that it was no longer a mere matter of theoretical objection or of anticipating difficulties but that it had become a practical issue and that our interests required that action should be taken on it.  At the time the discussions in Geneva to which the Taoiseach referred <Col N="2173" /> were in prospect and it was contemplated that the charter for an international trade organisation which was signed at Havana in March of this year would, in fact, emerge from an international conference which was planned to be held in 1947.  The British Government were unwilling, and for good cause, to enter into negotiations with us for the conclusion of a new comprehensive trade agreement in advance of the conclusion of the international conference and the opportunity of studying the principles which would be enshrined in the proposed international charter.</P>
    <P>The President of the Board of Trade, however, agreed that we had difficulties emerging from the provisions of the 1938 agreement and that it was unreasonable to ask us to continue to put up with those difficulties until it became possible to make a new agreement after the conclusion of the international conference, and so he undertook to discuss the variation of the provisions of the 1938 agreement with a view to meeting our difficulties and to operate the new agreement, as varied, pending the general negotiations. It was, I think, in April, 1947, that representatives of the Board of Trade came to Dublin and negotiated the arrangement concerning Article 5 of the 1938 trade agreement, relating to the free list, and the article dealing with the quota restrictions on motor cars, and arrived at an agreement which was in principle very similar to what is set out in this agreement.</P>

      <P>A secret agreement was not our desire.  If that point is going to be made I will deal much more fully with the negotiations that took place, but maybe the Deputy who made the remark will discuss the matter with his more intelligent leaders before he repeats it.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the history of the effort to get an amendment to Article 5, but I want to discuss the origin of Article 5 itself.  The Taoiseach has spoken of the 1938 agreement and of Article 5 as if they constituted millstones around the neck of this country which we could never get rid of.  I want to emphasise the fact that the agreement was an agreement for three years only.  The list of goods scheduled to Article 5 upon which we undertook not to impose tariffs were goods which were not made in this country in 1938 and which we did not anticipate would be made here in the three years after 1938.  We undertook to leave them free of custom duties for three years, but at the end of three years we had, first of all, the right under Article 18 of the 1938 agreement to go to the British Government for a revision of the list; and, secondly, if we did not get a revision satisfactory to ourselves, we had the right to terminate the agreement altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite frankly cannot understand the Taoiseach's reference to the operation of Article 5 in the disorganisation of our trade balance.  Surely any Deputy who examines that list will agree with me that our main complaint against Britain is not that they are sending us excessive quantities of these goods, but that they are not sending us enough. In the main, the goods set out there constitute various classes of industrial and agricultural machinery, chemical products and other industrial raw materials which we need.  In so far as the list contains goods in other categories the total trade in them is a <Col N="2175" /> mere bagatelle compared with the total value of our imports.  It is misleading to suggest that the operation of Article 5 in present circumstances has contributed to this distortion of our balance of trade to which the Taoiseach referred and to which I propose to refer again later.</P>
    <P>The further provision in relation to Article 5 and the free list scheduled thereto, dealt with in Article 4 of this agreement, do not appear to me to give any advantage to the Government in regard to the protection of industrial expansion here.  The right to impose tariffs on goods up to 40 per cent. of the pre-war trade in these goods is an advantage which was secured last year and which has only been formally confirmed and published in the agreement.</P>

      <P>As far as I was concerned, the agreement which was made last year was adequate to meet any <Col N="2176" /> immediate difficulties that had emerged and it was also adequate to enable us to give an assurance of protection to any industrial projects then current, and was adequate to safeguard the position until the negotiations which were contemplated during this year had taken place and had been concluded. It was contemplated, therefore, right from the first contacts we had with Great Britain after the ending of the war, that a new trade agreement would be negotiated.  The postponement of the negotiation of that agreement until this year was a result of the British Government's desire to postpone it until after the conclusion of the Havana conference.  It was, therefore, inevitable that negotiations should have taken place.</P>
      <P>The question for the Government to decide in relation to those negotiations was whether they should direct their efforts to a completely new agreement, whether they should be confined to an amendment of the 1938 agreement, or whether it might not be better to give notice as specified in Article 19 of the 1938 agreement to terminate it and let trade matters for the time being between ourselves and the British Government be arranged by temporary agreements limited in scope and time and confined to the commodities to which they would refer.  The Government, however, decided to negotiate upon the basis of an amendment of the 1938 agreement, and that is my main objection to the agreement.  The 1938 agreement is a bad basis on which to build a four years' arrangement regulating all our trade with Great Britain and I think that it would have been much wiser to have given the time and attention required to the conclusion of a new agreement which would relate to modern post-war trade conditions, or to have made temporary <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements governing the needs of current trade and to postpone making the new agreement until later when the general trend of future international trade conditions might be more clearly visualised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not quite make out from the Taoiseach's speech whether he is recommending this agreement to the Dáil as a good agreement or as the <Col N="2177" /> best the Government could make in the circumstances or as something just a trifle better than nothing at all.  In various parts of his speech the Taoiseach appeared to approach the question of the agreement in different moods.  I may say that his various Ministerial colleagues who participated in the negotiations with him and who have spoken about the agreement in public have also varied in their attitude towards it from one extreme to the other.  It is, of course, recognised by us that no Government could draw up an international trade agreement in precisely the terms they desire.  I think it is a good thing in the political development of this State that that fact is now recognised by the Taoiseach and his Ministerial colleagues. Every agreement is the outcome of negotiations and in these negotiations some concessions must be reluctantly given in order to get advantages which are considered of greater importance.</P>

      <P>That is the point I have expressed.  It is a great tragedy that that was not always recognised by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and those who sit on the Government Benches with him.  I think the mistake this Government made in relation to these negotiations is that they talked too much before entering the negotiations.  I think they talked themselves into this position, that they had for political reasons to make some agreement, no matter how inadequate or how bad.  As a result of their pre-negotiation speeches and their Press interviews they put themselves in the position that, no matter what line the British Government took, they had to come back with an agreement.  Do not tell me that the British Government did not fully realise the tactical blunder they made and take full advantage of it.  They should have left themselves in the position that, if at any stage of the negotiations it appeared that the British Government were driving too hard a bargain or were taking a line which, if pursued, would <Col N="2178" /> be detrimental to our economic interests, they could have broken off the negotiations and come home to think in an Irish atmosphere before going back to resume negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, they deprived themselves of that tactical advantage by their unnecessary loquacity before meeting the British negotiators.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is agreement in this Dáil as to what should be the aims of an Irish Government in concluding international trade negotiations. The Taoiseach did express them in part.  In all negotiations now and in the future we must endeavour to avoid placing any limitations on our power or intention to promote such economic developments as we here deem to be practical, including the power and the intention of assisting them by the restriction of imports. Secondly, we must endeavour to secure opportunity of developing markets abroad for our exportable surplus at prices which are fair to our producers, and, generally, to create conditions favourable for trade expansion. Thirdly, we must in present conditions, which conditions may continue for many years yet, have particular regard to securing in trade negotiations access to supplies of materials and equipment which are required for our development and also, in these post-war circumstances, endeavour to protect ourselves against unfair treatment either in regard to prices, qualities, quantities, or delivery of goods purchased abroad which we must either obtain from a single supplier for practical reasons or which we undertake in trade agreements to purchase from a particular supplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives which the delegates who concluded this agreement had before them are, presumably, those I have mentioned.  Certainly, in their unwise pre-negotiation declarations they gave indication of what they were seeking, which were, in the main, unobjectionable.  According to the various statements made at Press Conferences, particularly that held in London, the delegation set out to <Col N="2179" /> secure, first of all, the same price for Irish cattle as Britain pays English and Six-County farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that at a Press conference in London. He said that the Irish delegation were making the following demands: (1) Ireland wants the same price for her cattle and poultry that Great Britain pays British and Six-County farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement that he said that.  They did not get that.  I do not know what point the Taoiseach was trying to make out to-day, but I take it and I am correct in saying that Irish-bred cattle will not obtain in Britain the same price as English-bred cattle.  Is not that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference of 5/- a cwt. and there may be more. Secondly, according to this statement at that Press conference, the delegation were seeking a modification of Article 5 of the 1938 agreement.  They knew and I knew that that modification had already been agreed to and that it was merely a matter of putting it in words and embodying it in the agreement.  Thirdly, they were seeking the acceptance of our interpretation of Article 1 of the 1938 agreement and, in that regard, the Taoiseach mentioned particularly books, periodicals and tweeds.  May I inquire now whether these commodities are amongst those in respect of which an arrangement has been entered into with Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Books and periodicals were the commodities in respect of which the action of the British Government in restricting imports from this country had the most immediate effect on production arrangements here, and were the matter which raised the whole issue in the first instance with the British authorities.  They were seeking to obtain coal at the British home <Col N="2180" /> market price.  They did not get that. There is in this agreement, however, an undertaking on behalf of the British which I interpret as meaning that they will supply in 1949 the same quantity of coal as they will supply in 1948.  I take it that 1,500,000 tons are roughly what we will get this year and they are undertaking to supply to us the same quantity as this year.  Was there any undertaking in regard to quality?  Was there any undertaking sought in regard to quality?  Was there any agreement that included in that quantity of coal to be delivered supplies of foundry coke?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am trying to make.  The delegation went over there to negotiate. They had certain advantages.  They had the advantage of having for sale foodstuffs which the British Government required.  Surely they thought they should get in return for these foodstuffs something more than a fair price?  Surely they should have endeavoured to obtain an undertaking from the British to supply us with the goods we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but what happened?  We made a temporary arrangement and left officers behind us to specify to the British Government the commodities we required them to supply to us.  That was the position up to the time the change of Government took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was just what you did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and let me say&mdash;because it is a view I have held for a long time&mdash;that in present circumstances it is bad national business to negotiate trade agreements for the export of agricultural products in return for nothing except a fair price for these products.  The Taoiseach told us that so far as cattle are concerned <Col N="2181" /> there were countries on the Continent which were willing to enter into trade agreements for a period of four years, just as long as this trade agreement is to operate, to secure quantities of cattle at prices in excess of those which the British have agreed to, and that we could get from these countries goods we need and from one of them, at least, hard currency.  They would not do it. Why not?</P>
      <P>May I get an explanation as to why we should not take advantage of the willingness of Continental countries to enter into trade agreements of the same duration as the agreement with the British Government which are more advantageous to our cattle producers and which, in addition to securing a higher price for cattle, will give us what the British were unwilling to undertake to give us, namely, the goods we require?  If we do not get those undertakings from the British Government, why make an agreement at all?  If the British Government will not give us the industrial commodities which we require to maintain employment here to secure the increase in output Ministers are talking about, why make a four-year trade agreement? Why not say to them as we said:  &ldquo;We will make a temporary agreement until you are prepared to make the type of permanent agreement we require.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For negotiations&mdash;and these negotiations would have taken place if there had been no change of Government.  You carried out the <Col N="2182" /> negotiations for us and made an inadequate agreement because you failed to realise your bargaining powers and because you talked yourselves out of the use of your bargaining power by these stupid, unnecessary statements made in advance of the negotiations.  Not merely are we undertaking for four years to supply our agricultural exports to Great Britain at prices which are, in the main, indeterminate and not merely have we not secured from Great Britain an undertaking to supply us with the things we need, including coal &mdash;not merely could we not get from them an agreement to supply that coal to us at the British domestic price&mdash; but we are continuing the provision of the 1938 agreement under which we must keep a tariff in operation against coal from non-British sources.  Is that not so?  If we are to maintain the position in which we have to impose a tariff upon possible supplies of coal from sources other than Great Britain are we not to be entitled to be regarded as part and parcel of the market to be supplied at the British home prices?  Of course we are.  I am quite certain that the Ministers' officers endeavoured to get the British Government to agree to supply coal at the British price&mdash;they said so&mdash;but they did not succeed.  I think they would have had a much better chance of success if they had done what I suggested they should do&mdash;at some stage of the negotiations to come home for a week or a fortnight&mdash;without making a speech to the British telling them how much you loved them and that you had come over to make the type of agreement they wanted.  In addition, the Minister for Industry and Commerce proclaimed to the Press conference before the negotiations that they were seeking to obtain British industrial raw materials at the prices at which they are supplied to the British manufacturers.  Did he seek that in the negotiations?  Was it merely window dressing at the Press conference before the negotiations? Did he talk about that matter to the President of the Board of Trade and did he get a refusal from the President of the Board of Trade to supply us with the industrial raw materials <Col N="2183" /> required by our manufacturers at the prices at which they are supplied to British manufacturers who are competing in this market with our producers?</P>
      <P>We all know that there is a range of industrial raw materials for which our manufacturers have to pay prices ranging up to 25 per cent. above the prices at which British manufacturers can buy them.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows, or should know, that that differentiation in price between industrial raw material supplied here and in Great Britain is in many cases enforced at the direction of the President of the Board of Trade. He knows that there are in England many firms who were anxious to supply goods here last year at prices which were reasonable and fair to our manufacturers, but who were instructed by the Board of Trade to sell them only at higher prices.  Did the Minister not think it wise to have sought a rectification of that situation when he was making a four-year trade agreement? Remember that this is a four-year agreement.  I ask the Deputies opposite to keep in mind the fact that when it is ratified here we cannot in honour escape from it for four years.  We need not have entered into a four-year agreement unless we got a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the undertaking set out in Article 1, sub-paragraph 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland undertake to use their best endeavours to increase exports of agricultural products to the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to talk again later on the full significance of that article and what it means in the agreement.  Of course, we had Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, saying that they were going to double British purchases of Irish fat cattle and a lot of other things that nobody took seriously.</P>

      <P>Stop muttering.  Under Article 1 of the trade agreement the Government of Ireland undertake to use their best endeavours to increase exports of agricultural products to the United Kingdom.  What does that undertaking involve us in?  Does it imply that for the period of four years we are going to exercise power to direct all agricultural exports to the British market even if we can find more profitable markets for them elsewhere? Are we undertaking that, regardless of world conditions or variations in world trade, we will divert all our exportable surplus to Great Britain?  Does it mean, or can it be interpreted as meaning, that we are undertaking to eat less of our own foods in order to increase exports to Great Britain?  The Taoiseach spoke about reasons for the decline in the export of our cattle.  He omitted one reason, which is supported by the statistics, and that is the enormous increase in the consumption of meat in Ireland.  It may be that the increase is not as great as the statisticians would suggest because they probably attribute to our people the consumption of all the cattle that went by night over the Border and are not recorded in the trade statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But on the basis of the available statistics there has been a very substantial increase in home consumption during the war and it might, perhaps, explain some of the manoeuvrings of the Minister for Agriculture and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in relation to the price of meat and the price of cattle if we interpret Article 1 of this agreement as involving on us not merely an obligation to divert supplies to Great Britain, even if there are better markets elsewhere, but to eat less meat ourselves in order to increase the export of agricultural <Col N="2185" /> products to Great Britain.  I would remind the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach of how the very clear obligation of the British Government under Article 1 of the 1938 agreement was dodged by them when it suited them to dodge it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to know what it might mean.  The Dáil is being asked to bind itself to this agreement for four years and we should get from a responsible Minister something more than a statement of what it might mean.  Surely, we should be told what it does mean.  Do the Ministers know what obligation we are being asked to undertake there?  The Taoiseach spoke of Article 2 and made particular reference to our balance of payments.  In that regard he made a gratuitously insulting remark that the previous Government was not concerned about the growth in the adverse trade balance and neglected the interests of the nation in that connection.  Let me say this about the adverse trade balance: so far as the public are aware there is no need for the &ldquo;utmost alarm&rdquo; to which the Taoiseach referred.  We know that in the year 1946 our external trade closed with a balance in our favour.  We know that when all the items were taken into account, all receipts and all payments, there was a net addition to our external assets in <Col N="2186" /> that year.  We know that in the year 1947 there was a net deficit&mdash;a small deficit&mdash;very small in relation to the gap in visible trade.  It was a deficit which was not a lot greater, if greater, than the net credit of 1946.  I do not know how the balance of trade is moving this year.  We see that there is on visible trade, apparently, a large deficit; but if the Taoiseach wants to convince the Dáil that there is need for the &ldquo;utmost alarm,&rdquo; need for restricting necessary imports in order to diminish the adverse balance of external payments, then he has got to give the Dáil more information than he has done.</P>
      <P>No successful policy in relation to the adjustment of the trade situation can be attempted without public cooperation, which cannot be obtained without giving to the public the information upon which the Taoiseach based his statement.  From my own point of view, let me say that during the war we unwillingly and unavoidably built up in Great Britain an accumulation of sterling assets.  That accumulation represented Irish unrequited exports. It represented the purchase price of goods which we sent out and which we could not use to buy the goods we needed in Great Britain because of the restrictions imposed by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I think it would be a good thing for this country if we could take a substantial proportion of these sterling assets of ours and translate them into machinery and equipment, the items which are mentioned in the free list schedule to Article 5, and bring them in here. These assets of ours would be far more valuable utilised here, employing people here, increasing output here, than in financing the importation of goods form abroad.  I refuse to be perturbed about the fact that we are succeeding in translating some proportion of these external assets into physical goods.  I think it is a good thing if we can do that now and I say that, unless the Taoiseach has some reason to assert&mdash;some assurance&mdash;that the British Government is not contemplating the devaluation of sterling at some time during this four-year period, <Col N="2187" /> then there should be a policy of the Government to encourage people to transform their claims upon sterling from British securities and British bank balances into goods, preferably capital goods, and thereby get real wealth into this country&mdash;real wealth of permanent value, as against these paper claims, the value of which is very largely outside our control.</P>
    <P>I agree that it may be that circumstances may arise during the four years in which power to restrict on balance of payment grounds the importation of some classes of goods now in the free list may be important.  It is foolish to pretend that you have got real power to do that under the provisions of Article 2 of this agreement.  Article 2, as I interpret it, involves, first of all, the preparation of a list of those goods which the Government might wish to restrict; secondly, the presentation of that list to the British Government; and, thirdly, the obtaining of their agreement to the list.  An agreed list having been prepared, there follows the imposition of quantitative restrictions on those goods, again subject to the agreement of the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there is the agreed list.  Is it agreed that the list must be agreed?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland shall thereupon, notwithstanding the provisions of the said article, be entitled to impose on the import of the goods in question such quantitative restrictions or import duties as they think fit and as may be agreed between the Governments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know if that article can be interpreted otherwise than I have interpreted it.  If there is another interpretation possible, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce will tell us what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the references in Article 4 of this agreement as to the deletion of the time limitation on the operation of Articles 1 and 2 of the 1938 agreement, I am anxious to get some information.  Article 1 of the <Col N="2188" /> trade agreement gave the right of free entry into Great Britain but so far as eggs, poultry, butter, cheese and other milk products are concerned that right was enjoyed by us on a contract basis up to the 20th August, 1940, and no longer.  That time limitation has been removed, but will the Minister tell me if it is not in fact correct that these commodities&mdash;eggs, poultry, butter, cheese and other milk products&mdash;are at the present time purchased under bulk contracts by the British Government and that, in fact, the deletion of that time provision in present circumstances means nothing at all and will not mean anything unless and until private trading in these commodities is restored to Great Britain?  Is there any likelihood that private trading in these commodities will be restored in the next four years?  With regard to Article 2 of the 1938 agreement, which gave us a right to certain preferences set out in the schedule, again I suggest that these goods are in the main at the present time subject to bulk purchase by the British Government and in that regard also the deletion of that provision means very little unless private trade is restored.</P>
    <P>It is precisely that point which makes me advocate the complete abandonment of the 1938 agreement as the basis of any trade arrangement with Great Britain.  It does not apply. So far as these commodities are concerned&mdash;eggs, butter and other things which the British Government buy in bulk at whatever prices they negotiate and sell at a price which has frequently no relation to their cost&mdash;the right of free entry and preference means nothing. What is important is the commercial contract they are prepared to make to buy stated quantities at a stated price for a certain period.  That is the type of commercial contract which should have been negotiated in London and which would have been of some real importance to the country, instead of this vague arrangement, based on the amendment of an out-of-date agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 1, reverting to what the Taoiseach said, I understand he has obtained from the British Government an assurance that they <Col N="2189" /> will not plead considerations of domestic policy in imposing restrictions contrary to that article upon Irish exports to Great Britain.  I find it difficult to follow the ever-shifting attitude of the British Government in relation to that article.  Within a few months before I ceased to be Minister there was an assurance form them that they would not advance balance of payment considerations as a reason for restricting Irish imports.  Now we have them putting balance of payment considerations as one of the grounds upon which they might operate contrary to the provisions of that article.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that it was not until they had to find some excuse for breaking their obligations under that article during 1947 that they began to interpret it in the way which they are now doing, and time after time, in official and unofficial contacts with their representatives, different arguments were advanced and different reasons given. I put on record here that there was, as late as November, 1947, an assurance given by the representative of the Board of Trade that balance of payment considerations would not be advanced as a reason for restricting Irish imports contrary to the provisions of that article.</P>

      <P>To our official representatives engaged in negotiations with the Board of Trade in London at that time.  There is in the Minister's Department an official record.  We are told they will not advance domestic policy considerations.  It is true that they did in the past advance considerations of domestic policy as justifying their ignoring of that article.  They claimed that some textiles and other goods shipped from here did not conform to their utility specifications, or were for sale at prices different from the controlled prices of British products.  Am I to understand now that Irish products will not be excluded from Great Britain merely because they will be available at prices different from the controlled prices of the British products, or merely because they do not conform to any utility or standard <Col N="2190" /> specification which may be in force in Great Britain from time to time? These are considerations of internal politics and I take it the assurance given by the Taoiseach is that they will not be advanced in the future as a justification for the exclusion of Irish goods from the British market.</P>

      <P>I explained to the House that under the general agreement on tariffs and trade a party to it is bound by certain obligations.  If there were, under that general agreement on tariffs and trade, an obligation to impose a tariff on a particular country because of the fact that a previous tariff had been put on&mdash;take it in the case of eggs or poultry of non-Commonwealth origin, eggs from France or any place like that&mdash;and if the British Government decided to raise that duty then, under the general agreement on tariffs and trade, they would be bound to raise the duty on Irish eggs because of the obligation undertaken by that general agreement on tariffs and trade.

      <P>Under the general agreement on tariffs and trade there is an obligation undertaken by the British Government.  If that Government imposes a tariff on French eggs, it must therefore impose it upon Irish eggs coming in.  That is the provision in the general agreement.  If that is done, and it has to be done under the obligation of the Geneva agreement, then the existing margin of preference is maintained.  Is that clear?</P>

      <P>It is not clear to me. Prior to the Geneva discussions there were consultations between the British and ourselves and any variations in their tariff rates which appear to affect us, likely to follow from the Geneva discussions, were agreed with us before the British agreed to them there.  So far as I remember, the only case in which that happened was in regard to condensed milk.  Has there been any case since?  Has anything happened which necessitates this clause in the agreement?  If the British have entered into agreements at Geneva which will become of wider application <Col N="2192" /> under the Havana Convention, which involves the imposition of duties on Irish eggs, butter and poultry, we can be told now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Eggs, poultry and butter, so far as I know, are not within the scope of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, but they may be hereafter, and, if they are, and a duty is put upon them, that will involve putting a similar duty on goods of Irish origin and this proviso maintains our right to preference.</P>

      <P>The basis of the discussions pre-Geneva and at Geneva was this, that if any country suffered in its trade by reason of these negotiations, such as by having a rate of duty created against it or a margin of preference reduced, it was entitled to a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  What did we get?  We are surrendering something here.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1938 agreement, which will be the basic trade agreement for the next four years, we are entitled to export these goods free of customs duty to Great Britain.  We are proposing to surrender that right, subject to our margin of preference being retained.  Have we got nothing in return for it?  It seems that there is definitely involved here some concession on our part to the British Government which we need not have made and which we should make only if there was some advantage to be secured from it.  It may be that it is good policy to make it.  It may be that it is better for us to contemplate a situation in four years' time in which we would still have the right to preference set out in the schedule of the 1938 agreement, even with duties against us, if the alternative is the withdrawal of the right to preference in consequence of the ending of the agreement.</P>
      <P>What is the significance of Article 5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture <Col N="2193" /> of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What goods sent from this country to Great Britain are dutiable at preferential rates?  I do not know what goods are involved there, if any.  If there are any goods which, at present, are dutiable at preferential rates on entry into Great Britain from this country, are we contemplating a situation in which the British can vary the duty on these goods, despite the conditions of the trade agreement of 1938, without notification to us?</P>
    <P>I again want to remind the Dáil of what the British are not undertaking. The temptation in discussing an agreement of this kind is to confine one's observations to what is in it but the most important part of this document is what is not in it.  The most significant part is what is left out.  We enter into an arrangement with them under which we agree to supply them with cattle, eggs and poultry, and even undertake to use our best endeavours to increase exports of agricultural products to Britain in return for some advantage.  What advantage?  What advantage over and above the increase in the fact cattle prices was secured or sought?  We are anxious to get supplies of quantities of fertilisers and agricultural machinery from Great Britain.  We know that the British Government can supply them.  We know that they will, in fact, supply some quantities this year but, if we are making a four years' agreement, should we not endeavour to put on them the obligation to send us supplies of agricultural fertilisers and the machinery required for agricultural production, on a basis as favourable to our farmers as they are allowing these goods to be supplied to their own?</P>
    <P>We did not seek, or apparently did not succeed in imposing, any obligation to supply our industrial manufacturers <Col N="2194" /> with the raw materials which we normally get from them and of which they are our natural source of supply. Much less did we get an undertaking that the raw materials would be supplied at a fair price.  Where the British know that we must get these materials from them, or go without, they have not hesitated to profiteer at our expense in the present situation.  Where they have a greater interest in developing the trade in manufactured goods with this country instead of the trade in the raw materials which we would use to manufacture these goods, they have curtailed and restricted supplies and sent our manufacturers abroad to other and more expensive markets. Did we seek in these negotiations to get any undertaking in regard to cotton yarns or rayon yarns or any of the other things which we have not been able to secure in adequate quantities from them in the past?  I have already referred to the need for an undertaking that they trade fairly with us, particularly in the matter of supplying Irish manufacturers with industrial materials on the same basis as they have supplied their own manufacturers. When we talk about the dumping of goods we know that when they have got an occasional surplus of manufactured goods they have not hesitated to ship them in here at prices which were destructive of normal trading conditions and which helped to disorganise employment in Irish factories.</P>

It is neither to the advantage of our industrialists nor to the consumers of industrial products.  It is far better to deal with dumping by stopping it at its source.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there an effort made to secure some assurance of priority in regard to the supply of necessary industrial machinery?  The Board of Trade will say, of course, that there is no priority list, but anybody with experience in these matters knows that there is what is called the Prime Minister's list.  The Prime Minister circularises industrial firms giving a list of the countries or a list of the firms to be supplied in priority with such machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have on many occasions raised this question of the Prime Minister's list and endeavoured to get some assurance that we would receive preferential treatment in the delivery of equipment essential for our industries. It may be that many of our industrial firms were not entitled to get, and should not get, preference to other industrial buyers of plant and equipment in other parts of the world or Great Britain.  We needed equipment for electrical development, dredging and the establishment of essential manufacturing enterprises and in return for what we are giving we <Col N="2196" /> should get some assistance of priority from Great Britain.  Remember, we are giving all we have and that we are undertaking to give all we have for four years.  These are the things they need and we should expect in return some assistance in obtaining what we require.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the hostility to this agreement which has developed among certain members of the Dáil and of the public is very largely attributable to the excessive claims that were made concerning it by its negotiators before it was finally drafted or published.  I think that the undue satisfaction with the provisions of the agreement that the Government expressed was very bad tactics, not bad tactics in political interests, but in national interests.  It is certainly going to make it very much harder for some other body of negotiators in the future to improve on the present agreement.  Whatever the Ministers may have felt inwardly regarding their labours in London, they should have had more moderation in proclaiming it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to open discussions on questions affecting our dollar position, but I want a clarification of the position.  I will seek that clarification by expressing it as I understand it, and by asking some Minister to tell me if I am wrong before the debate concludes.  We have undertaken before the European recovery <Col N="2197" /> programme loans are available to keep our drawings upon the dollar pool to a minimum, and after the European recovery programme loans are available that we will not draw upon the dollar pool more than we put into it.  That is, as I understand it, the financial arrangement which was made and published conjointly with the trade negotiations.  In so far as we have undertaken that our drawings will not involve a net drain upon the dollar pool, have we got a similar undertaking from the British Government?  The future position is that we will get loans of dollars from America under the European recovery programme, loans which will be adequate to finance our essential purchases in dollar areas.  The goods purchased with these dollars will be sold here in Ireland to firms or individuals for Irish currency or sterling. The Irish currency or sterling accruing from the sale of these goods purchased with European recovery programme dollars, will be put into a special account in the Bank of Ireland, and, when sterling again becomes freely convertible into dollars, that fund in the Bank of Ireland will be converted into dollars and the loan repaid.  I want to know if that is the position.  I am assuming that I am correct in my interpretation of the various announcements which have been made by the administrator of the European recovery programme that, under that programme, the loan will not commence to be repayable until sterling convertibility has been restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the situation, I would not regard it as unsatisfactory.  Having regard to the general difficulties of the time it is a workable arrangement which does not recessarily involve any continuing international obligations that we might not be able to meet. For some reason, however, the Government is reluctant to be clear on the matter.  I know that in the Department of Finance there is a certain hesitation about talking about these matters regarding foreign exchange and the difficult features of our financial policy in the general belief that these are matters which only experts should discuss and which common <Col N="2198" /> people should not be expected to understand. This childish attitude is all right in times of peace, but in present circumstances it is important that a clear understanding of the position should exist among the business community because people are making plans, or thinking of making plans, for various industrial and commercial developments but which they are postponing until they can see their way clearly ahead.  If they can foresee a situation in which enough dollars will be made available to purchase goods in dollar areas in circumstances in which the Government need not hesitate to draw dollars and use them, then our prospects of progress are greatly enhanced. If that is the situation, if we are accumulating dollar liabilities and against it equivalent sterling assets, the liability not becoming due until the sterling assets can be used to redeem it, that is all right, but if that is not so, I think that some explanation other than loose generalities should be given to us.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that the agreement is not altogether a bad agreement, but is a poor agreement.  A very much better agreement could have been made.  I say in all honesty that I doubt very much if we should have been satisfied to have made it.  We should have held out for a far more definite commitment on the British side to meet our requirements and to give us the things we need on terms that would be fair.  I think that we would have preferred to have postponed the conclusion of the negotiations until we had got some assurance that we would be met on those points.  But if I have put a correct interpretation on the agreement, then unless it emerges that there are some new obligations that have not been referred to, I do not think it is one that the Dáil should reject.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, considered that negotiations should be opened in May, 1946, for the purpose of seeing whether he could get some concessions on the free list under Article 5.  It dragged on from May, 1946.  Certain discussions were held in <Col N="2200" /> April, 1947, and finally an agreement was made and agreed to by the British on the 3rd December, 1947.  Finally, there was a minute agreed to by the British on 3rd December, 1947, two months before the Deputy went out of office, to the effect that the British were prepared to grant certain concessions under Article 5 without determining any percentage of the articles and provided they were notified in advance of the articles which the Government here wanted to protect.  Deputy Lemass was negotiating with the British Government from May, 1946, until December, 1947, and the result of these negotiations was this agreed minute.</P>

The Deputy told us that we would be better off without any agreement.  He did not tell us why they did not denounce the 1938 agreement.  Had they not an absolutely free hand to denounce it? The British could not prevent that.  It was provided in that agreement that we could give six months' notice to terminate it.  Why did not the Deputy do it?  There may be a very good reason for it.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the number of people who were deceived by Deputy de Valera's arguments for 16 years?  Let me get back to the agreement. Deputy Lemass challenged us about the meaning of Article 1 and said that it would mean this, that and the other thing.  That came well from people who were parties to the drafting of Article 1 of the 1938 agreement.  The fact of the matter is that we have brought back an agreement which is a very marked advance on the 1938 agreement and which puts us to-day in an infinitely better position both as regards agriculturists and industrialists than six months ago.  There is no question about that.  Before we went to London we found that, under the interpretation which they were placing on Article 1 of the 1938 agreement, the British were not allowing into their country any of our industrial surplus. We found that such things as hand-woven tweeds, homespuns, seaweed meal, and a variety of other commodities, which were providing useful work for our people, particularly in rural areas, had been completely stopped.  However, we had somewhere around £150,250,000 worth of homespuns and hand-woven tweeds in this country in the hands both of the cottagers and of Gaeltacht industries for which we had no outlet.  The Deputy wanted the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, as the Taoiseach said, that before the talks in London had ended we had got the members of the British delegation to the point that they agreed that, except in so far as they were limited by international agreements or currency considerations, they were prepared forthwith to have a review to see what goods from this country they could let in and that no domestic consideration would be allowed to operate to the exclusion of our goods.  The officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce here <Col N="2204" /> and the officials of the Board of Trade in Britain sat down to see if they could work out a list.  Remember that under the article we could not get in anything there before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to get in everything under that article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's contention and it is mine, too.  We are at one on that.  I am saying that we were not able to get them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We were entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands quite well that I am not for a moment contesting his interpretation of Article 1.  It is the same as ours I am saying that it is a fact that under the British interpretation of the article you were not able to get the goods in. Before I start to read this list I should like to say that I know the Deputies opposite will pick holes here and there and try to belittle it.  However, in all the circumstances it is fairly substantial, and I am glad to say it is going to be very useful for our people.  It is something tangible and something practical achieved.  Let me run through the commodities.  For obvious reasons I do not propose to give here the detailed quantities, figures and amounts.</P>
      <P>If Deputy de Valera or Deputy Lemass desire I shall let them have a copy of the list.  They will understand why I am not prepared to broadcast them here.  I should say that they will, of course, be made available to the various manufacturers and industrialists concerned.  Import licences will be granted for the importation into Great Britain and Northern Ireland of Irish goods of the following descriptions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister said that import licences will be granted I take it that import licences will still be required.  Will there need to be individual application or will there be general licences open to everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will let me read it, and I will have a copy of it sent to him.</P>

    <P>In the next list generous quotas have been fixed for the admission of the following goods into Great Britain and Northern Ireland between now and the end of 1948, when the position will again be reviewed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Ash stems; Aspro tablets; brushes; buttons (other than those made from vegetable matter or dum nut); trailer caravans; combs; dyes; rat paste; drinking glasses; bulrush powder puffs; limestone scantlings; tennis <Col N="2206" /> racquet frames; Irish poplin and poplin ties; women's footwear; raffia sandals; sisal matting.</P>
    <P>A further list provides that small quantities of the following goods will also be admitted into Great Britain and Northern Ireland between now and the end of 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Cosmetics and toilet preparations: soft toys; knitted gloves; enamel brooches.</P>
    <P>That is as far as the list has been examined up to date.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that import licences will be forthcoming for some, if not all, of the following types of goods, the position of which is still being examined:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Antiques; plasterboard; paper; ornamental stone-work; wallboard; women's clothing; shellfish; custard powder, jelly and blancmange; pet foods; medicinal foliage; liver extract; moulded brush stocks.</P>
    <P>With regard to books and periodicals, I would point out that there are lists here of goods which they are not prepared to allow in because, for some reason or other, they are caught under Article 9 of the international agreement or some other agreement.  I should like to say that the value of the manufactured goods which can be exported to Britain between now and the end of the year which formerly were proscribed from entry into Britain will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of, if all are included, about £750,000.  That is an approximate figure.  I have the exact figures for something over £500,000.  There are other commodities on which it is not possible at the moment to put a cash value, but the figure is somewhere between £500,000 and £750,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not committing myself.  They are committing themselves to accepting those, if they want to.  Deputy Lemass wants to know what we are getting.  That list is something. <Col N="2207" /> I am not saying that it is everything I should like to get but I am satisfied that it is a substantial advance on the position.  That is something that is going to be of considerable value and I think the Deputy will agree with me on that.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  Contrary to what the Deputies opposite seem to think, I do not want to do so in a controversial way.  To Deputy Lemass I would say that, taking Articles 2 and 3 of the new agreement that is now before us, his pet bug and the main reason why he was so anxious to terminate the 1938 agreement, namely the free list, has gone completely. There is no use in trying to push aside the value of that free list. Deputy Lemass never minimised it before.  He always regarded it as very important.  It was his main, if not his sole, reason for wishing to terminate the 1938 agreement.  The Deputy will agree that under Article 3&mdash;at the moment dealing with the 40 per cent.&mdash; for practical purposes it does not matter very much whether it is 40 per cent. or 100 per cent.  In our lifetime we are unlikely to see the position where we will be producing or even likely to produce in this country the full 40 per cent. of the articles there. I think the Deputy will agree with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Take that in conjunction with our power under Article 2 for balance of payment purposes.  I say that in effect the free list is dead. We were unable to get rid of what was even to Deputy Lemass another objectionable feature of the 1938 agreement &mdash;that is, the Prices Commission to which the British were able to refer.</P>

      <P>I am saying that that was just as objectionable to me as it was to Deputy Lemass.  We were not able to get rid of it.  We did our best. I have no hesitation in admitting that at all.  But we did get rid of another objectionable article&mdash;that is, Article 12&mdash;which gave them the right to fix the priority themselves.  That has now got to be done in conjunction with our <Col N="2208" /> Government.  The Deputy hung his whole case against this agreement on the fact that he believed we were foolish to enter into this agreement at all and that we were particularly foolish in entering into a four-year agreement because, he said, we could sell our cattle to a hungry world without any agreement and at a much better price than we could get from Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said that was the position, but that we were not going to take advantage of it. Deputy Lemass stated that, too, but he blames us for not taking advantage of it.  That is the difference between the Taoiseach and Deputy Lemass.  The Deputy's argument is the argument of the shopkeeper who puts his cigarettes under the counter and who refuses to supply the man who has been going into his shop for the last 20 years because, owing to the scarcity of cigarettes, some other person will give him 2d., 3d. or 4d. more per package than the regular customer will.</P>

I want to put it to the House that, as Deputy de Valera said, we should look at this in a businesslike way and should not introduce electioneering tactics into it.  I put it to the House that it is a good agreement. I put it to Deputy Lemass, when he talks about what we should have demanded from the British and insisted upon getting from the British, that we have got from the British for the first time for our farmers an undertaking that every ounce of agricultural produce <Col N="2210" /> that we have here will be taken and will be bought at remunerative prices and at higher prices than were probably ever paid for agriculture before.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is too long on the road to pretend to be quite as innocent as that.  It is there.  What was I looking for on the industrial side? What was Deputy Lemass looking for last autumn?  What was the position? We wanted the right to send into Britain our industrial products free of any duty and that they should take from us everything in the industrial line that we produced; and that they should not be empowered to impose any restriction, by way of duty or quantitative restriction while, on the other hand, we were certain that we should have the full right to restrict in any way that we thought fit anything which the British had to export into this country.  The fact of the matter is&mdash; and Deputy Lemass knows it to be the fact&mdash;when this agreement is ratified by this House we have the right to restrict any article coming from anywhere in one way or another.  Is not that so?</P>

We have given nothing whatever away.  Deputy Lemass tells us that we are foolish to enter into a four-year agreement to sell our agricultural produce to the British at a lesser price than we could get elsewhere.  That is a well-known and well-accepted principle.  If Deputy Lemass were only letting a house to-morrow, the Deputy would get a much higher rent from the tenant if the tenant were only taking it for one year rather than if the tenant were taking it for four years or ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say this, that I am satisfied that they are not deliberately withholding these goods from us, and I have reason for saying that.  I did make very strong representations with regard to raw materials for our industries.  I did make special appeals with regard to certain commodities like foundry coke, iron and steel.  I saw the British Minister of Fuel and Power personally on the matter of foundry coke.  We wanted a small quantity&mdash;a couple of hundred tons a week would put us on easy street.  The Minister assured me he could not possibly give it to me without putting some of their own industries on short time or obliging them to close down.  He told me they had not enough for themselves, that their own engineers and scientists had been working to find alternatives or substitutes. He said he was prepared to place fully and freely at our disposal the results of their investigations and that immediately they would be in a position to give us foundry coke they would do so.  I was told further that in so far as they could increase raw materials they would endeavour to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an improvement within the last two or three months, even in regard to steel.  There is no doubt about that.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact&mdash;and no one in the country knows it better than Deputy Lemass&mdash;that there are very grave shortages; that those shortages are world-wide.  The Deputy knows <Col N="2213" /> that if Britain sends commodities to other countries other than this, there are reasons other than merely price reasons at stake.  Britain herself wants to get certain things in.  The Deputy knows quite well she has to send out certain products of her own in order to secure certain raw materials she wants.</P>
    <P>I frankly do not believe that the British are deliberately trying to withhold from us the capital equipment and machinery we are badly in need of and that would help our production.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong this any further.  I am absolutely convinced, notwithstanding the long speech we have had from Deputy Lemass, that this is a good agreement.  Like the Taoiseach, I do not claim that it is perfect.  I would like to see a better agreement.  I believe, however, it is an advance, and I believe that with constant contact we can improve on the position, even within the four years.</P>
    <P>I believe industrially and agriculturally we are getting a reasonable chance to move forward.  I believe that as soon as the supply position eases, as we all hope it will soon, we are in for a period of progress.  I do not say there will be a change overnight, but I believe we are moving towards a reasonable expansion in industry, apart from agriculture.  So far as the Government is concerned, it is anxious to develop both agriculture and industry. It is anxious to put industry on a sound foundation, to see that it will be efficient and that it will be properly run.  While recognising that new industries, small industries, cannot particularly in their formative years, be expected to compete with well-established large industries, we are prepared to give the necessary protection.</P>
    <P>This agreement, in my opinion, gives us an opportunity to move towards that increased production which is so badly needed and which is fundamental to any activity in which we may engage. I believe we have removed a certain number of the obstacles, the blots and the blemishes that were in the 1938 agreement.  I am satisfied the House <Col N="2214" /> will have no hesitation in approving this agreement.  I am satisfied that Deputies opposite believe that it is worth something, that we have achieved something.  I think Deputy Lemass admitted that in his closing remarks.</P>
    <P>I took a great many notes on various points, but I do not propose to deal with them.  There were points made by Deputy Lemass that I could refute, but I do not propose to go into them.  I say this is a good agreement, a good achievement.  Worked out in the right spirit both on this side and the other side, I believe that at the end of four years everybody will be satisfied that it was something of great value to this country and that it came at a time that was critical, not merely for agriculture, but at a particularly critical time in the history of our four years' expansion. This is a very critical period.</P>
    <P>There are industries for which these additional exports will make all the difference, and Deputy Lemass knows that.  There are many of our cottage industries to which these exports will be a boon.  It will enable them to start working again.  I have no hesitation in recommending this agreement to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one general proposition made by the Taoiseach when asking the House to accept this agreement, and that is that it is not right or proper that we should claim that it provides something it does not in fact provide, nor, on the other hand, should we denounce it from this side of the House alleging that there is something missing from it that is really contained in it.  The few remarks I shall make will refer more to the agricultural provisions contained in the agreement.  I want also to refer to a statement which is to me, and apparently was to Deputy Lemass, an incomprehensible statement by the Taoiseach when he claimed that this agreement provided for our farmers for the next four years an assurance of a guaranteed market for all their produce at satisfactory prices when, in fact, it is clear that in regard to some commodities provision is made for annual discussions <Col N="2215" /> between representatives of the British Government and ourselves as to the prices to be paid for them.</P>
      <P>The principal part of this agreement is that which deals with our cattle trade.  I claim that a good deal of exaggeration has taken place as to what is achieved by this agreement for our cattle trade with Britain.  This evening we had an admission from the Taoiseach that we did not by this agreement secure parity for our Irish cattle with the cattle bred in Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Not only did we secure from the Taoiseach an admission that that was the case, but we had a further admission that he did not even ask for&mdash; because he said it was a matter of domestic policy for the British Government itself&mdash;the removal of that price discrepancy.  I am sure that the Taoiseach and those charged with the responsibility of conducting those negotiations felt they were not entitled to seek the removal of that differential, but I should like in that connection to remind the Taoiseach that in the discussions that took place last October and November, between representatives of the Government here and the Government of Great Britain&mdash;the differential at the time was 7/6 per cwt.&mdash;we saw fit to seek for the removal of that differential and, in fact, we did succeed in removing 2/6 per cwt. which left it at the stage at which it is now. I do not know by what process of reasoning the Taoiseach arrived at the conclusion that it was not fair to seek for the removal of what he described as this subsidy to England and Six County producers, but it is in fact on record that the differential prior to the discussions to which I referred last October was not 5/- per cwt., but was 7/6 and was reduced as a result of these discussions by 2/6.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me about the provisions of the annex to this agreement is that while the British agreed during the discussions to which I refer to the removal of that 2/6, I find here in Article 6 of the annex the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" />&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake that they will not introduce any excessive increase in the existing difference of 5/- per live cwt. between the prices paid by them for cattle bred in the United Kingdom and those paid for cattle from Ireland, fattened for a minimum of two months in the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am genuinely anxious to know why the British saw fit to ask for the insertion of Article 6 of the annex.  They agreed to reduce the differential to 5/-during the discussion last October. What has happened since then that has influenced them to change their mind, at least to the extent of the insertion of the provision such as the one I have read out which enables them to increase that differential, but not excessively, which, I take it, means that if the British Government so decided, if for some reason that certainly is not known to me it should be in the interests of British policy or British agriculture to do so&mdash;and the annex governs Article 1 of the agreement&mdash; they take power to go back on the concession which they gave in the preliminary talks last fall?</P>
    <P>There are in this annex a number of other provisions that quite frankly seem to me to be quite inconsistent. Let us have a full understanding of this matter, because, mind you&mdash;and I do not blame him&mdash;I think the Taoiseach in dealing with this matter was not as conversant with this business as one would require to be.  Let us then get an idea of what the position is and what the position is likely to be as a result of this agreement in so far as it affects the cattle trade.  We have, as I say, cleared the decks and we have a clear admission that not only was this differential between Irish cattle and English and Six-County cattle not removed, but it was thought by our negotiators that it was not their business to ask for its removal and so it remains.  Not only has it remained but you have a provision under which it can be increased if the British Government so decide.  That is No. 1.  Then we come to No. 2.</P>

If I am wrong in the interpretation I have placed on the annex to the agreement, then let us have an explanation from those who are responsible for it.  The claim is made that in the concessions we have secured by this agreement, so far as cattle is concerned, we have secured a parity price for Irish fat cattle for immediate slaughter in Great Britain with the cattle previously exported as stores, fed on English farms and sold after a period of two months.  If we had secured that concession without qualification I would be the first to regard that concession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy Fagan is in a different position in <Col N="2218" /> regard to this matter to other Deputies in the House.  I know that he has a particular reason for being enthusiastic about the agreement, and with that let me leave the matter.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat that if that concession to which I have referred had been secured without conditions, I would be the first to say that it was a very valuable concession.  Has it been secured without concession from this side?  If not, are we not entitled to examine what the concessions are, to ask the Minister responsible and the delegation responsible what they are?  Are we not entitled to give to this House and to the country our views as to whether we regard the concession obtained from the British as a suitable and proper <i>quid pro quo</i> for the concessions which we extended to them?</P>
      <P>Let me proceed to show the inconsistencies about which I have spoken. No. 7 of the annex says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake to arrange to pay prices for fat cattle imported from Ireland equivalent to those paid for store cattle bred in Ireland after a minimum of two months' feeding in the United Kingdom...  The seasonal schedule of prices will be drawn up in consultation with the two Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all right, but let us have a look at Article 2 of the annex.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both Governments intend that at least 75 per cent. of the total numbers of cattle so exported in each year shall consist of store cattle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In No. 7 we are given parity with Britain, I do not say with British homebreds, but what do we get?  We get a definite limitation of that concession and I am entitled to ask the Minister who was responsible and the delegation why.  No. 2 was not inserted there at our request, I am sure.  It must have been inserted in the annex at the request of Britain.  Why did they make that request to us?  If it is a concession that our fats for immediate slaughter will be sold at the same price as Irish stores which were formerly fattened there for two months, why should there be any limitation?  I think that <Col N="2219" /> is a fair question to ask.  That is my view and I will hold it until it is explained to my satisfaction to the contrary. My view is that while No. 7 undoubtedly gives the concession, No. 2 has interfered substantially with the value of the concession.</P>
    <P>Am I not entitled to ask further, since I suspect that No. 2 was inserted at the request of the British, an explanation of why the British should in the face of circumstances in which they find themselves, in face of the meat shortages in Britain, ask us to limit the export of fat cattle?  That is one of the reasons why I regard the concession obtained in No. 7 as being interfered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the question of starvation arises.  Suppose that of our total exports to Britain 400,000, 450,000, 500,000, or 600,000, roughly 50 per cent., formerly went out as fats, why did the British now say that they will only take 25 per cent. of the cattle as fat although we might have 65 per cent. to export as such? That is one of my objections to this agreement.  While this may not have for us, for the agricultural industry or for the cattle trade, any immediate danger, the introduction of the quota system is one of the most objectionable things you could possibly have. What I am amazed at is that there was no Deputy in this House when the present Minister for Agriculture was a Deputy, who so often voiced his objection and abhorrence of the quota system in all its shapes and forms as the Minister.</P>

If you take that stipulation in No. 2 with the other concessions to which I will refer later, you must ask yourself whether the concession in No. 7 is sufficient compared to the concessions we have given in Nos. 2 and 5.  I honestly say that if <Col N="2220" /> that proposition were put to me with the knowledge I have of this matter, I have no doubt, in my present state of mind anyway, as to what my attitude would be.</P>

      <P>You will certainly not find in anything I agreed to last November anything which has any relation to No. 2 or to No. 5.  I was trying to give the House an idea of the harm which could result in a longterm sense so far as the cattle trade is concerned from this provision.  No. 5 deals with the continental trade.  I am not complaining of the provisions of No. 5 in an all-out sense.  The figure specified there is not so objectionable inasmuch as we only exceeded it in our exports to the Continent in 1947. I would not like, however, to have to agree to a stipulation for a definite figure in an agreement of this kind, inasmuch as it ties you up hand and foot.  Even though the figure mentioned might be sufficient to cover the market available, I would not like definitely to tie myself to any figure, however generous it might be.  There could, of course, be circumstances in which there might be need for it.  If the concessions secured from the other side were sufficient to warrant my doing so, then, naturally, I would change my mind.  I agree that in the matter of making a commercial agreement as between Governments it must be a question of give and take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain why the British Government felt it necessary, while giving us the same price for our cattle sent as fats for immediate slaughter as those fed for two months in Great Britain, to say: &ldquo;You must not send us more than 25 per cent.&rdquo;, although 30 or 40 or 50 per <Col N="2221" /> cent. might be available; and, in addition, why they should have stipulated in No. 5 that we can only send 50,000 for the first year to the Continent and that after that our exports to countries outside Great Britain shall be ten per cent. of all our exports, and that 25 per cent. of these exports will be rough cattle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to bear with me in giving my opinion as to the way in which this provision may affect us.  I am prepared to admit that our right to export 50,000 cattle to the Continent is a fairly useful one.  That number was only exceeded last year, and not by very much&mdash;about 7,000.  It would have been exceeded to a greater extent if transport facilities had been available.  That figure is all right.  Let us suppose, however, that after a period of years this continental trade was to disappear.  What would be the result of such a disappearance?  In addition, what is likely to be the British domestic policy in regard to the raising of live stock.  If the continental market should disappear, the 50,000 cattle, or whatever number it may be in the future, would become available for the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we have the British Government's present policy of encouraging English farmers to raise stores and feed young calves by the payment of a subsidy of £3 per head. That is bound to have results in Great Britain and the Six Counties.  In addition to these two factors, we have the change in Great Britain's tillage policy. <Col N="2222" /> In this agreement there is provision for the export of cattle to Great Britain at a certain price, but only a certain percentage of these can be fats.  There is established there an objectionable quota system which, in the event of the continental trade disappearing, and in view of the British Government's present policy of encouraging the raising of stores in Great Britain and the Six Counties the danger of having 75 per cent. of all our live stock thrown on the British store market, which would be better supplied by home-bred stores than it is at present, might end in depressing prices acutely.  I know that I may be met with the explanation that this is after all only a four-year agreement and that, in all probability, some of the fears to which I have given expression are not likely to arise during that period at all.  Four years after all is a short period and I say again that I hardly expect the Minister to be able to give me an adequate explanation for his acceptance of this provision.  I would say further that because of his attitude in the past towards these matters of quotas and restrictions of all kinds, I am surprised that he should even regard the concession that is contained in No. 7 as adequate compensation for the two concessions to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>It is an old and a long story.  The Minister himself has made use more than anybody else of the expression &ldquo;old and favoured customer.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, he used it so often that I sometimes felt terribly sorry I did not live near Ballagha-derreen and that I could not be one of his customers and establish that kind of long-distance relationship so as to obtain the favourable terms that a man <Col N="2223" /> with this outlook is prone to give to people with connections like that.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Apparently not only were the British not satisfied with No. 2, but they proceeded to make things more secure in No. 3.  In No. 3 they stated that the rate of delivery of fat cattle shall, if necessary, be adjusted according to the facilities for handling and slaughtering in Great Britain.  That is understandable, but they have, in No. 2, undertaken that they will admit 25 per cent. of our exports to Britain as fats.  Surely, objectionable and all as that condition is, you would think it would be up to them at least to make the necessary provision and set up the necessary organisation to enable them to handle that percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always suspicious when those with whom I am discussing matters of business ask me to insert this provision or that condition. I must regard that request as having some importance and of being of some value to them or possibly of holding out the hope that it would be of value to them in the future.  That is why I am looking upon No. 3 in this way.  I was invited by the Minister for Agriculture to read No. 8.  Of course, I had read No. 8.  The first thing I thought of when I read it was something which the Minister himself should have thought of, and of which I am sure he did think, because his constituency is alongside mine and both happen to be Border constituencies.  I was listening to the Taoiseach when he quoted for us, not at any great length, figures showing our exports of cattle in some selected years.  In the figure which he gave to show the extent to which matters in the cattle trade had deteriorated he selected the year 1930. After all, I suppose it is a good debating point and, in that sense, it is justifiable, but I think the figures will show that 1930 was a year in which our exports were higher than they had been for any year from 1925 on to that period.  Then he came to a year when our exports were at the very lowest ebb, but he did not refer to some of the known factors that were responsible for that condition of affairs.  I would say that one of these factors&mdash; I cannot, naturally, say just to what extent&mdash;is undoubtedly the movement of cattle just the same as there is the movement of other produce and commodities over 300 miles of land frontier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his opening remarks seemed to think that we would have no justification in asking for any modification of the differential as between Six County and English-bred <Col N="2225" /> cattle and cattle bred here.  I would like to remind him that that differential is a source of temptation to people here to take across the Border cattle with which we are not subsequently credited.  That state of affairs could easily result in our failure to meet what is provided for in paragraph 8.  Paragraph 8 of the annex provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that if increased numbers of fat and store cattle do not become available in the proportion set out in paragraph 2 in due course, then the provisions of paragraph 7 above will be subject to review by both Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The British Government have, I suppose, insisted on the insertion of paragraph 8 in this annex, which gives them the power to review if we on our side do not achieve the objectives set out in Article 1 of the agreement.  The question arises, will they take up that attitude towards us?  The result of their policy and the price conditions which are laid down for their own home-bred cattle both in England and the Six Counties is a definite source of temptation to take cattle across the Border, even at this present moment, in order to take advantage of the 5/- per cwt., which is not an inconsiderable sum when related to a beast of 10 cwt.  It means 50/- on that one beast.  While it may not be, as the Taoiseach has claimed, any of our business what the English pay to their own or to the Six County producers, we can at least contend that it does have the way open to smuggling cattle that should be accounted for in the manner I have described to keep us right so far as paragraph 8 is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right, Sir.  So far as my understanding of the provisions of this agreement goes, if I were given the concession that is provided here in paragraph 7 of the annex I would be very glad to get that concession. But if I were given that concession with two conditions attaching to it&mdash;(1) a limitation of the number of fats we can export, and (2) a definite limit on our continental trade&mdash;in my present frame of mind I certainly would not be agreeable to the acceptance of such conditions.  If the British come to us and say that they are prepared to place our Irish fats on the same price schedule as Irish cattle brought over to England and fattened on British farms for a period of two months I would be prepared to consider favourably that proposition.  Under the provisions of the second condition it cannot be said that our Irish fats are placed on parity with Irish-fed cattle in Britain.  They are not securing parity.  If we were to have 50 per cent. of our cattle fat and if paragraphs 6 and 7 give us the concessions that are claimed, then we are only getting these concessions in respect of 25 per cent. of our cattle.  I would like to hear somebody refute that solid, hard fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer is the reference to carcase meat in the annex.  I have not much to say with regard to it.  The conditions under which carcase meat may be sent to Great Britain are the same as those agreed to by us in September-October. In so far as the terms affecting carcase meat are concerned, they are the same as those to which we agreed.  I do want to say that this was a trade that I was anxious to encourage because of the amount of employment given and because of the offal resulting from that <Col N="2228" /> trade and because of the employment that would ultimately result from its development.  I would have liked to see some more concrete evidence that we were progressing in that direction by this agreement.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this agreement to show that we have got any further concessions.  The same applies to canned meat.  Here is where I wonder what justification there is, in view of the provision in relation to canned meat, for the claim that we have secured an assurance from the British as to the availability of a market and reasonable prices for the next four years.  I am prepared to concede that during the discussions which took place last September or October&mdash; whatever time it was&mdash;this was one of the matters on which I found the British Government representative most unreasonable.  We were anxious to encourage the canning industry and preserve it for many of the reasons I have given so far as the carcase neat trade is concerned.  The Minister will find in the records of the Department that I made the best showing I could in order to get the British to give us a decent contract for canned meat. The British attitude, strangely enough, was one of hostility to canned meat in any shape or form.  I think when the Minister went into office he found that hostility still existing.  When it became apparent that the food position was not everything they thought it might be, or for some other reason, they changed their attitude and increased the quantity of canned meat. I am not contending that I did not meet with that difficulty.</P>

      <P>It is not the kind of proposition we can hold out as a market for all we can produce at a reasonable price for the next four years.  I am glad to hear about the continental market.  That was not the case some time ago.  Here is a further criticism of the agreement and of the general attitude of the British Government in these matters.  Take all the agricultural items covered in this agreement &mdash;cattle, carcase meat, canned meat, poultry, eggs, bacon, butter, sheep, lambs and the rest.  They have given us in relation to cattle the offer which I have analysed.  For canned meat they made us an offer for one year only. They have given us an offer for bacon of which we have none to export and their price is 225/- per cwt.  Where is the long-distance undertaking in this agreement, so far as the British are concerned, that that quantity and price will be satisfactory for bacon and canned meat even over the four years' period?</P>
      <P>There is no mention of what they will give for butter unless the reference that should butter become available for export a discussion can take place as to price.  This four years' agreement is held up to us as one that offers a sort of security for, and inducement to, our farmers to expand production. I can see that the British are quite liberal with regard to produce where they know there will be a definite shortage for the next three or four years, but in regard to other items about which there is a doubt and about which world conditions might change rapidly there is the stipulation that there will be negotiations from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not alteration in the agreement so far as poultry and <Col N="2230" /> eggs are concerned.  What do they say about becon?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake to import bacon from Ireland at the annual pre-war rate of 27,000 tons, or more if it is available, at a price of 225/- per cwt. f.o.b. until the 30th September, 1949.  Subsequent prices shall be fixed by negotiation between representatives of the two countries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I am told that this is a longterm agreement, how can I reconcile it with that paragraph?  The pig producer, who is aiming to increase his stocks, knows that in 1949 negotiations will take place as to price.  We have no bacon to give them now, even if they gave us 500/- a cwt. for it.  Therefore, the offer up to September, 1949, means nothing.  It is the price that will be available after that that will enable a farmer to say: &ldquo;That looks all right for four years&rdquo;.  We will have a market for the sale of our agricultural produce, but in relation to produce about which the British seem to think there is likely to be a sudden change in world conditions and prices, they make sure they will not be committed to anything for a period longer than 12 months.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of this agreement as it affects the cattle trade which are objectionable to those in the trade to which I am not going to refer here.  I have still in mind the Taoiseach's invitation not to be unreasonable in our criticism of this document, not to claim that there is something in it that is not in it or to allege that there is not something in it that should be in it, but I think that those who are engaged in the cattle trade will ultimately see, and, in fact, see now, whether or not any real advantages have been secured.  I believe that even those of us who are taking the long view as to the possible effects of the concessions that we have given to the British in the two clauses to which I have referred and who are suspicious of these concessions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I repeat then that if, as an individual, I were faced with the proposition, would I accept the concessions extended in Article 7 subject to what is contained in Articles 6 and 5, I certainly without hesitation would say that I would not accept them subject to such conditions.</P>

      <P>I must say that I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Smith and Deputy Lemass, because the pair of them were put up here to-day to do the best they could.  Right enough, to have to tackle the Old Age Pensions Bill and this agreement on two successive days was enough to daunt the courage of the most resolute Opposition in the world.  Inasmuch as they are an extremely incompetent Opposition to begin with, and as they have been 15 years out of practice, I think they are deserving of the warmest congratulations on their heroic effort to make it appear that this, which in my judgment, speaking on behalf of the agricultural community, is the best agreement that has ever been signed between Great Britain and Ireland in respect of the agricultural industry, is, in fact, nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adroitness of the Minister for Agriculture of November, 1947, in trying <Col N="2232" /> to prove, as Deputy Smith, that he went over to London last November for nothing at all, that he spent three days in London talking about nothing at all and that he came home at the end of three days having talked about nothing and resumed the even tenor of his ways is beyond praise.  What brought the Irish Minister for Agriculture to London last November?  Was it for the purpose of admiring Mr. Williams's bow tie?  Something must have brought him there.  If I understand aright, what brought him there was to tell the British Minister for Agriculture that he had an accumulation of aged cattle which he could not sell because there was 6d. per lb. between the price of Irish fat cattle and Anglo-Irish fat cattle and that if that differential were maintained he would be at his wits' end.  The British Minister for Agriculture then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to see you go distracted altogether; I will remove 5d. of that differential up to the 29th of February and after that date the differential will be 2d. per lb.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister for Agriculture thanked the British Minister for Agriculture warmly, returned to Ireland and, in the months of December, January and February, shipped to Great Britain an unprecedented number of aged cattle.</P>
    <P>After that, when I came into office, I said to my colleagues quite simply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I am to be Minister for Agriculture in this country, I am going to run the Department of Agriculture and Mr. Williams is not.  If the British Minister for Agriculture wants to regulate agricultural policy in this country, he is not going to do it so long as I am here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got leave of the Government to go over to London and, with the best will in the world for the decent man, to tell him that.  I do not deny that a good many people thought that it was a fool's errand and that I would break my neck on it, but I thought it was a damn sight better that I should break my neck than that I should remain posing as an Irish Minister for Agriculture in Merrion Street while the activities <Col N="2233" /> of my Department were directed from Whitehall.  I went to London last March and I was informed, as I have no doubt my predecessor was informed, that the British Minister for Agriculture claimed the right, by price manipulation, to regulate the quantity of fat cattle and store cattle that we would from time to time send to Great Britain.  If at any time he, in his absolute discretion, thought the number of fat cattle going from Ireland excessive, he would widen the differential to such a point as would kill the fat cattle export and let nothing but stores go.  He had practised that industriously until eventually in 1946 he had virtually put an end to our exports of fat cattle to Great Britain. In 1947 our total export of cattle to Great Britain was 424,000 odd and we sent 51,000 fats; in 1946 our total export was 438,714, but by the operation of Mr. Williams's price manipulation, the number of fats was only 11,000; in 1945 the total number of cattle exported was 491,000, but as a result of Mr. Williams's price manipulation the number of fats was 14,000.</P>
    <P>Now I said quite plainly and simply, without hard feelings or offence to any man, either Mr. Williams is going to run my Department or I am going to run my Department.  Both of us cannot run it and I will not tolerate a system under which the British Minister for Agriculture claims the right to determine at his own sweet will what the internal live-stock policy of Ireland shall be.  In principle I do not admit it, and in practice I reject it. As far as he has operated that right to date, you thought that by reducing the number of fats you would enhance the number of stores.  We told you, and we tell you now for the last time, that any such attempt will result in a reduction of the total number of available live stock because you so dislocated the trade, that that dislocation has travelled all the way from the port of Dublin to Connacht and the County Limerick, so that calves fetch 10/-apiece. Our people kill them and will not bother to rear them as a result.  If you look at the numbers of our cattle the year I came into office you will find that the number of cattle under one year old reached the lowest figure it <Col N="2234" /> has ever reached in the recorded history of this country.</P>

      <P>Do not be making Mr. Williams's case for him.  You have reduced our cattle exports to 438,714, and if you want to keep that up you will not keep it with me.  Mr. Williams is a reasonable, friendly man.  We sat down and talked the thing over together.  I need hardly tell you that when I said &ldquo;bo&rdquo; in London the whole British Government did not fall down and die in front of me.  But when you are talking to reasonable men and argue the thing out with them, you have every reason to hope that in time they will act like reasonable men.  The boys beyond there said: &ldquo;Ah he came back with one hand as long as the other and he is trying to put the best face on it.&rdquo; But my prophecy was right. The differential was to go from 1d. to 2d. on the 29th February.</P>

      <P>It was postponed to the end of March, to the end of April, to the end of May and to the end of June. I went over in June, and when you talk to reasonable men about a reasonable proposition, they usually act like reasonable men.  When I went over to London in June I came back with Article 7 of the annex:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake to arrange to pay prices for fat cattle imported from Ireland equivalent to those paid for store cattle bred in Ireland after a minimum of two months' fattening in the United Kingdom, subject to appropriate adjustment in respect of marketing costs.  The seasonal schedule of prices will be drawn up in consultation between the two Governments.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted and that is what I got.  Maybe I am going to get my head in a halter now, but I am going to tell you what I said <Col N="2235" /> about the 5/- bonus that is paid on what the British call &ldquo;home-bred cattle&rdquo;.  It is a new doctrine to me that a calf born in the County Armagh is &ldquo;home-bred cattle&rdquo; in terms of Whitehall.  The British have a perfect right, however, to any domestic policy they like and the basis of my representation to the British Government was: I will not let Mr. Williams, the British Minister for Agriculture, operate the live-stock policy of Ireland.  So how could I, in the next breath say: &ldquo;I demand that I should control Mr. Williams's live-stock policy in Britain&rdquo;? There are some people who said that it was unfair that the Irish farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties should get a lower price for his cattle than the price that is paid to the Irish farmer in the Six Counties.  To this I countered at once: &ldquo;I would not take that bonus.  If the people of Northern Ireland, or the Government of Northern Ireland, are prepared to demand in their name, the fee for being an unwanted charge on British charity, we are not prepared to play that rôle and we will not accept that fee.&rdquo;  Now, was that rational?  I think it was.  I would not ask Britain to accord to our people the bonus or advantage which they provided for their own people&mdash; not for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not prepared to make the representation in London that we wanted the financial advantage of being in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but that we wanted the national dignity of asserting our true constitutional position.  I put the position without getting cross.  I wanted them to act like reasonable men, but if I wanted them to act like reasonable men, my first duty was to act like a reasonable man myself.  No reasonable man asks an advantage if he will not accept its responsibility.  No man has the right to ask the advantage of being a loyal citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland if in the next breath he denies the existence of such an institution and says that the United Kingdom means Scotland, Wales and England, God bless them all, and Ireland is Ireland.  People who think anything else are labouring under a delusion.  I know that there <Col N="2236" /> are people in this country who said, &ldquo;Arrah that is grand highfalutin talk, but 50/- is 50/-&rdquo;, but I do not think that the poorest farmer in Monaghan would wish me to go to London and ask for our people a fiduciary advantage, the natural consequential obligations of which I repudiated on their behalf.  In any case, that is what I did.  It is literally true to say that I would not take the 5/- bonus.  If I was wrong in that, I ought to go.  It never even crossed my mind and I do not think that it crossed the mind of any of my colleagues in the Government that is at present on these benches that we would dream of asking of the British Government an advantage which manifestly and recognisedly had at all times been reserved for their own nationals as part of a design to promote their domestic live-stock policy, in which manifestly we have no part to play.</P>
    <P>In respect, however, of the differential which was between Irish fat cattle and Irish stores that went to England and were fattened there, I insisted that should be removed and that the claim to re-establish it should be irrevocably abandoned.</P>

Does Deputy Smith apprehend the development of a surplus of meat in Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would.  Frankly, I do not apprehend a surplus of meat in Great Britain in the course of the next few years.  There has not been a surplus of meat from domestic sources in Great Britain since the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  They have been importing meat probably for the last 300 or 400 years.  Deputy Smith is going to lose his night's sleep lest suddenly the British people are going to turn over to the use of fish, or lest every cow in England is going to have quintuplets twice a year.  I agree that, if a situation arises in the immediate future in which we are beating at the door with cattle shaking fat and the British people, who are on 10d. <Col N="2238" /> worth of meat, are going to raise ashplants to drive them away and say: &ldquo;Aroint thee, witch&rdquo; to every fat bullock going into Great Britain, the proviso of Article 7 would come into operation.  I must say that if, under Article 8, the British Government asked me for a review of Article 2 on the ground that I am sending them too much meat, I will send round to Harley Street for the first alienist I can get to sit in at our discussions with a view to determining whether there is any one in the room who requires to be certified for Bedlam.  If the Deputy's only anxiety is that, in the course of the next few years, the British people are going to drive fat cattle from their doors on the ground that, with 10d. worth of meat they have too much to eat, all I can say to Deputy Smith is that if that is the only worry he has on his mind he ought not to allow a single hair on his head to go grey about it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will find that in the course of four years that will not arise.  I should like to say a word about the atmosphere in which these negotiations had to be carried out.  Every Government, when negotiating with another Government, is entitled to avail of certainwell-recognised instruments of negotiation. One of these instruments of negotiations is to quote your own people <Col N="2239" /> against you.  For instance, if you are seeking to keep the price of cattle at an economic level and the parties you are negotiating with are able to say: &ldquo;Your own people are howling that the prices of meat are too high.  All the butchers are on strike in Dublin because the price of cattle is too high&rdquo;, it requires some <i>sang froid</i> to say: &ldquo;There are butchers and butchers&rdquo;. If you are going to negotiate in London on the basis that there is a manifest impropriety in existence which reasonable people must at once perceive and readily rectify, I can assure Deputy Smith that what was happening, under Deputy Lemass in the <i>Irish Press,</i> was not helpful.  On the 18th March we had the heading: &ldquo;Talks likely soon; new protest on cattle prices&rdquo;.  There was a long description of a comment that I had made on the present situation and a reference to a comment on it made by Dr. Summerskill of the British Ministry of Food. Then the <i>Irish Press</i> consulted a leading figure in the Irish live-stock trade, who is recorded as expressing the opinion that the attitude of the British Ministry of Agriculture was not at all unreasonable and that their claim to maintain the differential was done in legitimate economic interest to their own farmers and was not due to any ulterior motive of seeking to control our live-stock industry by price manipulation.</P>

      <P>In spite of that kind of extremely disreputable journalism and of the utterly unscrupulous racketeering which was attempted but prevented, <Col N="2240" /> we have succeeded in removing this differential for all time.  That has meant a material financial advantage to every individual who sells a beast. However, it means much more than that.  It means we have a rigid link joining the price payable for Irish fat stock to that realised for fat stock reared and fattened in Great Britain. Remember it is that rigid link that matters.  It is only six or eight months ago since the British paid about 40/-per cwt. more for a British bred and fattened beast than they paid for an Irish beast whether it was fattened in Ireland or in Great Britain.  I am wrong there.</P>

However, there was a difference of about 40/- per cwt. between the Irish fattened beast and the British fattened beast.  Now there is a difference of 5/- and a binding agreement that at no future date, for the duration of this agreement, or until it has been voluntarily terminated after four years' existence by one side or the other, shall there be an excessive increase in the existing difference of 5/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That word excessive is of vital importance.  Its definition sets a limit to the differential that can ever be established between cattle fattened in Great Britain and bred in Great Britain&mdash;British cattle you call them&mdash; and the Anglo-Irish or Irish cattle.  I entirely agree with Deputy Smith that if these negotiations had been conducted on the basis that there were two sets of rogues sitting opposite one another, both primarily concerned to pick the other's pocket before the day's work was done, the employment of such words as &ldquo;any excessive increase&rdquo; would have been recklessly indiscreet. Maybe I am wrong, but I do not think I am.  The advice I tendered to the Government of which I am a member, and which I now tender to this House, is that we were dealing with honourable <Col N="2241" /> men whose word was, in my judgment, better than their bond.</P>

Six months ago he would have said: &ldquo;Article 1 of the 1938 agreement is sown up in the bag.  There is no ambiguity about that.

If they prove to be other than that I have made a mistake for which I deserve dismissal from this Government but I do not think I have.  Our predecessors thought, when they signed the 1938 agreement, that Article I was as safe as if it were in the Bank of Ireland. They came to this House honestly believing that and on that assurance this House adopted the agreement. They were painfully mistaken.

If it were not that, I can assure this House&mdash;no matter how a document were drafted&mdash;that there are brains and brilliance to get out of it in Great Britain if a dishonest intention were there present.  I am of the old-fashioned mind who believes that the word of an honest man is stronger than the bond of a rogue.  There are men in this world of whom it is true to say that one would be wiser to take their word rather than their bond because they are too proud to break their word but they have the ability to get out of any written bond that they or anybody else can write.</P>

      <P>If it is written by honest men in 1948, as I believe this is, in confidence I commend it to the House.  It provides in my judgment a rigidity which guarantees the live-stock industry of this country from ever experiencing the kind of exploitation they experienced in the past.  If it does not prove to be that, it is not what it is meant to be.  I am convinced it will and, by whether it proves to be that or not, I consent to be judged.</P>

      <P>I prefer not to give way <Col N="2243" /> to the Deputy.  The Deputy is quite free to speak when I have finished.  In regard to carcase meat, I felt that the existing relationship was, on the whole, reasonable.  There was some question as to whether the sum of 1½d. correctly reflected the intended differential in costs.  Both sides readily agreed that if the trade could by demonstration establish that the differential should be more correctly 1?d. or 1?d., both of us would very readily agree it should be so adjusted. I think that was a sensible arrangement. Upon my word, I believe that the 1½d. is perhaps a little more than it should be; but if those who are engaged in the carcase meat trade at any time desire to assemble a sufficient number of beasts the British Ministry of Food is prepared to collaborate with us in a test to correct that figure to 1¼d. or 1?d., or whatever is fair; and it is understood on both sides that whatever the test under mutually agreed conditions reveals would be substituted for that 1½d.  That arrangement was made by some of my predecessors.  I think it was a sensible arrangement and a very proper arrangement and I left it exactly where it is and the offer to the carcase meat trade stands precisely where it stood in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to canned meat.  That canned meat agreement is of no consequence whatever.  I do not want the House for a single moment to believe that that canned meat section is a mighty achievement at all.  The plain fact is that the British people&mdash;put it in their own words&mdash;believe that &ldquo;tin is too dear an envelope for meat&rdquo;. Under this contract they undertake to sell us the tinplate necessary to make these tins.  The only other source from which we could get tin would be from a dollar source and naturally we did not want to buy dollar cans and sell them for sterling to Great Britain; nor does Great Britain desire to see dollars, which are scarce enough, used for such a purpose.  The British say they want meat.  They say: &ldquo;First, we would like to get it on the hoof; if you will not send it to us on the hoof, then we would like to get it on the book <Col N="2244" /> if you will not send it to us that way, we would sooner get it in sausage meat; but the last way in which we would like to get it would be in tins, because we think the tin is a too luxurious envelope.&rdquo;  You cannot go over and take people by the throat and tell them they blooming well will take their meat the way you want to send it to them.  They are a very reasonable people.</P>

      <P>I said: &ldquo;Five thousand tons are all you took last year.  It would suit us&mdash;and it is a matter of some consequence to us&mdash;that we should have 10,000 tons to-day for Great Britain in case alternative markets should not turn up.&rdquo; And their reply was: &ldquo;Certainly, if that would be of assistance to you, why not; we do not particularly want that meat in that form but we would be glad to oblige you.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Hold your horses a bit; you are not obliging us and we do not want you to think you are, because this meat is probably saleable for a higher price on the Continent.&rdquo;&ldquo;Very well, then &mdash;let us put it this way: if you have 10,000 tons that you want to send us at 15/6 a dozen cans we will take it and we will provide the tin for it; but if you can sell it to greater advantage anywhere else you are welcome and no hard feeling.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is a very fair proposal; on our part we have given you the first swipe at it and on your part you have said that if we are not able to sell it somewhere else you will take it from us, but if we are able to sell it elsewhere there will be no hard feeling.&rdquo;  It is right to say that I tried to explain to the British Ministry of Food repeatedly that they were not getting this kind of meat on the hoof or on the hook if they did not take it in the can.  Canned meat is a particular variety of meat which one does not ordinarily export in carcase from or on the hoof.  It is good meat, canned under the most scrupulous veterinary inspection.  Every ounce of it is healthy and sound and excellent. But it is not first quality.  I am glad to be able to report to the House&mdash; because I am usually supposed to be a kind of scourage on Irish industry&mdash;<Col N="2245" /> that our information in London was that the canned meat coming from this country to England was superior to the canned meat coming from any other part of the world.  I am so sick of being told by the Fianna Fáil Party that there is nothing we can produce in this country that someone else cannot produce cheaper and better&mdash;that is the usual justification for the 50 per cent. tariffs&mdash;that it is a source of joy to me to be able to tell the House that in the canned meat business, where we meet Canada, the United States of America, the Argentine and some British canners on an equal footing, the general verdict was that our product was the best and the best value for the money they were paying.</P>

If I wanted to be as apprehensive about the ambiguities as he elected to be I <Col N="2246" /> might labour certain ambiguities in that agreement.</P>
      <P>I think the agreement made by Deputy Smith was a good agreement. It bound me by contract, when I went to London, but it caused me no uneasiness. I think it was well negotiated for our people.  It provided me when I came into office with a useful instrument for the development of an extremely valuable branch of our agricultural industry.

      <P>Now we come to butter and bacon. Surely Deputy Smith, if he had any car, would detect some reminiscent ocho in the price of 225/-?

      <P>With regard to the last paragraph, the price for potatoes was published recently and I think it was £10 18s. 6d. up to Christmas and £11 8s. 6d. from Christmas onwards. That is something on which I would like an expression of opinion from Deputies.  If Deputies will look at that <Col N="2248" /> last paragraph of the agreement they will see that further negotiations with regard to potatoes are envisaged.  We have undertaken to deliver 50,000 tons at a price which Deputy Smith says is not enough.  I am glad to have that outlet for the Cooley potatoes, so as to ensure that they will not have to be sold to the alcohol factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is still under discussion.  I am devising a plan to enable the Cooley men to get what I hope will be more than they ever got before.  On top of that I want to make another proposal.  The British Ministry of Food have proposed to us that in as much as their aim is to attain self-sufficiency in potatoes, to grow all the potatoes they require, they feel that if we would undertake to grow a quantity of potatoes, entering into agreements either on an acreage basis or a tonnage basis, they could release a certain amount of what we will call the quasi-marginal potato land in Great Britain for the cultivation of some more suitable crop, a crop more suited to the soil.</P>
      <P>My attitude in regard to that proposal is that if the British are prepared to offer us what seems to me a remunerative price, I would be inclined to advise the people to make contracts for the production of these potatoes much on the same basis as they contract for beet.  That is a matter we will have a discussion on to see if we can arrive at a price which, in their view, will justify releasing that much land in Great Britain and which will reward our farmers who enter into contracts, bearing in mind that potatoes can be a fairly uncertain crop in the matter of yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flax was mentioned.  Up to now the British Board of Trade purchased all our flax at an agreed price, supplied the flax seed at an agreed price and our farmers grew as much as they wanted.  Now the British Board of Trade declare that they propose to disinterest themselves in that matter and leave it to the North of Ireland spinners. Up to last year our Government, rightly in my opinion, collaborated with the British Government in the production <Col N="2249" /> of flax and I think on the whole those who grew it got a fairish price for it.  There was no obligation on them to grow it if they did not want to.</P>
    <P>I understand the northern flax spinners are expected to approach the Irish Government with a view to determining what would be a fair and equitable price.  I would like to spare them by saving them their railway fares If they pay our people the same price as they pay the people in Northern Ireland, I am sure our people will grow flax for them; but if they want to pay a different price there will be no hard feelings.  There are other crops that we can grow more profitably, and we will grow them.</P>
    <P>If they want to buy flax here we will be glad to oblige them, but if they want to buy flax on the cheap, nothing doing.  I think that is fair enough and there need be no hard feelings.  Let me reiterate emphatically that if it will help any industry in Northern Ireland to get flax grown down here and that industry in Northern Ireland is prepared to pay a fair price for it, it will be a pleasure on our part to help in getting the flax for them.</P>
    <P>It is asking for something unreasonable to suggest that we should expect our people to take less for flax grown on the Monaghan side of the Border than for flax grown across the road on the Fermanagh side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith said a strange thing when he was talking here this morning about Article 5 of the annex.  He says: &ldquo;There is a figure of 50,000 head there and it is not too bad but I should not like to consent to the stipulation that a definite figure will be adequate for our requirements.  It may not be bad but it gives me an uncomfortable kind of feeling.&rdquo;  I wonder if Deputy Smith realises how revealing these sentiments are?  If he consults the works of Adler and Jung he will find that that statement is pathognomonic of a weak character, someone who cannot make up his mind, who is trembling on the edge of a bank, who knows he should do it but who cannot bear to put his hand to the instrument which will enable him to do it.  He would like to be in the position <Col N="2250" /> of saying: &ldquo;Well I didn't say yes and I didn't say no.&rdquo;  That is the sign of a stubborn but a weak-minded man and the Deputy must try to correct that.  I said that that arrangement is an arrangement which would never interfere with the rights of our people and the Taoiseach having considered it carefully, initialled it and subsequently signed it.  I am quite certain that I did quite right and that we would have been mistaken to tremble on the bank like a swimmer who did not dare to plunge in and yet was loath to put on his clothes again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith was greatly concerned about the provisions of Article 3 of the annex which says that the rate of delivery of fat cattle shall if necessary be adjusted according to the facilities for handling and slaughtering in Great Britain.  We have been doing that since the war began.  The Deputy was for 12 months Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>My Department is not situated in Great Britain; it is in Upper Merrion Street.  Does the Deputy realise that this deals with the handling and slaughter of cattle in Great Britain?  I do not include any part of this country in Great Britain. All that has been adequately discussed at Colwyn Bay since and, as I understand the arrangements at present, they are entirely satisfactory to the Live Stock Shipping Association.  The accommodation at Birkenhead is to be extended, and I am not without hope that, as a result of this arrangement, the port and slaughtering facilities at Birkenhead, which I think are the best in England, will be substantially reserved for our fat cattle and that fat <Col N="2251" /> cattle from other sources will go to Glasgow slaughterhouse or some other recognised slaughtering point in Scotland. One of the great advantages about Birkenhead is the rapidity with which we can get fat stock from there to the slaughterhouses and the utter absence of subsequent transport for them, that is to say, that they walk from the boat to the slaughterhouse and this eliminates the danger of bruising and injury which is not insignificant in the course of protracted rail journeys in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I particularly want to say this.  In a light-hearted moment on the occasion of my visit to London I declared that we were perfectly content with the arrangements made with Mr. Smith in regard to eggs and I said: &ldquo;Give us the facilities and we will drown you with eggs.&rdquo;  This had the astonishing result that some solicitious merchants and poultry-keepers over there bombarded the Department of Agriculture with queries and said that this disturber from Ireland was going to destroy all the hens in England and what would they do if the English people were to be drowned in that way with Irish eggs.</P>

      <P>When they do, I think they will hold me in the same high regard as does the Deputy.  I want to say this quite clearly, to still the worried hearts of these nervous creatures, that it was understood by my predecessor and by myself, that we would countenance no question of the control of our exports to Great Britain under this agreement, because it was understood by both parties that certain quantities would be taken, but it is perfectly true that just as the intention was expressed that a certain ratio of fat to store cattle was the mutual hope of both parties to the 1948 agreement, so it was the mutual hope of both parties to this egg agreement that the major percentage increase would take place in winter.  In fact, our aim was to maximise our winter supply for the very excellent reason that we got a better price in winter than in summer. <Col N="2252" /> It simply means that you have got to have the pullets hatched in January and February if you want the hens to lay in October, November and December. Let me reassure the anxious British people who own hatching pullets in January and February and even earlier, as far as they can, that we reckon that these gracious ladies will exert themselves with particular energy in the winter months and that the prospects of the henneries in England being swept away by the flood-tide of Irish eggs is highly remote, but we confidently anticipate adding substantially to the egg supplies of Great Britain during the winter of this year, next year and of many winters to come. That is all I have to say about the trade agreement.</P>

      <P>If I never achieve anything else in public life, the comparatively trivial part I played in negotiating this trade agreement in Britain is quite sufficient to justify the 15 years I have spent pothering about this House.  There is no job I would prefer in this wide world than to be Minister for Agriculture in this country.  There is no achievement in the course of my ministry of which I shall be prouder than this agreement which my colleagues and I have brought back from London.  It provides for the farmers of this country a sure and certain market at remunerative prices for every conceivable product that the land of Ireland can produce.  There is nothing standing between any farmer in this country and modest prosperity, but his own reluctance to work.  Any farmer in Ireland who is prepared to work his land with ordinary diligence according to the methods he himself thinks right is assured of a good living for the next four years, and by that assurance is cast upon him the solemn obligation in justice to see that the agricultural workers who work beside him and make possible his profitable production <Col N="2253" /> will get their just share of what he earns.  I know that there are some farmers&mdash;thank God, they are very few &mdash;who will resent this reminder of the obligation in justice that devolves upon them to see that the agricultural worker gets his share of these advantages that our Government has secured for our people.  They are meant for everybody, for the consumer, for the producer and for the man who works to make that production possible.  I stake my reputation that working freely as free men, putting compulsion behind us, our farmers will do this Government and this country honour in the way they will take advantage of the immense advantages here available and that they will do more.  In addition to enjoying those advantages themselves, they will pass on their just share to what has been one of the most downtrodden sections of our community but which, please God, is soon going where it belongs, right up to the top of the tree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time, I think about the time that this agreement was either signed or being negotiated, it was stated that the Minister for Agriculture was extremely prone to exaggeration.  I am now convinced that that is not the case and I am glad that he has been able to tell us that this provision regarding 75 per cent. store cattle and 25 per cent. fat cattle does not mean anything at all, that the word of honour he got from some British Minister or other is what really counts and that the real idea would be 75 per cent. fat cattle and only 25 per cent. store.  He indicated quite clearly that this document was not going to prevent that, but I am afraid that it is written in this document and that we only heard the Minister's opinion, in other words, some of the exaggeration he has been accustomed to use.  I think that it is highly unfair to the whole agricultural community to mislead them in that way.  They will have to abide by what is in this document and nothing else, no matter who tells us that the British are going to do anything else.  I believe that it is an exaggeration if not an untruth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tells us that Britain will not turn <Col N="2254" /> beef away and in the answer to a question I asked him as to what cattle were exported on the 3rd, 10th, 17th and 25th July, I got the following figures.  On the 3rd, 825 stores; on the 10th, 853 stores; on the 17th, 1,427 stores and on the 24th, 1,572 stores.  The fat cattle exported were: on the 3rd of July, 3; the following week, 250; the next week, 219 and the next week, 490.  It would appear, therefore, that the farmer is getting better prices for stores than for fat cattle and that that is the reason that there are more stores going over, and notwithstanding what the Minister told us, will continue to go over.  I do not believe for one moment that Britain wants fat cattle at all, for if they wanted them they would not have put these figures in the agreement at all.  Statements like those are unfair to the Minister, to the Department of Agriculture and to this House.  It is an attempt to mislead men who have greater ability than he has, the farming community and the people in the cattle trade.  I could give other figures to prove that.  For example, yesterday at the sales stores made a good deal more money than fat cattle and that is going to continue.</P>
    <P>I am a bit puzzled about the question of the 5/-.  I do not know exactly where it went to, but I suppose it went into the British Exchequer.  It must have gone some place like that because, since the agreement was made, cattle fell by at least £5 or £7 a beast. We must have been getting the 5/-which is given to the British for two months' fattening of stores.  It is my opinion that the price will go still lower, because we are going into a time of large supplies.  Therefore, the advantages that the Minister for Agriculture has pointed out will certainly not be visible until less cattle are on the market.  That has been the curse of the country for years and years. Farmers had no opportunity of keeping up prices except by curtailing production. That was always the case. What will the position be now considering that the only relief they had was the continental buyer?  Even yesterday, what sort of market would you have had at the Dublin market if the continental buyers were not there? <Col N="2255" /> Therefore that 5/- and the elimination, for that is what it means, of the continental buyers is a disaster so far as the cattle trade is concerned.  No matter how honourable this Mr. Williams or anyone else may be, I do not believe that it is right or proper to put the whole of our cattle trade and those who are living by it, and they are the greater part of the community, into the hands of the British alone.  They are ordinary human beings and they require some stimulating. It is good for them and better for us.  One of the biggest faults in this agreement is, I think, the clear indication that they intend to eliminate the continental buyers.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I am very disappointed.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture has a complete agreement about it but he forgot to tell us of it.  We know that we are to get 1,500,000 tons of coal in the coming year.  But the Minister never said a word about food for our live stock or manure for our land.  How are we going to produce all these cattle and all these fowl which are going to drown the British in eggs if there is no food for them?</P>
    <P>The fact is that it was a great misfortune that there was so much propaganda about this question of day-old chicks.  Thousands of them have died of hunger because there is no food for them.  In a great many places the great bulk of them turned out to be cocks; there were hardly any pullets at all.  Our friends who relieve us of a good deal of cattle and queer the pitch so far as statistics are concerned, I believe, sent van loads of them around the country and they were sold to people who believed they were all right.  Now, of course, they have a yard full of the best Rhode Island Red cocks.  That was a very loose way of doing the business.  It is no wonder the <i>Irish Times</i> said of the Minister for Agriculture that he occasionally mistook geese for swans.  He should give a lot more thought to that matter because it is a serious one for farmers.</P>
    <P>We did have a meeting of the advisory committee once since the Minister took office.  I was one of those <Col N="2256" /> who advocated very strongly that we should procure as much artificial manure as we could get.  But there is not a thing doing since.  The price of. any manure that can be got is so exorbitant that the ordinary farmer cannot put it on his land.  Where are we going to get the food to feed and fatten all these cattle?  How are we going to produce the food to feed the thousands of fowl when there is nothing coming in from abroad?  If Great Britain is in a position to procure that food from other countries, I think we should have got a share of it.  It would be much more important than some of the items here, and some of the items which the Minister for Agriculture has himself put in.</P>
    <P>I am therefore disappointed with this agreement, because we knew and everybody else knew that a portion of that subsidy the British were getting on their cattle was being passed on to us.  We are going to be minus that now &mdash;the 2/6 or 3/- a cwt.  That is now disappearing, and the fall in the price of cattle was to a large extent due to that.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty which I think is going to be created immediately this matter gets publicity.  Our farmers have to take a long view of things and budget in advance.  If the continental buyers are to be eliminated, they will know that as soon as these buyers disappear down will go the price of cattle.  These are the two things to which I take particular objection. If the actual terms of the agreement were as the Minister for Agriculture has told us they were, it would be a fairly good agreement.  I do not know, however, that we are entitled to take his word, no matter how honourable he may be, and we will hardly take the word of the British Minister.  I think these were foolish statements to make and, once the people find out that such statements as these were made, they will tend to lose confidence in the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture will want to create a great deal of confidence in himself through the country because there is certainly a want of confidence in what he has been doing.</P>
    <P>I do not think any farmer is satisfied <Col N="2257" /> with this agreement.  I have heard many of them state that it is a complete surrender.  We are now giving the boot to the continental buyers, because that is what it really amounts to, and they were the only hope that the farmers had of keeping prices up.  It is only the possibility of being able to sell his produce that will induce a farmer to produce more.  The farmer had to cheesepare and cut down production because he was always afraid that he could not sell his produce.  If anything happens to prevent the British from taking our potatoes and if the price which they are to pay for them is not put down in black and white, I am positive that we are going to have a big surplus of potatoes and that there will be no sale for them. Therefore, the sort of wild statements which have been made are not at all suitable.  I am sorry that we have to accept this agreement.  I would sooner have what the Minister for Agriculture told us, but, unfortunately, it is not in the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speakers, it is very difficult to know what they intend to do.  If they intend to put this agreement to a vote, I shall certainly vote for it.  I shall vote for it as a farmer because, so far as the sections of the agreement which relate to agriculture are concerned, I believe that they do definitely improve the existing position.  I do not profess to know very much about the portions of the agreement which affect industry. These particular sections may be good or otherwise, but as a farmer I consider that, as agriculture is our basic industry, the fact that this agreement is satisfactory so far as agriculture is concerned commends it to me.  I believe that it is a good agreement, mainly because it definitely relates agricultural prices here to prices in Great Britain.  If I thought for one moment that the British Government were likely to revert to the policy which they pursued in the early thirties, the policy of compelling their farmers to produce cheap food in order to lower the cost of industrial production, I would not be very enthusiastic about this agreement.  Everybody in the House will acknowledge that the <Col N="2258" /> British have learned a lesson.  They have learned that agriculture is their most important industry.  They have learned that it is absolutely essential for their very existence to give the farmers and their workers a reasonable return for their labour.  As it is definitely the policy of the British. Government to see that their agricultural producers are amply rewarded, I think it is definitely an achievement. and advantage to have our prices closely related to the prices which the British farmer will obtain,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same people, including the exMinister for Industry and Commerce, suggested that it might have been just as well to let things take their course &mdash;to have no definite trade agreement with Britain because competition would keep up the prices of agricultural produce and perhaps other produce also. We must remember that we are passing through the third year after the termination of the war.  It was during the third year after the termination of the first world war that agricultural prices collapsed&mdash;particularly live-stock prices.  Throughout the farming industry this year, and particularly early this year, there was a notable feeling: of uncertainty.  Farmers said: &ldquo;Prices are good; they are very good as far as live stock is concerned but will they last?&rdquo;  I know what would happen if there was even a temporary slump. There would immediately be a panic and a serious collapse in the live-stock industry.  There is no danger of that now.  We know that for four years prices are stabilised.  The farmer can go all out to increase his stocks and to turn them out better, if possible, knowing that at least there will not be a definite collapse in live-stock prices. That is certainly a very great advantage to the agricultural industry.  Looking at this from a long term point of view, it is true that this agreement is only for a period of four years and, as far as cattle are concerned, that is not a very long term.  But definitely the decision to relate our live-stock and agricultural prices generally to British prices for those four years establishes. a precedent which I think will continue much longer than the four years.  When this agreement works in a satisfactory <Col N="2259" /> way to both sides, I am satisfied that when the period expires the precedent which has been established will continue and we shall have established a basis of good trading relationship between the two countries that will be of immense advantage to the agricultural community and to the rest of the community too.  I was not very fully impressed by the arguments advanced by the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the remaining price differential of 5s.  It is an achievement to have reduced the differential between Irish bred and produced cattle and British bred and produced cattle down to 5s. per cwt. but I feel that we should go all out and continue to go all out to get that existing differential removed.  I think the Minister made the case that the 5s. extra which the British farmer receives represents a bonus paid by the British taxpayer.  However, we must remember that it is, nevertheless, the price that the British farmer gets and whether he gets it directly from the consumers or from the entire British community as taxpayers it does not alter the situation in the slightest.  The British Government agreed to British farmers being paid a certain price because they consider that it is a just price and because they consider it is the lowest price at which the farmer can efficiently and economically produce meat.  Therefore, since our costs of production are not less than the costs in Britain we have an unanswerable case in demanding that we should at least get as good a price as the British farmer is getting and I do not think that we should have any hesitation in continuing to strive towards that objective.  It must be remembered in this connection that the British farmer enjoys an enormous variety of advantages over our Irish farmer.  He has ample fertilisers at a very low price &mdash;a price little more than 50 per cent. of what the Irish farmer has to pay. His land is completely exempt from rates.  There are tillage subsidies on practically most of the tillage lands and, in addition, I think that he has a greater supply of feeding stuffs but I am not so sure of that particular point.  However, his production costs are undoubtedly lower than ours are. <Col N="2260" /> I was rather surprised that there was not some section in the agreement whereby the British Government would enable us to import additional fertilisers. I was hoping that something like that would be included in the agreement for us.  It may be that some provision is being made in that respect otherwise.  Certainly it is a very urgent need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised a question as to whether it might or might not have been possible to make a better agreement. That is a question about which we could debate for hours.  Whenever a farmer sells a beast at a fair he goes home wondering, if he had held out, whether he could have got five, six, seven, eight or nine shillings more for the beast or could he have got even a pound per head more?  He can never be quite sure.  He knows that he might have got a little more and he knows also that he might have missed the sale and had to bring his cattle home. That is always the feeling that prevails in the mind of a man who has made a bargain.  However, the average man takes the philosophical view of the question and says: &ldquo;Well, I did the best I could and I am quite happy.&rdquo; That is the view of the ordinary farmer with a business like mine.  The ex-Minister went further.  He said that when our Ministers went to London they talked too much.  That is another debatable question about which we farmers could give a diversity of opinions.  I am a farmer of long experience. On going to the fairs I see all kinds of bargains being made and I see all the different types of dealers at them.  There is the man who will come up to you and shout and bellow and talk and who will slap your hand and walk away.  He will then come back again and will make all kinds of gestures and put on all kinds of acts which would do justice to an Abbey Theatre act.  He would show his contempt for you and his disgust at your amazing ignorance of the value of cattle and so on.  You meet all those types of people and you meet the other type of buyer who comes up to you quietly and in a gentlemanly way and whispers that you have made a slight mistake in regard to your estimation of the value of the stock.  In a gentle kind of way, <Col N="2261" /> without attracting any attention, he succeeds in making a deal with you.  I have had experience of these different kinds of buyers and I have had experience of being caught out by these different kinds of buyers.  The man who shouts and bellows will sometimes score.  Likewise, the man who whispers will sometimes score.  It is a debatable question as to which type of technique is the most effective in driving a bargain. I do not intend to give a decision on that question.  I think every man has his own manner of approach and every man knows what his best approach is.  Probably our Ministers knew what they were doing in London and they handled the situation which presented itself to them to the best of their ability.  It is no use shouting that this is a wonderful agreement; that we have scored over the British; that we have won something from them; that we have codded them to some extent.  Neither is there any use in going around saying that the British have fooled us.  In every bargain there must be a certain amount of give and take.  We had to give certain things to the British in order to get certain benefits from them.  The question arises then as to whether we made a fair bargain as between what we hoped to gain and what we obtained.  I think on the whole the advantages we have gained outweigh the disadvantages, particularly in regard to agricultural products.  We did certainly give the British a very big concession.  Let there be no mistake about that.  We restricted the entry of continental buyers into our markets.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tabled a question in this House asking for information as to the number of cattle which were exported to Britain in the 12 months prior and the number that were exported to the Continent.  The information I was given was that in the year ending 31st March, 1948, our exports of fat cattle to Great Britain were 56,669.  Our exports of store cattle were 221,848.  Our exports to the Continent were 57,000 odd.  That means that our total exports to Great Britain were 335,577 cattle as against 57,000 to the Continent.  I do not like to be dogmatic about figures, because when <Col N="2262" /> I was eight years old I was severely chastised by my esteemed teacher for daring to suggest that four and two made eight.  But I have made a calculation on these figures and my calculation is that if we are confined to exporting 10 per cent. of our total cattle to the Continent we shall be confined to an upper limit of 33,000 as against 57,000 for the 12 months to the 31st May, 1949.  We have made that concession to the British.  The value of the concession ought not to be underestimated, because it is a considerable one.  On the whole I feel that the return we shall gain from it in a stabilised market is worth the difference. But let nobody say that we have fooled the British any more than the British have fooled us.  We have driven a hard bargain with them and they have driven a hard bargain with us.  That is the sensible approach to the position.  I have no doubt that the provisions of the agreement will be honoured by Deputies on the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that trade relations between the two countries will become more and more harmonious as the years go on.  We have not had a very happy trade relationship with Great Britain over the past 25 years.  First of all, we had the collapse in agricultural prices for which the first World War was responsible&mdash;a collapse which was brought about by the folly of the British Government in throwing their agricultural industry on the scrap heap. Then we had the Economic War which completely upset all trade relations. After that we had the second World War which made trade relations very unstable.  On the basis of this agreement I think that we can look forward to fairly satisfactory trading conditions to the mutual advantage of both nations.  I do not accept the implication in the Minister's statement that the farmer does not share his prosperity with his worker.  As a farmer I resent that allegation very much. The farmers of this country have always endeavoured to treat their workers as well as they possibly could. I am satisfied they will continue to do so in the future.  While agricultural wages are low, it is not difficult to calculate the income of the average <Col N="2263" /> farmer.  We know what the total value of agricultural output is.  It is a little over £100,000,000.  Divided over the 650,000 people engaged in the industry that gives an income of about £3 per week to every person employed in agriculture. It cannot be held, therefore, that anyone is making a fortune out of agriculture or that anyone in the industry is being unfairly treated.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Agriculture that this agreement constitutes a basis upon which we can build our agricultural industry in security.  Not only have the farmers to work harder and more efficiently in the future but they have also got to be watchful of the burdens that may be placed upon them. The prices of agricultural produce are only good in relation to agricultural costs.  If agricultural costs continue to rise the prices we get as a result of this agreement will prove to be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture twitted Deputy Smith because he said that if he had the responsibility of signing this agreement he would have hesitated a good deal before he signed one with two clauses in it&mdash;one which limits our export of cattle to countries other than Britain to 10 per cent. of what we send to Britain and the other which limits our fat cattle exports to Britain to 25 per cent. of the total cattle sent to that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said very bluntly that he thought Deputy Smith was a fool for expressing his hesitation in that way.  There are some gentlemen who rush in, jump in, where angels fear to tread.  I am not saying that Deputy Smith is an angel, and I am not saying that the Minister for Agriculture is a very wise man.  If he were wise he would hesitate a good deal before he signed an agreement which may be the cause of great difficulties here in the future.  Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly pointed out that we have alternative buyers in the Dublin market and that has had the effect of keeping up the price of our stock.  These stock are sold not only to continental but to British buyers. Any person who frequents the Dublin <Col N="2264" /> market will know that for a number of years the fact that there were continental buyers there competing with the British made the British pay £2 or £3 a head more than they otherwise would.  I fear that under this agreement there will be a temptation for the British to hold back until the quota of 10 per cent. for the continental buyers is filled and then they will give us their own price for the remaining 90 per cent.  The competition for the 90 per cent. will be between the British farmers themselves.  I would prefer to see not only British farmers competing for our store cattle but also continental buyers.</P>
    <P>The other point that Deputy Smith was doubtful about was with reference to restricting our exports of fat cattle to Britain to 25 per cent. of our total exports to that country.  If the price of stores falls in future and if there is any reasonable price for fats the tendency for our farmers will be to keep their stores until they are fat.  It would be difficult to say to every farmer: &ldquo;You are going to sell four cattle, but you can fatten only one for the British market.&rdquo;  It would be very difficult to arrange to have exactly 25 per cent. of our cattle exported to England&mdash;25 per cent. of fat cattle and no more.  If it comes to the point that more than 25 per cent. of the cattle are offered for sale to England we will have the same difficulty as the British forced us into during the Economic War, when we had to give permits to people to export fat cattle.  That was the cause of great difficulty before and I do not think we should show any great joy at having a clause inserted in the agreement which may cause us difficulties of a similar kind in the future.</P>
    <P>There was nobody louder in denouncing the administration of the permit system during the Economic War than the then Deputy Dillon.  If he remembers his denunciation of the efforts of the Department of Agriculture to distribute those permits he will realise one reason why Deputy Smith might have some doubts about this agreement and why he is not receiving it with any great joy.  The Minister for Agriculture, in the course of his exploits when <Col N="2265" /> this agreement was under consideration in London, said he was not the sort of man who would charge an old customer an extravagant price for his goods.  That is all very fine and dandy and it is a very fine sentiment for the Minister to give his customers, his private customers, his goods at a cheap rate.  In this case, however, he is giving the goods of the Irish farmer to Britain and I think it is his job to get the highest possible price.  The British are not quite as soft-hearted or soft-headed as the Minister for Agriculture. We are very old customers of theirs and a short time ago we found ourselves in a tight spot for fuel.  We have been buying coal from them for many years, but they did not hesitate to charge us a very high price, 25/- a ton more than they charged consumers in England.  If we are to import 1,500,000 tons of coal and pay 25/- a ton more for it than is charged to their own consumers, we cannot consider their attitude so favourably.</P>

      <P>We had to buy the wheat from the Argentine.  The situation is that the British have to buy our meat in order to keep up the ration of 10d. worth the Minister was talking about. I do not think the Minister for Agriculture should have any hesitation in asking them for as high a price as he can get.  Even if he asked a very high price that is not to say they will give it.  When it comes to making a bargain they are quite tough and they will not give an extra price to the Minister for Agriculture simply because of his blue eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take the abolition of the 5/-per cwt. between Irish fat cattle and what the Minister calls Anglo-Irish fat cattle and let me calculate what it will mean.  As Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, in the past because of the competition of British farmers for our cattle we got some of the 5/- that they got from the <Col N="2266" /> British Government for keeping the cattle for two months.  We are not going to get the full 5/- under the present agreement because there is in the clause which purports to give us the same price for Irish fat cattle as for Anglo-Irish fat cattle a proviso that the price is &ldquo;subject to appropriate adjustment in respect of marketing costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I think I heard all his speech&mdash;did not advert to that particular part of the section and I do not know whether he knows by how much the 5/- will be reduced in respect to an &ldquo;appropriate adjustment of marketing costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it will help the Deputy I shall give him the price that cattle would make without the agreement and the price they are making after the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the British farmer got 5/- per cwt. for keeping an Irish beast for two months and selling him afterwards as a fat animal.  The Irish farmer who takes over his beast for slaughter in Birkenhead will get that 5/- minus an appropriate reduction in respect of marketing costs.  I hope that some Minister will explain before this debate ends, by how much the 5/-will be reduced in respect of the marketing costs referred to.  Supposing that we got the total 5/- per cwt. for fats.  They are restricted to about 25 per cent. of our total exports&mdash;say 100,000.  Take it that the average beast would be a 10 cwt. beast, which would be heavy, that would amount to 50/- per beast or a total of £250,000 on 100,000 beasts.  That would be the maximum gain in respect of the differential between Irish fat cattle and Anglo-Irish fat cattle.  You have to put against that the £1,750,000 we are giving the British for coal over and above what they are charging their own consumers at the present time plus, of course, freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Taoiseach had no word of criticism or complaint that we were not going to get anything out of the sterling pool in dollars in the coming year.  Last year it must be remembered <Col N="2267" /> that for the nine months ending June we got £12,000,000 worth of dollars out of that pool.  For the coming 12 months, according to the statement made by the Taoiseach here and by the Minister for Finance on another occasion, we are going to make no net draw of dollars out of the sterling area pool.  That is, we are committed to get all the dollars we want over and above the dollars we earn, by borrowing from the United States or by obtaining a gift from the United States.  We have undertaken not to make any net draw on the sterling area pool.  Have the British undertaken in their case not to make any net draw?</P>
    <P>For a number of years past one of the weaknesses of the sterling area, the great weakness of the sterling area, was the amount of dollars which was spent, not by ourselves but by Britain. I saw that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a speech made last September pointed out that of the dollars spent at that time out of the Washington Agreement, £1,500,000,000 worth of dollars was spent on capital development that had been completed in England.  The British expenditure had reduced the dollar assets of the sterling area by something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000,000 worth of dollars and during the years that that was done, we had been adding to our sterling assets.  The people as a whole of this country, not because of any wish of the Government, but simply because we could not get stuff, actually added in 1946 £20,000,000 to the sterling assets, so while Britain had been overspending their assets to the tune of £1,500,000,000, we had underspent our current earnings by £20,000,000.  If we are in the next year or so to be restricted in our drawings from the area pool, are the British going to restrict themselves in their calls on the assets of the sterling area? The whole sterling area arrangements, started before the war, were based on the assumption that the British would take reasonable care of the assets upon which she was basing her credits. During the war, on that assumption a number of people gave her credits. Since the war, they have been not only <Col N="2268" /> dispersing the number of dollar and hard-currency credits, but they have also gone through a couple of thousand million pounds worth of dollars.  I think if we are to bind ourselves not to make any net draw on the sterling area pool, there should have been an equal binding on the British not to make any net draw.</P>
    <P>If we take the two matters together &mdash;the Taoiseach said we should keep them separate but they were discussed together in Britain and it is right they should be discussed together here&mdash;it seems to me from all the series of agreements that have been entered into in regard to dollars and in regard to cattle and industrial products that the British have driven a very hard bargain indeed.  The Minister, of course, will know better than private Deputies or Deputies in opposition what the situation was that drove them to accept a series of agreements, which will bear hardly on our economy and which may present great difficulties to us in the future.  All I can say is that I hope that there was complete justification for entering into these agreements and that everything possible was done to make certain that our case was put as strongly as possible.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture, who exaggerates in public on some occasions, was not allowed to run away from his responsibilities when he was speaking across the table to the British Ministers.  The idea that we should not drive a hard bargain with them while they were allowed to drive such a hard bargain with us is nonsensical and is not the way to gain the respect of such hard bargainers as the British Ministers proved themselves to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is prepared to accept that there will be a reasonable interpretation of a very loose phrase in this agreement.  He believes that the British will interpret the phrase &ldquo;excessive differential&rdquo; or &ldquo;excessive increase&rdquo; in a reasonable way.  He gave us no indication here to-day of what was to be his interpretation of &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in that regard. He pointed out himself in relation to the 1938 agreement that when the British wanted to get out of the clear terms of that they put an interpretation upon it that runs contrary to the <Col N="2269" /> clear meaning of the clause.  If they can turn round and deny the meaning of Clause 1 of the 1938 agreement, I am perfectly certain that when it comes to interpret what is to be an &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; increase or what is not going to be &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; increase, they will do what they want to do themselves and tell the Minister that it was not excessive.</P>
    <P>Before this debate ends I hope that, for the guidance of our farmers, some Minister will explain what are the marketing charges, the marketing costs in respect of which the 5/- per cwt. will be reduced.</P>

      <P>May I supply the information now?  If the agreement had not been negotiated on the date in June, the price of Grade A cattle would be 17½d.; as a result of the trade agreement special quality cattle will be 19d. and Grade A cattle 18½d.  Grade B, if the agreement had not been negotiated, would be 14¼d., and Grade B, under the agreement, 14¼d.  You have therefore an advantage of 1½d. a lb. for special quality cattle and 1d. a lb. on Grade A cattle over the old Grade A, while Grade B is the same before and after the agreement.</P>

      <P>As a farmer and as one who can claim, I think, to know as much as any Deputy in this House <Col N="2271" /> about the cattle trade, if not more, I welcome this agreement and I think it is a great step forward for the farmers of Ireland.  It is the first time in the history of this country that the farmer knows exactly what he is going to get for a calf that is born to-morrow.  No wonder calves have gone up since the agreement was signed.  They have gone up in Mullingar, my own town, to £9, £10 and £11.  We were discussing the matter the other day in Mullingar and farmers there maintained that a good calf a week old is worth £7 or £8, and that price is guaranteed for the next four years.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Aiken, to Deputy O'Reilly and to some of the statements of the Minister for Agriculture, I, as one who is in the cattle trade, laughed at how little they know about us. First of all, with regard to the 75 per cent. stores, Deputy O'Reilly answered the question very admirably by giving us the answer which he got to the question which he put down.  There were 825 stores one week, 853 another, 1,000 another and 1,552 another week. Against that there were three fat cattle one week, 250 the following week, 290 the week after and 409 in the last week. Last week, therefore, three times as many stores as fat cattle went with the increased price.  That answers their grouse that we never reached the position of 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>You take 50,000 cattle going to the Continent.  Deputy Aiken was afraid, I think, that when the continental buyer stopped they would go down.  I cannot see why the continental buyers will stop buying with a 50,000 cattle quota this year.  They are not able to get sufficient boats to bring more than 700 or 800 a week.  I do not believe they are bringing 1,000 a week to the Continent.  There are 52 weeks in the year and, therefore, you will have the continental buyers in the Dublin market every week in the year.  That does away with Deputy Aiken's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They bought 57,000 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are to buy 50,000 this year.  They will not be out of the Dublin market any week this year <Col N="2272" /> unless they can get a lot more boats. Last year, with 57,000, they were in the Dublin market the whole year.  Buyers from Holland were in the Dublin market every week.  Deputy O'Reilly said that the prices of cattle were going down and he was fretting about what would happen if the continental buyers were not in the Dublin market.  There were only English and Northern Ireland buyers in the Dublin market for stores and there were three times as many bought.  We would all like to see the number of cattle shipped to the Continent increased to 100,000.  If we wanted to sell for the continental trade we could ask 5/-, 6/- and 7/- per lb. for beef and we would get it.  But would that suit us in this country?  As a farmer and a person in the cattle trade, my honest opinion is that the price of beef is high enough and that the price of cattle is high enough to pay the farmer for rearing them.  If we want to fall out with England on the question of price, there is no question but that the continental trade will be there for years to come, because there is hardly a four-footed animal on the Continent. If the Minister for Agriculture wanted to soar the price of cattle up to £10 per cwt., he could say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to England and the continental buyers would buy every beast we had.  They are clamouring for them every day. They would give 5/- a pound or even 10/- a pound for beef.  Did anybody ever ask what these buyers are getting for our meat?  I know well what they are getting.  I saw cattle going there for the last two years and I know what the results are.  I think that would be a dangerous policy for us to adopt in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement made by the Minister for Agriculture is a wise agreement. He is getting from the English Government a guaranteed market at guaranteed prices for four years.  Now when a calf is born, we will know what we will get for it in four years' time.  I do not know how anybody can say anything against that agreement.  We also have a guaranteed price for other agricultural produce.  I welcome the statement of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to potatoes, because I think potatoes are the easiest crop that a farmer can grow.  The biggest <Col N="2273" /> bother is the pitting of the potatoes but, with modern methods, that can be got over.  There is no trouble in putting in the potatoes and growing them.  Therefore, as I say, they are the best crop that a farmer can grow.  The growing of beet is all right, as it is necessary for the provision of sugar, but it is the dearest crop a farmer can grow.  I would not grow it except as a manure crop and the necessity for it in order to produce sugar.  I always went in for potatoes when I could get a market for them.  The Minister for Agriculture has told us that he has got an unlimited market for potatoes.</P>

      <P>If the Minister extends that market we will not want any tillage inspectors in this country.  The farmers will be wise to grow potatoes because they will pay them.  The previous Minister for Agriculture was concerned about the 5/- difference between Irish and English-bred cattle.  I do not blame the English for that because it is a safeguard for their own farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to fret about that 5/-.  If the English farmer thinks he is not getting enough for his cattle, he will fight for a higher price and we shall have a case to follow up.  In that way I say that the English farmer will be fighting for a higher price for our cattle.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about poultry and the fact that there were so many cocks amongst the chicks.  People know well that those chicks which were coming over the Border were cocks.  Anyone in the business can order pullets and get them. These people who are going around with these cockerels only fool farmers like Deputy O'Reilly.  I think this is a great agreement and, if the farmers are not satisfied with it, I do not know what they will be satisfied with.  I hope the Minister will follow up this question of the potatoes.  I congratulate the Minister and the Taoiseach and all the members of the Government on the great day's work they did for the farmers of Ireland when they signed the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been raised in this debate on which I understand information will be considered desirable.  There is the question of this country's over-all balance of payments with other countries and a certain question as to dollars and what facilities we have to get dollars.  These are two matters which I should like to get into proper perspective.  The House will know that at the end of August last year what was called the &ldquo;dollar crisis&rdquo; hit the world.  There was a very brief period in which sterling was supposed to be freely convertible. It was realised at the end of August last year, however, that that situation could no longer obtain.  In these circumstances, the members of the Government then representing this country were requested to cross to London to discuss the question of the dollar exchange and they did go, it being understood at the same time that general trade matters would be brought under discussion.  Before going to that meeting and at a time when he had notice of what was called the &ldquo;dollar crisis&rdquo;, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Deputy Lemass, went to Letterkenny and delivered a speech to a Fianna Fáil meeting.  I am reading from the report of that speech in a newspaper of the 15th September, 1947.  In black-line type in the paper I have was this: &ldquo;Warning that Irish purchases in the United States of America may have to cease was given by Mr. Seán Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he addressed a Fianna Fáil meeting at Letterkenny yesterday.&rdquo;  Then there is a quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The London dollar pool is running dry, and what is left of it is insufficient to meet the needs of countries like ourselves who have claims on it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The paper heading continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister said that Ireland is ready and willing to co-operate in any measures proposed to protect sterling, as Irish interest in sterling is very large (£400,000,000).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was then another quotation to the effect that we would like a plan for the development of the whole sterling <Col N="2275" /> area and not a scheme designed specifically to benefit Britain alone. The remarks in that speech are to be commended.  The Minister of the time, in the same speech, spoke about the balance of payments, and from the same newspaper, I give this quotation of what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this year it looks as if we will import goods to the value of £90,000,000, while our exports will total barely £30,000,000.  It is more than doubtful whether our income from other sources, external investments, tourist expenditure and the like, will bridge the gap.  There are people who say that we should restrict the number of visitors while we have food scarcities here.  With our imports running at £60,000,000 per year in excess of our exports, we must find the means of paying for them somehow.  Nobody will sell us goods for nothing.</P>
    <P>Included in our imports are foodstuffs to the value of £17,000,000, and the revenue we get from the tourist business just about pays for them. If the gap between exports and imports remains around £60,000,000 per year, then sooner or later, we will be forced to take special action to push up exports or to curtail imports, even if it means doing without goods that we want.</P>
    <P>It will not be merely a matter of dollars and U.S.A. supplies, but of sheer inability to pay our way unless we can get output up and exports expanded, or increase our other sources of revenue such as the tourist business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That speech was made in September, 1947, and the forecast that the then Minister made was that on visible trade the balance against us was likely to be £60,000,000.  The actual balance, as it turned out in the end of the year, against us was £90,000,000 in visibles, but invisibles bridged that gap to a considerable degree.  After counting everything in our favour and counting some things liberally in our favour we had an overall deficit in the year 1947 of £30,000,000.  The Minister, at Letterkenny, then continued&mdash;and this is <Col N="2276" /> where the heading from the newspaper came from&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is what the Press calls a dollar crisis.  It means, simply, that the U.S.A. is exporting goods&mdash;goods which the world urgently needs&mdash;at the rate of one billion dollars per month more than she is importing. These goods must be paid for in dollars.  As a result, all the dollars, gold and free exchange in the world are being sucked into the U.S.A., and very soon there will be none left, and the purchase of goods from the U.S.A. will have to stop&mdash;unless she sells on credit, or by loans, gifts or investments, or puts more dollars into circulation.  We got our dollars in the past merely by exchanging British pounds for them in London&mdash; pounds which we got from the sale of cattle to Britain, or from the tourist trade, or similarly.  Now, the London dollar pool is running dry, and what is left of it is insufficient to meet the needs of countries like ourselves who have claims on it, except for a very short time.  The net result is that we will have to curtail our purchases in the U.S.A., and at some stage they may even have to stop. We have an interest in preserving the exchange value of British money. Various official funds, banks, insurance companies and private firms in this country own about £400,000,000 sterling.  If the exchange value of these assets should be reduced, then our ability to pay our way abroad while preserving our present standard of living will be reduced also. We are, therefore, very ready and willing to co-operate in any measure that might be proposed to protect sterling.  The obvious method is to develop the resources of the sterling area; to expand its exports and reduce its imports.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A plan for that purpose must, however, be designed to benefit all the countries in the sterling area, to develop all their production resources equally, and not merely for the benefit of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The resources of the sterling area,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are immense, and, if properly utilised, will be adequate to meet the needs of the people in it <Col N="2277" /> and ultimately to restore the position so that freedom of international trade can be re-established.  Until that is achieved, however, we cannot end shortages here because, in present circumstances, there are many classes of goods which we need which, if we cannot get them from the U.S.A., we cannot get at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to speak of the difficulty of getting the realities of the international situation understood.  He said there was too much complacency bred here.  People took too easy a view of things.  Those remarks were made by Mr. Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the 14th of September, 1947, and were quoted in the papers of the 15th of September, 1947.  Some time after that he, with the heads of his Government&mdash;and Deputy Aiken was one of them&mdash;went to London.  A summary of the results of the discussions between the Irish Government and the British Government were issued as a White Paper. Deputies can read that for themselves. I do not think I derided it by saying that there was nothing very solid or binding or anything that could be called very good for this country in it. The fourth section of the result of these discussions is headed &ldquo;Ireland's dollar requirements&rdquo;.  The agreement is in these terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was agreed that the Irish Government, with a view to conserving the dollar resources of the sterling area, would effect substantial reductions in their drawings of dollars from the dollar pool for the period 1st October, 1947, to 30th June, 1948, bringing the net requirements to £14,000,000 plus Irish dollar earnings. This sum would be further reduced in the event of non-dollar wheat being procurable instead of dollar wheat. Expenditure in other currencies will also be kept to a minimum during the period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, non-dollar wheat was procured in the main, so that the agreement, as it was worked out, meant that the requirements were kept to £12,000,000 for nine months&mdash;say £16,000,000 for a year. Our earnings in dollars are about £8,000,000 worth, so that we had, <Col N="2278" /> roughly under that agreement, about £24,000,000 worth of dollars in a year. Our expenditure at that time was running in the region of £22,000,000 a year over and above our dollar earnings, or £30,000,000 worth of dollars in the year. That meant a restriction, accepted by the Government of the day, to 24 from the higher figure of 30.  That was done by, amongst others, the Minister who had stated that there was a dollar crisis; that the London pool was running dry; that it was in our national interest to keep it strong and that we were agreeable to do so even if it meant refraining from American purchases at some date in the future.  The balance of payments situation then forecast by that Minister as being possibly a £60,000,000 deficit in visible trade turned out to be a £90,000,000 deficit.  After all invisibles had been thrown in to bridge the gap, it resulted in a net deficit over all of about £30,000,000.  To-day, speaking on this agreement in the Dáil, Deputy Lemass referred to the balance of payments, and he said that in 1946 we had a balance on account.  He said that when all the items were taken into account, all receipts and all payments, there was a net addition to our external assets in that year.  He said that there was a very small deficit in relation to the gap in visible trade in 1947, but he said the deficit was not much greater, if greater, than the net credit of 1946.  The credit of 1946 was £10,000,000; the deficit in 1947 was £30,000,000 over all.</P>

      <P>But he was on this subject and he did not give any figure of £20,000,000.  In any event I was certain there was no such credit that year.  The deficit was £30,000,000 for 1947.  The deficit for the first quarter of this year was running larger than that.  The ensuing months subsequent to the first quarter have shown a welcome decline in imports and it may be that the over-all deficit in the year 1948 will not work out at more than the £30,000,000 over all.  But it will be surprising and we shall be lucky if it only amounts to a £30,000,000 deficit this year.  That is the situation that, I think, has been correctly phrased by the Taoiseach as causing the utmost concern.  If we had only one year with this deficit we could have explained it. It might have been regarded as a temporary disequilibrium in our balancing of payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The channels of trade getting rather fixed and the flow of goods not showing, except in these last couple of months, any tendency to decrease, it was a matter of concern&mdash; of the utmost concern&mdash;as to whether we would be met for the second year with this over-all deficit of that very big sum.  We have been attacked on that and the suggestion has often been made that we were restoring capital equipment.  To a very small extent have we restored capital equipment. As between 1947 and the part of 1948 for which we have good figures, not more than 10 per cent. of the whole volume of our imports could be called capital goods.  The rest are consumers' goods.</P>

      <P>Individual items may look very big but the complete importation is not so much.  Certainly nylon stockings cannot be called capital goods and they came in in tremendous volume and at great cost.  In any event do not let any easy optimism be bred in people as to the big percentage of capital goods being brought in through our imports in the last couple of years. There were very few indeed.  It is also perfectly true that, even if we transfer or exchange part of what are called our sterling balances into capital goods, that does not completely answer the difficulty.  It is only when such goods are brought in as a lead to a production which is better than the dividends, whatever they are, which are missing because of the sale of certain securities, only then can a transfer of the assets to capital goods be considered a real asset or can the exchange be considered a beneficial one.  I do not need to give any figures other than those in order to show that there is concern and great concern at the rate at which imports are still flowing into this country unrequited by exports of ours to other countries and not balanced by the accumulation of invisibles, even when those are accounted in a liberal way.  We shall avoid as long as possible any question of restricting the free entry of goods into this country; but the time is not far distant when a selection will have to be made as to what imports it will be necessary to restrict from this country altogether.</P>

      <P>The second point is the question of dollar availability.  Two points have been made on that.  The first is the statement&mdash;I do not know whether it is a pretence or not&mdash;that the agreement is not clear.  The second is that whatever may be the agreement the public are not, so to speak, being brought into a confidential position in relation to it and are left amazed and definitely confused as to what the future development is likely to be.  As far as the agreement is concerned, may I repeat what I have already read.  In paragraph 4 of the White Paper which was issued last November it is stated specifically:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was agreed that the Irish Government, with a view to conserving the dollar resources of the sterling area, would effect substantial reductions in their drawings of dollars from the dollar pool for the period 1st October, 1947, to 30th June, 1948, bringing the net requirement to £14,000,000 plus Irish dollar earnings. This sum would be further reduced in the event of non-dollar wheat being procurable instead of dollar wheat. Expenditure in other currencies will also be kept to a minimum during the period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Balancing with this agreement it records that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to the matters covered by the former arrangement, it was agreed that pending clarification of the amount of assistance to be received from the United States of America under the European Recovery Programme, the Government of Éire would continue to effect the maximum economy in expenditure of hard currency and would not exceed the level of expenditure during the first half of 1948.  The Government of Éire will use its utmost endeavours to obtain the maximum amount of aid available under the European Recovery Programme with the object of ensuring as far as <Col N="2282" /> practicable that their recourse to the sterling area pool for hard currencies will not involve any ultimate drain on the pool.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The succeeding paragraphs state that the</P>
    <P>&ldquo;two Governments will keep in close contact with reference to the above arrangements and, in particular, will consult as to the provision of Éire's essential requirements of wheat and coarse grains.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if anybody has really any doubts as to what that means.  We are to use our utmost endeavours to obtain the maximum amount of aid we can get under the European Recovery Programme.  Our object is to ensure that there will be no recourse to the sterling area pool for hard currency and we will not involve, as far as we can, any ultimate drain on the pool. There are two exceptions, one stated in this and the other stated by the Minister for External Affairs in a recent discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us what the reciprocal arrangements are with regard to the reservations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The two reservations I want to put in that are with regard to wheat and coarse grains.  There is to be consultation and, as the Taoiseach has already said to-day, it is recognised by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer that in respect of wheat and coarse grains we would be enabled to draw dollars from the pool if we could not cover our grain requirements either under the European Recovery Programme or by purchases outside the Western Hemisphere.  It is very much like what was written in the November agreement.  The second reservation is that, as the Minister for External Affairs said here, there was a definite statement made by the British Government that if we found it impossible to service any loan we might get from America during the current year they would assist us from the dollar pool for that purpose.  I take it that the meaning of that does not require any further explanation, particularly when the <Col N="2283" /> Taoiseach has told the House what our dollar drawings, the level of our dollar expenditure, was in the first half of 1948.  I am asked if there is a reciprocal arrangement so far as England is concerned.  Public statements have been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England to the effect that it is the policy of the British Government, in the interest of the sterling area, that the level of the reserves must not be further reduced during the period of Marshall Aid, and their dollar expenditure must be limited by what can be financed by their dollar earnins, plus European recovery aid.  It is exactly the same with the guarantee that we have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or a change of policy neglectful of what has been agreed on, then what is the purpose of any inter-nation conferences at all?  We must proceed on the basis that when promises are given and statements made in regard to such an important matter of foreign financial policy as this, these promises and statements will be recognised even by future Chancellor and the same policy will be carried out.  As far as the present Chancellor of the Exchequer is concerned, the meaning of what he said is without any possibility of doubt.  We know that a very severe austerity programme has been in force in England and is actually being enforced at present. Their requirements for the ordinary amenities of life, their expenditure on foodstuffs, their expenditure on things like tobacco and petrol and on raw materials for their industries&mdash; all their industrial development&mdash;depends to a great extent on the future convertibility of sterling.  We know their expenditure has been very narrowly restricted and the threat has been made by the Chancellor of the <Col N="2284" /> Exchequer on the other side that if the scheme of payments continued to run against them as it was running at the moment, so that their exports would not meet a sufficient part of their imports, they would have to impose further restrictions on themselves.</P>
      <P>We considered when we were in England that we were meeting with people from whom we got fair treatment and in connection with whom we felt during the negotiations there was friendliness and honourable conduct displayed; we felt we had got as many undertakings on this matter as could be required and, with the exception of bad faith or a violent change in policy, I do not think anybody could raise any doubts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass wanted a clarification of our position and then he used phrases which I would accept as roughly expressing the position.  I quote from him in to-day's debate:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The future position is that we will get loans of dollars from America under the European Recovery Programme, loans which will be adequate to finance our essential purchases in dollar areas.  The goods purchased with these dollars will be sold here in Ireland to firms or individuals for Irish currency or sterling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I could disagree with the wording of that, but, generally speaking, it represents the situation.  The Deputy went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish currency or sterling accruing from the sale of these goods purchased with European Recovery Programme dollars will be put into a special account in the Bank of Ireland and when sterling again becomes freely convertible into dollars that fund in the Bank of Ireland will be converted into dollars and the loan repaid.  I want to know if that is the position?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the position.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If that is the situation, if we are accumulating dollar liabilities and against it equivalent sterling assets, the liability not becoming due until the sterling assets can be used to <Col N="2285" /> redeem it, that is all right, but if that is not so I think that some explanation other than loose generalities should be given to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not so clear a statement.  That would seem to indicate that the obligation to repay might not be the real obligation unless sterling can redeem the dollar borrowing.  So far as the Americans are concerned, they lend dollars and they expect to be repaid in the same currency, but they have all the time said that the objective of the whole European Recovery Plan is to make sterling freely convertible once more.  They have repeatedly said, privately and publicly, that they are playing a gambit that they expect will be achieved in 1952 and they ask other nations to take that same chance with them.</P>
    <P>We have certainly, through our Minister for External Affairs, made our position abundantly clear, as to what our position is likely to be if sterling is not freely convertible in 1952.  Notwithstanding that, they offer us a loan and put us in a rather exalted position, in that they refuse to give us anything except a loan on the ground that our credit is so good.  We cannot achieve convertibility.  The part we can play in making sterling convertible in 1952 is clearly a small one, but we hope the aim will be achieved and the whole plan will meet with success.  In that event there will be no difficulty from the point of view of having the resources with which to repay because, from the sale of whatever goods we get through dollar borrowings we shall have enough accumulated to pay the loan and to pay the interest outstanding. Whether the medium is there or not does not depend on us and we cannot be blamed if convertibility is not fully achieved by that time.</P>
    <P>As to what the extent of that aim will be&mdash;that is, where the public have been kept in any state of confusion or doubt, I have this to say.  We do not yet know what European Recovery Aid will amount to for us in a full year.  We know of the 10,000,000 dollar loan at one period and the 20,000,000 dollar loan at another period.  We know also that a certain sum was spoken of, but it is <Col N="2286" /> not yet certain what is likely to be our drawing in the nine months.  We have no security or certainty with regard to anything beyond the first quarter and the quarter we are now in.  With regard to these two periods of the year, people should remember that we have not yet got a single dollar from America.  That is not our fault and I am not imputing fault to the other side. If the public are unaware of what dollars there are or may be available that is one of the difficulties of the situation.</P>
    <P>I know the public are in doubts.  We shall try to resolve their doubts as quickly as possible.  We cannot resolve them until we know ourselves.  There is a tremendous scheme of accounting, documentation and programming, with all sorts of difficulties arising.  So far our programme even for any quarter has not been fully accepted or implemented. We have sent across not merely the statement of the goods we would wish to purchase with whatever dollars they make available to us, but we have provided them under certain headings.  We have the whole programme in great detail and we have submitted it before the organisations dealing with this matter.  We have as yet not had any firm assured reply from them.  Until we know, first, what amount of dollars are likely to accrue to us and, secondly, on what objects these dollars may be spent, we cannot advise the public, but we should lose no time in doing that.</P>
    <P>As soon as we are made ourselves aware of the situation the likelihood is&mdash;and I hope here I do not speak with too much optimism&mdash;that as between our dollar earnings and the aid we shall derive from the European Recovery Programme we shall have as much in the way of dollars as we had in the year 1947 or as we had, say, on the extension of the nine months' programme between October, 1947, and the end of June, 1948.  If that is the case the situation with regard to imports from America would be relatively easy, but we cannot yet tell people that will be the situation.  We have to ask people to plan ahead and let us know what their demands will be in order to satisfy the American authorities.  We <Col N="2287" /> have got considerable aid from the public but we want more.  With a view to having special aid I established a committee, which is known as &ldquo;The Foreign Payments Technical Committee&rdquo;. This committee is presided over by an officer of the Department of Finance and there are other officers of the Department also on it.  We asked the commercial banks and the Central Bank also to send representatives. They have agreed to do so and a meeting of that committee has been already held.  Further meetings will be held regularly.  We hope to disseminate through the banks to their customers such information as we think will be called for by these customers, if and when dollars are made available. If anybody complains that the public are kept in the dark, then that complaint is wrong.  If there is a complaint that the public do not know the circumstances I would agree that that is so, but that is not a difficulty of our making.  We tried to relieve that difficulty with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything I have to add on these two matters, which were the only matters put to me for answer.  The situation with regard to dollars might be fairly easy but I should utter another warning that we should not too easily assume that we will get sufficient aid from America to leave us with power to purchase from hard currency areas to the extent we did before and it may again be necessary, in respect to that area, to go in for a pretty selective limitation of imports.</P>
    <P>In respect to the balance of payments I again stress that the situation is a serious one, one which will have to be met in the way I mentioned before&mdash; some restriction of imports on a selective basis after a consultation with the people concerned.  We do not want to move in that way unless it is necessary to do so.  There should be a falling-off in these imports now.  If that falling-off does not occur of its own we shall have to make it occur.  We hope that imports will not continue at the rate which is now being maintained and that we shall not have to take action in the matter.  I would ask that the public <Col N="2288" /> should approach the banks for information of a technical type.  This committee, of course, makes no decision on policy; that is naturally a matter for the Government, but on the detailed working out of the whole scheme of the European Recovery Programme the customers of banks will be in a position to get some information, more information as time goes on, through the banks, and I hope they will avail of that source of information.  I should not conclude without thanking the banks who have so readily cooperated, first of all in understanding the difficulties of the situation with which we are faced and, secondly, in endeavouring through their customers to ease our difficulties.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  I told the House that as soon as I could put my hand on it I would give the precise reference for a quotation to which I referred earlier.  The quotation is from the <i>Irish Press,</i> dated 3rd March, 1948, and it is headed: &ldquo;Comment on an announcement by Mr. Dillon.&rdquo;  It was handed to me while I was speaking but, not recognising it as such, I said it was not the one I wanted, which, in fact, it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this agreement as a sound agreement on the whole but in my opinion there are one or two points that call for careful attention. I wish to criticise these points, not from any desire to be destructive in my criticism, but to satisfy myself that certain interests which I represent are properly safeguarded.  According to this agreement 75 per cent. of the cattle exported to England must go as stores.  I submit that never yet did any British Government insist on a provision in an agreement that would leave us or any other country in the position that 75 per cent. of the cattle exported should be confined to stores. I go further and suggest that if that provision is implemented at any further stage it may result in the British farmer holding over the purchase of these stores until the autumn of each year when there will be a danger of a glut in the market and when he can purchase these cattle at a much lower price than if the agreement worked out <Col N="2289" /> on a fifty-fifty basis or, at least, on the basis of 40 per cent. of fat cattle and 60 per cent. of stores.  I have discussed this matter with people in the cattle trade and they are all of one opinion in that respect.  If this is insisted on it means only one thing, that it is the British Government's intention to have stores available at a cheap price for the British farmer as has been the case since 1941.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the British farmer could buy these stores in this country at a certain price, hold them for two months and get £10 to £15 per head profit on them for these two months.  A time will come when the British farmer will demand the implementation of this agreement.  It seems apparent that the British farmer will have the support of the British Government and the implementing of that agreement will make store cattle cheap to the British farmer.  It all depends on how the English farmer will want the 75 per cent. stores.  If he decides on not buying them until October or November of each year and the Irish farmer is not allowed to export them before that date, there will be a glut of store cattle on the market and the price of cattle in this country will reach a very low level and we shall be driven back to the old export licence system again.</P>
      <P>There is another very important factor arising from the fact that 50,000 cattle are mentioned as the number to be exported to countries other than England and 35 per cent. of this number will be classed as inferior cattle.  I should like to know what is meant by that in the agreement.  Does it refer to cattle peculiar to certain counties that may not be taken by the British buyer? They would be rejected by the British buyer and not rated as exportable.  If that is so, it would refer directly to a type of cattle, not very coarse cattle, in our county and in other similar congested districts, and if that agreement is to be adhered to rigidly, I would ask the Minister to recommend that a certain percentage of that type of cattle be scheduled for the continental market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can never understand why the Minister for Agriculture did not insist or suggest to the British authorities <Col N="2290" /> a fixed price for sheep in the British market.  Why I refer to that is that in County Kerry the Northern buyers purchase sheep in the fair of Caherciveen, Killorglin, Kenmare and Killarney, transport them to Northern Ireland and get the maximum price for them in the British market, a guaranteed price, I understand.  If the local farmer got the same facilities or if he had some fixity with regard to the British market, he could do the same thing as the Northern buyers do.  It is a point I think the Minister should consider and give the Southern people the opportunity at least of competing with the Northern buyers in that respect.</P>
    <P>Speaking generally, we regard this agreement as a great advance.  I have listened to Deputy Smith and he talked of the price of the fat cattle sent to England, but they have been losing since 1941 under the previous system. The British buyer who comes in and purchases these cattle holds them for two months and makes £10 a head on them, or even at times £15 a head. This agreement, while it is not the last word, I hope, in the matter, is a great advance and I recommend it as such. I am just making these points to suggest that further consideration be given to us in the South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the change that has occurred in the debate and that it was not continued in the same tone as it was begun by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. International agreements of this sort are very serious matters and I think we should consider them on their merits.  If we are to consider them on their merits, we must ask ourselves what is going to be the effect on the economy of the country in the future and not merely compare them with agreements that have been made before under different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that I think it would be desirable to be clear about is the position of the 1938 agreement.  It has been suggested in some of the remarks that have been made that at the moment in which this present agreement was negotiated, the 1938 agreement was in the position of something that bound us for the future, something <Col N="2291" /> out of which we could not get.  The truth, of course, about it is that the agreement was made in 1938 for three years.  The war intervened and we indicated very clearly to Britain at the time that it was an agreement we wanted to change.  For certain reasons that I am not going into, as referred to by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, we agreed not to press that.  They were anxious that it should not be pressed until a certain international position would have been reached, a position that actually was reached before the present negotiations took place.  I am perfectly certain, therefore, that those who negotiated this agreement were not under a false impression that they had some binding agreement which would last, and by whose terms we would be bound, unless it was changed into another.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass pointed out, when they were negotiating this present agreement there were a variety of courses they could pursue.  Any Government in office, after March at any rate, was in a position of freedom.  The 1938 agreement was a document that had been signed back in 1938 under special circumstances.  Nobody will suggest that the circumstances to-day are the same as the circumstances which existed in 1938.  The only point I want to make is that any improvements in the document of 1938 should not be put as such but the agreement should be put rather on its own merits as if it were a completely new agreement. Deputy Lemass has suggested that it would probably have been better from the point of view of the interests of this country if a completely new agreement had been made.  However, that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>I want to agree with the remark made by one of the Deputies already that people who have the responsibility of negotiating an agreement are not in the same position as those who criticise it.  I think that the fair way of approaching any agreement of this sort is, having carefully examined it, to ask yourself whether you, individually, would have put your name to it.  If you come to the <Col N="2292" /> conclusion that you would, it is your duty, in the national interests, to support the agreement because you yourself would have been willing to make it.  If you oppose it, it must be on the grounds that you yourself would not be willing to put your name to that agreement.  The difficulty however is this.  When you are not in a position of immediate responsibility, like those who negotiated it, you cannot put yourself into their frame of mind completely and you may very well honestly say, when you are dealing with a matter from that approach that you would not have put your name to the agreement when, as a matter of fact, if you were transferred to the other side of the House with full responsibility and collective responsibility you might very well do it.  All one can do is to do one's best to be fair and just.  The best way for each one of us to be that is to regard ourselves as dealing with an international document and ask ourselves are we willing as negotiators&mdash; because we are brought into it and are, so to speak, negotiators&mdash;to sign that document?  We have this difficulty however, if we were actually negotiators, we might press and press hard for changes in it.  There is no doubt whatever that there are in this agreement and omissions from it certain things that I would press to have changed or inserted and certain things that other former Ministers would press but we do not know on this side of the House and cannot be sure, that having pressed as hard as we could if every pressure we could bring to bear was ineffective, that we would not accept this agreement rather than say that we would be better off without any.</P>
    <P>There is a certain feeling on this side of the House, as indicated by Deputy Lemass, that, although objections may be pointed out, the agreement should not be rejected.  If you think that it is not as good as other agreements that might have been made that is and must always remain a matter of opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A whole lot of factors come into this and, in the long run, all we can do is to examine the agreement <Col N="2293" /> and make up our own minds to vote as we think right in the national interests. I hope that I have made clear what was the position of the 1938 agreement so far as this one is concerned.  All I merely want to say is that the negotiators were perfectly free to have no agreement or to have such an agreement as they thought wise.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I am in favour of agreements rather than not having agreements.  There is one thing I should like to get information upon.  We went over last year to negotiate an agreement and we went in this spirit.  All the European nations had been asked by the United States Secretary of State to see to what extent we could either help ourselves or be mutually helpful. We felt that if both Great Britain and ourselves approached it in a proper spirit we could be of very great help one to the other.  Our whole appeal when we went over there was that negotiations on trade should be approached in that spirit.  The more we produce here, the more they produce, the better would be the position so far as the sterling countries were concerned.  We put it to the British Government at that time that the aim of both countries should be to increase production to the utmost; that our productive capacity should be availed of to the fullest, just as theirs should be, and that when it was a question of supplying materials and equipment for production our productive capacity should be considered just as important from the point of view of the sterling countries as a whole as their was.  We looked for certain raw materials and equipment on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the things which I regretted was not in this agreement; that there was no guarantee given to us of goods in return for the goods we were giving them and which were vital for them from the productive point of view, because food is obviously a fundamental necessity for production of any kind.  We were giving them food which was a necessity for them.  We were entitled to ask from them in return things that would enable us to produce more food for them, such as fertilisers or even coarse grains or machinery, so far as they could help us <Col N="2294" /> in that matter, because we would be able thereby to increase the quantity of agricultural products which we could give to them.  We expected that they would realise that.  Of course, they will always realise that when it is a matter that does not interfere with any conflicting policy of their own.  They will be quite prepared to help our agricultural production to any extent to which it does not interfere with their own plans for production in agriculture. The point is, to secure a fair balance in that case.  They are anxious to get our store cattle.  Why?  Because it partially contributes to their agricultural policy.  They say that it is better for them to get our store cattle and then fatten them rather than to allow us to finish our beasts here and get them fat. That is why they are trying to restrict the number of fat cattle that we export to them.  I think we should impress upon them that the cattle industry is important for us.  We should get a fair percentage.  I do not think that the 25 per cent. is fair, taking it all in all.</P>

      <P>We may not fill it immediately, but would the Deputy not agree that it would be a better system if we were exporting fats rather than stores?  From our economic, national point of view, is it not better, assuming better conditions, if you like, for geting materials for food, etc., than we have at present, that we should be exporting fat cattle rather than that we should be exporting stores?  I have always taken that view, anyway.  I may be wrong, but I should like to have arguments put up to show that I am wrong.</P>

      <P>At the moment.  I learned a bit of agriculture a long time ago.  One thing I did learn was that in the later stages a beast gave a far better return for the food given to it than it did in the early stages of its life; that in the later stages the food consumed turned into extra meat, whereas when the beast was young and growing a great deal of the food went <Col N="2295" /> to building up the bones and the body generally, a great deal of which was not available as meat.</P>

      <P>I am not taking up the position of making dogmatical or <i>ex cathedra</i> statements here.  I am only expressing an opinion.  I think, however, that opinion is fairly well founded, and that the proportion of fat cattle which we export is a very important matter for the future of our industry.</P>
      <P>When negotiating with the British Government let nobody in this House or the country think that you are up against people who are going to be swayed by sentiment or anything of that kind.  They are going to drive the hardest bargain they can.  The only way to negotiate is for us to see that the interests of our people are equally well safeguarded.  There is no other way of dealing with them.  They will respect you for that attitude much more than if they see they are dealing with people who are simpletons.  If you want to get respect from them, you must go as people who deserve respect. They are out to safeguard the interests of their people and our representatives must be out to safeguard the interests of our people.</P>
      <P>In dealing with them I must say that in my experience anyhow they have not approached this question of mutual help in the spirit I would have expected.  A committee was to be set up.  I think about the last thing we did as a Government was to agree to some terms of reference for that committee. That committee should have been set up long ago before that.  Personally, I was greatly disappointed that, although they professed, as we professed, that they wanted this mutual help in order to get more production, they were not prepared to set actively about it.  They did not set up the committee which would enable the matter to be examined at home so that each country, whilst having due regard to its own interests, could do its utmost to meet the common purpose.</P>

      <P>A committee of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers cannot give all the time to such work.  Civil servants will do the preliminary work. Any Minister will tell you that civil servants are given terms of reference and asked to do a certain part of the work, but that, ultimately, the responsibility rests with and the drive comes from the Minister in charge.  I have said already that we have as good a body of civil servants as any nation in the world has at its disposal.  The point is that a certain amount of preliminary detail and research work is done by the civil servants and suggestions made, but ultimately it is the Government's concern.  The committee that was suggested was not just going to be left in the air; it was obviously to work in the closest contact with the Ministers immediately concerned on both sides.  It should have been set up long ago.  I feel that, under this trade agreement, the British have maintained the attitude which they previously adopted.  They did make certain concessions in our agreement last year.  As you will remember, they began with a supply of coal and they have kept up that amount, but there were certain other things, such as fertilisers, wool tops, machinery, and so on which were needed as raw materials, which are not referred to in this agreement at all.  It may be that these are coming in larger quantities, but the point is that if an agreement is to work properly there should be real give and take.  It ought not to be all take on our side and all give on the other.  We are giving them food which is fundamental for their economy and have given it for years during the war, and we have the right to demand from them now the things that are necessary to further our production.  The present Government, as well as the past Government, are determined to build up our manufacturing industry to a reasonable level so that we will be able to give employment to our own people by producing the goods here that we should otherwise have to import.  We reached the point last year where they admitted that an Irishman working in Ireland was able to contribute more <Col N="2297" /> to the common pool of production than an Irishman taken over to work in Britain.  Let me repeat that we were not able to get from them at that time and it is probably true that the present Government had the same difficulty in getting from them a recognition of the fact that we were entitled to receive goods and should get goods and not credit.  It may be said that their argument is that it does not hurt us to give away our extra food, while it does hurt them to give away certain equipment and raw materials that we need. I do not agree with that argument at all.  If they are giving these things elsewhere it is obvious that they are not vital to themselves, that they are regarded as surplus, and we are entitled to our share of that surplus.</P>
      <P>The trouble with our bargaining position is that we have not, as we have often admitted, alternative markets.  It is very difficult to get alternative markets.  Britain, being beside us, and having a well established trade with us ought, I believe, to be given a reasonable preference. But it ought to be on fair, reciprocal terms.  We do not at present want from her any increase of our credits, but we do want goods in return for the goods she wants.  We want the goods that she can supply to us and that she used to supply to us in the past&mdash;coal, capital equipment and raw materials.  If there is to be a long term satisfactory trade agreement between ourselves and Great Britain it ought to be on the basis of a fair exchange of the things that they require for the things that we require. We want capital equipment and certain raw materials and Britain can supply them.  We ought not to be satisfied with any agreement which does not give us a fair balance in that regard.  I do not know what the position is now in regard to certain raw materials and fertilisers and some of the other things that we were looking for last year.  I do not know whether the present position is better or worse than it was.</P>

      <P>What about foundry coke?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the present negotiators experienced the <Col N="2298" /> same difficulty as we did in regard to that matter even though we pressed very hard for it.  We have to admit that foundry coke is difficult to get but, as part of the sterling group that is co-operating in it, we ought to get some share of it and the amount we want is comparatively small.  The British say that if they give it to us they will have to go short themselves but I would point out that we are giving them food which is vital for their production and there ought to be on their part a fair recognition of that fact.</P>
      <P>To sum up: As I have said, each one of us may feel strongly that there are certain goods which the British should have agreed to give.  The reference to the 1938 agreement is, in a way, misleading. That was a dead agreement by the time these negotiations took place.  There has been, in regard to the cattle price, an improvement on the position as it was.  My principal criticism of the agreement is that we are getting credit again when our dire need is for goods.</P>

      <P>If it had not been for the statements made by Deputies Fagan and Cogan I admit that I would have nothing to say in connection with this agreement.  Lest it might be thought that their sentiments reflect the mentality of the farmer in this country and lest the people opposite, who are largely composed of professional gentlemen, might think that these two Deputies are expressing the views of the farmers I think I had better say something from the agricultural point of view.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing from the agricultural point of view to have a long term agreement.  The farmer desires security and stability.  He has security when he can look forward to a long-term agreement because he knows the conditions that will obtain over a period of years and he has stability when he knows the prices that will obtain during that term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement such as this gives him the security and the stability he desires.  These agreements <Col N="2299" /> are all right when they are made when normal conditions obtain but when there are abnormal conditions such as we have to-day it is better not to have a long-term agreement.  Some of the Deputies compared this agreement to the 1938 agreement but I would point out that there is no comparison between the conditions which obtained in 1938 and the conditions which obtain at the present time.  In 1938, there was a glut of food all over the world.  What is the position to-day?  There is a scarcity of food all over the world.  You can get any price for food now.  I think it was Deputy Fagan who said that it would be disastrous for us if we did not supply Britain and if, instead we sold our food on the continental market.  He said that on the continental market we might be able to get 5/- or 6/-per lb.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the prices of cattle were too high.  I have never heard a farmer yet say that he was getting an exorbitant price and if that is the mentality of those who represent the farmers in this House the sooner the farmers realise that they have no representation here the better. In 1938, when the agreement was made, England claimed that this country owed £78,000,000 by way of annuities.  By way of pensions and local loans there were £20,000,000, making in all a total of £98,000,000.  That was the first thing with which our negotiators were confronted when making the agreement. There was the question of tariffs.  There was the question of ending the economic war.  Those were the conditions that obtained when our negotiators went over to sell a commodity that was at that time a surplus all the world over.  What was the result?  A good agreement was made.  Nobody in this country can deny that it was a good agreement.  The £98,000,000 were wiped out.  The £5,000,000 was wiped out in respect of the farming community: that sum when capitalised would amount to £78,000,000.  The local loans and the pensions of £20,000,000 were wiped out.  If the present negotiators had wanted to show something tangible as a result of their efforts why <Col N="2300" /> did they not wipe out the £250,000 still payable under the Damage to Property Act?</P>
      <P>With regard to the differential in price between store cattle finished in England and the fats that go across from here, that may appear to be an advantage.  In actual fact, when the shippers come to realise the price they are getting in England that differential may not be as great as we now think it is.  What effect is it going to have on the store cattle trade in the months of February, March and April?  At what period of the year do the British want our fat cattle?  Are they going to spread the importation of our fat cattle over the 12 months?  Every farmer knows the difference between producing beef from November to March and from April to October.  I would like to know at what time this 25 per cent. of our cattle is going to be sent into England.  Further, who is going to determine the difference between a fat and a forward store both ready for the knife?  If that is not determined by the shippers here does anybody believe that it will be done over there in the interests of either the Irish farmer or the Irish shipper?  It has happened before that things were not done in our interests.  Notwithstanding the Minister's assertion this evening that honourable men do honourable things, we have had a sample of the honour that obtains on the far side.  I would remind the House that a leopard does not change his spots. Deputy Cogan referred to the glut and fall in prices after the 1914 to 1918 war. At that time in North America beef was being imported from Canada. That continued until the end of 1926 and the American Government then put a tariff of three cents per pound on Canadian beef cattle imported into America.  What was the result?  The result was that the English people who were buying our stores and beef took the Canadian cattle.  We consequently had a glut here.  Have we any guarantee that the same conditions will not obtain again under this agreement? We have no guarantee.</P>

It has been stated that this agreement was brought about by the Coalition Government. We have had guaranteed prices before.  Somebody had the temerity to say that this is the first time the farmers in this country had guaranteed prices.  We have had guaranteed prices in this country for the past 16 years.

There is one question I would like to ask the Taoiseach with regard to the 2/6 that still appears; it is the third paragraph under &ldquo;B&rdquo; on page two. It states that store cattle retained for more than two months by the farmers in Great Britain and the Six Counties will qualify for the premium paid for home-bred cattle.  The premium at present is at the rate of 2/6 per live cwt.  That is not the differential that obtains between English-bred and Irish-bred fats.  The differential of 5/- between Irish stores fattened in Britain and Irish fats is being wiped out.  To what does this figure of 2/6 refer?</P>

In 1931 we imported 408,000 cwts. and we exported in that same year 1,182,000 cwts.  It can be safely assumed that the consumption of bacon there was between 26,000 and 27,000 cwts.  In 1939 our imports were only 30,290 and our exports were 583,000 cwts.  Everybody can tell you that the bacon ration is now unobtainable.

      <P>He has.  From the point of view of making agreements in normal times, that is the best policy a Government can adopt; but when it comes to making agreements in abnormal times, such as we have now, I doubt if it is a good policy.  Conditions may be quite different in 12 months; the farmer may be placed in the position that he will be receiving less than the cost of production.  What is the good of getting 2/- per lb. for beef it it costs 2/6 to produce it?</P>
      <P>The continental market is a very valuable asset to this country.  In future we will send them 10 per cent. of our exportable surplus.  One bad feature of the agreement is that in the first year 20 per cent. of our cattle exports must be of the rougher type and afterwards 25 per cent. must be of the rougher type.  Any farmer knows when he goes to a fair and has one bad beast in five or six, the price of his good animals will be determined by the price he is prepared to take for the bad one.  The very same thing must obtain as regards continental buyers.  If they have to take a certain number of inferior quality cattle, the price they will pay for the top quality animals will be largely governed by what they pay for the scrub animals that this agreement compels them to take.</P>
