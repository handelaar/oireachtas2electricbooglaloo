      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has considered the suggestion put forward in the debate on the adjournment on the 25th November, 1948, for the speed up of work on the sewerage scheme that will serve the houses to be built on St. Anne's Estate, Dublin, and if he has yet come to any decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have not yet had occasion to consider that suggestion further. My reply to Deputy Belton's question of the 24th November clearly indicated that only preliminary reports on the design of the scheme had yet been submitted to me by the local authority. When the work is ready to be put in hands all suggestions for its expeditious completion will be given due consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that over 100 houses are unoccupied in the immediate vicinity of Cork City; that these houses were built by speculative builders, and on that account do not qualify for the housing grants, and if he will state whether, in view of the abnormal scarcity of houses, he will consider making a grant available to the purchasers of these houses and, if necessary, introduce proposals for legislation to enable him to do so in order to have these houses occupied without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the <Col N="1300" /> position is as indicated by the Deputy's question.  If the houses are outside the city boundary and were begun before the 1st November, 1947, they would have been eligible for the grant of £45 per house payable under the earlier Housing Acts unless they did not comply with the statutory requirements in regard to floor area.  I am not prepared to introduce legislation for the purpose of making grants available for the purchase of houses.  The Deputy will appreciate that this matter is governed by the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, which was only passed into law early this year, and further amending legislation would not, I feel, be warranted at this early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister think that it would be far more reasonable and sensible to introduce this legislation than to be compelling the Cork Corporation to export half a million of money for prefabricated houses?  These houses that I refer to are idle.  They have got the £45 grant and all that they are looking for is the balance of the £275 grant: As I have said, these houses are now idle.  It is a long time since I drew the Minister's attention to this.  I did so on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  It is a tragic thing to see these houses idle while we are compelled to go across the Channel for houses for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to refer the Deputy to my reply.  As I have pointed out, the Housing Act is less than a year in force.  Therefore, the question of introducing amending legislation is not one that could be considered as easily as the Deputy suggests.  There is very much more in the Deputy's suggestion than there is in the question he addressed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that for over four months an average of 35 of the members of the Cork Masons, Bricklayers, Paviours and Tilers Society have been idle in Cork; that 20 of their members had to travel to other countries to get employment and also that there was no scarcity of skilled labour in Cork; and whether, in view of the scarcity of houses for our people and the availability of labour and materials, he will indicate the steps he is taking to remedy this deplorable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a letter in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 26th November from the Cork and District Operative Society of the Masons, Bricklayers, Paviours and Tilers which gave figures similar to those quoted by the Deputy.  So far as I am concerned the Deputy will be aware that I have given the closest attention to the housing programme in Cork City.  I have left no doubt of my desire that the housing output in Cork should be immediately expanded.  I made a personal investigation of the position last April and I have personally and through my inspectors kept up pressure in the matter ever since.</P>
      <P>Schemes for the erection of 42 houses and for the development of sites for 192 houses are in progress and the construction of 100 further houses by direct labour has commenced.  The Corporation have in their possession additional housing sites amounting to 175 acres of which 172 acres were acquired as far back as the period 1933 to 1938.  I approved in August last of the employment of an outside Architect to enable the preparation of plans for those sites to be expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the local authority of which the Deputy is a member will accord a full and immediate response to my pressure for a continuous and expanding housing programme and that this will result in a steadily growing volume of secure employment and in <Col N="1302" /> the elimination of the booms and depressions which have been such an unsatisfactory feature of the building trade in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, due to his interference, the whole building industry in Cork is disorganised? I have a letter here from the Department of Social Welfare dated yesterday in which it is stated that 193 members of the building industry are walking the streets of the city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the needs of the working classes in Finglas area will be substantially met when the schemes at present in progress in the area are completed.  The local authority are, however, conducting a new survey of housing needs in the area and if this shows that further houses are needed they will be provided as expeditiously as possible.  The Deputy's suggestion may prove feasible if and when the city boundary is extended in the Finglas direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it would be no more than reasonable that a certain proportion of these 4,000 houses about to be built in Finglas would be set aside, as a safeguard against the ever-increasing housing problem in that area, for the requirements of the local people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that certain objections have been raised by the landowners concerned to the acquisition by the county council of the land proposed to be acquired for the purpose of providing a burial ground at this place.  An application was made by the county council for a local inquiry in relation to the matter.  The council has been advised that before they can acquire, otherwise than by agreement, land for such a purpose, there must be full compliance with those requirements of Section 203 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, which lay down the procedure in relation to the submission, after due notice, of a petition to the Minister for compulsory powers.  The matter appears to be still under consideration by the county council.  I am having a reminder sent to the council and the Deputy may take it that, so far as the Department is concerned, if and when a petition is submitted consideration of the matter will be expedited at all stages.</P>

      <P>This is entirely a matter for the local authority.  I have had inquiries made from the county council and have ascertained that the flooding is caused by the inadequacy of two gulleys and a sewer to take flood water, resulting in the water collecting on the roadway.  Difficulty was experienced by the local authority in securing the agreement of neighbouring landholders to the running of an alternative drain through their lands to take off flood water.  I am informed that a provisional agreement has now been made with one of the landholders and that this will shortly come before the local authority for consideration. I understand that, in the meantime, every effort is being made by the local authority to clear the flood water by pumping, but the recent heavy rain in the area has probably added to the difficulties.</P>

I do not anticipate any ill effects on the morale of the corporation service.  On the contrary I consider the encouragement given to the wage earners should have a good effect.

It is 25 years ago <Col N="1309" /> since the Port and Docks Board and the Dublin Corporation decided that we should have new bridges.  In view of the preliminaries which will be necessary, will the Parliamentary Secretary not order that these preliminaries take place now and thus be ready when materials are available to proceed with the work rather than have to commence the preliminaries two or three years hence?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter entirely for the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Dublin Corporation.  I do not think it is within the scope of the Minister to start the preliminaries in the manner suggested.  The 1929 Act provided that the construction of the bridge should be completed by 1936. Power was given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to extend this time limit and, on application, this limit was extended.  If the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Dublin Corporation can resolve the difficulties the matter will be fully considered by the Minister but until they send the proposals and do the preliminary work themselves the Minister can do nothing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to an advertisement dated 30/11/48 in the Press, on behalf of the Dublin Board of Assistance for the appointment of nurses for St. Clare's Hospital, Glasnevin; if so, whether he will state whether the proposed salary of £130, rising by £10 to £150 per annum, with meals, laundry and £30 allowance in lieu of residence (with an uncertain bonus of 3/9 per week), has been approved by him as an adequate salary for the posts; whether the Board will provide accommodation for the nurses appointed to the posts at the stipulated residence allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of remuneration mentioned in the advertisement for nurses at St. Clare's Hospital is the scale generally approved for general trained nurses and Sick Children's Nurses employed in that institution and is equivalent to the remuneration paid to similar nurses in other local authority institutions in Dublin.  In addition to the salary mentioned these nurses are in receipt of emoluments to a total value of £117 a year, together with temporary bonus of 7s. 6d. a week. This means that their total remuneration is £266 10s. 0d. a year at the minimum of the scale rising by annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £286 10s. 0d. a year.  General trained nurses who are qualified for fever nursing and <Col N="1312" /> engaged on that work are entitled to an allowance of £10 a year.  The total remuneration in such cases is, therefore, £276 10s. 0d. per annum rising to £296 10s. 0d. per annum.</P>
      <P>In St. Clare's Hospital and certain other institutions where nurses are nonresident but in receipt of meals while on duty, arrangements are made for the payment to them of the approved ration allowance of £70, meals being supplied by the local authority concerned at a very nominal cost and paid for by the nurses.  This arrangement has the effect of compensating the nurses concerned for any additional expense they might incur in securing suitable living accommodation outside the hospital.</P>

I am not aware that the existing building was condemned several years ago and I can state that I have seen hospitals in other parts of the country which are in a more serious need of improvement.  I have recently been through the County Hospital, Waterford, and it appears to me that with certain improvements in the kitchen and in the heating of the hospital together with the provision of a suitable X-ray plant the hospital would be able to carry on for the present.

      <Col N="1315" /> In order to speed up the ultimate provision of beds for tuberculous patients throughout the country it was decided to proceed with a sub-regional sanatorium at Ardkeen, Waterford, to contain 250 beds and a separate children's sanatorium at Dublin in addition to the Dublin, Cork and Galway regional sanatoria.  This decision has necessitated an alteration in the bed compliments in the Sarsfield's Court scheme, the planning of which has had to await final decision of the Ardkeen and Dublin projects.  The planning of all regional and sub-regional sanatoria projects must necessarily be co-ordinated and is being actively pursued in my Department.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I was asked shortly after my coming into office to sign a document relating to a letting to enable cattle and sheep to be grazed on the site. That is an example of the rate of progress of the last Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me the reason for the change of policy now after ten months in office?

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the fact that in a communication which I addressed on the 30th October to the former commissioner administering the affairs of the Balrothery Board of Assistance, I suggested that consideration should be given to the desirability of transferring fever cases from Loughlinstown Hospital to the fever hospitals at Cork Street and Clonskeagh and also that a temporary operating theatre should be provided at Loughlinstown Hospital. These suggestions were discussed between representatives of the Balrothery Board of Assistance and officers of my Department on the 12th November.  I understand that they were further considered at a meeting of the Balrothery Board of Assistance, which was held on the 29th November. I am awaiting the views of the board on these matters.</P>

I am exceedingly anxious on one point.  I wonder could we get an assurance from the Minister as to whether the money given under transition grants for the past two years in relation to roads, namely, 90 per cent. on trunk roads and 75 per cent. on county roads, will be continued this year.  Can the Minister ease our minds on that matter now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I dealt last night with the extremely worsened position of the rural community facing this rate.  I would like to mention the extra burdens placed on the farmers <Col N="1320" /> by the present Government.  For instance, there is the removal of the food voucher scheme, which threw an extra imposition on the present rate and which will throw an enormously increased imposition on the rate next year.  In addition to that, you have the extra national health insurance and you have the fact that despite increased wages and increased costings generally, the farmer, where he would have an opportunity of getting an increased price for his produce, is up against a Government Order in relation to fixed prices.  Where the open road is in respect to some commodities, the Government will make no attempt to stabilise the market here, if I except the type of stabilisation that was done last week for the purpose of catching votes in the Donegal election.</P>
      <P>The farmer is in a worse position today&mdash;far worse&mdash;than he was this time 12 months.  The farmer who produces oats as a cash crop and produces potatoes for the market finds himself in the position so glowingly put up by Deputy Davin last week&mdash;17/- to 20/- a barrel for oats and £5 a ton for potatoes.  In that position he is asked to face the increased burden of labour costs and now he will have to face increased rates.  I think that is grossly unfair.  The consideration of this Bill at this period is unjust.  It is brought in here now while motions which have been on the Order Paper for months awaiting consideration would have perhaps solved the problem and the House has not got an opportunity of considering them.</P>
      <P>I allude to the private members' motion of Deputy Cogan looking for complete derating and the amendment by Deputy Lehane.  These motions have been there for months on the Order Paper.  They deal with this particular problem and the House has not got an opportunity of considering them but the House will, whether we like it or not, have to pass this Bill.  It is presented to it with the pistol at our heads: &ldquo;Take this or you will get nothing.  This will have to be passed to-day.&rdquo;  That is the position we are facing and I hold that it is an absolutely unfair position in which to place the representatives of the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> I have a certain amount of sympathy for the position in which the farmers' representatives in this House find themselves.  As I told them here last week in this <i>posad saluch</i> into which they have entered, they find that the other partners are not prepared to maintain the child of the marriage.  I think they ought to apply for a divorce and get out of this inter-Party arrangement into which they entered, when they find that the other partners to the agreement are getting their share and that they get nothing but reduced prices, bigger costs and a daft Minister.</P>

      <P>After listening to Deputy Corry's account of the terrible predicament of the farmers of Cork, for the first time in my life I feel happy that I am a Mayo man and that I come from a constituency of small farmers&mdash;&ldquo;hen-roosters&rdquo; he once described them&mdash;but nevertheless good, honest, industrious farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not seem to have the terrible worries that the farmers of Deputy Corry's constituency have.  I daresay the Deputy is prompted to come here and parade himself as a sort of god before his constituents, to tell the House and all those people who will read his speech in the pages of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> tomorrow, what a wonderful fight he is making, and that he alone in this House is making, for the farmers, that not alone is he the guardian of the farmers in Cork but the farmers of the whole country.  Just offhand this morning I went down to the Library and picked up Volume 99 and I turned to column 380 and there I found a motion put down in the name of Deputy Cogan who was then a member of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  The motion read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced to provide for complete derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each <Col N="1322" /> farmer and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was debated in the House and Deputies on each Party spoke for and against it.  I find that, according to column 552 of the same volume, Deputy Corry stood up and in his very opening statement said: &ldquo;I will not take more than two minutes on this motion.&rdquo;  He would not take more than two minutes then to support a motion which would definitely benefit the farmers of his constituency much more than it would benefit the farmers of the constituency I represent.  Further on he states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the position of the joker across the Border, let me remind the Deputy that a man on a holding with a £50 valuation has to pay his land annuities in full, even though John Bull does not charge him a penny in respect of them.  His annuities, let us say, amount to £20. In the case of the farmer here whose annuities were £20, he is now paying only half that amount, namely £10. I find now that the farmer across the Border is paying 135 per cent. increase in his housing rate.  If you take it that £12 would be a fair valuation for the farm buildings, it would mean that a man was paying something like £9 12s. 6d. a year.  So that between what we are giving to our farmers here, plus the reduction of 50 per cent. in their annuities, our farmers are better off than the farmers across the Border.</P>
    <P>That means that Deputy Corry in 1946 was quite content and well pleased that the farmers of this country had got sufficient benefits and were entitled to no more.  Further we find at the bottom of columns 557 and 558 that the Dáil divided on the motion which was to bring relief to agricultural producers.  The result is given as Tá, 25; Níl, 66.  Big and black on the list of Deputies who voted Níl we find the name of Deputy M. J. Corry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Col N="1323" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>He walked into the Lobby to make sure that the farmers in 1946 would get no relief when we, the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party, who were alleged to have no interest in the farming community, tried to get that relief.  Deputy Corry took only two minutes, as he told us, to discuss something on that occasion that was of first-class importance and he decided that relief must not go to the farmers.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with Deputy Corry's technique.  As I said at the outset, the remarks he has made are meant, not so much to support the interests of the farmers but to catch the headlines of the local papers in his own constituency which he hopes the people there will read.  The then Minister for Finance, now Deputy Aiken, said at that time, as reported in col. 546:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think it would be fair to ask the general taxpayer, in present circumstances, to bear any increased burden for the purpose of giving any further relief in rates to the farmers at this time.  I think the farmers are ill served by the Deputies who make such a claim on their behalf at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is rather a strange statement in view of the fact that a year afterwards the same Minister, who thought that those Deputies so ill served the farmers they represented, found that they were, to a certain extent, in his estimation correct.  While he did not go on that occasion the full distance to meet what those Deputies wanted, he nevertheless went three-fifths of the way and gave a relief of three-fifths of the agricultural rates on the first £20 valuation of holdings.  However, so much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which is only in reality a continuation of measures that have passed through this House, is something which candidly I would like to go further.  However, I honestly think that at the same time if it is continued, it is a reasonable effort at this stage as finance and taxation have to be got one way or another.  While I admit now that it is only a continuation of legislation which has been enacted here before, I still claim that I would like to see complete derating of at least the <Col N="1324" /> first £20 of the valuation on agricultural holdings.  Nevertheless, we must be honest and say that if we are to provide money for the carrying out of social services and other things the money must come from somewhere.  I am not at all in agreement with Deputy Corry when he says that the farming community are in such a state of poverty this year as compared with last year.  At the same time, I do agree that the farming community have never, up to date, got the respect that they deserve or the payment for their produce that they have earned or are entitled to.  They are not in the terrible predicament that Deputy Corry leads us to believe.</P>

      <P>More so than I, as a rural Deputy, would like to see.  I can assure the Minister at this stage that as he knows the biggest demand on the rates of every county is the provision of money for the maintenance of roads, and the different health charges. We are of the opinion that the cost of those two schemes should be met entirely from the Central Fund and that the ratepayers of the different counties should be left to provide for the county roads and for the cul-de-sac roads which I hope to see under contract at least by this time next year.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of roads and the health services are definitely the heaviest burden on the ratepayers, and money must be found.  Even though the 90 per cent. and 75 per cent. grants from the Government on money spent in excess of a certain figure are very useful and must be continued, I should prefer to see those&mdash;in particular the main and trunk roads&mdash;made a national charge with the provision for the maintenance and upkeep entirely from the Central Fund.</P>

I should like him to bear this in mind and to consider the possibility in some way or other of finding money which will help to relieve the ratepayers and make their burdens lighter.  I can assure him that if rates go much higher the people will definitely not be able to meet them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I must welcome the change in Deputy Commons' attitude towards the prosperity of the farmers. Very little change has been made in prices since the time when he used to complain that the farmers were overwhelmed with costs and got poor prices for their produce.  One of the costs that he used to complain most bitterly that the farmers had to carry on their backs was that of Ministers' salaries and Deputies' allowances.  He used to go round the County Mayo making complaints of those costs.  We do not hear the Deputy now objecting to the high Ministerial salaries.  When somebody put a question as to whether any of the Deputies who were objecting to the high Ministerial salaries had paid anything back to the Exchequer we discovered that Deputy Commons had paid nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We got the answer from the Minister for Finance officially in the House.  Deputy Commons need not try to throw doubt on that.  We have had many Deputies for many years talking in this House on the question of how <Col N="1326" /> best to assist the farmers, whether by derating or by increasing farm prices. In the Budget, I think, of 1946 a very good compromise was come to in regard to rates.  The State Exchequer by bearing two-thirds of the small farmers' rates has an interest in seeing that the rates are kept down and that any money collected for county council or local government purposes is properly spent.  If we were completely to derate agricultural land and buildings there would be no brake on the local authorities in making demands for the expenditure of money when the ratepayers had not to pay.  But the community would have to pay.  If the ratepayers had not to pay it as rates they would have to pay it as taxpayers.  I would very much prefer to see the Government taking care to see that farmers got proper prices for their produce than to see them increasing still further the relief on agricultural rates.  The farmer by getting poor prices for his crop can drop very much more than his total rates in a year.  Some of the farmers, for instance, who dropped from the 45/- a barrel they were led to expect if the Government promises of remunerative prices had been kept dropped very much more when they only got 21/- or 22/- than two or three years' rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would pay the community better if the Government would take care to live up to their promises in relation to the prices of farm produce. The farmers of this country I think have never objected to paying rates, rents or land annuities provided they had the wherewithal to pay them.  I would prefer, in this particular situation, to see the Government making some restitution to the farmers who sold their oats at 21/- or 22/- a barrel than increasing the agricultural grant. The farmers who sold their cats at 21/- or 22/- a barrel have been very badly hit.  They had been accustomed for some years to get 42/- or 45/- a barrel for their oats, so that a drop to 28/- a barrel, at which the Minister appears to have fixed the price, is bad enough, but the 21/- or the 22/- is very much worse.  I think that the Minister for Local Government should try and use his influence with the Minister for Agriculture to see that the farmers <Col N="1327" /> who only got the 21/- or 22/- a barrel are compensated, at least up to the 28/- a barrel level.</P>

Perhaps they do not think that they will ever again have responsibility for dealing with matters of this kind.  This is an important matter.  It is an exceptionally important one for the farming community.  This Bill simply aims at continuing the inadequate relief that has been provided up to the present in respect of rates on agricultural land. The time has certainly come for a review of the entire position relating to the incidence of taxation on the various sections of the community.  I think the time has certainly come for the taking of far-reaching and drastic steps to reduce the rates on agricultural land, and, in addition, to ensure that the rates on all property are not increased.  There is nothing more alarming at the present time for the ordinary citizens of the country than the steadily mounting burden of rates. While the sums voted for the relief of rates on agricultural land may appear to some to be considerable they are more than swallowed up by the very enormous increase in rates which has taken place during the past couple of years.  Some time a halt will have to be called.  Otherwise, it will be impossible for the average ordinary citizen to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather perturbed about the position as far as the farming community are concerned.  I am perturbed as to whether it is the intention of the Government to take a further step to relieve rates on land.  I am not one of those who, like Deputy Corry or the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, support derating when in opposition <Col N="1329" /> and oppose it when their own Party is in power.  The Fianna Fáil Party came into power 15 or 16 years ago by advocating the derating of agricultural land, but for 16 years they sat down and refused to honour the pledges which they had given when seeking office.  Now, when they are out of office I notice that some of them are coming around again to complete derating and probably before very long the majority of them will go full blast demanding that the farmer be completely relieved from rates.</P>
    <P>I am not very much concerned with the antics of political Parties.  I have been absolutely consistent on this matter in every Dáil that has been elected since I became a member.  In the 10th, 11th and 12th, and now in the 13th Dáil, I have tabled a motion for the derating of agricultural land.  In every Dáil up to the present of which I have been a member that motion was defeated by the mobilised strength of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That motion will again come before the present Dáil in the course of a month or two and I am wondering what action the Fianna Fáil Party will take on the matter.  Will they dress themselves in sackcloth and ashes and repent of their sins of the past 15 years and come in and support the motion?  That is something which remains to be seen.  In the meantime, I am rather perturbed about the attitude, not of the Government but of certain people who seem to be very influential in regard to Governmental policy.  I have here an article which appears to have been inspired by the Department of Finance.  It was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 27th November, 1948.  A section of that article is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government, nevertheless, have hopes of being able to cut down outlay on certain schemes which will offset any inevitable increases.</P>
    <P>There is still wide scope for economies in the various grants and subsidies provided to farmers.</P>
    <P>The farmers have, for years, been the most pampered section of the community.</P>
    <P>They should now, it is thought, be able to stand on their own feet and make the same contributions to <Col N="1330" /> State and local taxation as certain urban sections of the community who are less well-off and have suffered severe financial hardships as a result of the war.</P>
    <P>The having of the land annuities, the doubling of the agricultural grant in relief of rates, the subsidies, the guaranteed markets and guaranteed prices, the exemption from income-tax of their actual profits, the immunity from the thousand-and-one charitable appeals with which the townspeople are always faced&mdash;all have contributed to make the farmers the most financially independent citizens of the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear now that the farmers are not the most pampered section of the community. It is pertinent to point that out on a Bill such as this which provides for a grant for the relief of agricultural rates.  The total agricultural income is £100,000,000 net.  Divide that sum between the total number of people engaged full-time in agriculture and you get an average income in the agricultural industry of £153 per year, that is, less than £3 per week.  That is the average income of the people engaged in agriculture&mdash;£3 per week. If anyone says that the people engaged in the most important industry in the country at an average income of less than £3 per week are a pampered section of the community I should like to know the condition of that section of the community which is not pampered.  It is time to face this problem in a realistic way.  Nothing contributes <Col N="1331" /> more to the depression of productive industry, to the killing of initiative and private enterprise, than the piling up of steadily-increasing burdens of taxation on productive property.  The farmer is promised prices somewhat comparable to those which the British farmer can expect. He has, however, to compete with the British farmer and the Northern Ireland farmer who are exempt from rates.  There is no use in saying that the annuities have been halved and that the having of the annuity offsets the benefit of complete derating.  It might have been the case 15 or 16 years ago.  However, with the enormous increase in rates at the present time the halving of the annuity is only a mere bagatelle.  It is necessary to come vigorously to the relief of agriculture in this connection and to fix definitely a limit beyond which taxation on land and agricultural property will not be increased.</P>
      <P>Some people, including the ex-Minister for Finance, suggested in connection with derating that if agricultural land were completely derated there would be no local check on local taxation.  He forgot that derating of agricultural land would not relieve the farmer of his contribution to rates.  He would still have to pay rates on his dwelling, just like the townspeople.  He would still be interested in the level of local rates and in public expenditure by the local authorities.  It is wrongand I think it is time to realise that it is wrong&mdash;that we should have this matter of rates on agricultural land coming up here as a short-term policy, as a stop-gap policy from year to year. It is time this matter was put on a permanent footing.  I would ask the Minister now, immediately this Bill becomes law, to consider the incidence of taxation as between one section of the community and another and to find an equitable basis and to put it into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land is a gift or a concession to the farming community.  It is nothing of the kind. I will again, as I did last year, emphasise that the grant for the relief <Col N="1332" /> of rates on agricultural land is not a gift to the farmer but rather a crude and inequitable means of attempting to rectify an injustice to the farming community. If you adopt a principle that the farming community should contribute to the local expenditure in proportion to their income you will find that the present system of levying rates is altogether inequitable.</P>
    <P>The farmers' income for the average pre-war years was one-fourth of the national income; during the emergency period it was one-third of the national income.  However, the rateable valuation of agricultural land and buildings is 80 per cent. of the total rateable valuation of the State.  Thus, it will be seen that the whole basis of agricultural rating is wrong; it is inequitable to the farming community and these agricultural grants go only part of the road towards remedying that situation.  It is necessary to consider that point because strong pressure may be brought to bear on the Minister to resist appeals for a more equitable system of rating in regard to agriculture. He may even be pressed to reduce, as has been suggested in that article, the benefits which are being conferred in this Bill and similar measures.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, the moment this measure becomes inactive, to give careful consideration to the matter and see that justice and equity is meted out to all sections of the community.</P>

      <P>This measure is one which must come into operation at the earliest possible date.  I quite realise that.  I realise also that it is more or less a stop-gap measure.  The real problem facing the Government so far as agriculture is concerned is the revision of land valuation.  Inevitably that will have to take place.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the fact that in County Kerry the problem of the upkeep of the roads is interrelated with the problem of rates on land.  The local authority there finds it very difficult to segregate responsibility as between the amount obtained from rates on agricultural land and the amount required for the upkeep of the roads.  I would like to make one suggestion <Col N="1333" /> to the Minister, though it is probably not relevant on this particular measure.  I would suggest to the Minister that some remission should be made in regard to the main roads and that the State should take responsibility for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The revision of the system of rating and a proper valuation. That would give the farmers in Kerry and the local authorities time to adjust their budget.  It would give the local authorities an opportunity of asking the farmers to pay a fixed figure for rates on land.  The last Government went a long way to derate land.  They gave certain concessions.  I know that the Minister will continue along those lines by giving any relief that can be given to the farmers.  But that will not go as far as we would like.  As Deputy Cogan said, we would like to see a full review of the present position coupled with a revaluation of land in order to adjust valuations on an equitable basis. We are facing the position in Kerry where it will be impossible for the people to meet the rates.  Whether that will be next year or in three years' time I do not know, but we are facing that position.  I realise the Minister has no option at the moment but to proceed with this measure.  I urge upon him the necessity for a review at the earliest possible moment in the light of the statements I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is a continuation <Col N="1334" /> of what we have previously had.  I have heard Deputy Cogan state that Fianna Fáil stood for derating prior to their taking office.  To some extent that may be true, but there were a number of us who did not support that view.  Some of us believed that if there were full and complete derating, it would be impossible to equitably adjust the position.  It would not meet the case.  I hold that the halving of the annuities met the position of the agricultural community much more equitably than would complete derating.  I do not approve of derating.  I think it is bad.  It would give advantages to people who do not work their land far in excess of those it would give to the people who work their land in a proper way.  Fianna Fáil went a long way, as has been mentioned by Deputy Flynn, to find a solution of the problem.  The crux of the matter is that the amount given in respect of employment on holdings is not at all high enough.  I think that is the best direction from which to approach this question of derating. There should be an increase in the rebate given in respect of hired labour and in respect of the adult members of a family who work on the land.  I know what complete derating would mean. I know the man with 200 or 300 acres would sit down happily and let his land while reaping the full benefit of derating.  That could not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn adverted to the necessity for a revision of the present valuations.  That is a pretty big task. A revision of valuation might work out very unfairly.  There are a large number of people in this country who were driven forcibly on to the bad lands in this country and for 100 years they put sweat and labour into that land and brought it up to a high state of fertility.  Under a revision of valuation they would be compelled to pay for all the useful work they did.  On the other hand, there were people who were on good land.  Since then they have let that land deteriorate through their own fault.  They would reap the benefit of a revision of valuation.  But the people who worked their land would be penalised.  I would advise the Government and the Minister&mdash;and, indeed, <Col N="1335" /> any Government&mdash;to proceed very, very cautiously in that direction.</P>
    <P>The rates are soaring at the present time.  They are soaring mainly because of increases in social services. There is an increase in hospitalisation. There is an increase in the wages and salaries paid to the staffs, and so on. If these increases continue, something more will have to be done undoubtedly. I do not say that it will have to be done by the Minister for Local Government; but something will have to be done by his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture. Properly guaranteed prices will have to be given to the farmers in order to enable them to pay that rate. They were quite capable of paying the rate, such as it was, for a number of years particularly for the last seven or eight years, when they were assured of good prices for live stock and guaranteed prices for a number of the crops they produced.</P>
    <P>There is a depression now coming in prices all round.  That can be clearly said, and I say publicly that the Minister for Agriculture is aiming at that, too, in this bogey to bring down the cost of living.  The cost of living means as much to the farmer as to any other section of the community and unless the farmers are given reasonable, guaranteed prices that will cover the cost of production and leave them a reasonable profit, they certainly will not be able to continue paying increased rates.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to impress on the Minister that after this Bill goes through he should examine the position and bring in legislation whereby employment and production will be taken into account in any further relief that is given; that the amount that is being paid in respect of employees will be increased at least 100 per cent., and also what is given in respect of the adult members of the farmer's family. If that is done I believe that will be the proper system of derating.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to complete derating, just as I was against the form of derating we had during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, when there was half-a-crown to the £ given <Col N="1336" /> and the Treasury was recouped by putting a certain amount on the lb. of sugar.  The result was that the man with £1,000 valuation got 1,000 half-crowns. He probably had a much smaller family than the person with the £15 valuation.  He got 1,000 half-crowns, whereas the poor man got only 15 half-crowns, and yet the poor man had to pay his share of the farthing in the pound, and that was far out of proportion to what the other man had to pay.</P>
    <P>I would oppose any measure of that kind, but I am in favour of an increase in the rate in respect of the employees, whether they be hired labour from out side or members of the family.  I would regard that as a proper form of remission of rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can complain about the reception which this measure has received or about the criticisms that have been offered.  I feel that, on the whole, they have been helpful and constructive.  This measure is restricted in its form.  It is, as Deputies have pointed out, a temporary measure and, while it affords an occasion for raising various matters, it does not provide, in its subsequent passage through the House, any means by which certain views can be given effect to.  I know there are a certain number of proposals on the Order Paper dealing with various aspects of rating and local taxation and I feel that when they are reached they will give an opportunity of raising many questions on this very complicated, very controversial and very long-standing issue of local taxation that will enable the various points of view that are held to be fully discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I offer one mild criticism on some of the arguments that were advanced?  It is that there does seem to be what amounts to&mdash;I am sure quite unwittingly&mdash;an inclination not to advert to the fact that this Bill is elastic in its scope and it aims at providing grants towards the relief of rates on an increased figure as increases in local rates go on.  I think that, in itself, is an indication of policy and a concession to the ratepayers that should be emphasised.  I think that statement disposes of the main argument <Col N="1337" /> that Deputy Childers advanced in his contribution to the debate.  I want to assure Deputy Sheldon, who had some doubts as to how far certain provisions in the Bill covered certain matters, that we have been advised by the competent advisers of the Department that the point he made is fully met in this Bill.  I do not think he need have any further worries on that score.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry is responsible for producing humour of a rather peculiar form sometimes; but he does introduce humour into discussions of all kinds.  He was certainly in a rather humorous role to-day in rating me because of the time of the year that this Bill was introduced, having regard to the fact that the introduction of the measure was exactly one day earlier than the introduction of a similar measure last year and also having regard to the fact that in the course of the discussion last year the Minister was fairly adamant, and, in his own words, the Dáil was asked to take the Bill or leave it.</P>
    <P>I do not regard this Bill as a final contribution towards rating questions in this country.  It is an indication of the policy of the Government.  It is evidence of the desire to go as far as possible to meet the position of agriculturists in so far as they are contributing to local taxation.  Further opportunities will be afforded during the year for a discussion of the whole question on a wider basis.  I may say, not in any offensive way, that it does seem to me that if the policy of the then Minister for Finance, announced in his 1946 Budget statement, was given effect to, as presumably it would if the change of Government had not taken place, the provisions under this measure would be very different, because the Minister for Finance, in his 1946 Budget statement said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to make it clear that the rate subsidy part of the new scheme is intended to last only for this year and next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is important to emphasise that the reduction in the amount of the grants that were then contemplated by the Minister for Finance have not been <Col N="1338" /> made; that, in fact, the principle has been maintained of progressive grants of an increasing amount in accordance with the increasing amount of local rates.</P>
    <P>The Chair has happily relieved me of the responsibility of discussing main roads to-day&mdash;the nationalisation of main roads&mdash;and various other matters. I do not think, either, that it is a suitable opportunity to go into the whole question of derating, or of any modified form of derating.  I shall leave that to another occasion just as I leave any discussion on the whole question of agricultural policy of this country to the Minister who is charged with responsibility for that policy.</P>
    <P>There are certain other matters to which I should like to refer briefly.  I want to take a few points mentioned by Deputy Corry who complained about the inability of the landholder to qualify for the allowances in regard to agricultural labourers in certain circumstances. The fact is that the allowance is only payable if the agricultural labourer is in continuous employment from the period in question. I think the House will realise that if that position were changed the possibility of very serious abuse, and in the end very serious loss to the country as a whole, would arise.  I cannot, therefore, offer any hope that any accommodation will be given on that matter. I do not see, looking on the matter in a sensible way, how any accommodation of that kind could be given.</P>
    <P>The whole question of examining the rating system of this country as has been advocated from various quarters. is also a big question and will have to take a very considerable time.  I do not intend to anticipate what may be done in that connection.  It is clear that there is evidence of an increase in rates throughout the country and the increase is being kept under very close observation by the local government authorities.  It is clear also that money values in the matter of rates have altered, as they have altered in every other connection in this country.  It is clear too that the increased services&mdash; and there have been substantial developments in that connection throughout the year, health services <Col N="1339" /> and other services of that kind&mdash;make demands on local ratepayers that have got to be refused or met.  Nobody contemplates at the present time a refusal of these demands.  My task, therefore, and the task of the local authorities, is to see that the impact of the increase is made as light as possible having regard to the position as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are any other points that have to be referred to because the points made by Deputy Flynn, having regard to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, cannot be replied to by me.  I think, in fact, the reply I have given covers substantially most of the points that were raised in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  In doing so I would suggest that the general discussion on Army strength, Army policy and Army organisation, might be more appropriately taken in conjunction with the Estimate but if there is any desire on the part of the House, or of any Deputies, to discuss such matters arising out of or in connection with this Bill, of course that is within their right and I have no objection.  In dealing with the Second Reading, if such matters are raised I propose not to raise them myself but to deal with them in reply to the debate.  I think however there is one matter which has appeared to a very great extent in the newspapers and on which it is important to clarify the position in introducing the Bill.  There have been a number of Press references of one kind or another in different newspapers giving a peculiar prominence to inter-Army courtesies which I believe are normal, beneficial and should be encouraged. There is no new departure in the way of policy in regard to officers from other armies visiting our Army or officers from our Army visiting other armies.  There is nothing new.  That has been the procedure that has been followed by two previous Governments. It is the normal procedure with armies representative of friendly countries but, on account of the late war and of the amount of public attention attracted by any suggestions of postwar alliances, these normal courtesies have been featured to such an extent as to give rise to doubt, suspicion and, even, to a certain amount of anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies opposite, and Deputies all round, would understand that it is in the best interests of the <Col N="1341" /> nation and the world as a whole, to have, so far as it is humanly possible, the friendliest feeling existing between the officers and men in different armies.  In that connection, I can only assure the House that the statement made by the Taoiseach was made without any reservation and that there is nothing indicative in such inter-Army courtesies of anything sinister, nothing indicative of any back-scene arrangement or alliance of any kind, whether between two or more than two countries. Deputies opposite have heard time and again from two Governments that the matter of engaging in any such alliance is unthinkable and impossible for a divided partitioned country whether in peace or in war.  The position of dual command&mdash;even, possibly, rival commands&mdash;in a little island of this kind, is just next door to impossible. An adequate defence plan for a small island divided in two is nearly militarily impossible and greater responsibility, greater risks or anything else are just inconceivable as long as this country is and remains a divided country.  I introduced those particular observations just in case they might be raised from elsewhere in perfectly good faith.  I wanted to give that assurance in advance as clearly and as emphatically as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of this Bill,&mdash;it is, of course, an annual Bill, a Temporary Defence Forces Bill&mdash;it would be reasonable that questions should be put as to what the position is regarding the permanent Defence Forces Bill. The work on that Bill is proceeding. It is a very detailed and a fairly comprehensive measure.  It is our intention to introduce it at the very earliest possible date.  It has not reached the degree of finality yet, even to bring it before the Government as a whole.  I very much fear that it will not be complete and ready for the House in time to obviate the necessity of having this Bill as a carrying-on Bill up to 1950. Consequently, I am introducing this Bill.  The Bill itself is a very short one. I think the White Paper that was circulated with the Bill made clear the reason for and the meaning of the different amendments and additions that are contained in this Bill.  They are very few in number and perhaps <Col N="1342" /> there is only one that may call for anything in the nature of criticism or detailed explanation.  That is the particular section which alters the penalties to be imposed on deserters as defined in the Emergency Order of some years ago and subsequently incorporated in the Temporary Defence Force Act of 1946.  There were in the original Order a number of penalties imposed on deserters; loss of pay, loss of gratuity, forfeiture of pension, the normal military penalties of imprisonment or otherwise and a further disqualification from any employment directly or indirectly paid for out of State funds for a period of seven years. I am proposing to the House that we keep all those penalties and disqualifications with the exception of the latter disqualification.  I am recommending to the House that, when keeping all the normal military penalties&mdash;forfeiture of gratuity, forfeiture of pension and of pay and the discharge sheet that states clearly the reason of discharge&mdash;they waive disqualification from employment for a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>My reasons for asking the House to agree to that amendment are many and, I think, sound.  Firstly, when the original Order was brought in imposing all these penalties on deserters, I think that both the Minister and the Deputies in the House were concerned with the fact that certain men with the colours had deserted and gone to give service elsewhere.  I do not think any of us were aware of the full legal consequences of that particular Order when it was put into operation.  When legal opinion was taken on the matter, it was found that the particular Order not only applied to what you may call straightforward deserters but it also applied to men who were on the reserve, not called up but who had not left any address and who went to work on turf bogs or elsewhere without leaving an address.  While they were elsewhere, they were called up, but did not get the call and, consequently, did not respond to it.  The result is that all those men are at the moment, according to the law, unemployable, and will remain unemployable for the next four years.  In practice and in good faith and without knowing their legal category, a great number of such men have <Col N="1343" /> been taken into employment of a semi-State kind under local authorities, working on the roads, on the bogs or working under such other organisations as receive part of their funds from public funds.  When, recently, I circulated a list of all such people to different local authorities, it was ascertained that a number of men here and there up and down the country, hardworking men, who were giving good service, whether on the roads or in some other capacity, must be turned out of work promptly if the full law, as it stands, is applied.  I am asking the Dáil to keep all the remaining penalties and disqualifications, but to waive the particular one that brands these men as unemployable for the next four years.  There may be a certain amount of balancing to be done about such a recommendation.  I think, however, that most Deputies, on the whole, will consider that the recommendation is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>There is another amendment dealing with the period of service where a man, having completed his full service, reattests.  At the moment, he has the right to reattest and the Army authorities have the right to take him. However, when he has reattested, and when he has been taken he must be released from service at any time he gives three months' notice.  That creates an unstable position in an Army.  Any day you may receive a a great number of requests giving three months' notice and those men must be released on doing so.  It is proposed by an amendment in this Bill that once a man reattests for a period of two years if he wants to get out within the period of two years on compassionate grounds, humanitarian grounds or any other grounds that will be dealt with in the normal administrative way.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that, apart from an emergency situation when there are very sound and very real reasons for retaining a man with the colours, if a man has a good case on compassionate grounds to be released, the ordinary administrative machine always takes a reasonable and humane view of such applications.  In the ordinary course of events, the man would be released. <Col N="1344" /> I think Deputies sitting on the opposite benches will realise that, if you have an Army to a great extent built up on the basis that any man that gives three months' notice must be released, that is not either militarily or administratively sound.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal here in another section with regard to the reserve of officers&mdash;that, on application, the Minister can attach them to any particular branch of the reserve.  At the moment, if an officer is a reserve officer in one reserve branch and if he applies to be transferred to another, and the general staff and the Minister want to transfer him to another, there is no legal power to do so.  He must be retired first and reattested.  The underlying idea of this amendment is to give the right, on application, subject to a recommendation of the general staff, for the transfer of an officer from one portion of the reserve to another.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the power to make bye-laws governing transport and traffic within certain military areas.  That arises out of the necessity for an extension of the aerodrome at Baldonnel.  It is necessary, in the interests of public safety, after due notice and after consultation with the Department of Local Government, that the Department of Defence should have the right to close up certain roadways during certain operations. If such authority is given by the Dáil, that particular power will only be exercised when it must be exercised in the interests of public safety, and will be exercised in such a way as to cause the very minimum degree of inconvenience to the general public.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is little contentious matter in this Bill.  Perhaps the only contentious matter is that which he referred to himself.  At the same time, I would like to utter a mild protest against the manner in which this Bill has been brought before the House. The Minister, a week ago, promised the House that the Bill would be circulated on Monday.  Actually, it was not in the hands of Deputies until Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is not the Minister's fault because it has occurred on previous occasions.  What I feel about it is that this is a Bill by reference, and you have to refer to other legislation if you want to get an intelligent understanding of what is contained in it.  From that point of view, while I do not hold the Minister responsible for the delay that has occurred in the circulation of the Bill, I do suggest that it seems to me to be unnecessarily hurried.  This Bill will not have any effect until after the 31st March.  Therefore, I would have expected that the Minister would have left it over until next week so that there would be no suggestion that Deputies had not ample time, if they so desired, to consult the Principal Act, and so satisfy themselves on the matters contained in the Bill.  As I have said, from my point of view there is nothing objectionable or contentious in the Bill with the exception of the matter which was referred to by the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 5, however, I cannot see any real necessity for the amendment to that section for the reason that it was provided that a man who had completed his 21 years' service, if he was fit and his character was good, could be permitted by the Army authorities to continue serving for another 12 months.  The main idea behind that was that it would give a serving soldier the opportunity of finding his place in civilian life.  He could not just do that until his 21 years were up.  If a man was of good character it was only right that he should be given the opportunity of trying to re-establish himself in civilian life.  I know from practical experience that not even the three months were insisted on if the soldier could, by any means, find employment in civilian life. The Army authorities were only too willing to release that man and so permit him to establish himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this: that I see a danger in respect of the extension for the two years.  It is with regard to the official quarters.  A man who is a serving soldier for 21 years will no doubt be a tenant of official <Col N="1346" /> quarters.  By his continuance over the 21 years he is likely to exclude a young soldier who is perhaps only beginning his long term of service from being established in such quarters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is if we are able to get him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty. I am not even going to put down an amendment about it but I am throwing out the suggestion to the Minister that his continuance in service should depend on his getting out of the official quarters within a specified time.  If he were given 12 months or some period like that he would have a fair opportunity of securing accommodation for himself.  You can be assured that if a man, who is continuing on for a further term of service has the opportunity of securing civilian employment he will go for it, because it should be much easier for him to re-establish himself in civilian life at the age of 41 than it would be at the age of 51&mdash; that is if he continued for ten years over and above the 21 years.  From that point of view I think that his continuance in service should be dependent on the fact that arrangements would be made to ensure that these quarters will be available for the young soldier who is facing his long period of service.</P>
      <P>I take very strong exception to the deletion of Section 8 from the original Act.  If there are such men as the Minister mentioned here they could very easily be dealt with.  If, for instance, it is true that a reservist failed to have delivered to him his calling-up notice, then that can be investigated, and if it can be proved that he was not in fact an actual deserter but rather that he was absent from service by reason of the fact that he failed to secure the original calling-up notice then, to my mind, it would be a very easy matter to cover that particular type of man.</P>

      <P>I do not desire to pursue these individuals in any kind of vicious way.  I want to say, however, that the Irishman who joined the Army of his own country and who deserted and joined the army of a belligerent <Col N="1348" /> country&mdash;a country which might be a potential invader of this country&mdash; would in any other country receive a sentence of one kind or another very much more severe than that imposed upon him by this regulation.  We know what happens to soldiers who desert in time of war.  There was a time of stress and danger obtaining in this country at the precise time when these men deserted the colours.  It seems to me an extraordinary state of affairs that any Minister or any Government would at this stage endeavour to re-establish these deserters from our Army to a foreign army and make available to them employment that in many respects cannot be secured by men who continued to serve their country throughout the emergency.  A week or so ago the Minister gave us figures, in reply to a question by my colleague, of the number of Old I.R.A. men who had been forced out of the employment which they had secured from the State.  Among the number given, I think it was 51, were 17 Easter Week men.</P>

      <P>It is astonishing that these men who blazed the trail in respect of the establishment of this State are being forced out of the employment they were given by the former Government.  They are now on the unemployed list while at the same time provision is being made for deserters, for men who deserted from their own Army and joined a foreign army&mdash;men who might very well have been members of an invading force against the rights and principles of this country.  That is an astonishing state of affairs and it is one which I would ask the Minister to reconsider.  As I have already said, if there are any such persons as the Minister has in mind why not cover that particular type of person?  Why in the name of goodness should we go outside that category and bring in these people for whom no Deputy in this House, and no man or woman in this State, could have any respect?  After all, a man who joins the Army of his country in time of stress and danger is at least regarded as somebody who is giving loyal and patriotic service to the State.  A man who <Col N="1349" /> deserts his own Army at a period such as that&mdash;I do not care what the reason may have been; whether it was that he was seeking adventure or that he was seeking more pay&mdash;deserves no better treatment than the treatment that was meted out to him as a result of the legislation which was passed in 1946.  I would ask the Minister, when he is dealing with this matter on the Committee Stage, to re-examine and consider it from the point of view of dealing with those people who may inadvertently have been kept out of serving by failure to deliver the notice or by the fact that at the time they were in England or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation.  I am very glad to see that the Minister has taken steps under Section 9 to appoint additional commissioned officers to the naval service. I hope that this is a conversion on the part of the Minister to a belief in the utility and value of a naval service.  The Minister will recollect that on last year's Estimate he referred in very belittling terms to the naval service.  He was then a Deputy.  I hope that as a result of his closer contact with the service now he realises that, however small or poor in type our vessels may be, at least the personnel of that service is as highly trained as the personnel of any other similar service in the world.  They have given ample evidence of that.  They have shown that they are capable of navigating their vessels to any part of the world under any circumstances. Recently under the Minister's own jurisdiction they proved that conclusively. I would be glad to think that the Minister had changed his views in general in regard to the naval service and that he no longer regards our ships as &ldquo;mere rubber ducks&rdquo;.  That is how he described them on one occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it is desirable for Deputies to discuss general military policy on this Bill.  I notice, however, by a strange coincidence that the Minister in introducing this Bill committed the same grievous offence of which he accused his two predecessors&mdash;Deputy Aiken and myself. We were accused of failure to <Col N="1351" /> produce in this House any policy in respect of the Army.  On a number of occasions I endeavoured to assure the Minister that the policy in respect of the Army was always there.  It was an unchanging policy.  It is a policy of ensuring an Army sufficiently large to train a greater Army in time of emergency. The only question that arose at any time was the question as to what the size of the Army should be to carry out that task.  We may have differed on that particular question.  It is certainly my conviction, as a result of my experience, that it is quite impossible for an Army of 6,000 or 7,000 men efficiently or effectively to turn civilians offering themselves for service in an expanding Army into good soldiers.  We had practical experience of that in 1940 when we had a large influx of civilians into the Army.  It was found impossible in practice to give these men the type of training necessary in a reasonable period of time with the numbers the Army then had at its disposal. Were it not for the fact that we had a reasonably large number of reservist officers and N.C.O.s to call upon, plus a reasonably efficient Volunteer force numbering between 7,000 to 10,000 men, it would have been impossible, even in the time at our disposal, to turn that Army of civilians into the efficient and effective Army it was in 1942.  The Minister had the pleasure of seeing that Army march through the streets of Cork&mdash;the capital city of the South&mdash;with all their equipment.  It was a vast Army in respect of this particular State and to all of us it was a source of pride.</P>
    <P>I say again that it was the presence of that Army which ensured the safety of this nation during the emergency. The danger I see at the present time in the reduction which appears to be taking place is that we may find ourselves in the future with an insufficient Army to train an expanding Army.  I am convinced that the Army is lower to-day numerically than it was at any time in its history.  I am convinced of that and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  I believe the outflow exceeds the intake.  I hope the Minister will be able to correct me on that <Col N="1352" /> and assure me and the other Deputies that the Army is not being depleted in the way in which I believe it is.  I have no figures at my disposal and I have no precise information, but I think that the strength of the Army to-day is somewhere in the region of 6,000 or 7,000 men.  If it is in that region, I say it is in a gravely dangerous region, considering the times in which we live.  The Minister made reference to that in the course of his remarks on one of the Estimates that was before the House.  He referred to the circumstances that would exist and that, to some extent, should govern the strength of the Army.  I feel that at the present time the Army would be incapable in any emergency of dealing effectively with an intake of recruits, and much less would it be able to give the protection that citizens of the State would look to the Army to give.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, in the course of a speech in his constituency, suggested that the Army of to-day would be incapable of defending Rineanna.  He went further than that in this House when he suggested that the Army of to-day would be incapable of defending this House.  I know the Deputy was merely making that statement for effect, that he did not in fact believe that, but it is very doubtful if the Army of to-day could effectively defend Rineanna were it attacked.  I am afraid I would have to agree with him in that statement, while I may not agree with him in respect of the defence of this House.  That is a very serious state of affairs.  If there is even a suspicion that that is so, I say that there should be a complete revision of Ministerial or Governmental policy in respect of the strength of the Army.</P>
    <P>The last Government in coming to a decision that an Army strength of 12,500 men was necessary did so on the studied advice of the Army authorities. These were all competent men who had given a life study to the subject of national defence and, naturally, the Government was greatly concerned with the fact that these men considered that number as the very minimum. That is what we were accepting <Col N="1353" /> because we were as much concerned as the Minister is about the cost of the Army to the State.</P>
    <P>But there are other considerations besides the cost of the Army to the State.  If the people want to ensure that the independence of this country is to be retained, they will have to pay the cost which the Army entails.  The cost of an Army is the premium, so to speak, which the people have to pay for their safety and security, for the assurance that this State will continue in being.  I think that particular aspect was not given the consideration it deserves by the present Government.  The first institution of the State to feel the effects of the economy axe in this country was the Army.  We were hardly in our seats here on this side of the House when it was announced that all recruitment to the Army had ceased, that the recruiting campaign then in operation should cease, and that contracts which were advertised in all the newspapers throughout the country were cancelled.  The Minister can tell me that recruitment did not cease&mdash;that they were accepting recruits&mdash;and that would be true.  I could not dispute that statement if he makes it.</P>
    <P>In normal times recruitment to the Army never exceeds 12 or 20 men a month and the outflow from the Army greatly exceeds that number, so that it would be only a matter of time, if that normal course were to continue, until we would have no Army at all.  I invite the Minister to inform us what is the strength of the Army to-day, and to give us the week to week number of recruits.  He can do that, because I know that the figures are there and there will be no difficulty about giving them.  He certainly can give them month by month over a considerable period, and I will be agreeably surprised if the figures I have quoted are exceeded.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of vital importance to the citizens of this State that this whole question of the strength of the Army would be reconsidered.  Whatever economies are to be effected in this State, in my humble opinion they should not be effected in the Army.  I know what the Minister's views were in <Col N="1354" /> respect of the strength of the Army when he was sitting on these benches. I know what were the views of a number of his colleagues when they, too, were on this side of the House.  I know what were the views of the Minister for Local Government when he was as a Deputy sitting on this side, and the views of the Minister for Lands when, as Deputy Blowick, he was over here. Unless they have changed their minds, I cannot see very much hope of the Army being brought up to the strength which the Army authorities themselves demand as the minimum which would be required if we are to have an effective establishment in this country capable of dealing with any emergency that may arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister when he was over here made this statement, as reported at column 52, Volume 105, speaking of our coastal defence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What was our coastal defence right throughout the war, quite rightly and properly?  Our coastal defence throughout the war, the defence of the water approaches to this country, was the responsibility of the second mightiest navy in the world, and we would be the greatest fools in the world if we did not make use of that all through the war and did not closely co-operate, so as to make that naval defence the more efficient by co-operation between it at sea and us on land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Minister was making that statement I naturally presumed that he meant that he was going to accept all the help possible that the second mightiest navy in the world could give us in respect of the defence of our shores and that he on his part would be prepared, as he said, to give them co-operation on land.  What co-operation can we give with an Army with a strength of 7,000 men?  That would not be co-operation; it would probably be an impediment.  If there was to be any co-operation with the country that controlled the second mightiest navy in the world, and if that co-operation was to ensure that, from the sea anyhow, this State would receive protection of that second mightiest navy, then at least we should have an Army on land that would ensure that the air fleet of <Col N="1355" /> some foreign country would not be capable of coming in here and capturing our main air bases.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cowan is correct in his surmise that the Army of to-day would not be capable of defending the airport at Rineanna, I fail to see in what respect we are giving co-operation to anybody.  We are not even cooperating with our own people because we cannot give an assurance to them that at least what the Minister himself described as a token defence would be put up.  Even if it is only a token defence, we are at least defending our own territory.  We are defending it as a free people and we are defending it with our own Army.  At least that is to be expected of us, not alone by our own people but by those from whom we are expecting aid of the types suggested.</P>
    <P>I suppose I may be speaking on defence policy generally.  I take it that the Minister did not want us to discuss defence policy on this Bill but I feel that it is more appropriate to discuss defence policy generally on a Bill which gives the Army its legal existence for a period of 12 months.  By the same token, I think it is perhaps a record to have had two Bills of the same character, giving that legal existence to the Army, taken in the one year.  We had a Bill here last March, giving the Army its right to operate up to the 31st March, 1949.  We are now in 1948 giving it the right to carry on until the 31st March, 1950.  As I said in the beginning, I cannot see the necessity or the desirability for hurry in respect to this measure.  I should have liked, as I said, to have examined this whole matter in greater detail.  I am sure there are quite a number of our Deputies anxious to discuss it also. No doubt the result of taking the Bill to-day will provide them with that opportunity in the coming week.  From that point of view, it may be that the discussion here will be of a wider and a healthier character and perhaps helpful to the Minister in his approach to the Government on the general matter of Army policy.</P>
    <P>I can only hope that as a result of his contacts with the Army he <Col N="1356" /> will have perhaps changed his views but I must express grave doubts in that respect because recently the Minister gave away, or I understand he has made some arrangements about giving away, one of the finest sites for training cavalry in Cork.  We had one of the finest and most natural sites down there for training the anti-Tank and the Tank Corps.  That I understand has been given to some group of individuals in Cork who intend to establish a race track there.</P>

      <P>If that is so there is no force in what I am talking about at all.  If the whole scheme was changed, then there is no use in discussing the matter any further.  However, I should like to be given some assurance that that is so and that it does not, in fact, affect the training of this very necessary anti-tank force.  Some such scheme, some such alteration of original plans, was put up to me.  They would not be accepted by the Army for the simple reason that the Army tanks going out to carry out their exercises would have to cross the proposed race track.  They made it clear to me that <Col N="1357" /> if that was so and if certain buildings were to be erected as was also proposed, it would be quite impossible for the Army authorities to carry out the training which was so vitally necessary to this particular corps.  They even suggested to me that, if I was feeling so strongly sympathetic to the project, the best thing from their point of view would be for them to get out altogether and seek some other site.  That was the position when I left.  If the situation has changed to any great degree then that is all right.  The Minister has the last word on the matter and nothing more can be said anyhow. There was another site down there, however, which was of tremendous value to the Army authorities and which I understand has also been given away.  I think it is called the Rock Road site for the barracks.</P>

      <P>Well, is was regarded as an ideal site during the recent emergency.  Something like 2,000 soldiers were housed there in surroundings which were very much above the normal, for the period of the emergency, anyhow.  The huts which were erected there were of a semi-permanent type.  They were a magnificent concrete built hut with wooden flooring and fairly reasonably spacious.  From my point of view, I regarded them as being an ideal mobilisation centre, a centre which in any emergency, or in any <Col N="1358" /> urgent matter of getting troops in quickly and holding them for some particular period, was the ideal site.  That site is no longer available for such a purpose.  We had the unenviable experience during the last emergency of going round almost every county in the country with the exception of the Six-Counties and taking an old mansion of one kind or another.  In some cases we had to renovate them almost completely in order to house the unfortunate soldiers that were given the duty of protecting that particular district of the country.  I visited every post throughout the country during that period and I often thought with regret that we had no official barracks of one kind or another in these areas into which we could bring our troops and give them the reasonable comfort to which any man who offers his services to the State is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to hear from the Minister, when he is concluding, what type of co-operation he proposes to give on land to the nation which at the present time has the second strongest navy in the world, and his opinion on the subject of the matters which have been debated in the papers and to which he has referred&mdash;I have not followed them up very closely.  I have seen a reference here and there to the fact that the military authorities of foreign countries were visiting this country, inspecting our military establishments and so on. Naturally, that did not surprise me, because that sort of co-operation between armies is probably the greatest proof that we are a free people with our own Army, rather than the reverse. It may be, of course, that certain people have misinterpreted the effect of these visits and may have in certain respects regarded them as being in some sense dictatorial or something of that kind. We have been sending officers on courses wherever it was possible to send them.  It if were possible to send a man to America on a military course where he could get secure information which was valuable to the Army at home he was sent there to receive it. If it could be secured in France he went to France and secured it, just as if it were possible to secure it in England&mdash;and it was, as far as I am aware, nearly always available to our officers <Col N="1359" /> to go on courses of one kind or another to the English military establishments &mdash;we availed ourselves of the privilege to send our officers on these courses.</P>
    <P>The result has been of tremendous benefit to the Army.  I am very pleased to be able to say that in almost every case where these officers attended the courses abroad they came very high on the examiners' lists and in some cases they even occupied first place.  When these gentlemen came back they instructed selected courses of our own officers and the result, of course, was of tremendous value in general to the Army.  I do not think, therefore, that anyone need be perturbed in respect to statements in regard to the visit of foreign officers to our military establishments.  If the policy which was carried out in the past is unchanged then, in my opinion, there is nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks, I would make a special appeal to the Minister to have Section 8 reconsidered from the point of view that I have put forward. In its present form it would be intolerable to suggest that the individuals whom I have in mind should in any circumstances be permitted to avail of the provisions of this particular amendment which is now proposed. The period originally was for seven years.  I would appeal to the Minister to let that period run.  It is the normal course.  People have been disfranchised for a very much less serious offence for a period of seven years.  I think it is the legal period which is used in cases of this particular kind, for criminal acts and so on.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this I feel and hope that I am interpreting the minds of my own colleagues.  I feel that I am interpreting the minds of reasonable, common-sense, decent people in this country when I say that it would be intolerable that any individual who was a serving member of our Army and deserted in a time of serious danger and joined the forces of a foreign nation, should now be put in a position that would place him in a higher category than the men of Easter Week and the men who followed the men of Easter Week&mdash;the Old I.R.A. men&mdash;because that, in fact, is what we would be <Col N="1360" /> doing if we allowed this amendment to go through.</P>

      <P>I do not know what is in the Minister's mind when he talks about disqualification.  If the disqualification continues to remain, then if this amendment is passed it does not prevent him from securing employment with any of these bodies.  Is that not so?  As far as leaving the disqualification there is concerned, it merely means that there is a blot on the man's character.  Whether you have the power or not to raise that disqualification does not matter to me.  The fact that he committed the serious offence of deserting from the Army in a time of stress will remain for all time whether the official disqualification is raised or not.  But, whether the disqualification is raised or not, the fact remains that if this amendment is passed he will be entitled&mdash;whether he secures the employment or not is another matter&mdash;to receive employment from any of these bodies.  All that I am asking the Minister to do is to have the matter re-examined. I feel that, as a result of what we have said here, he will have it re-examined with a view to seeing, in the case of those individuals who while they were members of our Army deserted and joined a foreign army, that the original legislation will operate against them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to mislead the House, whether the thing that I am putting forward is approved of or not.  I want Deputies to understand what I am putting forward.  There are two classes.  There is the man who was actually with the colours and deserted. He has, as Deputy de Valera has reminded me, a discharge book, and on his discharge book will be written: &ldquo;Reason for leaving the Army&mdash;desertion.&rdquo; A man that has not a clean <Col N="1362" /> Army discharge cannot be accepted directly into State employment, whether this amendment is carried or not.  You have, then, work such as road work or work with Bord na Móna or some of those other bodies.  They do not ask for discharges and so that class of work would be open to him.  Then you have another man that is classified in the original emergency Order as a deserter legally.  I do not think that we ever intended to make him a deserter.  He is a man who was on the reserve, who did not leave his address and, in fact, who never got his call-up.  He is under the penalty at the moment.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Minister should have to introduce this Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  We had another one of them before the House about eight months ago.  At that time I stated my objection as plainly as I possibly could to this form of legislation in regard to the Defence Forces.  Deputy Traynor has made a statement about the strength of the Defence Forces.  I am anxious to know from the Minister what is the present strength of the Defence Forces, officers, N.C.O.s and men in the regular Army and the reserve in the separate categories.  There is no doubt at all that, apart from the question of defence policy, the strength of the Army is as low as it is to-day because of defects in the Defence Forces legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1923 the original Defence Forces Bill was introduced.  At that time it was necessary that the Bill should be rushed through the House.  It was introduced as a temporary Bill with a life of one year.  The Minister at the time promised the Dáil that if he were given the powers that were in that Bill he would bring in a revised Defence Forces Bill which could be debated in all its stages in the ordinary way by the House.  The House at the time accepted the position as put forward by the <Col N="1363" /> Minister and, at the request of the Government of the day passed that legislation into law.  The result was that that Bill was not originally examined by this House in the way any other Bill is examined.  The discussion of sections did not take place.  The result is that for 25 years now the Defence Forces of this country have been governed by an instrument that never received the proper consideration of this House.  As one who has some personal experience of the Defence Forces I say that if the Minister were to bring the old 1923 Act, as it is amended up to date, before this House and get the views and the help that would be given to him by Deputies in that connection it would help to remove many of the grievances under which officers and soldiers live.  These grievances are, to a large extent, responsible for the fact that we have to-day an Army that is inadequate in strength for any purpose&mdash;whether for the purpose of being the base on which an Army could be built up during an emergency period or whether for ordinary maintenance or training purposes.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister, who has had the benefit of experience as an officer in the Defence Forces himself, would have made sure that the Army Headquarters Staff in the last six months would have completed the study of the permanent Bill that is supposed to have been on the stocks for many years.  There would be no suggestion, I am quite sure, that Army Headquarters Staff is overworked at the moment.  There could be no suggestion that any of the other Army Staffs are overworked at the moment.  As I understand it, those staffs are endeayouring to find work to do because they have no soldiers to handle.  Down in the Curragh the position is that, with so few soldiers to train or to handle, the staffs there have to try, as I said, to find work.  They are looking for work.  So much so, that a section that have been mentioned here&mdash;the civilian employees of the Department and the Corps of Engineers&mdash;are now required to furnish most elaborate particulars every week of the amount of work done and at a general Officers' Conference in the Curragh there are queries as <Col N="1364" /> to how many square yards of paint Mr. Somebody or Sergeant Somebody applied during the past week.  When our Defence Forces are reduced to that level they become a joke, but a costly joke.  There is no use in having a Defence Force if it is going to be a joke and if it is going to be used in that way.  Any person who knows the mind of the ordinary young recruit who joins the Army nowadays is fully aware that his whole anxiety is to get out of it as quickly as he can.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that when I speak in this fashion I am speaking not for the purpose of criticising but for the purpose of pointing out that Temporary Provisions Acts year after year have contributed, in themselves, largely to the state of dissatisfaction that exists and to the state that is making it impossible to build up the units that we have to their full strength.  There would appear to be some objection, I do not know what it is, by Governments, and now we have had three of them in succession, to bringing in before this House a Defence Forces Bill that could be thoroughly examined and approved of as the best instrument for securing, regulating and controlling the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Twenty-three years ago the then Minister for Justice&mdash;he was acting-President of the Government at the time&mdash;came to this House and told the members of the great fundamental objection he had to any military officers having a sense of proprietorship.  I think the Minister at that time was fundamentally right, and the Dáil approved of the ideals that he had at the time in regard to military control.  A section was inserted into the Ministers' and Secretaries' Act about that time requiring that service on the Council of Defence would be limited to a period of three years.  That was a wise provision. That was a sound provision. From that time until 1932 the principle then laid down and accepted was applied.  Every three years there was a new officer going up to one of the appointments on the Council of Defence.  There was a natural flow of fresh experience right up to the top. The result of that was that the Defence Forces had reached their <Col N="1365" /> highest degree of efficiency in that period.  Now, Fianna Fáil&mdash;for reasons that I have never been able to understand&mdash;decided to change that policy. When one of the members of the Council of Defence completed his three-year period the Fianna Fáil Government simply reappointed him for another three years.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with it in my own way.  Had there been in the last 16 years an opportunity for officers to be promoted from the bottom right up to the top there would have been five changes in that period.  The Minister for Defence, whoever he was, would have been able in that period to have the advice of officers who had gone through the mill from the ground-floor right up to the top.  No matter how much efficiency obtained at the bottom, substantially the same Council of Defence was maintained over that long period.  What do we find?  We had to-day a most illuminating crosstalk between the present Minister and the ex-Minister for Defence as to the advice given to them by the Army staff in two particular matters.  One was the question of training grounds and the other the question of billets, or camping grounds.  One Minister, apparently, was advised that it would be wrong to make over part of a particular training ground for a racecourse and another Minister is advised that there is nothing wrong in it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>If the training ground was absolutely essential for training purposes &mdash; as apparently Deputy Traynor was so advised&mdash; then subsequent advice that part of that ground can be given away is not the same advice.  If Deputy Traynor as Minister was advised that a certain encampment down in the South of Ireland was both necessary and suitable and if his successor is advised that it can be given away, then there is something radically wrong in the system of advice.  I merely mention that matter because of the illuminating interchange between the present Minister and the former Minister across the floor of this House to-day.  Each of them was apparently advised in a completely contrary way by the same staff. I could cite more examples, but I am prepared to deal with the one given across the floor this morning.</P>
