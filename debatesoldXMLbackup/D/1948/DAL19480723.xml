      <P>Perhaps it might be convenient at this stage if we could give some general indication as to the sittings of the House next week.  It was proposed to set down the Social Welfare Bill for consideration on Tuesday.  I understand that was agreed to on the assumption that the Bill will be available to-day.  The Bill is available and we can proceed with discussion on the Second Stage on Tuesday next, unless it is desired to shift the Second Reading of the Bill to Wednesday.  If one day's sitting of normal length will be sufficient to dispose of the Second Reading of the Bill, the House need not meet until 3 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon.  If, however, it is thought that it will not be possible to complete the Second Stage of the Bill between 3 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., it would be necessary to sit at 10 a.m. on Tuesday or Wednesday. It is a question of facilitating the House in the matter and, perhaps, the Opposition could facilitate.  If it is thought preferable to discuss the matter between now and 2 o'clock to-day between the Whips, that can be done and some arrangement made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill is not likely to be protracted but, having regard to the nature of the Bill, I think it will take a very considerable time in Committee.  Perhaps the Tánaiste would indicate now when it is contemplated that the Committee Stage will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="An Tánaiste William Norton">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>There, again, it is a matter of facilitating the House.  So <Col N="1488" /> far as I am concerned I am quite prepared to put down the Bill for Tuesday and have the Committee Stage the following week.  If, however, there is any desire on the part of the House to conclude business on the discussion of the Bill next week, we could take the Committee and other Stages next week. I am not, however, pressing for that because I realise it is desirable the House should get an opportunity of dealing fully with the subject matter of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  If the House agrees, we can, with the agreement of all Parties, take the Committee Stage next week.  I am not pressing for it and it can remain over until the following week, if desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the length and nature of the Bill, I think it would be impracticable to take the Committee Stage next week.  That presumably means that the Committee Stage would be taken the following week.  The amount of business to be done next week will, I think, consist entirely of the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill and other minor Bills which have been introduced.  In view of that I think it would be practicable to complete next week's programme within the normal sitting hours.  If, however, the Government thinks that more time is required perhaps an earlier meeting on Wednesday would be sufficient.  That particular matter can be discussed between the Whips.  Assuming that the programme for next week is the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill and of the other minor Bills which have been introduced, some of which may be concluded next week, I think busisess could be discussed within the normal hours.  It is a matter upon which the Government Whips would know as much as the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will occupy two days on the Second Reading of the Bill.  However, I do not mind if we do, but if we are going to <Col N="1489" /> take just one day on the Second Stage the House may feel it would get a better opportunity of studying the Bill if we met on Wednesday instead of Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to intimate final agreement to that arrangement, but I think it is practicable. Perhaps it could be fixed up between the Whips during the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on the Department of the Taoiseach is a Vote which is of considerable importance not alone to this House but to the people outside.  People who read the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning and read therein the report of the debate which took place here yesterday cannot help reflecting on the statement made by Deputy Lemass in dealing with the activities and the manner in which this Government is discharging its obligations. The <i>Irish Press</i> quotes the Deputy as having said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Give the country a chance, said Mr. Lemass.  Get out of office after this short period of five months&mdash;far more than any of us anticipated.  Call it a day.  The experiment is over. Recognise the fact that you have failed.  Recognise the fact that you have not even been trying and that, if you have been moving at all, you have been moving in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely, Deputy Lemass does not think that the people are completely daft? The people see for themselves the value of the present Government.  After the next four years, the people will be given an ample opportunity of expressing their approval of this Government, and they will do so in no uncertain manner.  If Deputy Lemass was of the opinion that the life of this Government would be only a few weeks or months, then it was not the first time the Deputy was greatly mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Give the country a chance,&rdquo; says Deputy Lemass.  What chance did this country get for the past 16 years under the Deputy's administration?  To-day we have, thank God, the most democratic Government in the world. <Col N="1491" /> Democracy in this country never got a chance in recent years.  The Government that administered affairs here in the past 16 years was a one-man Government, a Government dictated to by one man.  That is not the case with the Government which the Irish people have to-day.  We realise the very serious obligation that rested on our shoulders in past years, and more particularly in recent months; we realised that there was a necessity for a change from a one-man to a people's Government. One-man Government in this country has been a complete failure&mdash; one man dictating the laws and laying down the regulations, supported by a large army of dummies who thumbed applause to support some dictatorial move on the part of the leader of the Government.</P>
    <P>The only applause that came from the dummies was the thumbed applause when the one man who was controlling the whole machinery spoke. Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party were prevented from speaking; they were only penny messenger boys in the eyes of the last Taoiseach.  Ministers under him were afraid to arrive at any decisions. He took the necessary steps to veto any decisions arrived at by his Ministers.  He monopolised the whole time of the Cabinet and if he decided on any particular step the Cabinet blindly followed and the remainder of the Party blindly followed them into the Division Lobby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I want to put this through the Chair to the Taoiseach.  Am I to understand from Deputy Flanagan's statement that he has had access to Cabinet Minutes? How otherwise would he be capable of making these statements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from what we have seen in this House, from what we know from the outside, from what we have learned, that that is what was happening. Deputy MacEntee knows quite well that what I am saying now is quite true.  On more than one occasion the Deputy has been the <Col N="1492" /> subject of the thunder of the ex-Taoiseach's knuckles on his head.  We know that on more than one occasion the Deputy was prevented from making any decision, whether right or wrong. We have learned from our experience of the past 16 years that if there is one type of Government which the people should not have it is a Government on the lines of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day we cannot say that our Government is led or controlled by one man.  We are proud to say that there is a really sincere attempt being made to prevent our country from following in the footsteps of many European countries, countries that have been led by dictators.  We saw to it that dictatorship would not get a complete grip in this country; we saw that the one step to be taken in order to ensure that that would not happen was to end the administration of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ending the administration of Fianna Fáil meant the ending of dictatorship here.  Thank God it has ended and it will never again get the grip in this country that it had for the past 16 years.  Deputy Lemass tells us there is no leadership in this Government.  This Government is functioning under the leadership of the Taoiseach, a man who is highly respected by every section of the community, a man who has never entered into bitter debate in this House.  All Parties on this side of the House were unanimous in their selection of the Taoiseach.  He has the full confidence and support of all the Deputies behind him.  He has received and will receive the widespread support and sound approval of all the Irish people. Fianna Fáil are bellowing from public platforms and even behind the closed doors of various Cumainn that this Government has not been formed with straightforward, honest and reliable motives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an admission from Deputy Brennan.  The majority in any Parliament have the right to form a Government.  We have been given that right by the people.  Where could there be any greater display of democracy than to have a Government functioning at the desire and with the approval of our people?  We have that Government to-day and there are Deputies like Deputy MacEntee parading through the country warning the people to prepare for an immediate general election.  If the Deputy is expecting an early general election, he might as well be whistling jigs to a tombstone.  This Dáil, with the full approval of Government Deputies, will run its full term, notwithstanding what Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Brennan or Deputy Burke may say.  If we on this side of the House consider a general election necessary, we will have no hesitation in asking the Taoiseach to have that general election, so that we can wipe out those Deputies and their supporters completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall wipe them out root and branch.  I am warning the Fianna Fáil Party, realising that they are none too happy in their present state, because, as days go on, they must realise that this Government is finding a warmer place in the hearts of the people.  No longer has Fianna Fáil the weapon of jobbery in order to strengthen the Party.  No longer will they have the sympathies, as they had in the past, of the industrialists, who were prepared to pour thousands into the Fianna Fáil funds.  They were prepared privately and secretly, as I know confidentially, to hand their contributions to the trustees of Fianna Fáil in order to get the necessary adjustments made in the Department of Industry and Commerce, to further their own ends by this system of crookery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. I am only saying that, as a result of the change of Government, the huge funds that were pushed into the letter box of Upper Mount Street to assist the former Government Party will not, and cannot, arrive by the organisation's post, morning after morning, because these people realise that they cannot advance their own interest further by being on the safe side of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Fianna Fáil organisation is being dropped like a hot bun throughout the country.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies are being completely ignored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that no longer can they make their false promises to the people, no longer are they in a position to promise the people the sun, moon and stars because they are in a position to give the people nothing.  Even when they were in a position to do something, they gave the people nothing.  Now they cannot give the people anything, but nothing and they have no prospect of being able to give the people anything.  We know quite well that at the moment they are doing everything that is humanly possible to undermine the earnestness and sincerity of the present Government.  They are trying to prevent the Government discharging their obligations to the people and from fulfilling the ten vitally important points of the Government programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that we have reached the end of this recess without having legislation introduced which might benefit our people but the reason that legislation, such as that introduced by Deputy Norton last week, which will benefit our old age pensioners and others who require a proper social services scheme, has been delayed is because of the hindrance of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are not prepared to <Col N="1495" /> co-operate in seeing that the people of this country are properly housed.  The housing problem which this Government has to face is not being given that co-operation and support of Fianna Fáil, but is being sabotaged left, right and centre.  Morning after morning we find in the pages of the <i>Irish Press</i> statements in large print put there designedly for the purpose of undermining the confidence of the people in the present Government but, thank God, the people at last realise their responsibility and are prepared to stand behind a Government that is prepared to stand for them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Lemass in the course of his long address, in which he said nothing, alleged that this Government had no policy.  This Government placed their ten-point policy before the people immediately after the formation of the Government. Every Party on this side of the House are in full agreement on that ten-point policy and are prepared to support the Government loyally until each of these ten points is completely fulfilled. When these points are fulfilled, the people will see that the experiment of coalition has been a wonderful success, and the prophecy of Deputy Lemass will be falsified.  The experiment of coalition will prove to be the best type of Government because we have every section of our people interested and participating in the making of the laws of the country.</P>
    <P>We have the Labour Party who will cater fully for the needs and requirements of the labouring section.  We have Clann na Poblachta who will see that as far as their policy is concerned, it will be fully adhered to and that, in time, with the support of their colleagues we shall have a complete and united Ireland of 32 counties under one Government.  We have the Fine Gael Party in complete agreement prepared to give this Government the services of their able and their experienced men.</P>
    <P>The brains of this country sit on the Front Benches of this Government. Our Ministers made wonderful personal sacrifices in order to place their services at the disposal of the people.  I <Col N="1496" /> know very well, as does every other Deputy, that the Ministers comprising the present Government from the Taoiseach downwards are labouring in this House and in their various offices at great financial loss to themselves. How many of the Ministers we had for the last 16 years laboured at a serious financial loss?  Thank God, we have seen the day when there are men left in this country who are prepared to work for this country and advance the interests of the people, even when it entails serious financial loss to themselves. If it were not for the patriotic spirit of these men probably the benches on this side of the House would still be occupied by the men who were growing fatter and richer while the plain people of the country were growing thinner and poorer.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil can thank me for any of their success, and can also place on record the game that I played bravely in this House, and the <Col N="1497" /> part that I contributed generously to bring about their downfall.  May I say that the Fianna Fáil Party are taking an unfair advantage of the Government by criticising unduly the efforts of the Taoiseach and of his Ministers to bring about a decent standard of living for our people.  Instead of uttering strong syllables of criticism, why will they not sometimes utter words of co-operation and support and play their part as Irishmen in an Irish Parliament in bringing about unity in the country as a whole?  Instead we see petty jealousies and Party spite no matter what attempts are made from this side of the House to bring about a happier state of affairs in the country. These attempts meet with forcible opposition and with undue criticism from those at the other side.  The Taoiseach, shortly after this Government was formed, said that he would welcome criticism from this side of the House.  That was the first real display of how freely democracy is working here.  It was an attempt to bring about complete success within the ranks of the coalition.  The fact is that Deputies on this side can at any time they desire, freely express their views.</P>

      <P>We have reason to give all the co-operation and support that we possibly can to a good Government. I believe that the people of the country cannot see or realise the value of this Government within the short period of five months.  I say that at the end of 12 months, or even at the end of two years, our people will be able to experience very little difference simply because it will surely take this Government 12 years to repair the damage which Fianna Fáil did in 16 years.  The damage they created in 16 years cannot be fully repaired in five years.  I would be surprised if we had any great material changes in this country as a result of this Government in ten years.  First of all we have to build up what Fianna Fáil pulled down and that is no small job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said that, as far as he could see, this Government could take no decisions themselves without appointing committees or advisory councils.  Deputy Lemass is wrong with all due respect to him.  How many commissions, councils and committees were established by Fianna Fáil at the expense of this State?  And how many lengthy reports did these bodies present to the Fianna Fáil Government. How long had the demand been made to the Fianna Fáil Government to set up a council of education, and how long did it take the present Government to establish that council of education?  If this Government sees that there is wisdom in appointing committees, councils or advisory boards they will be appointed and their reports will be acted upon and not shelved as were the reports of the various commissions established under the Fianna Fáil Administration.  Some of those commissions and committees sat for long weary hours endeavouring to provide the Fianna Fáil Government with the best possible report and solution on the subjects which were submitted to them for investigation.  Was it not rather disheartening to them to find that, after their long hours of labour, their reports were ignored and not put into operation.  I have no hesitation in saying that the reports of advisory boards, commissions or councils appointed by this Government will <Col N="1499" /> be acted upon, and that their reports will not find a wholesome resting place on the shelves in Government Buildings to be covered with cobwebs.</P>
    <P>It is safe to say that one cannot expect wonders all at once.  It will be at least a number of years before the people can judge rightly whether we, from this side of the House, are serious in our efforts to comply with the ten points of policy which we said we were prepared to embark upon.  We have seen the attempts of the past Government. We have seen how they have failed entirely in their obligations, not from one but from every point of view. The Irish language, the language that we were told would be spoken, the language of our people&mdash;what great wonderful progress have we seen during the Fianna Fáil Administration with regard to the Irish language?  The education of our children; beyond the fact that a few new national schools were erected here and there throughout the country where they were necessary, what great progress has been made with regard to the provision of proper educational facilities and a sound system of education for all our children? Where are the results, what are the results, can we see any results of the Fianna Fáil policy with regard to education?  We do know, however, that any of our people who were fortunate enough, who were lucky enough, whose parents were in receipt of sufficient earnings to give them a college education, the people who got a good, sound education, who left the various colleges qualified Irish speakers, who prominently displayed a Fáinne, were on the long queue outside the office of Deputy de Valera, then Minister for External Affairs, trying to obtain passports to take them to the four corners of the world.</P>
    <P>After years of education, after the large sums that their parents spent on educating them, they were in the position of having nothing before them, nothing at their doorstep, nothing left for them, but to emigrate to the four corners of the world, in order that they might secure an existence, secure work, secure a decent standard of living, which was not at their doorstep at <Col N="1500" /> home, but which had to be secured, which had to be granted to them by a foreign Power, in a foreign country, a foreign land.  Was it not a disgraceful state of affairs?  Knowing and believing that the one aim of the new Government is to provide full-time employment for all our people at home, is it not very sad for us to think of the hundreds and thousands of people that left the shores of this country under the Fianna Fáil Administration and especially within the last few years of it.  I say that Fianna Fáil are now endeavouring to undermine the confidence of the people in the present Government by telling them that they can provide work for our own people.  Will they answer loudly why did they not provide work for our own people during the last 15 years and provide a decent standard of living for them during the last 15 years?  Why did they force completely from our shores fathers of families, younger sons, and elder sisters to be nurses in English hospitals, waitresses in English hotels? Are our young men to stand behind the handles of the farmers' ploughs of Great Britain and follow the hooves of British horses along British fields? Are our labouring men, denied work at home, to be compelled to go to the lowest depths of English coalmines in order to help in the production of coal for England?  Why was a serious attempt not made at that time by Fianna Fáil to implement their promise to the people?</P>
    <P>This Government is implementing its promise to the people; we are doing it, we mean to do it; with the co-operation of the Deputies behind the Government, it will be done.  Work will be found; work must be found, if the Irish nation is to survive completely, but if the long drain of Fianna Fáil emigration is to continue, where will our country find itself and how can it survive?  How can our country possibly survive if the mail boats are going to leave the North Wall and Rosslare, if the steamships are going to leave Cobh for America, packed to their fullest capacity with young Irishmen and young Irish women who are being forcibly driven from the land of their birth because they are denied work and a decent standard of living <Col N="1501" /> at home?  Surely the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is one of the items of Government policy that I am prepared to press forcibly in order to see that a solution is found to end for all time the tide of emigration which bring about this disheartening state of affairs where the firm shake-hands and the long good-bye is experienced on practically every floor in rural Ireland.  That is the result of the policy of the last Government, no work, no proper suitable conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

May I say, arising from it, that he made reference to the broadcast which the Taoiseach made immediately he took office, in which he stated that the provision of work, food and housing was the major aim of the Government.  I suggest that the Taoiseach should use the radio to as great an extent as possible, because there is no more effective medium for conveying information to the country than the radio.  The radio takes the place of newspapers in remote districts where there are no daily deliveries of papers and in practically every house in rural Ireland there is a radio.</P>

      <P>It would be well if the people would reflect on the speech made yesterday by Deputy Briscoe.  I should like to inquire what is to be the policy of the Government with regard to our financial position and whether the Taoiseach would be prepared to make a statement as to what steps will be taken with regard to the financial system to which we are tied. I believe that this Government may be very seriously handicapped in implementing their promises to provide full-time employment, to provide housing and to provide the necessary food supplies by that system.  If the Minister for Local Government is handicapped in the matter of the costs of housing, or if the Minister for Health is handicapped in the matter of financial accommodation for the proper hospitalisation of the country and for the prevention of the spread of tuberculosis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for the appointment of these Ministers, and, if they are in any difficulty with regard to the administration of their Departments, I believe the Taoiseach, if approached by them, will give them advice.  He may be faced with the problem of having to examine closely the financial system under which this Government works and under which the previous and other Governments worked.  I believe he will have to tackle that problem, because he cannot properly discharge his obligations as Leader of the House and head of the Government within that financial system.  I believe that drastic action will be necessary on the part <Col N="1504" /> of the Government in the matter of the banking system.  It is deplorable that, if the Government requires accommodation for the carrying out of schemes of national importance, it is necessary for them to borrow from the banks at very high rates of interest.  If we have to borrow for such schemes, if the Government must again bend the knee to the bankers and pay them high rates of interest, our housing, hospitals, drainage and other schemes will cost our people very large sums.  This money must come from the taxpayer and what the taxpayer has in his pocket must come from the soil and therefore it is our people in rural Ireland who will have to dance to the tune called by the bankers.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to this matter for the purpose of getting a statement from him as to what Government policy is to be in the matter of the present financial system, referred to by Deputy Briscoe, and, in a passing reference, by Deputy Aiken. I believe that system has been responsible for the downfall of the previous Government, in that they were prevented from carrying out their promises on various matters, and I believe that it will be a handicap to the present Government and to all future Governments. It is ridiculous that if one deposits money in the banks, one gets interest at the rate of 1½ per cent., but if one gets money on loan, one is obliged to pay 6½ per cent., and that the bankers, private individuals who have no responsibility either from or to the people, should hold the Government and the people in the hollow of their hands.  Some steps will have to be taken with regard to the provision of the necessary capital to enable the Government and the Taoiseach to implement their promises.  I impress on the Taoiseach that, if he proposes to continue the policy of borrowing from a group of private individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If he proposes to continue to work within the present financial system, he will find himself very seriously handicapped.  I suggest that, if necessary, a Committee of this <Col N="1505" /> House, or a committee of experts, should be set up to examine the financial system and that its terms of reference should be to devise a proper financial system which would fleece neither the individual nor the Government in their money requirements for the running of the country.  The matter should be the subject of long and careful consideration behind the doors of the Cabinet room.</P>
      <P>It is the desire of members of the House and of every Irishman to see that, within our time, Partition will be ended, and the Taoiseach, I am sure, will avail of an early opportunity to reopen the matter with the British authorities.</P>

May I say that, at last, we have a Government which is the envy of the whole world?  This country should be one of the happiest and one of the grandest countries in the world.  We are by no means unreasonable.  I believe that we Irish are a very reasonable people.  I believe that when we have a good Government, we appreciate a good Government.  For that reason I trust the fruits of this Government will be appreciated by our people.  I hope and trust that for long and many a day we will experience in this country groups of men bound together, as we have them to-day, for the common good.  I believe that the experiment of coalition government has worked in the past six months, has worked well and has <Col N="1506" /> worked most satisfactorily.

If we have that state of affairs and if upon these benches we have Fianna Fáil Ministers I do believe it will be a nice spirit to prevail within the House and in the country.  I believe that coalition Governments are the right and proper type of Government and that a one-Party Government will never function in this country again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but the course which the debate took made me feel that it was necessary that I should say just one or two things as briefly as possible.  We of the Clann na Poblachta Party continue to support the Government led by the Taoiseach because of a fundamental difference in approach from that evidenced by their predecessors.  We do not subscribe to the view of Ministerial infallibility or of Governmental infallibility. It is because this inter-Party Government has approached the problem of government realising that, being human, they were fallible, and that their duty was, realistically and honestly, to approach the various <Col N="1507" /> problems, foreign and domestic, that confront them.  Their predecessors gave evidence of an attitude of mind that what was done by the Government, what was done by a Minister, was above and beyond criticism, was incapable of being wrong.  It was that authoritarian complex, it was that dictatorial approach to public questions, that gave us a result in the general election, which put into office this inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>The problems that confront the Government are not going to be solved in a session, in a year or in the life of any one Dáil but an honest effort can be made at least to commence laying the foundations of a new and a better Ireland.  There are many aspects of Government policy about which the different components of the inter-Party Government may not feel particularly enthusiastic but this inter-Party Government came together on a ten-point programme and, so long as the Government led by the Taoiseach, this inter-Party Government, adheres to that ten-point programme, then we of the Clann na Poblachta Party will support them.</P>
      <P>This inter-Party Government has been jibingly derided as an experiment. Of course it is an experiment.  Is not all human progress the history of courageous experiments?  This is one of the most courageous experiments which this country has ever tried. Mistakes will be made, mistakes probably have already been made by the inter-Party Government, but I submit that they have been honest mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal immediate economic tasks lying before the present Government are the provision, first of all, of adequate housing for all the people of the nation&mdash;I would urge upon the Taoiseach that the provision of proper housing for the people should occupy a place of priority in all governmental planning&mdash;the development of our industries and the provision of that volume of employment that will ensure that it will be no longer necessary for our people to board the emigrant ship in order to earn from the stranger the living denied them at home.  These are the things which.  I suggest, must be <Col N="1508" /> high on the priority list of Government planning.  These are not things that will be achieved in a day.  They will require hard and unremitting work. They will require the co-operation, not alone of all the Parties forming the inter-Party Government, but also of the Deputies who sit on the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>Sometimes perhaps in debates here there is a tendency&mdash;we are all possibly guilty of it&mdash;to attempt to score the cheap debating point, the purely Party point.  It would not be human nature if things like that did not occur but there should be problems and there should be occasions upon which all sides of the House can co-operate.</P>
    <P>There should be occasions when the undoubted experience and ability of many of the Deputies now in opposition should be at the disposal of the Government.  I would have preferred that this inter-Party Government experiment should have been an all-Party Government one.  I believe that that is something which will come eventually.  For the moment, the Parties comprising this Government are left in the position that the co-operation they can expect from Deputies on the opposite benches can only be co-operation of a most critical kind.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which was referred to in the debate on external affairs, but inasmuch as it is a matter of major Government policy, I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, to refer to it again.  I would urge on the Taoiseach that while any portion of our national territory remains occupied by the invading forces of the British Empire, the Government should put it before them, as a matter of settled and definite Government policy, that in any outbreak of hostilities in any war which may occur, this country cannot participate on the side of the Power which is occupying portion of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>Very well.  I find myself unable to accept the gloomy <Col N="1509" /> picture painted by the leader of the Opposition and by several of his colleagues, as to the possibility of war in the immediate future.  I make that statement with some diffidence, inasmuch as the leader of the Opposition was for many years the Minister for External Affairs; but I would draw his attention to the fact that the President of the United States of America stated yesterday that the hopes for world peace in the future were excellent and that, in his opinion, there would be no war.</P>

      <P>So do we all hope that he is right.  I would urge on the Taoiseach the desirability of avoiding the growth of any kind of war psychosis in the country or the aggravation of the very natural fears of the people about the possibility of a future war.</P>
      <P>We in Clann na Poblachta have been taunted by Deputy Lemass and others because of our support for the inter-Party Government.  That which really annoys the Deputies opposite is that Clann na Poblachta has found it possible to support this Government and at the same time maintain its own separate and distinct identity.</P>

      <P>There is no question about it and if the Deputy goes to his own constituency it is one place where he will learn it very quickly.  We in Clann na Poblachta do urge on the Taoiseach that as soon as may be advisable there should be an examination by the Government of the financial system under which we live. We believe it is in the national interest that our currency should no longer be bound to parity with sterling.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Briscoe, a member of the Opposition, giving expression to similar views last night. I would urge on the Taoiseach that that position should be examined by the Government at as early a date as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Valuable work was undoubtedly done by the previous Government for the Irish language.  I would urge on the <Col N="1510" /> Taoiseach that the drive to make Irish once more the spoken language of our people should not be slackened off by the present inter-Party Government.  I for one do not believe that there will be any slackening in the drive, nor do I accept the attempt made by Deputies on the benches opposite to suggest that they, and only they, were sincere in their desire to see the Irish language revived.  So far as we of Clann na Poblachta are concerned, it is a cardinal point in our policy, and we will insist that there shall be no slackening in the drive for the revival of Irish and no lessening of Government enthusiasm therefor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass last night devoted a considerable portion of his speech to criticisms of, and attacks on, the various component parts of the inter-Party Government.  He suggested that in this Government there was no freedom of thought or freedom of action.  In the course of other debates, similar suggestions were made by Deputy MacEntee.  I will not waste time in dealing with what Deputy MacEntee said.  Deputy Lemass made reference to a &ldquo;machined majority.&rdquo; That is something which is not true and something which I wish to controvert as emphatically as I can.  There is no machined majority on this side of the House.  There is a majority of people carrying out the mandate given to them by the people.</P>

      <P>There is a majority of Deputies on this side of the House adhering to the ten-point programme on which they came together.  If that is a machined majority, then it is a machined majority all right.  Criticisms about machined majorities come very badly from Deputies sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches, who were machined for 16 years.</P>

      <P>I will not deal with the official interrupter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Bí id' thost, a Dhonnchadh. Criticisms about machined majorities would come well from any part of this <Col N="1511" /> House rather than from the people who sit on the benches opposite. Deputy Lemass opened his speech on this Estimate in a rather patronising way.  He said that after the setting up of the inter-Party Government it was viewed by a section of the people with what he described as good-natured tolerance.  Then Deputy Lemass went on to describe how that good-natured tolerance evaporated and was replaced by irritation against this awful inter-Party Government.  There was a good deal of truth in what Deputy Lemass said because, so far as this House is concerned, there was a patronising, indulgent, tolerance of this Government for quite a considerable time, and then the irritation developed.  But it was not amongst the people that the irritation developed.  The irritation and the annoyance developed on the benches opposite when the Deputies discovered that this was not a fly-by-night Government which was going to last for six weeks, but a Government that had taken on hands a job of work to do and was going to do it.  Irritation and good-natured tolerance, how are you!</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that we in Clann na Poblachta make no apology for supporting the present Government so long as that Government adheres to the ten-point programme. So long as they so adhere, we will continue to support them; so long as nothing done by this Government is, in our opinion, injurious to the national interests or to our policy for the achieving of the national ideal of a free and undivided Irish republic for 32 counties.</P>

      <P>I want to say to the Taoiseach very sincerely and very clearly that this Government has been formed to do two particular jobs.  One of them is to provide housing for the people and the other is to provide full employment for the people.  While no one appreciates more than I do the difficulties facing the Government, I feel that on both these headings the energy and the determination that should be shown by the Government have not been shown up to the present.  I do not intend the Taoiseach to take that in any way as destructive criticism on my part.  I want him to accept it as a constructive suggestion with regard to these two problems.  In this City of Dublin we have 23,000 people needing homes.  Yesterday, I asked the Minister for Local Government how many houses the Dublin Corporation intend to provide before 31st December next and the Minister gave me figures which suggested that approximately 400 houses would be built between this and the end of the year.  I am sure the Taoiseach realises that that number is totally inadequate to meet the very dangerous situation in this city arising from the shortage of houses.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate for Local Government I was precluded from making suggestions to the Minister for Local Government with regard to housing, because they would mean proposals for legislation.  I take this opportunity, therefore, of saying to the Taoiseach that it will be necessary to give the Minister for Local Government extensive legislative powers to enable him to carry out the housing drive that is necessary.  Similarly, in regard to the provision of employment, legislation will be necessary and I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that that legislation will be introduced for consideration at the earliest possible date.  The Taoiseach said on the night that he was appointed that these were two of the matters facing the Government.  This House will be adjourning in a couple of weeks until October, and I ask that during that period the necessary legislation required to give power to the Government to solve these problems will be prepared and ready for us when we reassemble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> On a personal matter, I want to say that in introducing his Estimate, the Taoiseach referred to his car allowance and mentioned that I took some objection to the change made.  When we were discussing the financial provisions I did indicate that, in my view, the provision of State cars for Minsters was wrong, that it was too expensive and that it should be stopped.  I made the suggestion that all Ministers should be in the position of the former Taoiseach and his predecessor, who had not State cars, but an allowance, I think, of £350.</P>

      <P>You may if you want to.  In my opening remarks on this Estimate I drew attention to the fact that this year&mdash;so far as I know, for the first time&mdash;the practice which has hitherto obtained was departed from. The practice of giving to the Government or to the Ceann Comhairle some indication of the general topics on wide Government policy which it was intended to debate on this Estimate was departed from.  I mentioned yesterday in my opening remarks that I had no idea what topics were to be considered or debated.  The results of the departure from tradition and practice have been evident by the disorderly course which the debate has taken and the wide range of topics which has been discussed by Deputies.  They have ranged from cabbages by Deputy V. de Valera to cheese by Deputy Corry and from republics to inflation.  It appears to me, going over in retrospect the speeches that were made, that I would need to be a Ministerial Pooh-Bah&mdash;I would need to be Minister for Finance, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Local Government, Minister for Education, as well as Taoiseach&mdash;to be in a position fully to answer the various detailed points that were raised in the course of this discussion.  This debate was opened by Deputy Lemass and he set the tone of it.  I have rarely listened during my period as a Deputy in this House to a debate that was conducted on such a low level and with such utter disregard for the general interest and welfare of the people as a whole.  I hope that, in the course of the remarks that I have to make, I will be able to curb the natural indignation which I feel at some of the things that were said during the course of this debate and that I will speak with such dignity and restraint as our Parliamentary institutions demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made a speech which appeared to me, at all events, to have been made extempore.  It was a speech more on the lines of what one would hear from a platform at a street corner during election time than a speech of a serious character that you would expect to hear from a responsible Deputy in this House on a debate which is exclusively reserved <Col N="1515" /> for the discussion of the highest branches of general Government policy. He started off by referring to this new inter-Party Government as &ldquo;this setup.&rdquo; He wanted to know how long &ldquo;this set-up&rdquo; is going to last.  He purported to tell the House of the public opinion that he gathered from day to day in reference to Government activities and of the likelihood of this Government lasting or of being a stable Government.  He spoke of this Government as being an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; and asserted that it was suffering from lack of leadership and lack of direction.  I deal with these matters at the outset of my remarks not, I hope, in a political way&mdash;not for the purpose of gaining any political Party capital for any group that supports this inter-Party Government&mdash;but because an effort was deliberately made by Deputy Lemass to sabotage this so called &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; which has now become an institution of this State&mdash; the inter-Party Government.  He tried to undermine public confidence in the Government in order that he might be able to run the length and breadth of this country to the Fianna Fáil supporters and flog their failing support for his Party.  There was little thought in the whole course of the speech made by him for the general public interest nor was there any attempt to make any constructive proposals.  He stated that this was an &ldquo;experiment.&rdquo;  I assert that it has become no longer an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; but an institution. Deputy Lemass may possibly have heard of what the late Mr. Gladstone on one occasion stated.  He stated his belief in what he called &ldquo;the power of confident assertion.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass, apparently, adapts that phrase to his political philosophy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass believes in the power of truculent assertion.  That was the tone he used and the level he fixed for a debate in this House.  That tone was followed and that level was kept by Opposition Deputies throughout the whole course of this debate.  He made a vulgar taunt that we in this inter-Party Government were going, as he said, to hang on to office as long as we could.  Neither I nor any one of <Col N="1516" /> my colleagues in this Government has any interest in place, power or patronage.  We do not want office or the fruits of office.  Nobody can conscientiously assert that any single one of us entered into this inter-Party Government for the purpose of Party politics&mdash;for the purpose of securing Party patronage, or office, or profit, or power, and I throw back that vulgar taunt of Deputy Lemass.  We came together in the public interest because 750,000 of the Irish people, as represented in an Irish Parliament, required that we should do so.  It will ever be a source of pride to me that I was selected by a group such as is represented in this Government to be the Leader of the Government which was then formed.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the results of our efforts, we have at least achieved this: we are a Government co-operating for one purpose and one purpose only; we are a Government with a united policy and a united purpose, and that policy and that purpose is to do the best that we can by every available means in our power for the general good of all sections of the Irish people without thought for our political Parties and, I think I am safe in saying, without thought for our own personal interests. That is our strength.  That is our pride.  That is our guarantee to the Irish people that we are here in this Government only so long as they require us to be here.  No vulgar taunt from Deputy Lemass, no sneers from his lips will divert us from the task that we have undertaken until we have done what we promised to do and, having done that, we will submit ourselves to the verdict of the people and we will be content to be judged upon our results.  Our strength to us at all times will be the strength that is the unifying force in this Government.  I asserted some weeks ago in Cork that this was a stable Government; that all its members were united by a common policy and a common purpose.  I pledge my faith again to the Irish people and to those who are supporting us that that is the position.  We will hang on, as Deputy Lemass so vulgarly said yesterday, as a Government until we have achieved what we have set out to do.  It will not be the public <Col N="1517" /> opinion, as expressed here by Deputy Lemass or by any other Deputy, that will judge us.  It will be the public opinion of the people expressed in a democratic way.  We have no doubt as to what the verdict will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass purports to tell the House&mdash;and, through the House, the people believing, of course, that he is doing something in the public interest &mdash;that he is astonished at the number of people who come and tell him that they have lost confidence in this Government.  He says he gave advice at the start of this Government to somebody or other that we should get a chance.  I have looked through Deputy Lemass's speeches and his public utterances and nowhere do I find any public statement of that character, and nowhere do I find in his actions any constructive effort to give this Government a chance.  Deputy Lemass has referred to my broadcast over Radio Éireann shortly after I was appointed to my present position.  At that time, I said to the people that we were no political mendicants looking for a chance or begging for a chance. We are a Government elected by the majority of the representatives of the Irish people in this House.  Those are our title deeds to act as a Government and, until our authority is withdrawn, we shall continue to be so.  If Deputy Lemass and his colleagues do not give us their co-operation in the interests, not of our political or several political Parties forming this Government but in the interests of the people, then they will answer not to us, not to this Dáil, but to the people when the time comes.  We have again the faith that Deputy Lemass has in truculent assertion when he says that the people are telling him in increasing numbers that they have withdrawn support from this Government.</P>
    <P>In the last few months, we have had discussions on the Estimates for the Public Service&mdash;Estimates prepared by the last Government, the Deputies now in opposition.  They were discussing their own Estimates.  In every single case, with two exceptions&mdash;Health and Lands&mdash;motions were put down to refer back the Estimate for reconsideration. Those Estimates in the particular <Col N="1518" /> circumstances of this year furnished an opportunity that is not normally furnished to Deputies in this House of learning and debating every aspect of Government policy.  Those Estimates were fully discussed&mdash;more fully discussed during the last few months than Estimates have ever been in this House since the establishment of our State.  Every single one of those motions to refer back was withdrawn except the Estimates for the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture.  The Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting was put to a division.  On that range of Estimates, covering every aspect of Government policy, there were only three divisions&mdash;Defence, Agriculture and a motion on Wireless Broadcasting. Yet Deputy Lemass, with his usual brazen defiance of fact, purports to say that there is a complete absence of consistent policy in any sphere on the part of this Government.  They had not the courage to go into the Division Lobby on any of these Estimates except three, Defence and Agriculture and a motion on Wireless Broadcasting confined to one item really, broadcasting on the proposed short-wave station.  Are all those Deputies who voted for the Government on these three divisions all irresponsive to public opinion?  Do they know less than Deputy Lemass sitting here in his Dublin office knows about what people are thinking?</P>
    <P>Is there any inference to be drawn from the fact&mdash;the undoubted fact&mdash; that every Deputy in every Party in this House, except Fianna Fáil, every Independent Deputy in this House, except on two occasions when Deputy Cowan voted against the Government, have all voted for this Government on every single item.  Is there no inference to be drawn from that that this Government has and retains the confidence of the representatives of the people here in this House?  On the merits of the proposals put forward, not as Deputy Lemass would say, a machined majority, but on the merits of the proposals themselves, those people with divers interests, scattered throughout the country in close touch with their constituents from week to week, see fit to support this Government. <Col N="1519" /> The only instrument in Deputy Lemass's hands is the instrument of the <i>Irish Press</i> and the instrument of his confident and truculent assertions that we are losing the confidence of the people.  Deputy Lemass stated that he was anxious that we should&mdash;to use that phrase to which I object&mdash;get a chance and he so advised, apparently privately, because I cannot trace it either in his public utterances or his public actions, that we should get that chance.</P>
    <P>We went over to London recently to negotiate a trade agreement on behalf of this country.  During our negotiations we were entitled to expect that we would get at least, if not co-operation, that co-operation which Deputy Lemass says he was privately giving to his supporters.  We were entitled to expect that we would get a charitable silence while we were negotiating on behalf of all sections of the people.  I do not intend to occupy the time of the House to-day with exposing in detail the manner in which the Party opposite and their political newspaper endeavoured to sabotage the efforts of an Irish Government on behalf of the Irish nation over in London when we were trying to do our best for all sections of the Irish people.  I will have an opportunity, I hope, before this Parliamentary session is over, to expose some of the lies for which somebody called &ldquo;a Dáil Reporter&rdquo; is responsible.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is this, that when Deputy Lemass asks us to get out, he is doing something which he wants from the point of view of his failing political Party and he is not expressing the views of the Irish people.  We have, for the first time in the history of this State, a Government formed in the way in which many people thought it should have been formed from the inception of this State.  We have here a Government, for the first time in history, representative of all sections of organised labour.  We have, for the first time in the history of this State, the working men and the working women given a chance, through their representatives, of taking part in the councils of the <Col N="1520" /> nation.  We have here, for the first time after many anxious years, representatives of the Republican Party, and it is a great joy and a great pleasure to me to be the head of a Government in which that Party is represented by my friend and colleague Deputy Seán MacBride.  We have the farmers represented, all sections of the farmers, and we have the much maligned representatives of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Government is a cross-section of the Irish people.  That is the Government that the leader of the Opposition said could not be formed and, if formed, could not last for six months. The six months are nearly up.  I have not so far prophesied anything, either as to the duration or the stability of this Government, although I have my own strong opinions on that; but I do venture to prophesy that this Government will last more than the six months that the people opposite said it would last.  I also want to assert this, that it is an intellectual joy to me to preside over a Cabinet in which there are such people as Deputy Seán MacBride, Deputy Everett, Deputy Norton, Deputy Blowick, Deputy Dr. Browne and my own colleagues with whom I have worked for over a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>That is a Cabinet that is going to produce results for the Irish people. That is a Cabinet with a policy.  I say here, realising that I must speak with restraint and a sense of responsibility, that, for the first time since 1922, this Cabinet will, by its policy and its actions, give some hope of bringing back to this country the six north-eastern counties of Ulster.  I must speak on that subject, as I say, with restraint and responsibility, but I do make that assertion with all the confidence that I have in me.  Anything that might be said over and above that might possibly damage the advances that have been made and I will, therefore, ask my friend, Deputy Con Lehane, to bear with me for that reason and for that reason alone if I do not answer one of the questions that he has put to me, with reference to making it clear that so long as the six north-eastern counties are occupied <Col N="1521" /> by British troops, we will not take part in any war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane, I think, knows my views on that.  I can say this much without, I think, impairing the national interest, that if, as Deputy de Valera says, there is an impending war, the interests of this country,&mdash;the interests of the six north-eastern counties in particular&mdash;the interests of Great Britain, the interests of the United States of America, the interests of Western Europe and the interests and maintenance of Christian principles, require and demand that there should be a united Ireland to face the menacing situation which may possibly develop in the next few years.</P>
    <P>We have, as I have indicated, a consistent, clear policy enunciated on every branch of social, financial, agricultural and industrial questions. Deputy Lemass said yesterday on my Estimate that we have no consistent policy on anything.  He spoke yesterday also on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce as if he were in the most complete agreement with the policy we have.  How does he square that with decency or honesty in debate?  How does he square that with the tone he adopted yesterday on my Estimate?  How does he reconcile that with the conduct which ought to be extracted from every Deputy in this House, to conform to dignified, decent standards of debate?</P>
    <P>When speaking of the proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Government if you like, to set up a committee to inquire into the necessity for a food subsidy, a subsidy on flour and bread, he sneered at one of the ablest men in this State, the Attorney-General, Mr. Cecil Lavery. There was a sneer on his face when he referred to the Attorney-General, as he said, being the chairman of this committee.  The Attorney-General, Mr. Lavery, was deliberately put upon that committee for the purpose of commanding, as it will command, the confidence of the people in the justice and impartiality and the searching nature of the inquiry which, it is hoped, will be made into the food subsidy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked why did we not tell the people that we were going to <Col N="1522" /> withdraw the food subsidy.  We did not tell the people that we were going to withdraw the food subsidy because we are not going to do it until we see that we can do it.  What we are going to do, if and when we can, is to take away some of the £10,000,000 subsidy put there by the last Government if the position emerges that some of the people engaged in these industries, the flour and milling industries, are getting too much profit at the expense of the consumer.  Then we will take it back, and that is what we want this committee for, to take that £10,000,000, all of it if we can, most of it if possible, some of it at all events, and still leave the people getting the same amount of bread at the same cheap price and utilising what we will save on that for the constructive proposals that this Government have in view.</P>
    <P>That is our policy on that matter and that is the policy we are going to be judged on by the people.  No sneers by Deputy Lemass, no truculence, of which he is such a past master, will get over that when the facts are elicited and when we come to be judged by the verdict of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and Deputy Major de Valera spoke about war.  Deputy Lemass asked was there any effort being made to minimise the dangers of the international situation, as and when they develop.  Deputy Con Lehane gave complete expression to my view this morning when he appealed to us in the Dáil and to public men generally not to foster or create a war phobia or a war psychosis, not to aggravate the natural fears of the people.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned we are going to plan on a hypothesis of peace. We intend to keep, and are keeping, a very wary eye on the war clouds that are hanging over Europe and most of the world, but we are not going to stultify our efforts or to atrophy our energies by doing what the people opposite want us to do, to dissipate our resources and energies in thinking about war, to add as Deputy de Valera, Junior, would have us, a match to the collection of turf mould up in the Phoenix Park collected by the last Government.  We believe that we <Col N="1523" /> must plan for peace, otherwise our energies will be atrophied and our results stultified, but we are doing everything possible to see that every resource in the world is tapped so that for peace, as well as for war, we shall have adequate supplies.</P>
    <P>We have not, as Deputy Lemass hinted or sneered at, taken the ration off bread even though the British have done so.  The British took the ration off bread, not because they were in any better supply position than we, but because the taking of the ration off bread in England would not result in any appreciable increase in demand. We have sufficient supplies here which would enable us to take the ration off bread were it not for certain other factors, unconnected with the supply of flour or bread.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputy Lemass is fully aware of these factors.  No doubt he is aware of the practice that would obtain if bread were taken off the ration, that flour, instead of being used for human consumption, would be used for feeding greyhounds and other animals that might be more useful than greyhounds are.  That situation is being carefully watched by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and when the position is clarified the ration will be taken off.  Deputy Lemass said nothing about the rationing in England of other essential foodstuffs, but he seems to think that, because we did not take the ration off bread, we were doing something that was reprehensible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass took a flight into financial and economic spheres.  He and others have charged us with niggardly economies and an austerity régime.  We have made it clear, or it should be clear to any person who will care to listen, that our economies are made for two purposes.  They are made, not merely for the sake of indulging in pettifogging, parsimonious frugalities, not for the purpose of indulging in economy for economy's sake, but in order to rescue this country from the hopeless position into which it was drifting as a result of the hopeless spendthrift policy of the last Government,&mdash;a matter that will form the <Col N="1524" /> subject of interesting reading in the course of a few months when we shall have an opportunity of presenting to the people the full history of the grandiose plans for building and other schemes prepared by the people opposite in a time of stringency and financial stress.  We effected economies for the purpose also of bringing down the cost of living, and to curb inflation.  I hope that Deputy Lemass has cleared his mind at last as to whether we are in an inflationary period, a disinflationary period or a deflationary period though in his assumption of economic knowledge, he appears to have ignored the real issues involved in these matters.</P>
    <P>The policy of this Government was two-fold.  We set ourselves a short-term task, the task of curbing the cost of living and of dealing with inflation. We set ourselves the long-term task of increasing the wealth of the State by increasing production and assisting the productivity of our agriculture and manufacturing industries.  For our short-term policy to deal with inflation and the cost of living, we took the line&mdash;and we took it confidently and we were right&mdash;that excessive Government expenditure such as was indulged in by the last Government was one of the contributory factors in inflation and keeping inflationary pressure going. We should like to have all these grand schemes at our disposal for the benefit of the country if we had the money and the circumstances were different. We should like to erect a new Parliament House, somewhere perhaps in the Phoenix Park or some place else.  We should like to have a broadcasting house, though not at the price which it is proposed to pay for it at the other side.  We should like to have a short-wave broadcasting station and a transatlantic air service plying between this country and America, but first things come first.</P>
    <P>I assert again that one of the great contributory factors in keeping up the cost of living and in maintaining inflationary pressure is excessive Government expenditure and overtaxation. We brought down taxation. We decreased Government expenditure to the minimum.  In order to stop inflationary <Col N="1525" /> pressure, we postponed every bit of expenditure on buildings of a certain type and other Government services that we could.  We asked the people to save for the same reason. We asked for their co-operation by not buying goods at the present high prices, in order to curb inflation, to arrest the rise in the cost of living, and to check that which Deputy Lemass so sneeringly referred to yesterday when he was talking of workers&mdash;a third round for increased wages.  We could not avoid that inflationary spiral if Deputy Lemass's policy were to be pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred in his speech yesterday to the mid-Victorian economic principles which were being implemented by the banks and which, he said, were expressed here as Government policy by the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Lemass referred to the late Lord Keynes as having revolutionised economic thought by his writings.  Deputy Lemass should have checked and verified his statement before he made it.  Lord Keynes, when he was writing of the matters referred to by Deputy Lemass, was dealing with a time when what he called &ldquo;a spendthrift economy&rdquo; was the proper kind of policy according to his economic theories, a time of depression, a time when Government expenditure was essential to encourage production and create employment.  That was what he called &ldquo;spendthrift economy&rdquo;. He was referring to the conditions which existed in 1932 when he wrote his book on the <i>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass forgot that Lord Keynes one of the greatest of economists, knew that his economic theories had to be adjusted and, if necessary, altered to fit new facts, altered and fitted to new situations.  Deputy Lemass told the House, whether deliberately or through ignorance, that the policy which Lord Keynes advocated for a time of depression and deflation in 1932 was the policy that we were saying was the proper policy in present circumstances.  Lord Keynes in 1940 adjusted his theories to the facts as they then existed in consequence of the war and he produced that new <Col N="1526" /> programme to deal with the new situation which he referred to in his book on <i>How to Pay for the War</i> as a policy of &ldquo;deferred savings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is the contrast to the mid-Victorian policy which Deputy Lemass told the House, either through ignorance or with deliberate intention to mislead, is the policy of our Minister for Finance.  The Minister's policy is not the policy that Lord Keynes stated was the policy for times of depression when it was necessary for a Government to spend money in order to increase employment.  Lord Keynes changed that when the times of inflationary pressure and inflation came. These, he said, were times for saving &mdash;for a policy of deferred savings and a policy of deferred spending.</P>
    <P>That is our policy.  That policy seemed perhaps a bit extreme when first enunciated.  It was a policy which was referred to by one Labour Cabinet Minister at the time, as a policy which impelled him to say that &ldquo;he would have no mucking about with the pennies of the poor&rdquo;, but that policy was put into operation subsequently during the war and during the so-called peace&mdash;a policy of deferred saving and deferred spending in Great Britain by the British Government. That is our policy, a policy of deferred spending by the Government on everything but essentials until times improve and inflationary conditions cease to obtain.  I suggest that Deputy Lemass should rid his mind of the confusion that obviously exists there and learn that what our policy is, is not a policy of deflation but a policy of disinflation. The Deputy asked a rhetorical question yesterday to the effect: &ldquo;How can you reconcile a policy of monetary deflation linked with a programme of full employment?&rdquo; Deputy Lemass is confused in his ideas.  He does not apparently know the difference between disinflation and deflation.  The policy of the Minister for Finance, and the policy of the Government, is a policy of disinflation, and that policy of disinflation is the policy that exists in England under the guidance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the very drastic <Col N="1527" /> steps that were taken last year in Great Britain to control inflation. Capital expenditure was cut by the British Budget on a vast scale last year, and it is admitted by many that the British Chancellor has succeeded, to a very large extent, in checking inflation as a result of the measures taken.  What has been the result?  It is that employment has not been affected as a result of the policy of disinflation carried out in England, a policy which we are endeavouring to carry out and the policy which Deputy Lemass said that it of necessity results in increased unemployment. Here is a quotation from <i>The Economist</i> in its issue of July 17th. Dealing with disinflation and its results, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There could be no clearer demonstration of this than the quite astonishing figures of unemployment for June.  On June 14th the total number of persons registered as unemployed was no more than 274,000 &mdash;actually 16,000 less than the number shown by the returns for May.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the answer to Deputy Lemass and to his rhetorical question yesterday.</P>

      <P>The numbers have increased but not as a result of our financial or economic policy.  They have increased perhaps for the reason that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave yesterday, and perhaps for the reason that they are the direct result of the <i>damnosa hereditas</i> that this Government took over from the last Government when they packed the <Col N="1528" /> Park with fuel of every kind, class and description, and encouraged unfortunate people to put their money into lorries and with their lorries to get employment from Fuel Importers, Limited.  When we came in we were faced with the conditions that the Party over there, if they had come back to power, would have been faced with, conditions created by them without foresight and without planning.</P>
      <P>Let me quote one last observation from another economic authority on this question of inflation and deflation. Professor Lionel Robbins who lectured in Dublin some months ago, writing in his book, <i>The Economic Problems in Peace and War</i>, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To remove inflationary tendencies is not to resort to deflation, i.e., to a contraction of money incomes.  We need a policy which will avoid both inflation and deflation of incomes and which will keep planned saving and planned investment in a proper relation of equality.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to occupy the time of the House on these matters of economic principles.  Deputy Lemass put himself forward as an economic authority; he mixed up deflation and disinflation, and he is now deflated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of other matters that Deputy Lemass referred to in his speech opening this debate yesterday on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition.  He referred to my broadcasts again.  I thank the Deputy for the compliment he paid me of listening to me.  I thank him, too, for the compliment he paid me when he made my statements the principal thesis of his speech.  &ldquo;Adequate food, decent housing and the provision of work&rdquo;&mdash; these were stated to be primary points of our policy.  They still are the primary points of the policy of this Government, but they are not the only points of policy of this Government.  Again, we are content to be judged on results. We have provided adequate food, and we hope to provide still more food, and better food, through the efforts of our Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Lemass said that we have no consistent policy.  We have this outstanding <Col N="1529" /> policy at all events, that we set out immediately we came in here to repair the almost irreparable damage that was done by Deputy Lemass in particular, and by his Government in general to the agricultural industry of this country.  That was our first and primary task, and that will always be in the forefront of our programme.  We have the greatest confidence in our Minister for Agriculture to carry out that programme with practical and beneficial results for all sections of our people.  Our land is the primary source of our wealth and all the people, of whatever class or rank in this society of ours, exist upon it, or derive their incomes from it, directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>The year 1947 was a red-letter one in Irish agriculture because in that year the number of cattle under one-year-old was the lowest in the present century.</P>

      <P>It was the result of the agricultural policy of the last Government. In 1947, the last year of the infamous reign of Fianna Fáil in this country, the last this country will ever see, the number of cattle under one-year-old was the lowest for a century. That was the result of the policy of the killing of calves, the result of that economic war from which this country has not yet recovered, but from which, please God, it will recover as a result of the agreement we made a few weeks ago with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>We were asked yesterday by Deputies what provision we were making for the future or what we were going to do for the people.  This is what we are going to do for the people.  We are going to give them a decent agricultural industry; we are going to build up, on the basis of that solid agricultural industry in this country, a prosperity that has never before been seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and the Minister for Industry and Commerce appear to have been at one yesterday on their policy in reference to industry and commerce. It took Deputy Lemass a long time to learn the lesson and he learned it as every one of the Opposition Ministers learned their lesson, not at their own expense, but at the expense of the unfortunate people of this country, that <Col N="1530" /> a prosperous agricultural industry was essential for a prosperous manufacturing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane asked me this morning to see that our policy would be so directed that an adequate number of houses would be provided and that we would provide work for our people and prevent them from going on the emigrant ships which were so lavishly provided and facilities for the passage of which were so lavishly provided by the last Government. My hope and the Government's hope is to do what Deputy Con Lehane wants us to do.  We want to find work for all our people.  I am proud to be working in this Government as its head, with Deputy Norton, Deputy Everett and the others, and with their co-operation.  I went as leader of a delegation to trade talks in London, after having consulted with the representatives of Labour, and I was fortified by the knowledge that I was looking after their interests and that they were co-operating with us.  That is what no Government of this country has ever been able to say before, and our strength and greatness comes from that knowledge.  We hope that a prosperity will be built up in this country, with the money from which housing shall be provided as well as work for all our people.  Deputy Cowan asked me the same question with regard to housing and work as Deputy Con Lehane did, and I can assure both Deputy Lehane and Deputy Cowan that the efforts of this Government are directed to those ends.  Deputy Murphy, the Minister for Local Government, has charge of that housing drive.  The present Minister for Local Government is a man who talks little but does a lot, and I know that he has such plans for housing as will achieve even such a success as Deputy Cowan hopes for.  We are not miracle workers and we took up a load of misery from Fianna Fáil when we came here.</P>
    <P>We took over a <i>damnosa hereditas</i>, the like of which no Government ever took over before, but I have no doubt that with the enthusiasm and the idealism of the present Ministers for Local Government and Public Health, <Col N="1531" /> with the backing of every member of this Government, with the backing of every member of every Party composing it, with the backing of every Independent Deputy in this House, this housing, which is so urgently required, will, in fact, be furnished for our people.  I think I can say to Deputy Cowan, and I am sure Deputy Lehane knows it from his long friendship with me, that from the years I was a Deputy in this House and from the associations of my late father with Dublin Corporation, I have a far deeper knowledge than many Deputies in this House, including Deputy Lemass, of our people's housing needs. The only people who came to our house in the old days were people who were looking for houses and they are still coming now when I am Taoiseach, Prime Minister of this country.  I know, I fully appreciate what they are suffering and I know how little was done for them by the last Government, but something is going to be done for them by this Government and any <Col N="1532" /> money, any legislation, which is necessary for the provision of houses or for work for our people, as long as I am head of this Government, will be provided.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to deal with many of the other matters which were referred to in the course of this discussion. Deputy Lemass says &ldquo;Get out&mdash; let this Government get out.&rdquo;  We will get out, as I said before, when we have achieved the purposes for which we were formed.  We do not, as Deputy Lemass so vulgarly said, hang on for place or power, office or patronage.  We are doing it, as I repeat again, in the interests, not of one section of our people, but of all sections of our people. I am confident and proud, as is each of my colleagues in this Government, that in our efforts to achieve prosperity for this country, and to bring about the unity of Ireland, we will have behind us an increasing measure of support from all sections of the Irish people.</P>

      <Col N="1535" /> There is power to borrow under the first sub-section of Section 2 and that is sufficient for the purposes but sub-section (4) is to make it mandatory that any moneys that are borrowed from the Government of the United States of America are to be placed to the credit of an account with the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is thought, in order to prevent any inflationary effect, that this money should not be allowed to go into free circulation all over the country but should be placed to the credit of an account of the controller and myself.</P>

      <P>I imagine that will be the ordinary way, yes.  The financing of this has not yet been gone into.  First of all, I have been advised, and I have stated with assurance, that there is power to borrow.  The general run of the machinery would be this&mdash; that dollars will be provided; they will be paid, say, in America to purchase goods for which dollars are required: the goods will come here; the goods will be sold here; the proceeds of the sale we do not propose to allow to get into general circulation, and, therefore, we have this scheme of placing them to the credit of an account.  Provision will have to be made for redemption of the dollars hereafter and the easiest way is that we would achieve as much credit as possible from the proceeds of the sale of the goods which have been paid for in dollars supplied by the United States and, eventually, when convertibility comes, the account will be paid by the moneys we have accumulated.</P>

      <P>Because that is a matter for detailed arrangement as to what is going to be done.  The only points that it is necessary to meet in the Appropriation Bill are&mdash;first, is there power to borrow?  &mdash;There is.  The second is, what is going to be done with, say, the moneys that accrue from the sale of the goods that come, say, from America, purchased by dollars? We suggest that it would not be right that these moneys should be in free circulation through the banks all over the country.  Therefore, we propose to have them credited in the Central Bank to an account that will be in my name.  Deputies are well aware that we must make good these borrowings eventually.  Therefore, we must make provision for that and, while the loan is outstanding, must also make provision for servicing of the loan.  If the Deputy will suggest what other way is proposed, I will listen to his suggestions, but this Bill only meets two points&mdash;(a) making it clear that there is power to borrow, and (b) making provision that these moneys will be placed in the Central Bank instead of circulating through the ordinary banks.  What is wrong with that?</P>

      <P>I understand the system outlined by the Minister for Finance now.  What is worrying me is accepting this loan at all from the United States.  I saw in the paper yesterday, I think, that the Government propose to borrow £5,000,000 worth of dollars from the United States for the coming three months.  That is borrowing at the rate of £20,000,000 worth of dollars per year.  For the nine months ending June, we were getting dollars from the British sterling area pool at the rate of about £20,000,000 worth of dollars a year&mdash;£14,000,000 worth for nine months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Exclusive of £2,000,000 for wheat in the event of our not getting Australian wheat.  Very well. That is at the rate of £16,000,000 worth of dollars for 12 months, so if we are to go on the first three months' drawings of this European recovery aid and make borrowings from the United <Col N="1538" /> States authorities, we are going to borrow, or procure in some fashion from the United States Government, £20,000,000 worth of dollars in the coming 12 months.  I would like the Minister for Finance to say if that is so.  It is proposed to borrow £20,000,000 worth of dollars, or accept that amount from the United States Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be at the rate of a little over 7,000,000 dollars per quarter, about £15,000,000 worth of dollars for the twelve months, if it goes on at that rate.  That was the rate at which we had been getting dollars from the sterling area pool, and we got those for pounds.  I think that was pretty well meeting the requirements that were absolutely essential for the economy of the country.  If we are going to borrow or get dollars directly from the United States Government and have no other means of getting £15,000,000 worth of dollars in the coming 12 months, does that mean we are going to get no dollars at all from the sterling area pool?</P>

      <P>Where are we going to be, if we have to borrow £15,000,000 worth of dollars this year?  That is what I would like to know.  On what terms?  Under this Bill, we are now giving the Minister power to borrow from America £15,000,000 worth of dollars, or thereabouts, or borrow very much more.  This country will have to repay those dollars according to the contract.  We cannot, like a lot of other countries, borrow this money with our tongues in our cheeks and afterwards depend on repudiation.  We are a small country.  We want to keep the friendship of the United States, and it is of the utmost importance that we enter into no contract for a loan or otherwise that we are not able to carry out to the letter of the contract.  The Minister might say, if he has any information, what the terms of the loan are&mdash;first of all, as to interest, and, secondly, as to repayment.  It was announced that we are going to borrow £5,000,000 worth of dollars.  I would like to know what the terms are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to include one clause in the contract&mdash; even though he has to pay a higher rate of interest for getting it in&mdash;that in a year in which the United States is not balancing its books with the rest of the world, is not buying&mdash;and by the term buying I mean to include investment or lending&mdash;as much as it is selling, in such a year not only the interest should be forgiven but the instalments should be wiped out for that year, since in such circumstances it is impossible for the world to repay America the amounts that are due on foot of these and all other loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a great mistake, indeed, for us to contract to pay America irrespective of whether or not America is allowing the world to repay her.  I hope that the Minister will go very far <Col N="1541" /> indeed, even extending the rate of interest he is prepared to pay, in order to get such a clause into the contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I propose is that there should be a clause in the loan agreement stating that in a year in which the United States does not buy as much from the rest of the world as it sells to it, the interest, and whatever the sinking fund is to be, would be forgiven by the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a contract in which there would be such a clause and you pay, let us say, 1½ per cent. interest, or a contract in which you could get the money for 1 per cent. without the clause.  I would rather pay 1½ per cent. for the loan with that clause in it than get the loan at 1 per cent.  with the clause out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise another matter on this Bill which I think is appropriate to it.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may issue out of the Central Fund a sum of £45,927,774 for the public services. I think that that issue should not be made until serious allegations touching the honour and probity of public servants and people connected with the Government which were made a short time ago by one of the members of the present Government are investigated.  Before the change of Government, the present Minister for External Affairs said that he had sent papers to the then Taoiseach alleging frauds in connection with Government contracts and breaches of rationing and price control Orders concerning, among others, some persons closely connected with the Government.  These allegations were made publicly.  The person who made them has since become a member of the Government. <Col N="1542" /> So far as I am aware, no investigation of the nature demanded by him has since been made.  Either these statements were true and that condition of affairs continues to exist with the connivance and the consent of the person who made these allegations, or else, on closer examination of the position by him, they have proven to be unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such investigation as the present Minister for External Affairs demanded.  There was, of course, a prosecution, but the facts then disclosed did not justify in any way the sweeping and serious statements made by Deputy MacBride, as he then was.  These statements were made during the election.  They were calculated to create in the public mind the impression that the then Administration was engaged in corrupt practices. The terms in which these allegations were made were carefully chosen.  They were chosen in such a way as to imply that there was intimate association between members of the then Government and the persons engaged in these frauds in connection with Government contracts and breaches of rationing and price control Orders.  Nothing which has appeared in the Press since the change of Government would warrant charges being made by a responsible person in these terms.  I understand there was a prosecution.  The extent of the offences disclosed in that prosecution, I am told, were not such as to justify the statements which were then made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you read the report of the prosecution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, because it escaped my notice.  The publication which was given to it was so slight that there was certainly nothing disclosed, so far as I am aware, which would show that there were frauds in connection with Government contracts.  There has been certainly nothing disclosed or anything which would indicate that the persons then charged with certain offences were closely connected with <Col N="1543" /> the Government.  I think that is a matter which would justify the House in hesitating to vote these moneys until they have a definite assurance from the Minister for Finance that there was no such widespread fraud or corruption as his colleague, the present Minister for External Affairs, alleged in February of this year to have existed.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I think I should make some reference.  This Vote provides money for the payment of salaries of Ministers.  In the course of the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Health, the Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) disclosed that an extraordinary state of affairs existed as between him as a public office holder on the one hand and the organisation which was responsible for securing his election to this House and his ultimate promotion to the Ministry on the other hand.  The Minister for Health, in winding up the debate on the Estimate, confessed that he pays over a large part of the salary which he draws from public funds to the treasurers of Clann na Poblachta. That, I think, has disclosed a position in relation to public offices which is most disquieting.</P>
      <P>In the old days, Tammany Hall, in its degeneration as a political organisation, was known to have exacted tribute, either in cash or service, from those whom it helped to place in public offices.  The inevitable consequence of that was that under the aegis of Tammany Hall, public office holders became unspeakably corrupt. We are, I believe, witnessing the introduction of that system here in our public life, because the disquieting disclosures which the Minister for Health has made as to the relations which exist between him as a public office holder on the one hand and the organisation of which he is a member on the other hand have been followed up by the disclosures which Deputy Cowan made as to the financial relations which exist between his former colleagues of Clann na Poblachta in Dáil Éireann and the executive of that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> It is to be apprehended from these that, in return for the support which the Deputies in question receive from the Clann na Poblachta election machine when they are seeking election, they have bound themselves to pay into the coffers of that organisation such moneys as they draw from the public purse by way of Parliamentary allowances and, in return, they receive from that organisation from time to time such sums as it sees fit to grant to them for services rendered.  The effect of this is, of course, to deprive the elected representatives of the people who are in that invidious position of freedom of action, of speech, and even of opinion.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Minister for Finance can certainly discuss the matter with his colleague and secure its alteration without legislation, because while the statute does fix the sum which will be paid to a Deputy by way of allowance, it does not fix the sum which may be paid to a Minister by way of salary.  The statute merely states that the salary to be paid to a Minister shall not exceed a certain figure.  Therefore, if the position is that the Minister for Health finds that for his labours a sum of, say, £1,700 is sufficient to remunerate him, then I suggest that the balance of the money payable to him ought to be allowed to remain in the Central Fund in the public purse instead of being drawn out of the public purse under false pretences and paid into the coffers of a political Party.</P>

What, for instance, is to prevent a similar contribution being exacted from a creature of the organisation who is made a judge of the High Court or of the Circuit Court or a district justice or a State solicitor or a country registrar?  Then when in due time the persons thus appointed jib at paying this tax&mdash;as, according to Deputy Cowan, some of his former colleagues are now doing&mdash;what is to prevent this liability being compounded by a promise that if they are permitted to retain the cash they will be prepared to render equivalent services which will be equally profitable to the organisation?</P>

      <P>The serious matter raised here to-day is this question of dollars and dollar availability and how dollars, if taken, are to be repaid.  The Minister for External Affairs went to Washington when this matter was first mooted and when it became an urgent one.  I do not think I am wrongly paraphrasing the statements made to him there when I repeat one phrase in particular; he was told by those associated with Marshall Aid arrangements in America that the whole of the Marshall Aid scheme was what could be described as &ldquo;taking a chance&rdquo; of sterling becoming convertible after European reconstruction had been accomplished.  The phrase &ldquo;taking a chance&rdquo; indicated that it was a gamble which the Americans were taking.  They were putting their money into European reconstruction, and they were doing that in the hope that they would recreate international trade and, in particular, they would restore the convertibility of sterling.  In that <Col N="1550" /> mood, even in the face of protests made by the Minister for External Affairs as to our position at the moment, they said that they were applying this aid in a broad way and with a full knowledge of our circumstances.  They said the whole success of the Marshall Aid scheme would be judged by whether or not by 1952 sterling had become freely convertible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the Act of Congress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is their attitude. Mr. Hoffman visited this country yesterday. He is the administrator of the European recovery plan.  He was at Shannon yesterday and the evening papers carried a few phrases from him. One does not, of course, tie a gentleman of Mr. Hoffman's importance to a statement he makes casually&mdash;and possibly without his having had time to consider the matter&mdash;to people who crowd around him at Shannon; but it is so much in line with what has already been said that I do not think I am doing him any wrong in quoting him.  He was asked why aid was given to this country by way of loan instead of grant.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would naturally prefer to give grants instead of loans to all countries.  The directive we have received from Congress limits us to giving grants to all countries which are deemed incapable of making repayment to the United States when exchange parity is re-established between the dollar and European currency.  The question as to whether this parity can be re-established is naturally bound up in whether the plan succeeds or fails.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the latest statement made on our territory by the administrator of the European recovery programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean there is nothing in this Act of Congress which establishes this administrator and gives this money in grant or in loan, allowing them to take repayment in nothing except dollars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Act which does not allow payment in anything except dollars.  With that in their minds' eye, these people have offered us dollars.  We have to put to them our position that we have not enough dollars to repay any loan given to us in dollars and their attitude is that &ldquo;the whole objective of the Marshall Plan is to ensure that by 1952, or thereabouts, we will be able to take sterling instead of dollars, because sterling will be convertible into dollars&rdquo;.  Nobody can say that we have misled the Americans.  More than anybody else we have made our position quite clear.  Notwithstanding that, they are pressing this loan on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this matter is tied up with the particular measure I have here, the Deputy has asked me about our position with regard to dollars.  We have certain dollar earnings.  They are there for whatever they are worth. Previously we drew dollars from what we call the sterling pool.  For these we paid sterling.  We got dollars in exchange.  The new agreement is <Col N="1552" /> exactly similar to that.  We are going to get dollars and we will put into the fund sterling in the hope, which the Americans have expressed more specifically than we have, that when 1952 comes sterling will be convertible into dollars and they will get repayment. What more can we do?  As far as the amounts are concerned our position is governed as set out in the phrase that I quoted from the financial agreement that has been made with England.  We must first draw on our own dollar earnings; secondly, under that agreement we must look for whatever maximum aid we can get from the European recovery programme.  That is our programme. In the background we still have recourse to the sterling dollar pool from which we can draw.  There are certain matters set out as a sort of limitation, but we are not precluded from it and up to a certain point we have a free right to draw&mdash;always keeping in mind that we have entered into an understanding with the United Kingdom that we shall bend all our efforts to getting dollars from the European recovery programme so as to minimise to the greatest possible extent our drawings on that dollar pool.</P>
    <P>I want now to ask the Deputy to go back and read what his colleague, Deputy Lemass, said at Letterkenny last September when he told the people that the situation with regard to the sterling dollar pool was such that all purchases from the United States might have to stop.  He went on to say that it was in our national interest to see that the reserves of the sterling dollar pool were kept as high as possible. That is a view we share and it was because we agreed with that second view ourselves that we made this arrangement.  That is an arrangement which we hope will give us not as full freedom to purchase from the United States as we would like, but a certain amount of freedom; in any event, while it is limited, and will have to be limited with regard to certain purchases, there is enough to go on with, we hope, in the intervening years. With regard to repayment, we will act honourably, as we have always done. We have disclosed our position in the most precise way to the Americans and <Col N="1553" /> they have agreed with our position. Their attitude is that it is pretty nearly more of a gamble from our side than it is from theirs.  We are ready to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat anxious about that word &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo;. It is a purely verbal matter.  It seems to me that there should be some definite indication.  Proceeds is a rather strange word to use there.  Is it the purchase of the loan or the sale of goods, or some other phrase of that sort?  Proceeds of the loan has a very definite meaning, I think&mdash;proceeds of any money borrowed.</P>
