      <P>Last night, I was dealing with our position as regards wheat. The policy of the last Government was to endeavour to get the people of this country, so to speak, wheat-minded, so that in case of war or in case our communications with the outside world might be cut off, we would have sufficient bread to feed our people.  For that purpose, during the years 1932 to 1939 we definitely paid more for wheat than the price at which it could be bought abroad.  We did that for a definite purpose.  The irresponsible attitude of the Minister when he came into office has brought about this year a definite reduction in the wheat acreage. There is no use in pretending that it has not.  If the seed does not go into the ground, the wheat will not be produced.  A very large proportion of the seed went to the millers.  The <Col N="192" /> Minister would have very little difficulty in finding out from his own Department the quantity of seed wheat that went back to the millers in 1947 and the quantity that went back in 1948.  He will find that his foolish statements have brought about a condition of affairs that I am sure he does not wish for any more than I do.  I do not want to see this country in need of wheat.  I do not want to see this country in need of bread.  That is, however, the Minister's job and I fear that his foolish statements will have repercussions.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out that the attitude of the Minister in giving us an uneconomic price for liquid milk will have definite reactions this winter in regard to the milk supply to the cities and towns.  I would like to point out in that respect that recently I had a letter from the Minister's Department in connection with six months' contracts.  If the Minister wants any information in connection with six months' contracts he has two means of getting it.  There is the Cork Milk Board under the control of his Department. There is the Minister for Local Government, who can tell him that the contracts for the mental hospitals, county hospitals, county homes and all other institutions are six months' contracts and no more.  He has a very simple way of finding out what he requires to know and it is not my duty to point out to the Minister or his Department the way in which they should get that information.  They are long enough in the job to know for themselves.</P>
      <P>We have, very definitely, an uneconomic price for milk.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he has brought in a pretty steep reduction in the price of cattle.  As soon as he effects non-competition in the Dublin market, the price of cattle is bound to fall.  I have given the difference as stated by the Minister in this House between the price of cattle sold in Britain last year and the price of cattle sold here&mdash;£10 a head.</P>

      <P>All right.  On the beet question, and the Minister's attitude in regard to beet, which I indicated last night, I would like to point out to the House and particularly to Deputy Cogan that up to the moment it is the only phase of the industry on which we have been met with a fair face in regard to agricultural costings.  In every industry the cost of production plus profit basis is acknowledged and recognised.  It is not recognised here in agriculture.  Seeing the wild rush made by the Clann na Talmhan Party after my motions which I put down two years ago, I thought that the least price they would have extracted for giving us that Minister for Agriculture was that we would have some costings board here before which the agricultural community could appear and get costings on a production plus profit basis, the same as every other industry in the State.  I expected it.  I have dealt with the costings we have got in connection with milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on beet costings, not milk costings.  I made a passing reference to the fact that we had got our milk costings.  We are at present engaged with the sugar company in getting out the cost of production of beet.  There are something like 400 farmers engaged in that job.  We are working under a guarantee from the sugar company that we will get that cost of production, plus a decent profit added on for our beet growers.  All praise to the general manager of the sugar company and the company itself, they are the first people to acknowledge the right of the farmers to the cost of production plus profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's attitude towards all that?  I quoted here last night his attitude towards beet, as given by him here on 6th of June, 1946. Are we, on behalf of the agricultural community, to spend a couple of thousand pounds in beet costings and put 300 or 400 of our farmers to the trouble and expense of preparing those costings, giving the time and labour to them, to hand it all over, from the so-called representatives of agriculture in this House, to a Minister who has declared that his job is to blow up the <Col N="195" /> beet factories, or that they should be blown up?  That is the condition of affairs which, unfortunately, has been brought about, with a very definite set purpose.  I gave last night the Minister's opinion of those people who he stated &ldquo;had gone from one foolish thing to another&rdquo; until they crowned all their foolish things by making Deputy James Dillon Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if it is the Minister's intention to set up a costings board, to give the farmer some hope of getting his cost of production plus profit, the same as every other industry is entitled to and has got. That is a fair question.  We know where we stand at the moment in connection with milk&mdash;that every five shillings you put on to the agricultural labourer's wage represents a halfpenny a gallon on milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the various aspects of this matter.  I definitely am not repeating when I ask the Minister here if he is prepared to set up a costings board.  According to my notes here, that is a thing I have not dealt with yet.  I have given the results of costings committees and have stated what is desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to bacon, I suggest to this Minister, who is so anxious that farm <Col N="196" /> labourers' wages be increased, who is willing to give the farm labourer a better wage, who says that if he is there for five years and if the farm labourer is not as well paid as his comrade in the city, he will have failed in his job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hard to interpret the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise that, since I am put to it, I will deal with it before I am finished.  Since they want it, they can have it; and I will not be out of order, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the Chair to judge.  The Deputy is on a wide range this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If these people draw me out, I cannot help it.  The Minister says it is his policy to make the farmer better off and to increase the prices he is going to get; but, according to Deputy Fagan, he has reduced the price of bacon by 12/- per cwt., and he met the bacon curers and told them to bring down the price of that bacon from 210/- to 190/- or, in other words, by £2 each in the price of a pig.  That has been the Minister's contribution towards increasing production of bacon plus the increase in the price for maize.  Pigs and politics are mixed in Cork.  Immediately after each general election, premiums for boars are given out on the basis of the number of election agents, and each fellow gets a premium for a boar.  I am glad that Deputy McAuliffe does not deny that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am treating it seriously. I think it will be admitted that it is a very serious matter that money voted here for premiums for boars is used for <Col N="197" /> paying election agents down the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>

      <P>If the cap fits anyone let him wear it.  I am not anxious to take up the time of the House.  Deputy P. D. Lehane, a member of the Clann na Talmhan Party, speaking here in the Budget debate on freightage charges in connection with beet, said that I had made no attempt last year to go to Córas Iompair Éireann and get these freightage charges reduced.  When Deputy Lehane made that statement he knew very well that it was not correct because he went with me to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>I will take some other opportunity of bringing it up in this House and of correcting it.  Let there be no doubt about that.  I do not intend to delay the House further.  I have given the facts as I know them. My extreme sympathy goes not to the Minister but to those unfortunates who have to deal with him.  I pity the <Col N="198" /> Deputies opposite.  I do that sincerely. Imagine the mind of the Taoiseach, how the poor man gets up in the morning in fear and trembling as to what he may find the Minister has said the night before.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies opposite want me to continue for a couple of hours I am ready to oblige them.  We as an agricultural community are brought up against this position&mdash; Deputy Keane alluded to it last night and Deputy McAuliffe made a few little allusions to it to-day.  It is in connection with a circular which was sent out from the Minister's Department to the Cork County Committee of Agriculture in relation to a week's holidays for farm labourers and a half-day each week.  During my whole lifetime I have always been anxious that the agricultural labourer would be placed in at least as good a position as his brother in the town or the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of affairs that we find is this, that labour is paid a wage that renders it practically impossible for us to hold any decent worker on the land.  The fault for that is that the prices for agricultural products are such that they will not enable us to pay a better wage.  I am as anxious as any man in the country to see the farm labourer get a week's holidays, as well as others, and his half-day on a Saturday if that can be managed by any means.</P>

      <P>This day is generally a field day for farmers, but unfortunately the farmers in the country will not think this a field day for them, because we have had enough Parliamentary <Col N="201" /> nonsense to sicken the poorest farmer.  The city mentality may think about &ldquo;gombeen farmers&rdquo;, but farmers, who are nothing more than &ldquo;gombeen&rdquo; men, have spoken in this House.  In the phase of agriculture over the last 25 years we have seen a good deal of compulsion.  We have had compulsion from Fianna Fáil for the last 15 years, and agriculture is now in the worst position it has ever been in, but we have now a new Minister with a new outlook, a &ldquo;new look&rdquo; and a voluntary period will be tried out now.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that if our farmers are harnessed to a voluntary system of agriculture they will take off their coats and work as they ought to work. I know they will, and I know that our farmers will be the better for not having compulsion.  I listened to Deputy Smith for the past two days and I am sorry to see such a despicable attitude on the part of an ex-Minister.  You would think he would act as a respectable man considering the responsibility he has held on his shoulders, but the play-acting, tomboy tirade, which he tried to put across to the new Minister was the mean, low and cowardly work of a bully.  Deputy Smith is not fit to wipe the boots of the man he was trying to put it across and Deputy Smith knew it.  It was nothing more than a fit of jealousy, the case of a small man jealous of a big man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the new Government came into power I am happy to say that the farmers have got a new trade agreement across the water, which, if it is worked in the proper spirit, will bring immense benefits to the agricultural community.  The Minister has done his part and it is now up to the farmers to do their part.  The farmers have the ball at their feet and I hope they play ball.  I would ask the Minister in the next few years to try to bring about a better spirit among the farming community, a spirit of co-operation. Co-operation is a thing which we certainly lack in this country. The farmers have never understood co-operation.  If they had we would have a far greater output than we have at the moment.  Without co-operation among our farmers we will not get that output.  Each farmer <Col N="202" /> is an individualist who tries to pull his own way.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Fagan say that we would never have co-operation from our farmers, but that is wrong.  I have tried it in my own parish with six farmers, well-picked men, middle-class farmers, and it worked immensely well. We started off by co-operating to buy a reaper and binder.  We worked it for a few years and got our crops cut on time.  We loaned it out and got a nice income from it.  We then bought an oats sower, a grass seeds sower and a sprayer.  We never had a hitch over six or seven years.  It changed our agriculture immensely and we have now up-to-date methods where before we had lackadaisical methods or no methods at all.  What we did in a small way in the parish could be done over the whole country.  With the goodwill of a few men at the top we could get an immense amount of co-operation. I know that a crank here and there can do a great deal of harm, but it is the man at the top who really matters.</P>
    <P>What I did not like about the Fianna Fáil policy for the past 15 years was the way they broke the manly spirit of our farmers.  They spent all their time trying to get our farmers and the farm labourers into the hollow of their hand. Then they knocked them down, trampled on them and wiped their boots on them.  When they had them as serfs they decided to raise them up and give them little sops now and again.  That is not the spirit that will raise agriculture in this country. Farmers are decent and noble men if you let them alone, but they are hardly ever let alone.  What I like about the new Minister is that spirit of his that will lead the farmers to the independent position they had in the past.  Let them fend for themselves.  If farmers are let fend for themselves they will do their work and do it well.</P>
    <P>Up to now farmers and farm labourers were only political suckers. They had to look to what way the wind was going to blow next.  They were afraid if De Valera came into power again they would get it in the neck, but I am glad to say that De Valera is out. A new look has come in.  The farmers <Col N="203" /> can raise their heads and there is no doom hanging over their heads now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Minister at the moment has his hands full as he has a good deal of rings to burst. He has the manure rings to tackle and I know he will tackle them; he has tackled the bacon ring and broken it and he has to tackle the flour ring and the cattle ring.  There is a cattle ring at the moment in our fairs and markets.  Not alone that, but there is a ring in connection with the buying of foreign cattle, a dirty mean ring who keep things to themselves and keep everybody else in the cattle business out in the cold.  I ask the Minister to break that ring and, if possible, change many of the men who were appointed cattle buyers in the past because they were nothing more than political hacks put there for a certain purpose and they carried on in a mean way.  One man would play into another man's hands and decent men were kept out and could not get to sell their cattle. I hope the Minister will tackle those rings and break them.</P>
      <P>All the phases of agriculture have been pretty well debated.  I come from a county where we have many phases of agriculture.  We have the small farmer and we have the large rancher and now we have the milk business starting in a large way.  All these phases of agriculture could co-operate without any harm to each other.  Each man should take off his coat and mind his own business.  We are told that farmers are down and out.  The poor mouth is always made about farmers. I do not hold that the farmer is down and out.  He will never be down and out.  He has carried on for hundreds of years in bad and good times.  The farmer who takes off his coat and works is always able to survive.  He may go down to rock bottom, but he will come up again.  It is the &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; farmer who brought about the slump in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of milk production was very fully debated.  So far as my <Col N="204" /> county is concerned, the small and middle-class farmers are getting into the milk business.  I asked several of them how they were getting on and they told me that they were doing exceedingly well, that they were doubling their stock every year.  Some of them who started with three or four cows have now 50 or 60.  They all tell me that they are doing well.  They would not go into the business if they thought they would not make money. Of course every man will fight for a bigger price.</P>
    <P>Those who have to milk cows have a hard time, of course, but, at the same time, if they worked in a proper spirit for the last few months instead of going on strike, they would be better off.  Last Christmas some of these people held a meeting and wanted to go on strike, but the principal leaders said: &ldquo;Oh, no, we would embarrass the Government&rdquo;.  A few months afterwards there was a change of Government and another meeting was held and they said they would go out on strike.  The instigator of that strike was Deputy Smith, the former Minister. They would not embarrass Deputy Smith a few months ago. These are things which I should like to see exposed.  The Minister should stick his heels in the ground, because he has the majority of the people behind him.  All I want the Minister to do is to see that fair and reasonable prices and wages are paid and a proper spirit created.  In that way we will have an upward trend in this country and our farmers will be in a free and independent position.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to focus attention on the question of industrial tariffs.  With the industrial tariffs we have at present we shall never be able to put the agricultural worker in the position of the town worker.  As I said last year, the small boy in the town making the leg of a chair or a piano is able to earn £6 or £8 or £10 a week, while the agricultural worker, who is producing much-needed food for the people, gets £2 10s. 0d.  That matter will have to be tackled.  The Minister will have to see that those who have high industrial tariffs behind them do not carry on as they are carrying on at <Col N="205" /> present.  I know some of these men in my own county who are enjoying these tariffs and they are able to tell me that they have so much money they do not know what to do with it.</P>

      <P>Farmers will have to do a good deal to help the Minister in order to put agriculture where it should be.  We are not getting the output from the majority of the farmers or the workers which we got in the past.  They are not doing as their forefathers did. They would be far better off if they did. So far as my county is concerned, one of the things I cannot understand is that the larger the landholders the faster they are selling out.  In the last four or five years nearly all those with 300 or 400 acres of land in County Meath have sold out and new people from Great Britain, India, and other countries are coming in here and taking over the land which these men left. What is wrong with these people that they cannot live on 300 or 400 acres of the best land in the County Meath? There should be an inquiry into that because there must be something wrong.  I think I can put my finger on what is wrong.  Most of these people are living beyond their means.  They are having a royal time.  They have not only one motor car, but two or three.  They attend every race meeting and sports meeting in the country and the land is left to fend for itself with a herd and a dog.  That is not farming.  It may provide pleasure for these people, but it is not good for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to try to find out why these people whom we thought were wealthy are selling out.  I know that if I had 100 acres I would not give two hoots about anything.  I would have a royal time, but I would mind my business.  On the other hand, the men with 40 or 50 acres of land are fixed units and they are doing well. The fact is that the man who minds <Col N="206" /> his business will always be able to carry on.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal about cattle prices and we are all glad to see that good prices are being paid.  It would, however, be far better if cattle prices were not quite so high.  Most of the people who are doing well in the cattle line are ranchers and are going out of tillage.  That is not good for the country.  I should like to see a mixed tillage policy carried out in the country.  The large landholders should not go completely out of tillage.  They should remain in tillage so as to give employment and not go back to the herd and the dog.  If they do, they are going to have endless trouble.  I do not blame the small uneconomic landowners who live near one of these people for having a grievance.  They see him having that grand time.  He has to give no employment except to keep a herd and a dog there and the cattle are sent to the market in Britain and fetch good prices.  They will say to themselves: &ldquo;This fellow is well off and he has not to work hard while we are here tilling with our horses and ploughs from morning till night and we are barely able to scrape a living.&rdquo; Therefore, I would urge upon the Minister that we need a good mixed tillage policy for this country.  I do not agree that there should be any compulsion about it because I am satisfied that there is no need for compulsion.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the Minister to make a tour of the country and discuss matters with the people in the different districts.  He should do as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government have been doing in the last few months.  The Minister for Local Government paid a visit to County Meath last Monday.  Many of the people there did not want to see him but when he came they were highly pleased with him.  He gave us an outline of what he wanted and he showed his form.  He impressed all the officials of the county council of that county as a man of business.  If the Minister for Agriculture were to do likewise and meet the farmers and agricultural workers it would do an immense amount of good.  It would give them <Col N="207" /> strength, courage and confidence, and it would bring him into closer contact with them.  I would urge upon the Minister to make that tour when he can spare the time.</P>
    <P>While he is on that tour he should break the many rings that require to be broken.  Those rings have our farmers in a grip that is unnatural and unfair.  I would ask him also to endeavour to bring about a better cooperative system amongst our people by getting a better market in the cities for agricultural produce.  A vast amount of the produce of our farms never reaches the market because there are no marketing facilities whatever. If the Minister could bring about a proper spirit in that connection by the centralisation of marketing facilities it would be a great help.  In that way a lot of farm produce which cannot be sold would be sold and there would be a good deal of extra money going into the farmers' homes.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with our fairs.  There are far too many middlemen, tanglers, tricksters and so forth knocking around at them.  They can come to our fairs in large hired motor cars.  They can stay in big hotels and slip off with £20, £30 or £40 in their pockets after a few hours' trickstering here and there.  I am satisfied that many decent farmers in the country have it put across them before they even reach the fairs at all.  These fellows are in a ring.  One fellow will bid a certain price and he will pass it on to the next fellow who will bid a slightly lower price while a third will bid a few bob higher and get the animal.  The result is that the unfortunate farmer does not know where he stands at all.  I want to tell the Minister that those rings are the friends of the John Browns who got the cattle licences through political means.  They are working all over the country to-day.  For that reason the Minister should investigate salesmanship.  Those farmers who are being imposed upon now should be able to sell their cattle by auction and get a fair price.  The fellows who are imposing on the farmers are a dirty, mean, low crowd. Of course not all of them are bad. <Col N="208" /> Some of them are making a living out of it.  However, many of them have backhand methods.  They are trying to make big money at the expense of the poor backward farmer who does not know very much about what is going on at the fairs or markets.  The Minister is a man of strong will, strong words and firm resolution.  When he sets his course he will not be diverted from it.  If he sets his course in this connection he will have, not 90 per cent, but 100 per cent. of the farmers behind him.  Of course, there will be a good percentage of the playboys against him but he does not worry about that.</P>

      <P>A number of the agricultural farmers in County Dublin who have spent a lot of money on agricultural machinery are rather disturbed with the present Minister's policy.  I represent a constituency in which there was a number of farmers before compulsory tillage began and they will still be there when compulsory tillage has gone.  A number of enterprising farmers have purchased a lot of agricultural machinery and their position at the moment is that they really do not know what to do.  They would like to carry on, of course, with extensive agriculture.  They are good employers. I should like the Minister to make a statement as to how he is going to protect this particular type of farmer who definitely wants to carry on agriculture and even grow wheat.</P>

      <P>I am speaking generally now.  Another point in which I am very interested in regard to the agricultural farmer&mdash;and especially the farmer in County Dublin&mdash;is the question of labour.  Many of these farmers employ a lot of labour.  If the agricultural industry is going to go down it means that we are going to have a lot of unemployment.  We have heard from time to time all the happy ejaculations that have been made from the Government benches with reference to rural Ireland.  Now we are in the position where we have an opportunity of developing that agricultural industry a good deal more because manures are becoming more plentiful.  The fact that manures are coming in for the farmers has been well spoken of.  I do not wish to delay too long on that particular subject.  A number of the farmers in County Dublin, however, have fairly fertile lands.  As a result, of course, of being near the city they possibly have a better opportunity of manuring their land than other farmers down the country.  The fact remains that all the artificial manure that can be obtained will be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to deal with the dairy farmers of County Dublin.  Some time ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture if he would concede a certain privilege to the dairy farmers.  I realised that a number of dairy farmers were going out of business.  I would ask the Minister to make one concession. Where dairy farmers ask for exemption under the compulsory tillage or ask for permission to keep more land under grass their representations should be sympathetically considered.  When representations were made on this matter the Minister said the law is the law.  That was not very encouraging. The dairy farmers in County Dublin have considerable expenses.  They have <Col N="210" /> a good deal with which to contend in their particular line of business.  They must keep their premises modernised; they are constantly under inspection.  I would like to see the dairy farmers of County Dublin in a position to pay more to their agricultural workers.  In that respect I would even like to see the industry subsidised.  I do not say that milk should be dearer, but I do know these dairy farmers have certain problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Madden made a very good case for the farmers last night.  It was pleasant to listen to him because he seemed to have a familiar knowledge of the industry.  Deputy Madden represents County Limerick.  In that county they are dealing with dairies; in County Dublin they are dealing direct with the consumer.  Dairying is one of our principal industries and it is one of the very few in which we do not have to import some of our requirements.</P>

      <P>When the dairying farmers make representations to the Minister I want him to go into the pros and cons of the various points put before him.  As Deputy Madden said last night when the previous Minister for Agriculture raised the price of milk by 2d. per gallon that was a definite encouragement to dairy farmers all over the country to keep their herds.  I am sure that practically everybody in the country would prefer to pay a little more for butter if they could get more butter, rather than to pay less, as they are doing at the present time, and get less butter.  If the industry is going down the Minister should <Col N="211" /> seriously consider subsidising it.  That is the point I want to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. That was done by the Fianna Fáil Government. When dairy farmers make representations to the Minister for exemption under compulsory tillage, in order that they may have more grassland or more land under hay for their cows, the Minister should sympathetically and favourably consider their representations in that respect.  These dairy farmers are an important section of the community.  Everybody from the child to the adult is dependent on milk.  That industry must be encouraged. I do not want the Minister to quote again &ldquo;the law is the law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is another type of industry in County Dublin to which consideration should be given.  That is the market gardener and the farmer who grows vegetables on a fairly large scale. Under the Fianna Fáil régime the man who went in for the growing of vegetables was assured of success and prosperity, because he got a fair price for his vegetables.  During the emergency he had difficulties to contend with in regard to seeds and fertilisers, but his representations in these matters were always sympathetically considered by the Fianna Fáil Government. I want the Minister to take steps to ensure that foreign competition will not militate against market gardening at home.  In dealing with vegetables, I include in that category both soft and hard fruits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the potato end of it only.  Will the Minister allow me to make my point?  I did not interrupt the Minister when he was speaking.  I refer now to the importation of tomatoes. As a result of our much despised Fianna Fáil policy again, we had succeeded in encouraging our people to go in successfully for the growing of tomatoes in County Dublin and the adjoining counties.  I think these growers <Col N="212" /> should be protected against unfair competition.  Tomatoes can be grown in other countries much more successfully than here because of warmer climates.  They come to maturity much more quickly than the crop does here. I do not say that our tomatoes should be too expensive for the consumer here, but I do say there should be adequate protection.</P>
      <P>There is one further point to which I want to refer in that connection.  It does not come actually within the purview of the Minister for Agriculture but it is germane to the tomato industry. Some of the tomato growers have an insufficient water supply.  Where there is no water laid on in a district I would ask the Minister to consider making a grant available for the sinking of a pump to serve six, eight or ten tomato houses.  That would be a considerable benefit to these people.  The industry in its initial stages is an expensive one for them because it calls for a fairly big capital outlay in the erection of glasshouses and so on.  In Rush at the present time there is a grave shortage of water and the people who go in for tomato cultivation there have to carry water quite a long distance.  I have already raised this matter by way of Parliamentary Question.  I know the problem is a fairly difficult one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am content with that.  With regard to fruit, there is not enough fruit in this country and I would appeal to the Minister to encourage our fruit farmers in County Dublin and elsewhere through the medium of the county committees of agriculture.  In reply, I would like the Minister to tell us what encouragement he will give to these fruit farmers. There is a future in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important industry is the poultry industry.  Here, I want to compliment the Minister on his ability to make the hens lay twice every day when he had only been a month in office.  That was on his own statement. The position is rather serious as far as the poultry industry is concerned.  We have a number of stations in County <Col N="213" /> Dublin which are severely handicapped through lack of land.  I have discussed this matter both with the present Minister for Agriculture and with his predecessor.  I would impress upon the Minister that he should use his good offices with the Minister for Lands to make more land available to these people in the poultry industry.</P>
    <P>I was interested in one case in my own parish.  A lady there was anxious to develop her poultry farm, but she had not enough land.  She was a great asset to the community, but apparently it is not the policy of the Land Commission to give land in such cases.  I do not say that because she is a lady the Land Commission would not give her land, but I do not think it has been the policy to do so.  We have now entered into a poultry scheme in a big way and it is intended that it should be developed, following the work done by the previous Minister.  The present Minister will, I hope, carry on the previous Minister's good work in that line.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, where the case is definitely justified, to give priority to any enterprising poultry stations, the owners of which have not sufficient land.  It is an industry that we should develop and, if the Minister intends to carry out the work he has promised to carry out, I am sure he will have no objection to making recommendations to the Minister for Lands to give people who need additional land an opportunity of properly developing their poultry industry.  I would like the Minister also to state what guarantee he has of feeding stuffs for those poultry stations.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects that I would like to discuss on this Vote, including grasslands, ranchers and cattle and sheep rearing.  There are many types of farmers in my constituency.  Has the Minister seriously considered how he will increase the sheep population?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to make any suggestion; I am asking the Minister, because anything I suggest would be wrong.  I heard the Minister some time ago saying that the reason <Col N="214" /> the sheep population had gone down was because of the increased tillage. It is agreed that some farmers might have to get rid of sheep on account of increased tillage, but in the very severe winter we had in 1947 thousands of sheep died all over the country and created a problem for the people on the hillsides.  They lost stock and it will be years before they can recover. The previous Minister very kindly gave a loan, to be paid back in four years, to help those farmers.  That loan was very good and it has been availed of by a number of farmers, but there are others who said, when they discovered they had to get two securities for the loan, that they were not agreeable to that course.  A number then in the sheep-rearing line in a big way have no sheep at all now.  I had to make representations to the local authority last year to get relief work for some of these people.  Another Deputy accompanied me in order to try to get relief work in the Dublin Mountains for people who suffered serious losses. They lost their livelihood and all the stock they possessed.  I am sure the Minister will give that matter serious consideration.</P>
      <P>One of the things that is disturbing most of my area is a statement that was made by the Minister.  I do not know whether he means it that way or not, but it has been interpreted that he has ostracised the horse, that the horse is an animal to be used just when you can get nothing else.  In County Dublin we have a considerable number of farms of less than five acres.  The Minister speaks of mechanisation.  Are we to judge by the Minister's statement that the rearing of horses in the future will be largely discontinued and that the farmer who is breeding horses, if he is to take the Minister's advice, will get out of that as soon as possible? In County Dublin there are 5,241 holdings not exceeding five acres.</P>

      <P>In County Dublin we have 653 farms exceeding five but not exceeding ten acres.  We have 369 <Col N="215" /> farms exceeding ten acres but not exceeding 15 and we have 760 farms exceeding 15 acres but not exceeding 30. There are numbers of small farmers who definitely depend on horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>How many horses could you keep on a five-acre farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our small farmers definitely depend on horses and, according to the Minister, he will have no regard in the future for the horse&mdash;he just wants full mechanisation. If he can have that on these small farms, very well, but he should clarify the position.  He should let us know if he needs horses for the national stud.  Horses have not been a bad asset in the past and they have held up our reputation in other countries. I do not think the Minister should be uncharitable to the horse. The horse suited us during the emergency. The international horizon is not so very clear or peaceful and I think the Minister would be wise not to introduce mechanisation at the expense of the horse.  On numbers of large farms they could not possibly have carried on without agricultural machinery, but that does not mean that we could dispense with the horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer for a moment to the much-dreaded inspector to whom the Minister was so uncharitable. In County Dublin, of course, there were very few defaulters under the tillage scheme, but I must say that any inspectors that I knew in County Dublin during the compulsory tillage campaign were ordinary decent men. They visited the farmers, not alone for the purposes of inspection, but in an advisory capacity.  They pointed out to the farmer his obligations to himself and to the community, and how essential it was that food should be produced during the time of crisis. These inspectors were, as I have said, decent men, and furthermore they were psychologists.  They knew how to approach a problem and how to treat it.  There has been a terrible lot of eyewash carried on in connection with the compulsory tillage campaign or, to use the Minister's own phrase, a lot of &ldquo;codology&rdquo;.  The Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="216" /> did no more in enforcing the tillage campaign than the Minister for Agriculture would have done if he were in office at that time.  They had to face the problem of producing food for the people.  It is very easy for the Minister now, when he comes in after the time of crisis has passed, to throw stones at his predecessor and at the inspectors who went around the country during the war and did their work, very diplomatically, as I think.  As a matter of fact, I think they should be complimented on the manner in which they carried out their duties.  There were very few farmers in County Dublin who had to be dealt with by these inspectors, but such as there were, were treated very diplomatically, courteously and efficiently by the inspectors. It is all &ldquo;codology&rdquo; to say that no inspector should go on any man's land until he is asked to do so by the farmer.  I was bred, born and reared, and possibly starved, on a farm and the Minister knows that there is no farmer who is going to send for an inspector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should he be invaded by an inspector any more than anybody else in this country, if he does not want the inspector to visit him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

      <P>Does the Minister not know blessed well that it was in the national interest that the Government should see that the people of this country would not starve during the war?  I have great admiration for the Minister in certain matters, but when he carries on this eyewash I do not think he is really wise.  Nobody can gainsay that these inspectors went around the country in the national interest and not merely because they were asked to do so by the Minister. They went round to ensure that there would be sufficient food for our people. It is very easy to talk now when the battle is over and to say what fort we should have taken first.  Listening to the way in which these men are spoken of, one would imagine that they were criminals like the Black-and-Tans who came in here.  If any farmer had any grievance against them or if he were insulted in any way, he had the right to report them to the authorities.</P>

      <P>It is very easy again for the Minister for Agriculture and his associates to come along, now that seeds and manures are no longer in short supply, to deal with the poultry industry, the pig industry, the cattle industry and all the other aspects of agriculture.  The Minister knows that we in this country were put to the pin of our collar to feed human beings during the war.  I would have much greater respect for the Minister and would be more anxious to co-operate with him, if he would desist from carrying on the misrepresentation in which he indulges from time to time.</P>
      <P>Again I heard allegations in this House with reference to the previous Minister to the effect that there were 22,000 letters unopened in his Department. Candidly I do not believe that, because if that were so, it would be a reflection in the first place upon all the civil servants in that office.  If that were the position there are plenty of capable people who are idle and who could assist at that work whom the Minister should have brought in to clear off the arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that there has been a hold-up in the farm improvements scheme from March to July.  A large number of farmers took advantage of that <Col N="218" /> scheme and they would be still more anxious to avail of it had this hold-up not taken place.  The previous Minister gave every encouragement to the farmers in that way.  The farm buildings scheme was another very essential scheme.  It is, I suggest, essential to have cattle properly housed if we are to have healthy herds.  The Minister knows very well the very high percentage of tuberculosis that exists among cattle in this country.  It is, therefore, essential that farmers should be encouraged to provide proper housing accommodation for their cattle.  The farm buildings scheme was a very good gesture on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I am asking the Minister why it has been put in abeyance.  Why does the Minister, when he is asked about these things, blame his predecessor? Possibly the Minister for Finance is not giving him any money to carry on this scheme.  If that is so, I deplore it and I think that the Minister should take every step to have the scheme again put into operation as quickly as possible.  The Minister knows that very many farm buildings are hopelessly inadequate and in very bad condition.</P>

      <P>In connection with the farm schemes, would it be possible for the Minister to consider joining with the Department of Lands in regard to the provision of good drinking water for our cattle? There are a number of diseases amongst cattle which are attributable to a great extent to bad water.  There was a Deputy here some years ago who spoke continually on this point, and I agree with him, because I have seen cattle with various diseases contracted through drinking bad water.  In some cases, cattle have to depend for drinking water on drains which become stagnant in summer time, and, as a result, they contract various diseases which react adversely on milk production and beef production, and I would urge that the Minister should do something in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>A depressed agriculture is a serious problem for farmers and those engaged on the land but a more serious problem for those living in the cities and towns.  Everybody will agree that, unless we have a prosperous agricultural community, who are consumers as well as producers, there is very little hope of any kind of prosperity, peace or happiness in city and town life.</P>
      <P>With regard to the supply of milk, during the past couple of years it was difficult to get milk, even at a price, in Cork, and it is little use for me to have a pound in my pocket if I cannot get milk or butter.  It would be much more satisfactory that we should have butter, even if we have to pay more for it, than to be as we are at the moment. During the years 1935-1945, milk production in the Six Counties increased from 35,000,000 gallons to 65,000,000 gallons.  In the remaining Ulster counties, there was a total of 273,000 gallons less in 1946 than in 1944.  In Munster, there was a decrease of 8,419,050 gallons and in Leinster, a decrease of 793,551 gallons, making a total decrease of 9,484,000 gallons in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I suggest that it is not well for the country that that condition of affairs should obtain. It is obvious that there is a very good reason for that decline in milk production and Deputy Madden last night put forward a very definite reason.  If the milk could be sold at an economic price, I am quite satisfied there would not be such a reduction.  As I mentioned on a previous Estimate, in the town of Cardiff alone, milk consumption increased from 11,000,000 gallons to 20,000,000 gallons within the past six or seven years.  If the English farmer can increase his milk production by nearly 100 per cent., even when ravaged by war, I am at a loss to know why it is that the production of milk has gone down here.  Obviously, the price is not sufficient to encourage the farmer to continue to produce, which brings me to the agitation by farmers and farm workers for shorter hours, better wages and more attractive conditions of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the farmer has a good case, that he cannot pay <Col N="221" /> increased wages because he is not getting a sufficient price for his products. When a comparison is made between the wages of the agricultural worker in England and the agricultural worker in Ireland the case is very strong.  The agricultural worker in England is paid £4 10s. 0d. for a 48-hour week and the girls on the land are paid £3 10s. for a 48-hour week, while our workers have about 59/- or 60/- for a 56-hour week and no holidays at all. These are matters on which the Minister will have to meet the farmers. I know he is not averse to doing it, but it should be possible to get common agreement between the farming community and the Minister as to what the price should be to encourage them to produce sufficient for our own people and for export.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the farming community and those who work on the land are the hardest worked people in the country.  When milk is delivered to me in the morning at 8 o'clock I often ask myself what would I do the same job for.  These men have no half-holiday. They have not even a week's annual holiday.  They work Christmas Day as well as every other day.  The farmer and his sons and daughters do likewise.  There is rather too much inclination to wave aside the farmer's arguments and to say to him that he is sufficiently paid for milk.  There should be common agreement on that matter rather than the tug-of-war that is at present going on between the farmers and the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I heard a great deal of discussion on the question of manuring the land.  I have been away from the land for many years but I have not lost my knowledge of the land.  I often wonder why we have to go to the four corners of the earth for phosphates to fertilise our land when we neglect to treat the refuse of our cities and towns and convert it into a useful and practical fertiliser.  I was in Birmingham some years ago.  It would be an education to anybody to go there to see what they do with the refuse and sewage of the city.  Not alone is it used to fertilise the land but for many other purposes.  In the year that I was there, 1931, there was a profit of £75,000 <Col N="222" /> in that way.  I often wonder when I see the amount of valuable manure being dumped around the City of Cork, Dublin and elsewhere why it is not used to bring fertility to our land.  I would suggest to the Minister that that is a matter that is well worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I am quite satisfied from some of the statements made to-day by farmer Deputies that the farmers are fairly badly treated by the various rings operating around Dublin.  The farmer sells his product in the wholesale market and buys at a very high price. The one way to counteract that is to develop the co-operative movement in the country.  I do not think it was right of Deputy Fagan to criticise somebody who talked about co-operation. If the farmer is to till his land and make proper use of it he can only do so by developing the co-operative movement as it has been developed in other countries.  There is a very fine foundation of it in this country.  Deputies on both sides of the House are associated with co-operative creameries. I am often at a loss to understand why farmers do not avail more of the co-operative movement.  While I have listened to Deputy Corry and to other Deputies for a long time, I still claim there is only one method by which the farmer can get the best results from his land and a decent price and that is to adopt the co-operative system of operating his farm and marketing his produce.  These are matters that the Deputies who represent farming on both sides of the House should be wise enough to develop, because there is a very definite move in the country to prevent these co-operatives from being developed as they should be developed. Therefore, I would appeal to Deputies on both sides of the House to encourage the co-operative movement. <Col N="223" /> As one who has some knowledge of how co-operatives operate, I think it is a tragedy for the farmers that they are not developed to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>A co-operative in the South of Ireland has a number of tractors and corn mills which they hire out to the small farmers.  These are a great help to the farmers in increasing production. The Minister should encourage as much as possible the co-operative idea of farming and marketing.  If we have not a progressive and prosperous agriculture we cannot have prosperous industry in our cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat some of the things that have been said.  If there is anything desirable in this House it would be a limitation of speeches.  If a man cannot say what he wants to say in half an hour, he is deliberately wasting the time of the House.  I will not repeat what has been said because I am quite satisfied that the Minister is conscious of the requirements of farmers.  As to the suggestion that he wants to do away with the horse, I do not think that is meant at all. What the Minister did say was that agriculture required to be mechanised much more than it is being mechanised. I agree.  Anyone who wishes to see the country prosperous must agree.  The suggestion that he wants to do away with the horse is dishonestly misrepresenting the statement of the Minister.  All this is hardly fair to the farming community.  The farmers who elect people to represent them here and to legislate for them expect to get some direction and not misrepresentation of statements that have been made in their interests.  I hope the day is not far distant when there will be some regulation limiting speeches to half an hour or three quarters of an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture is our main industry.  Every Deputy agrees on that.  The present position of agriculture is that production is going down and has been going down for the past ten years.  There has been no check put on it.  The cause is the low fertility of our land.  That, in turn, is <Col N="224" /> caused by constant cultivation for a number of years without the necessary elements being restored to the land. The chief deficiencies in our soil are lime and phosphates.  The Minister has promised that he will let the farmers have ground limestone at 16/- a ton.  That will be a great asset, as there is a big quantity of lime required for the land and at 16/- a ton a big quantity will be put into the land.  We also require phosphates.  The price of phosphates is too high.  If the present Minister would guarantee to let the price be less to the producer, it would help.</P>
      <P>How are we to find out the present condition of our soil?  There must be a soil survey.  The Minister says that, if the farmer gets the committee of agriculture to take a sample of the soil, they can have it analysed and give him the result.  That would be a big job. The Minister would need a soil advisory committee in each county.  Owing to the number of years in which we were short of manures, our soil is in a bad condition and a soil survey committee would be needed in each county to advise farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he is going to improve our grass lands.  They have not been treated as they should have been for a number of years, and a good deal could be done to improve them. Reseeding and proper treatment of the soil would enable them to carry a big complement of stock.  Other countries have done a great deal, but we seem to have made no progress in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our dairying industry is in very serious decline.  The milk yields are possibly the lowest of any dairying country in Europe to-day.  I suppose we are hardly averaging 350 gallons per cow.  Our big trouble is that we have not got the proper type of cow. That is a debatable question.  The Minister is in favour of Shorthorns, but it is difficult to get the right type of Shorthorn to give a high milk yield. I have seen some of them which can. We have one beautiful herd of Shorthorn cows at the farm in Glasnevin, with an average yield of about 1,000 gallons.  If we can get that type, we <Col N="225" /> can step up our dairying output and easily double it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is interested in young farmers' clubs. They can do a lot to educate our young farmers.  In our constituency we have a number of these clubs.  They give lectures and arrange for groups to inspect model farms in the country, and so help to educate those young men. In the last few months there has been a scheme under which 21 young farmers from different clubs went across to England and spent three weeks there studying agricultural conditions. They have seen how agriculture is being tackled in other countries and that has helped them a good deal.</P>
    <P>There have been many remarks about the Minister's statement about doing away with the horse and mechanising every farm completely.  I think he has been misrepresented there.  What he intended was that the farmer should keep up with the present world advance in mechanisation. Every farmer appreciates the value of that, as if you do not keep up you cannot keep in production.  Some Deputies referred to the small farm of two, three or five acres where the farmer could not carry on without a pair of horses.  I think such a small farmer does not have a pair of horses. The Minister, in those particular cases, hoped to have a co-operative system for implements and machinery.  That would help the small man who could not afford a pair of horses on a five-acre farm.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, the beet industry is a great help to the farmer and beet is grown extensively.  We have had some trouble in the past two years with blackleg, which is very harmful and has wiped out crops completely. The sugar company cannot find out where the trouble is, whether it is in the seed or in the soil.  I appeal to the Minister to face this problem seriously, in order to avoid a bad effect on the beet industry.  If conditions are as bad as they have been for the past few years, very little beet will be grown.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the success he has made so far.  He has a big task and has attacked it in <Col N="226" /> a very able way.  The farmers of the country appreciate the way he is approaching it, and I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important tasks the Minister has here is to procure sufficient phosphates.  I mentioned this to him after he became Minister, when we had a meeting of the advisory committee.  I also asked him to try and get the phosphates at a reasonable price.  I know he cannot do everything he likes and that the Minister for Finance may sometimes feel that he is in difficulties, but no matter what the difficulties of the Minister for Finance are, if we are serious in trying to increase production, a very great effort must be made to get as much superphosphate as possible and give it at as low a rate as can be arranged.</P>
      <P>Superphosphate is essential not only for our crops but for the replenishment of the land.  It is also fairly obvious that it is needed in our live stock. During the last three or four years I have noticed quite a number of cattle and cows going lame.  The veterinary people tell me that the cause of that is the want of superphosphate in the land. Therefore, if we intend to increase production we must try and procure sufficient manure.  Deputy Hickey mentioned a scheme that we discussed some time ago with Deputy Dr. Ryan for the collection and saving of manure in the cities and towns and sending it out to the farms in the empty lorries on their return from the cities and towns.  That is a thing which I think could be organised.  There will be a good deal of manure washed down the Liffey to-day after the cattle market. There is also a lot of manure to be collected in the vegetable market which is also thrown away.  At this stage we cannot afford to miss any opportunity of feeding the land with manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have much the same problem with regard to milk.  I do not know a lot about milk, although recently in the County Meath we have got quite a number of dairy farmers there who appear to be progressing reasonably well.  I have always heard that, as far as dairying is concerned, one of the <Col N="227" /> things that is essential is to feed the cows well.  I am afraid we have always been a bit remiss about that.  For some strange reason or other, it appears to me that the creameries are now moving from the areas where there is good land into areas where you have a poorer type of land.  I do not know the reason for that.  I think if the Minister examines the position with regard to the Dublin milk supply, he will discover that there is a tendency for milk producers to move towards the centre of Ireland.  The Leinster producers are inclined to develop in Westmeath and go out of action, so to speak, nearer the cities.  It would be interesting to find out the reason for that.  It may be because the rates in Westmeath are lower than they are in Meath, and a good deal lower than they are in the County Dublin, especially near the city here.  If we are to increase milk production that is something that should be examined. Farmers should also be encouraged to feed their cows better.  If that is done they will give more milk and their calves will be stronger.</P>
    <P>I have noticed at fairs in Meath and Westmeath that a number of the young cattle sent into them are not sold.  I would say that 30 per cent. are unsaleable. It is not easy to say where they come from.  They appear to roam about from one farmer to another.  A farmer buys them, keeps them for about two months and then tries to sell them to another farmer, and eventually they are bought to be slaughtered by a butcher.  They are cattle that do not seem to be of much use to anybody.  I would urge, therefore, that it ought to be possible to feed our calves and cows better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles mentioned something about rings.  He talked a good deal of tripe, as he usually does.  He did not explain what he meant about rings, but seemed to infer that rings had been created in every fair by Fianna Fáil. I suppose the Dublin market might have been suffering from the same sort of blister, but at the same time he seemed to think that there were too many whackers at the fairs and that cattle should be sold by auction.  It is <Col N="228" /> a strange thing that auctions, as far as cattle are concerned, were never a success.  In the County Meath they never got beyond Dunshaughlin and Dunboyne.  They are held here in the city, but they have not extended into the country.  The reason for that is not clear.  They attempted them in Navan and in Kells but they failed there.  If there is a grievance that whackers and dealers interfere with farmers and prevent them from getting a good price for their cattle, and sometimes no price at all, then I think it would be better to compel everybody to sell their cattle by live weight.  So far as I know there is no great abuse under the present system.  The farmer, when he is selling his cattle, likes a bit of a gamble, and so does the fellow who is buying them.  One day the farmer wins and perhaps the next day he does not, but apart from that, it might be possible to have cattle sold by live weight.  We have first to produce sufficient cattle and then sufficient food to feed them.  It does not seem that we are able to get sufficient food from abroad.  If we are to produce more food, one thing is essential and that is, we must have more manure.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the question of disease in cattle.  It is very important. I addressed some questions to the Minister on this some weeks ago.  The answer that he gave me did not indicate that the people were taking sufficient advantage of whatever veterinary facilities the Department is able to provide. Within the last two or three years we had a very serious epidemic of fluke, which killed quite a number of sheep and cattle.  Within the last month or so I was in a butcher's shop. The butcher told me that out of 20 livers not one was sound.  He showed me some livers in the shop which were quite hard and diseased looking, and, of course, unsaleable.  Even as an offal the livers were a total loss to him.  I do not know what we can do to remedy that.</P>
    <P>I know that, as far as a veterinary service is concerned, we are very much behind the times.  I looked up the figures for the County Meath which has a large population of cattle and of horses, and I am sure a large dog population <Col N="229" /> as well, but we have only ten &ldquo;vets&rdquo; for the whole county.  No small farmer can afford to pay a veterinary surgeon. He cannot do it; it is too costly.  He resorts to a quack and if the quack fails he goes to the shop and buys some of these abominations done up in nicely coloured bottles which are supposed to cure everything.  He pays a fancy price for them and eventually loses the animal. I think that the Minister should take some steps in that direction.  If we want a healthy people we must have healthy stock and if we want more milk we must have fewer abortions.  I know that there is some sort of abortion Order which was introduced here in 1925 or 1926, but is it only a laughing stock, common nonsense?  Cows come into the Dublin market after aborting; they are sold there and it is spread over the whole place.  That should be stopped.  We could not be serious about making a cattle trade in Great Britain or anywhere else until this is stopped.  You may say that we could not recover the fees given to vets, but on the Continent, before the warmongers destroyed half of Europe, they had a system of insurance for live stock. That should be very carefully considered here because undoubtedly we have a great amount of losses.  The latest reports state that they are roughly about 7,000,000 and that is a conservative estimate.  There are enormous losses from blackleg in cattle.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that we have got a guarantee as far as Great Britain is concerned, because Great Britain is a very tricky country and I hope she did not get rid of the other buyers we had here because there are proper cattle dealers in England and proper statesmen in England who are able to fight for their own and defend themselves. I am glad to see that they will not have much opportunity of getting at the farmers of this country.  It is like the famine; farmers did not forget it.

      <P>I listened to Deputy Smith, the ex-Minister, speaking here for a long time and he made some remarks which I felt were rather embarrassing or were intended to be embarrassing to the new Deputies who came into this House and claim to represent the farming community.  I am one of those new Deputies and I do claim to represent the farming community. While I have great sympathy with a number of things that Deputy Smith had to say, while I had a good deal of admiration for Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture, I always had sympathy for him because he was in the unfortunate position of being Minister for Agriculture in a Government that had a bias against agriculture and a bias against rural Ireland and while I believe that Deputy Smith did the best he possibly could while he was Minister and knew what was required for agriculture in this country, the leader of his Party and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce were the two strong men in the Cabinet and they had a very strong bias against the rural community in this country.  I am satisfied with the present Minister because he at least has given the farmers of the country a hope that something will be done for them in the future, and that they will not be relegated to the position to which they were relegated for the past 16 years.  You know the position of the farmers.  You know what they have <Col N="233" /> had to contend with in the past.  You know that after the first world war the prices of agricultural produce were reasonably fair.  You know that during that period wages of people employed in any sort of non-agricultural employment were considerably increased.  You know that this increase lasted afterwards.  But what happened to the farmers was that prices went down after the 1914-18 war until the general agricultural depression in 1932.  Then we had the economic war and the price of what the farmer was selling was considerably less than what he was getting in 1914. At the same time, he was paying considerably more for all his requirements. That was the position in which the farmer was placed before the outbreak of this war.  He was paying considerably more for everything that he had to buy, and rates and taxes, wages, etc., were higher.  At the same time he was getting less for his produce than in 1913.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see that situation arising again.  I want the Minister to be careful to see that it does not happen.  I do not want to refer to the London Agreement, because I am told it is something to which we should not refer.  Recently, however, the agricultural producing countries of the world have tried to form an organisation known as the International Federation of Agricultural Producers Through that organisation we hope to get rid of this cut-throat competition which we had in the past when you had farmers in Denmark sending stuff into one market, farmers from Ireland sending it into the same market, farmers from Germany sending oats at bounty-fed prices in here while we were sending butter at bounty-fed prices to England. I do not want to see that position happening again.  If the Department of Agriculture and the Minister can give Irish producers any help in maintaining this international organisation as an effective force in the world they should give what support they possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an agricultural country.  I am not going to tell the House that agriculture is the principal industry, because I am sick and tired of hearing people telling us that, when they are <Col N="234" /> talking with their tongues in their cheeks and doing the best they can to put the agricultural industry in the worst position in which it can be placed.  So far as we are concerned, 50 per cent. of our people are depending directly on agriculture and 25 per cent. indirectly on it.  Unless agriculture is prosperous this country cannot be prosperous.  We must realise that and we must legislate with a view to that.  There is no use in trying to increase and develop unnatural plasters in this country, such as the present City of Dublin is.  I agree that increased agricultural production is vital if agriculture is to have any real decent prosperity.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the fact that agricultural production is low in this country is not due to the farmers or to the agricultural workers.  It is due to what has happened in this House.  Over the past 25 years every piece of legislation passed in this House dealing with agriculture has always had the effect of hampering and reducing agricultural production, with one exception&mdash;the farm improvements scheme.  If you are going to continue hampering agricultural production you are going to reduce production still more.  I should like to ask the Minister to look into a few matters.  Is the Minister aware, for instance, that it costs about £5 per ton to have maize handled by a certain combine of millers and passed on to the producers?</P>

      <P>So far as I can see, the position is that the Minister or his Department is only giving quotas to the people who demand £5, £6 or £7 per ton for grinding and distributing this maize.  The Minister wants increased bacon production.  I think you can take it that five cwt. of maize will give you one cwt. of bacon.  If the Minister would give that maize to <Col N="235" /> those people who would mill it at a lower price, five cwt. of maize delivered to the producer at 4/- or 5/-per cwt. less would mean a difference of £1 to £25/- per cwt. of bacon.  That is a matter I would ask the Minister to look into.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also very keen on mechanising the Irish farmer.  I should like the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he is satisfied with the prices charged here for agricultural machinery such as tractors, trailers, etc.  Is he satisfied that we should pay more than the people across the water?  Is he satisfied that the prices are reasonable?</P>

I ask him to compare the price the Northern Ireland farmer has to pay for his machinery, the price which the British farmer has to pay for his machinery, and the price that the Danish farmer has to pay for his machinery, and decide for himself whether the price charged here is right or just.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another difficulty which I can see in regard to the Minister's policy of mechanisation, that is to get it into agreement with the statements of another Minister, who tells us that there will be no large farms in this country in a short time. If necessary he is going to look for legislation to do something about the matter.  Personally, I do not see any hope of mechanising farms if we are going to create rural slums on uneconomic holdings.  If we are going to be efficient and if we are going to use machinery we will have to have a certain space of ground in which to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Manures are a matter of very great importance to farmers.  For the past number of years we have been using up <Col N="236" /> the fertility of the soil and we have not got adequate supplies of manures to replace what we are taking out of it.  We are getting a quantity of inferior phosphates from a monopoly concern at what, to my mind, is an outrageous price.  The farmers cannot pay £11 a ton for inferior superphosphate and compete in any given market.  The position is that in various centres where there are considerable quantities of very valuable fertilising material it is being dumped in corporation dumps and at times being sent down the river in sewage and so forth.  Blood from abattoirs in Cork, which is being dumped in the river, could quite easily be converted into a useful fertiliser.  We have rough types of fish going round the coast that could easily be converted into fertilisers and fish meals.  These are matters that I think the Minister should take up and consider with the least possible delay.  In Cork we have a farmers' organisation.  There are three or four dumps there into which thousands of tons of street sweepings, cuttings of hedges from all the suburban gardens, leaves swept up from the streets, and so forth, were being dumped.  We went to the corporation, to the city engineer, to the county medical officer of health, and we eventually got a scheme agreed to.  One particular gentleman, however, objected, because he wanted to convert bogs into building sites.  Thousands of tons of valuable humus and fertilising material were dumped there to a depth of about 16 or 20 feet in order to make that bog a building site at a time when the farmers of the country were crying out for fertilising material.  I would ask the Minister to try to do something in that direction.  We do not want to have ships coming into Cork harbour bringing in phosphates, nitrogen and potash, while at the same time nitrogen, phosphates and potash are floating down into the sea.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something on the question of ground limestone which the Minister hopes to make available. I hope he will make it available at 16/- a ton.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied. On one occasion I called upon the Minister to tell him of a certain quarry in my constituency in a place called Carrigaline.  The result of the test of that quarry given by the Department of Agriculture was 100 per cent. lime content.  I did not believe it myself and I do not think the Minister believed it when I told him but I have the certificate from his own Department here now saying that the lime content is 100 per cent.  A private individual is interested in working one of these quarries. There are co-operative societies interested in working more of these quarries.  I would ask the Minister to give them all the help he possibly can.</P>
      <P>For the past number of years we have heard a lot about inspectors.  Inspectors in agriculture or inspectors dealing with farmers are something to be avoided.  There is, however, a great need for agricultural advisers.  There are not nearly enough of these agricultural advisers in the country at the moment.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister appealed to the farmers to avail of the soil testing facilities provided by the Department. I have met thousands of farmers who have tried to avail of these facilities but they are non-existent or only exist to a very small extent.  It was not very long ago that prominent officials of the Department of Agriculture publicly sneered at the idea of soil surveys and soil analysis.  Apparently there has been a change in policy on this point now.  I hope that having changed that policy the Department will provide the facilities which the Minister has announced are available to the farmers of the country and of which the Minister has invited them to take advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from questions which I put to the Minister that there is a difficulty about putting the farm buildings scheme into operation at the moment.  It has been suggested that as an election stunt it was advertised at the end of January; that the applications came in; that there were no facilities for dealing with the applications&mdash;no staff for inspection and so forth&mdash;and that nothing can be done as far as construction is concerned <Col N="238" /> until next year.  I should like to make a special appeal to the Minister in this connection.  A number of farmers in my area were taken in by that advertisement of last January.  They believed that there was really going to be a farm improvements scheme and that it was going to come into operation in the near future.  They cut down and seasoned timber and they had it cut into the appropriate scantlings or boardings.  In addition, they collected as well as they could the required amount of cement for the job. They have bought secondhand galvanised corrugated iron; they have bought corrugated asbestos sheeting. They have these on hands at the moment and there is a danger that the cement they have bought in 5 cwt. and half-ton lots may go to waste.  I want the Minister to consider their position. I want him to consider the fact that they read the advertisement issued by the Department of Agriculture last January telling them that this scheme was going through.  If these people put up the houses now with the materials they have collected I ask the Minister to send an inspector to inspect those buildings and, if the inspector is satisfied that they are properly constructed, the people should then be entitled to the grant.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the poultry scheme.  No later than this morning I received letters from three or four constituents stating that they are not getting the proper price of 2/6 per lb. for their cockerels and chickens.  They told me&mdash;I am not quite positive about this myself&mdash;that the Department had announced that the price to the producer for chickens and cockerels was to be 2/6 per lb.  I shall give the letters to the Minister or to his officials if they want them. Another point to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention is the fact that we have made arrangements for a number of years to come with Britain to take all the eggs and poultry that we have.  Britain is contributing some of the moneys that we shall use in developing our scheme of poultry production.  I want to tell the Minister that he should be careful in this matter.  Nobody will give you <Col N="239" /> £1,250,000 for nothing.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that the poultry keepers in this country will not find themselves at the end of the specified period with considerable stocks of poultry and a considerable output of eggs and a wholly uneconomic price for their produce; in other words, that there will not be at the end of this period a sudden fall in prices.  Poultry keepers in the country now are entering into considerable commitments in erecting houses and purchasing incubators and the other requisites appertaining to this particular industry.  The scheme will last for three or four years we are told; at the end of that time these people must have some guarantee as to subsequent developments.  If the scheme is going to be dropped at the end of three or four years they will have to decide now whether they can make their money in that particular period.  In the interests of the rural community this is a matter to which the Minister should give very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk about milk prices from the ex-Minister for Agriculture, from Deputy Corry and from other Deputies.  I am satisfied that the Minister has been wrong in fixing five different prices so far as milk for human consumption is concerned. Everybody knows that this entails five different variations in one milk bill.  Another unsatisfactory feature in relation to this fixation of prices is that the month of April has been put in with the summer months. Everybody who has experience of producing milk in this country knows quite well that in nine years out of ten April is the most difficult month in which to produce milk.  It is very rarely that one has sufficient grass on which to turn out a herd in the first three weeks of April.  This is a time when the farmer has to put his hand in his pocket and pay heavily for feeding stuffs.  I think the Minister has made a mistake in fixing five different prices.  He has made a mistake in putting the month of April, which is the hungriest month of the year, into the summer months.  He has also made the mistake of fixing the price of winter <Col N="240" /> milk too low.  I do not take Deputy Corry's remarks about the price of milk or the costings of milk very seriously. This is not the first time the Deputy has misquoted in this House.  Deputy Corry and myself, together with other representatives of the Cork Milk Board, came before the late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, on one occasion. Deputy Smith professed considerable sympathy for the agricultural producers and the milk producers, particularly yesterday.  When we produced costings that were done in conjunction with University College, Cork, and the milk producers' association in that area, Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, told us that he had no interest in costings and that the only costings he knew of or was concerned with were: would the milk be produced; if it were, was it paying; if it was not produced it was not paying.  I listened to a very different Deputy Smith yesterday from the Minister for Agriculture that I met some months ago.  I am satisfied that the price fixed for winter milk is absolutely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the policy of the Department in relation to cattle breeding.  I find it difficult to understand what the policy of the Department is in that particular respect.  The policy of the Department was one way until Deputy Smith became Minister for Agriculture.  I gave evidence before the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture; that was the commission which went into abeyance at the outbreak of war and from which no report has ever issued. I was cross-examined at length by the members of that commission when I ventured to suggest that the breeding of the so-called dual-purpose cow was all &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  I was amazed to find subsequently that people connected with the Department had completely changed their outlook when Deputy Smith became Minister for Agriculture. I am not quite sure what their outlook is at the moment.  I believe that the alleged dual-purpose cow, the Livestock Breeding Act, the mating of single dairy bulls with animals that were induced by over-feeding and by pampering to yield 600 gallons are largely <Col N="241" /> responsible for bringing the milk yield of the dairy cattle of this country down to its present ridiculous figure of 380 gallons per annum.  I was in the West of Scotland on the agricultural farm at Auchincruagh in 1938.  Now, when I go outside this country I stand up for everything we have here&mdash;even the dual-purpose cow. The manager of the place, a Mr. Cochrane, I think, was his name, was asking how we were doing here and I was trying to build up as well as I could the dual-purpose cow, which I do not believe in.  He said to me: &ldquo;Are you still at that?  That has been given up in every country in the world for the past 25 years; it has been proved a failure.  It has been given up in Denmark and New Zealand and other countries.&rdquo;  There they decided if they wanted milk that they had Ayrshires, Galloways and Highway Aberdeens, but they kept the two things seperate. Here we have certain dairying counties, the Munster counties and County Kilkenny, producing calves and dairy cattle.  These calves have been sold at considerably less than the cost of producing them.  They have been sold to people in County Meath and other counties at less than what it cost to produce them.  The people in the South will not continue to produce these calves for the people in the Midlands at less than what it costs to produce them.</P>
    <P>There was a ridiculous suggestion made in the other House recently, that farmers in the South should be prevented from breeding the type of cattle they want to breed and that they should be compelled to breed another type of cattle and sell at less than the economic price to somebody else who would get the fat of the deal in the end. I think the Minister should be very cautious in changing the policy of the Department.  If he wants to help the people in Meath and Kildare he should tell them that if they want Herefords or beef Shorthorns they should rear them themselves.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned in the dairying counties, I believe in having a proper type of dairy cow.  I believe there is such a thing as a dairy Shorthorn, but it is something that has been <Col N="242" /> practically ruled out by the policy in operation for a number of years.  I would say to these people: &ldquo;Breed your own beef Shorthorn, your Aberdeen Angus and Herefords if you want them; we in the South of Ireland, in the dairying counties, will breed our dairy cattle, and our Ayrshire, Friesian and Jersey heifers will be worth considerably more than the alleged dual Shorthorn heifer.  We are quite prepared to make sausages out of the bull calves and we will get 200 to 300 extra gallons of milk per year from our cattle in the South and we are perfectly satisfied that we will be able to have dairy products at a reasonable figure, which we cannot do under present conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned barley.  He was looking for an increased price for barely this year because the Minister found out that some millions of pounds had gone wrong in the past.  I think Deputy Corry is a bit late in the day with that suggestion.  I believe that barley growing in this country should be tackled by the Department.  Barley for brewing should be grown under contract, the same as the beet is grown for the sugar company.  We have been in the hands of the brewers as far as varieties of barley are concerned for a number of years.  The brewers are dictating to us the type of barley we ought to grow, and they evolved a variety of barley that has a very low protein content.  Having a low protein content, it is very useful as a brewing barley, but it is a very bad feeding barley.</P>
    <P>There are several types of barley that can be grown in this country where the Spratt Archer barley cannot be grown and these would give a considerable volume of food for live stock. You have Limerick and other areas where Kenya or a cross between Kenya and Spratt Archer will do well and give a good yield, but we have passed over absolute and complete control of barley varieties to the brewers, and the sooner we change that the better. Let the brewers have whatever barley they want under contract and at a price that will induce people to grow it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke quite a lot, and I was surprised he was wasting so <Col N="243" /> much time about nothing.  He referred to dried lime.  The position is that the dried lime that is available at Tuam sugar factory is all used in the Tuam area.  The Deputy was looking to the Minister to give a subsidy.  It costs £1 a ton and the people in the Tuam area have told me that even they cannot get sufficient supplies of it and that there is very little to go to Cork, Carlow or anywhere else.  It is true there is a considerable quantity of this lime available at the Carlow factory and there is a lesser quantity available at the Thurles factory.  It is a matter for the sugar company to decide whether they will put in a drying plant there or not.  The sugar company have not decided on that matter and the position is that there is no dried lime available from Tuam for anywhere outside Tuam.  There is no necessity, in my opinion, to pay a subsidy on this particular dried lime, which has a content of potash and nitrogen and is being sold at £1 a ton.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants agriculture to expand, he must make arrangements immediately to have an adequate supply of manures made available at reasonable prices.  He must take steps to see that the best seeds available are at the disposal of the farmers.  We have been trying to grow crops with seeds that were not fit for milling. Anybody who goes around the country can see fields of what is alleged to be Atle wheat, and I venture to say that there is not 25 per cent. of it Atle wheat.  Even the best of it is deteriorating. I appeal to the Minister to see that manures are made available at reasonable prices, in adequate quantities, and that the best seeds are made available also at a reasonable price. We do not want to be in the same position as that in which we were placed last year when we had to pay an outrageous price for inferior mangold seeds.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which also affects agricultural production&mdash; although it is not strictly within the ambit of the Minister's Department, he might convey his views on it to the appropriate Departments&mdash;and that is the steadily increasing rates and other overhead charges over which the <Col N="244" /> farmers have no control.  I suggest to the Minister that he might consider having some discussion with other Ministers concerned with a view to having a fixed rate or a fixed annuity applicable to all farmers so that it will be a known fixed rate and not something which is fluctuating from year to year, a condition of things which could not apply in any other industry in which specific costings are taken.  Again, I should like to congratulate the Minister on at least having given hope to the farming community and the rural community in general that their interests are not going to be relegated to the lowest degree in future.  I believe that that policy will help the country generally and will eventually result in a prosperous Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a good deal mentioned in this House about a soil survey.  I am sure it would be a very useful thing, but I think that everybody is agreed that there are other things which we could do that would be more helpful than a soil survey. I think that a soil survey would take so many years that the present generation would be dead and gone long before we would have the full results of such a survey.  If there is to be a soil analysis, it should be on the basis of problems as they crop up.  If a farmer finds that his crop is not doing well, whatever crop it may be, in a particular field, then I think he should have the matter reported and get a soil test made, but if we were to try to analyse the various soils in every field and every little patch of ground in the country, I think that is going to be a very big task, a much bigger task than having a new valuation of the country made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at the outset of his speech spoke of our soil fertility as being the lowest ever.  I wonder what record of statistics he is going on which enables him to say that it is the lowest ever?  I hold that that is only an assumption and that while there is a decrease in soil fertility generally, we shall find that, in many holdings, the soil fertility is as good as ever and that crops can be produced in 1948 as good as were produced in 1937 or <Col N="245" /> 1938.  A great deal depends on the management of the farm, how it is cultivated and looked after.  Of course, if you have careless management and crop after crop of cereals put in, there is bound to be a deterioration in the fertility of the soil.  But we have many good farmers in this country and, despite the lack of artificial fertilisers, the soil fertility of their holdings is very good.  That is all because of proper rotation.</P>
    <P>One thing in the policy of the Department of Agriculture with which I did not agree during the emergency years was that they did not permit a greater area of the land required to be tilled to be sown with a green crop such as kale or rape.  Where that was practicable, in addition to laying down the land with clover and ploughing it in, the soil is in as good a state of fertility to-day as ever it was.  Some of the leading experts on soil fertility hold that permanent pasture or permanent meadowing is one of the greatest causes, if not the chief cause, of the deterioration in soil fertility.  The use of fertilisers has been recommended. We should all like to have them but, despite all that has been claimed for the advance that has been made as regards soil tests, we have not yet arrived at the stage, I think, where we can be told with any degree of accuracy the type and the amount of a particular manure that our land requires.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to acidity and the liming of land.  Fifty years ago or more our farmers had a simple process for finding out whether soil was acid or not.  We have a more advanced way of doing things now but, even so, I do not think we have yet reached the stage at which any of those technical or scientific people can tell me whether I should put in a ton, two tons, five tons or seven tons of lime to the acre. I hope we shall reach that stage very soon.  I speak for a part of the country that requires a good deal of lime and, lime being so very important, I wonder why it is that the Minister has passed over a county like Galway where we have excellent limestone, so far as the establishment of some of these ground limestone plants is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I pass from that to a point which was also mentioned by Deputy Lehane, namely, waste factory lime.  The Galway Committee of Agriculture gave a subsidy at the rate of 3/6 per barrel or about 35/- per ton on burned lime. We have applied without success on various occasions to the previous Minister and to the Department of Agriculture requesting that we should be permitted to give a subsidy also on factory waste lime.  They have refused to do it.  It will be argued that we can buy this lime at £1 per ton.  We can buy it at £1 per ton at the factory, but the carriage of that lime adds very considerably to the cost.  In County Galway we have a main railway line running from Galway to Ballinasloe and dividing the county in two.  We have branch lines to Loughrea, Gort, and Tuam, and anybody looking at a map will see that there are large areas on both sides of the main line which are 40, 50 and 60 miles away from the Tuam factory, and the real cost comes in in getting that lime transported. There would be nothing wrong in permitting the county committee of agriculture to give the same subsidy on that lime, which, I believe, is even better than any burned lime.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed great surprise at the way the Marshall Aid Plan is being administered, so far as this country is concerned.  He could not understand why we should not get a grant the same as any other country. Everybody in the country is surprised also by that.  The Minister stated, and rightly so, that if we did get a grant we would be in a position to utilise it to greater advantage for the purposes for which it was intended than any other country in Europe.  If we are in that advantageous position, as we are, it is due to the attitude which, I am glad to say, was supported by 98 per cent. of the representatives of all Parties in this House.  The Minister, I am sorry to say, was not a very strong advocate of that attitude.</P>

A nod is as good as a wink, at the same time.  I think that the announcement which the Minister made some time ago regarding compulsory tillage and wheat-growing was not very helpful either, in getting us a free grant under the Marshall Aid Plan.</P>

      <P>Yes.  His views on wheat-growing are based on this: that because there are a number of people in the country who believe there is some virtue in wheat-growing, he is going to permit them to carry on with their folly.  As I have already mentioned, I never knew the Minister to be a respecter of the opinions of other people.  He always was fairly self-opinionated, and I must pay him this tribute, that he always had the courage to be self-opinionated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But I know very well why he has fixed a price for wheat.  It is because wiser counsels have prevailed amongst his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I am glad that that is so. While 62/6 is a good price, and it will be argued that it is a better price than Fianna Fáil gave, I hold now, as I always held, that neither the present price nor the price given by Fianna Fáil is sufficiently attractive.  I think it a mistake that a higher price has not now been fixed.  A good deal has been said about milk production and the necessity for paying remunerative prices to the milk producers.  That is quite right, and no matter what amount of subsidy has to be raised in order to keep milk production going, I think it can be justified.  The same is true with regard to wheat and beet. I believe that no matter what subsidy, in the present state of the world, is paid for milk, wheat or beet, is fully justified, because they are three commodities we could not very well do without.  If we had not got them, we perhaps could get on with porridge <Col N="248" /> and potatoes, as did our forefathers, but, at the same time, I do not think the people would grudge paying handsomely in order to see that we are not brought back to that position again.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to come out frankly and speak his mind in connection with the beet industry.  We cannot claim credit for starting the beet industry.  That industry was started by Cumann na nGaedheal.  It was extended and expanded under Fianna Fáil.  The present Minister, when a member of the Opposition, decried the beet industry, and it is only about a year since he said it was foolishness, that we would be able to get sugar from outside at 2d. and 3d. per lb. and that we should not continue the subsidisation of an industry of that type.  To maintain our present ration would require about 84,000 tons of sugar per year and I do not think it would be possible to procure that amount of sugar, or anything like it from outside.  Even if we did, at 5d. per lb. it would mean £4,000,000 leaving the country.  At 4d. per lb., it would mean something like £3,250,000 and, even if we got it as low as 3d., it would represent something like £2,500,000.  It is a fine thing to have that amount of money circulating here and it would be a very sad day not merely for the farming community but for the consuming public, if the growing of beet were endangered. I should like the Minister to be big enough to say now that beet growing has come to stay.  That is what the beet growers want.  They want some encouragement, and they want to know and to be assured that there is no danger that the industry will be allowed to flop because of any penurious method adopted by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Minister, we have to attach some significance to his statements, and, if we are not to attach some significance to the statements of a responsible individual, an intelligent and highly-educated man, if he is to be able to make any kind of wild statement when in opposition and to say later: &ldquo;Forget about them&rdquo;, where are we? What basis have we to go on?  We have to attach great importance to the statements which a person of the Minister's calibre makes, whether in opposition or in Government.  In fact, just as much when he is a member of the Opposition as when he is a member of the Government.  It would be a bad state of affairs if that should happen to our beet industry. The importance of the beet industry has not been driven home sufficiently to the farmers.  This crop supplies us with sugar, but its value as animal food is not appreciated in the country, with the exception of Carlow.  According to experts who have gone into the matter, not in this country but across the water, it would take a 20-ton crop of turnips to equal in feeding value the by-products, that is, crowns, tops and pulp, of a ten-ton crop of beet.  It has the additional advantage of being a crop that cleans the land of weeds, and because it grows so deep in the soil, it aerates it and makes it friable.  When a cereal crop, particularly wheat, is grown on a soil from which beet has been taken, in 95 per cent. of cases you are bound to have a good crop of wheat, provided proper seed is sown.  Further, it gives considerable employment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as far as wheat, beet and milk are concerned, we are not imposing too great a burden on our people when we ask them to subsidise them to such an extent that they will give a fair return to those who undertake their production.  I think it can be regarded as national insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the Live-stock Breeding Act.  We have heard various opinions.  From what I learn from Deputy P.D. Lehane I gather that he is more in favour of the <Col N="250" /> policy of the ex-Minister than the policy of the present Minister in regard to it, but, as far as we in the West are concerned, while the Livestock Breeding Act did a certain amount of good in giving us a better type of cattle at an early age, it has operated adversely.  I do not blame the Department of Agriculture altogether for that because there were a number of people on our committee of agriculture who were all out for the milk strain cattle and some of them would put a finger in your eye if you mentioned a Hereford.  I know that the majority of those I represent are out for the beef strain, that will get them the early return.  While they can have their Friesians or Ayrshires or double dairy Shorthorns in the South, we would like&mdash;I know I would&mdash;if permitted, to give premiums for Herefords and Poll-Angus to the same extent, if not to a greater extent, as is permitted in the case of dairy Shorthorns.  We are permitted to give only a certain number of premiums for Herefords and Poll-Angus cattle and it must bear relation to the number given for dairy Shorthorns.  We should be allowed to give at least 50 per cent., and if the people wish to keep Herefords, their wish should be met, and if it were all Herefords that they want, no barrier should be put in their way.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Horse Breeding Act and the way in which the regulations have been enforced.  This, of course, does not come within the ambit of the committee of agriculture but, in our county, premiums are given only to sires of the Irish draught.  The Irish draught is a good horse and suitable for the farmer's own use in County Galway, but when he is brought to the fair to be sold it is very hard to cash him until he is at least two and a-half years, while you can bring out a Clydesdale at one and a-half years and get a very fancy price for him, a far better price than you will get for the Irish draught.</P>
    <P>All these things have operated against the West for a good many years. When Deputy Madden was speaking last night and making a very fine case for the farmers in the South in regard to the milk price, he was countered by the Minister, who said, &ldquo;What about <Col N="251" /> the slaughter of the calves?  Has not the abandonment of that and its prohibition meant 3d. per gallon extra to the farmers in the South of Ireland?&rdquo; If it means 3d. a gallon extra to the farmers in the South of Ireland, I do not grudge them, but I disapprove of their being subsidised at the expense of a great many of the farmers in the West of Ireland.  There is a type of calf now coming to the West of Ireland which should be slaughtered and which should never be allowed there or which should never be allowed into any fair or market.  It is all very well for people to say, why do the farmers buy them, but the Minister knows quite well that in his own home town of Ballaghaderreen when a few farmers meet they will have a few drinks and will come out in the best of good cheer and that they love the idea of having a number of beasts going home the road before them.  Here you have this scrub calf and they will get him for £5 or £6, while a good calf is £10.  They can get two for the price of one and they will bring them home, and it is the worst money they ever spent.  It would be better to give £12 for the good calf than to buy the two scrub calves at £5 or £6 each, because 70 per cent. of them die, and, if they do not die, there is further loss in keeping them.  It would be better if they died.  Consequently, I am not enamoured at all of the decision to abandon the slaughter of calves. Good calves should not be slaughtered, but the weeds should not be allowed out to the markets or fairs, as they will not be profitable to the farmers who buy them.</P>
    <P>Diseases in cattle and sheep have caused great losses to the farmers. While it is a fine thing to have a free health service for the people, it would be tending in that direction, too, if we had a free health service for animals.  The Minister, who is anxious to build up a live-stock population, should seriously consider, in relation to farmers under £20 valuation, providing a free veterinary service.  That should be done, if possible, for all farmers, even though they may be called upon to pay something annually <Col N="252" /> towards it.  At present, farmers who find a beast sick or unwell have to go seven or ten miles to the nearest town and even then may not find the veterinary surgeon at home.  If they do find him and take him out, it means a couple of pounds, according to the distance and if there are several visits it would be as well if the animal died at first.  A free veterinary service would be very useful to the farmers and to the country in general.  It would be good for the health of the people, because when you have to pay fairly high fees, farmers often try to treat the animals themselves.</P>
    <P>Maize meal is very important in pig production.  I wonder what grades of bacon are required now by the British &mdash;are they the same as pre-war?  If so, we want something more than maize meal, which is a fat-producing food. If my memory serves me aright, we had, previous to the war, even amongst our own people, a great dislike for fat bacon.  People would not take it at all and so the fat portion had to conform to a certain measurement. It gives me a bit of satisfaction to know that the British would be glad to take it now and get it under their tooth and would not despise it.  Though that gives me satisfaction, it is only petty satisfaction, as we would like to see pig production increasing.</P>
    <P>Barley as a mixture with maize is very essential.  The Minister will say he has fixed a fine price for barley, that he has undone a wrong which was perpetrated on the producers.  The policy of the Department in keeping down the price of barley during the emergency was not to have it in too hot a competition with wheat.  I wonder if the high price for barley is such a sound policy.  It is all right for the barley producers for the time being.  There is only one cereal crop which should be subsidised, and that is wheat.  If you subsidise the others and fix too attractive a price, the tendency of farmers will be to go in for cereals year in and year out&mdash;and, no matter what fertilisers they have, they are bound to impoverish the land.</P>
    <P>Another industry which should be encouraged is that found in Donegal, part of the Midlands and in Galway&mdash;<Col N="253" /> the certified seed potato industry.  The Department should arrange for the inspectors to give lessons on its advantage. The people in it, and those residing in close proximity to them, know that the certified seed potato industry has been of great advantage to a large number of farmers in the West of Ireland.  It has enabled them, without any form of Government aid, to build houses and good out-offices over the past ten or 15 years.  I hope this part of the agreement for sending ware potatoes to England will not interfere with this industry.  It would be bad if it did.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned yesterday that the question of grass seeds had been handed over to a combine.  That was so, but it had to be, as if everyone were allowed to produce grass seeds, turnip and mangold seeds, we would have a very poor type of seed.  Grass seed is very important and it is foolish for farmers&mdash;many of them well-to-do farmers&mdash;not to insist on getting the proper type of grass seed.  I know some who, because of the few pounds they would save, will go into a neighbour's loft or stables and take away seeds that are not seeds at all, with all kinds of mixture of weeds and dirt. As a result, it is quite impossible for them to have proper grass or hay.  If there is anything which should be made a punishable offence, it is the use of inferior grass seeds.  A good deal more attention should be given to this.</P>

      <P>The Minister might use his good offices to see that something is done.  Deputy Burke mentioned the reduction in the numbers of sheep, and the Minister asked him what should be done towards an increase.  I think the one thing should be done in order to stabilise and improve the sheep industry would be, first of all, to do something about the woollen industry.  That is one part of the business which has been most uncertain for years.  We feel in the County Galway that we have not got a fair deal as far as that is concerned.</P>

      <P>The beet growers' association attempted to do that some years ago.  What happened was that when the wool was being bought according to grade, in the first year the farmers got a better price for the wool, but in the second year the combine came to the fore and, of course, they were prepared to lose a considerable amount of money in breaking that organisation.  They gave a farthing a lb. more than the farmers who sold to the beet growers' association got, and in that way the farmers sold their own organisation.  It is a difficult matter to handle.  But the wool should be graded and bought according to grade.  I think, too, that more wool should be used in the manufacture of clothing in this country than has been used in the <Col N="255" /> past.  Anything that we are capable of producing at home should be provided here, and so help the home market. That should be done, even though it might mean getting some costly machinery to bring the wool to that degree of fineness which is achieved in the case of Australian wool.</P>
      <P>I want to say that what Deputy Giles stated is true&mdash;that the best agricultural economy for this country is mixed farming.  If we go mad on cattle on the one hand or on tillage on the other, I think it is the wrong way of doing things.  I believe that if we have a mixed farming economy it is the best way to provide a proper agricultural policy for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kinane</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging from some of the speeches that have been made on this Estimate, it appeared to be generally accepted that we should go easy on tillage.  I do not agree with that, because I believe it is better for the country that we should grow our own wheat rather than purchase it from outside even at a cheaper price. I believe in the growing of barley as against the importation of maize.  At the same time, I do not agree with the manner in which the late Government conducted its tillage policy.  In the area that I come from people were compelled to grow wheat on land that was not suitable for the purpose.  That resulted in a dead loss both to the grower and to the nation.  There were other crops that could have been grown more profitably on that land.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kinane</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if remunerative prices are offered for wheat and barley, most farmers will grow these crops.  At the same time, I know that if the matter is left optional there are farmers who will go into grass, principally because they do not want to be troubled about labour. I would be inclined, suppose a farmer was relieved of his obligation to till, to put one condition on him.  Suppose that in the past he was compelled to till 20 acres of his arable land, well, if that land is considered not suitable for tillage, I would oblige him to replace the tillage by keeping a certain <Col N="256" /> number of milch cows.  I do so because milk and butter are in short supply, and both are just as important for the country as wheat.  Of course, we have a great market and big prices for store and fat cattle at the present time. That will tend to make most farmers go in for the raising of stores and fat cattle and not to touch dairying at all. Dairying is a pretty costly thing and those engaged in the work are not paid for their labour&mdash;I think Deputy Madden was the first to mention that. As you all know, cows have to be milked twice a day for the 365 days in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be great cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKinane" hpid="Mr. Kinane Mr. Kinane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kinane</NameTxt>
      <P>The same cow would not be giving milk on 365 days a year, but men are not inclined to do this work at the present time.  It is very hard to get people to milk in the country, especially on Sundays.  They will not do it without increased pay, and the price the farmers are getting for their milk would hardly enable them to pay increased wages.  I think, however, that the greatest obstacle is disease in cattle, especially for the dairy farmer. He is up against abortion, mastitis and sterility in his cattle and his veterinary bills in the year are pretty high in many cases.  I know a case in my own locality of a farmer who owned 12 cows. He had gone in for producing the best cows possible in a mountainy area, and he had Shorthorn cows.  He brought this to such a degree that in 1943, I think, he had the 12 best cows in Munster, in appearance, in milk yield and by testing.  The following year he had the 12 worst.  That was because this disease abortion set in and I think anything that could be done in the line of medical research to get rid of those diseases would be a good day's work for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest losses to the country in connection with dairying which has been carrying on for years and years is the export of heifers, fouryear-olds or three-year-olds.  The export of heifers should be stopped if we are to have good dairy stock. There is always an inclination on the part of the farmer who has a good heifer if he is offered a good price to <Col N="257" /> part with her and keep the wean, especially heifers of a Shorthorn type. The Minister approves of the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow.  I agree that the Shorthorn is the most generally useful and the Shorthorn, either the dualpurpose or the double-dairy, is, I believe, the best foundation stock in this country.  But farmers in the different areas will find out what type of cow suits the district best.  I myself have seen Friesians to be good on good land and even the Kerry cow, of which there has been no mention to-day, is the best cow for mountain areas.  She is the freest cow from tuberculosis; she is an easily fed cow; she is a heavy yielder and has high-grade milk.  I would urge upon the Minister to stop the export of good heifers, so that good stock will be kept in the country, and to consider the advisability of compelling, or rather advising, the people to replace tillage with milch cows.

      <P>In his opening speech the Minister endeavoured to paint a gloomy, dreary picture of agriculture generally.  He told us that the fertility of the land in this country has reached a degree of degradation lower than has been known for 100 years.  I wonder where the Minister got his information or on what soil analysis he based his assertion?  When has the soil of the country been analysed to warrant such a statement from the Minister?  I wonder does he rely on the information submitted to him and to his Department by the so-called farmers who come down to the West of Ireland from the fertile lands of Meath to buy store cattle, who say that they have lands in Meath that will grow three or four or sometimes even five crops in a row.</P>

      <P>I know several farmers who had to sell their butter within the last week for 1/6 per lb. rather than take it home.  The Minister should look into that matter.  If there is any information I can give him in regard to the matter I shall gladly give it.  Then there is another matter causing a certain amount of dissatisfaction and hardship in my area.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that it is very hard for people there to dispose of duck eggs.  Merchants tell me that the price they can get for duck eggs is 15/-per 100, that the price they can get for second quality hen eggs is 17/6 per 100, and for dents 12/6 per 100.  I asked them what was the cause of it and they told me that the Dublin firms have filled their quota for liquid eggs, that the whole supply falls on the home market, and that they are not able to sell the same quantity of duck eggs except at a very low price.  Some of these merchants have suggested to me, and I put the suggestion to the Minister, that, if there is no hope of an export market for this type of eggs, he should allow gift parcels of one dozen or two dozen to be sent to England.</P>
      <P>Then there is another matter that is the cause of a good deal of dissatisfaction. Deputy Fagan said that we had an abundance of fine pullets on every farm.  That is true, but we have also an abundance of fine young cockerels this year.  The merchants are not buying these spring cockerels. They say they cannot pay 2/6 per lb. for them as they cannot get a market for them.  One of the inspectors of the Minister's Department visited the store of one of these people last week and saw the merchant refusing to buy some of these chickens.  I therefore ask him to look into the matter.</P>

      <P>If there is any information or help I can give the Department, <Col N="260" /> I shall be glad to give it.  With regard to the extension of the poultry branch of our agricultural industry, everybody knows that we are advancing in the production of poultry and eggs and I hope that will continue. But, with the increase in the number of poultry, it is necessary to improve the housing conditions.  Many people who would go in for poultry this year cannot do so because they have not the housing facilities.  Many of these people have asked me to make representations to the Department to allow them to go ahead with building this year.  I know several cases of farmers who would be glad to go in for poultry but they have not the housing facilities. Some of these farmers actually have the materials, but they cannot proceed because the Department has refused to allow them to go ahead until the inspector calls.</P>
      <P>That applies also to the farm building scheme as a whole.  I know some farmers whose stables have fallen and who have applied for grants for building new ones.  One of these is a widow who some time ago made application for a grant for the building of a stable, the old stable having fallen.  She had the old roof of secondhand galvanised iron and could get an adequate supply of cement in five hundredweight lots. She had got some already.  I asked the Minister's Department to allow her to go ahead with the building, but my representation was not a success.  That woman is now faced with having no stabling for her stock for the winter. Where farmers are prepared to build with stone and lime and sand, they should be permitted to do so.  They will be able to get sufficient cement for a concrete floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with the increase in the population of poultry and due perhaps to bad housing conditions in many cases, there has been an increase in the incidence of disease in young chickens.  Last year there was certainly a high death rate amongst young chickens.  This should force the Minister to do something about allowing people to go ahead with building for poultry, at any rate.  We have had many cases of the dreaded B.W.D., coccidosis, and other diseases in chickens and a lot of these diseases <Col N="261" /> could be avoided if we had proper housing conditions.  The Department's inspectors are doing herculean work in trying to stamp out these dreaded diseases amongst poultry.</P>
    <P>Very little has been said in this debate about encouraging farmers to improve the breeds and conditions of sheep.  In my constituency of South Galway, about 25 years ago a number of pioneer sheep breeders got together and decided to produce a breed of their own.  They called them pure-bred Galway sheep.  These sheep were bred for three purposes.  One was to produce a smaller type than the old type, something smaller than they had in Roscommon or Clare.  They also bred to produce earlier fattening lambs. Their chief idea in putting this scheme into operation was to produce a fine quality wool.  Although at that time they got a good deal of assistance, co-operation and encouragement from the Department in starting this scheme, they have since got no encouragement or inducement to go ahead with the breeding of these fine wool sheep.  It is a well-known fact that the farmers down there accept whatever price can be got in the open market for their wool.  The price to-day ranges from 2/3 to 2/6.  They have to compete against the producers of larger sheep from Roscommon and Clare, which produce a larger fleece.  Naturally, the man in Roscommon or in Clare who produces these larger sheep will get 3 or 4 lbs. extra in the weight of the wool per sheep.  I do not think that, as things are, there is any encouragement to those farmers in County Galway who produce these sheep to go on producing fine quality wool.  That point should, therefore, be examined.</P>
    <P>I believe that, with encouragement and co-operation between the breeders and the Department, they could in time produce from those sheep wool which would compete very favourably with Merino wool.  I would ask the Minister to go into the matter and, if possible, to devise a scheme whereby those breeders could dispose of their wool by the grading system.  If that arrangement were made these people would get a much better price for their good <Col N="262" /> quality wool and they would be encouraged to produce an article for the market that would be much in advance of the ordinary quality wool which is available.  The price of wool in County Galway is to-day something between 2/3 and 2/6; 2/4 is the usual price.  I wonder if it has ever been worked out how the price of this wool at, say, 2/4 a lb. compares with the price of a suit of clothes of Irish tweed on a man's back which costs 19 guineas.  That is the price a person has to pay in a shop for a suit of clothes.  Certainly the farmer who produces the wool is entitled to something better than 2/4 on these figures.  Somebody between the producer and consumer is getting more than his share of it.</P>

      <P>Another matter which is causing much concern to the farming community all over the country is that we have to-day a type of cow that can be regarded as nothing better than a weed.  Many of our cows are supposed to be Shorthorn, but I would say that many of our cows are not worth their feeding because no matter how you feed them you cannot produce milk from them.  In this regard I think the Minister would be very wise to take drastic action in regard to the Live-stock Breeding Act.  It is a well-known fact that big prices are paid in Dublin for Department bulls, but down the country the farmers will go miles for any other type of bull but the Department bull.  That is the case, and surely the farmers know what suits themselves.  The best type of cow for foundation stock is the Shorthorn cow with a good milk strain behind her.  It may be said that we want a decent kind of calf that will produce early beef.  If we do, I submit that the best type of bull to cross with a good dairy Shorthorn <Col N="263" /> would be a Hereford or an Aberdeen Angus.  There are some parts of the mountainous areas where the Aberdeen Angus would suit better.  I believe the Hereford is the best cross possible for a Shorthorn cow.  Something should be done at once to help out those people who have bad cows. Most of the farmers in my constituency are small farmers who keep three, four or five cows.  If those farmers could get a good type of cow I am quite sure that every one of them would feed not three or four cows, but two.  Instead of having to feed wastrels and weeds they could feed a couple of store cattle instead.  Even if it were necessary to give long-term loans to some of those farmers to put in good foundation stock cows it might be very wise if the Minister would consider the matter.</P>
      <P>The question of veterinary advice was raised by some Deputies.  It is essential that we should have veterinary advice.  Many of our farmers in the West are very slow to call in a veterinary surgeon because, for one thing, the fee is a bit high and he has been used for years to what is described as the &ldquo;country quack&rdquo;.  I would suggest that if it were at all possible the Minister should consider the provision of free or partially free veterinary advice for all farmers.  It would save an enormous amount of stock each year and it would more than pay for itself in the long run. Even if the Minister had to devise a scheme whereby the farmers in general would contribute towards it I consider that it merits a fair trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk about farm machinery and co-operation. In the West of Ireland, where there are many very small farms, a small system of co-operation has been carried out for years.  Sometimes they buy small pieces of machinery by joining with one or two of their neighbours. Sometimes four or five farmers will buy between them a larger piece of machinery.  I do not know whether that system would be a success when applied to machines such as a tractor because the price of tractors is prohibitive as far as these small farmers are concerned.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="264" /> would consider some kind of long-term loans for the purchase of heavy machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it. There is another matter causing some uneasiness amongst our farmers.  That is the fee charged by the threshing machine owner.  Most farmers think the fees charged are too high.  Apart from the high level of the fees, in many cases the work is very badly done.  If it is within the Minister's scope I think there should be some form of inspection of these machines in order to ensure that there will not be unnecessary wastage.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency that has always produced barley.  It produces the best malting barley in the country. If the Minister does his work in regard to the price of barley I and my constituents will compliment him on it.  It is possible that the production of barley may have repercussions on the production of wheat but, so far as it helps out the farmer in my constituency, I consider it a good thing.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to pedigree seeds.  For some years past we have had pedigree seed wheat.  I have purchased some of it myself.  Most of these so-called pedigree seeds are not true to type.  The crop may come to maturity but you have five or six different varieties. The Minister should ensure that when the farmer buys pedigree seed that seed is true to type.  I agree with Deputy Beegan that the farmers are slow to purchase good quality grass seed in order to lay down good pasture. I myself have seen farmers sweep out dirty old lofts in order to lay down their pasture.  I think the farmers are slow to purchase these seeds because the price is prohibitive.</P>

      <P>That is good news.  I hold that if the farmers get favourable prices for their produce they will pay better wages to their labourers.  If the farmers can get a profit from the produce of their land they will increase the product of their land and employ more labour in doing so.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into that aspect of the matter.  I always hold that the farm labourer is entitled to improvement just as much as the farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House very long but, as a farmer, I think it is only right that I should make some contribution to this Estimate on agriculture, because it deals with one of the most important and essential industries.  At the outset I want to say that I welcome the change of Ministers and I sincerely hope that the present Minister will make a much better job of the work he has undertaken than did his predecessors in the last 16 years. Undoubtedly he has a difficult job on hands.  He has, if you like, taken up a battle lost.  In his opening statement he told us that he is faced with a problem with which no other Minister for Agriculture has ever been faced in this country.  Our cattle are at their lowest level for 150 years past.  That is something which must cause grave anxiety to any Minister or any Department interested in live-stock production. The fertility of our soil is at its lowest level for over 100 years past. Here, again, the Minister has a big job on hands.  His effort to cope with the problem of depleted fertility must be almost totally confined to searching the markets of the world for artificial manures in order to restore soil fertility and make the land more productively profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A variety of farming methods constitutes our farming economy in this country, and it is, therefore difficult to lay down hard and fast rules.  Farming might be split up into three categories. There are the milk producers <Col N="266" /> in the South; there are the cattle men in the Midlands; and there are the mixed farmers all over the western seaboard.  All of them contribute in some way to agricultural output in this country.  All of them must get every encouragement possible in their different spheres to continue production and to continue the volume of output necessary if we are to have real wealth in the country.  The Minister has set himself a difficult task in this respect. First of all, we must keep abreast of modern times and we must keep pace with modern methods.  I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the Minister's idea that farming should be mechanised to its fullest extent except in the case of the very small farms in the congested areas.  Farm machinery and implements should be made available to the farmers at prices which will enable them to go in for mechanisation. The introduction of machinery will increase output.  It may have the result, however, of displacing a certain proportion of agricultural labour. Mechanisation and manual labour do not go hand in hand.  As agricultural machinery comes in to increase the volume of output so will a certain number of agricultural workers be displaced from agricultural employment.  We all know that a tractor with a two or three furrow plough attached will do more work than three or four men with three or four teams of horses.  A reaper and binder, even in the smallest piece of ground, will oust from employment every agricultural labourer.  I know the Minister sees that difficulty.  Irrespective of that, mechanisation of farming in this country will have my fullest support.</P>

      <P>An application for a reconstruction grant in this case was received in August, 1947, but it was found that the proposals were such as to <Col N="272" /> render the applicant ineligible for a grant.  In January last the applicant submitted revised proposals which appear to conform with statutory requirements. On receipt of an estimate of cost of the work a grant will be allocated.

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Standing Orders and in the Resolution of the Dáil of 4th May, 1948, the following provisions shall apply in respect of sittings of the Dáil until the adjournment for the Summer Recess:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The Dáil shall meet at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, Wednesdays, <Col N="273" /> Thursdays and Fridays and shall adjourn not later than 12 midnight on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and not later than 5 p.m. on Fridays;</P>
    <P>(b)  consideration of Government business shall not be interrupted on Wednesdays and Fridays at the time fixed for taking business of private members; and</P>
    <P>(c)  Questions to Ministers on the Order Paper on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays shall be taken at 3 p.m., at which time the business under consideration shall be interrupted.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a Vote on Account was granted by the Dáil on 11th March and unless these Estimates are passed, and the Appropriation Bill is passed into law by the end of this month, there will be no moneys to carry on the public services.</P>
    <P>The position in reference to the Estimates is that we have so far debated 29 Votes and on these Votes we have spent 121 hours up to yesterday afternoon. Something like ten hours have since been spent on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  There are 44 Votes still to be debated and passed.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which calls for some action on the part of the Government in the interest of the public.  The plan that is embodied in this motion is an effort to reconcile our desire to give the fullest possible discussion to all Deputies on all sides of the House for the remaining Estimates and at the same time to recognise that we owe a duty to the public to finish these Estimates in time to enable the financial business to be concluded.  The plan embodied in this motion will give, as from yesterday, at least 80 additional hours for discussion.  We feel that that proposal is a reasonable one and ensures every Deputy, no matter whether he belongs to a Party or is Independent, adequate opportunities for discussion, provided there is co-operation and good will on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>With that additional allowance of time on the plan proposed&mdash;80 hours at least, probably more&mdash;we shall have at <Col N="274" /> the end of that time given to this Dáil the greatest amount of time given to the Estimates in the last 20 years, so that nobody can contend that this Government is in any way endeavouring to curtail discussion on the Estimates. The highest number of hours granted to Deputies in previous years, since the year 1928, was granted last year when the discussion on the Estimates occupied 166 hours.  The proposal now will give 201 hours at least, probably more.  These figures demonstrate what I have already emphasised, that there will be ample power, with good will on all sides, for a full and free discussion of the remaining Estimates.</P>
    <P>At the rate at which we have been going up to this, unless some plan such as is now suggested is put into operation, there would be no possibility of ending the Estimates before the end of the autumn.  There are eight groups of Estimates, each one of which is important in itself&mdash;Agriculture, which is in progress, Fisheries, Industry and Commerce, External Affairs, Posts and Telegraphs, Social Welfare, Finance and that for my own Department. As I have said, we propose in this plan to give 201 hours at least and probably more.  In the year 1935, on the 11th July at a time when less than 100 hours had been given, a guillotine motion was moved by the last Government and 102 hours only were given to the Estimates for that year.  A very drastic guillotine was moved on the 11th July, 1935.</P>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient to demonstrate to the House our desire to allow the fullest discussion, not to curtail any Deputy's rights and at the same time to safeguard the public interest, and to see that public financial business is brought to a timely conclusion, I ask for support for this motion and I would also ask for co-operation from all sides of the House to see that the financial business of the country is finished by next Friday week.  This plan by which it is proposed to add 80 hours, is based upon a time-table starting from yesterday and envisages the conclusion of the remaining Estimates on next Friday week at 5 o'clock.  I think we are entitled to co-operation from all sections of the <Col N="275" /> House and that the country expects that we shall get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer first of all to the reference which the Taoiseach has made to the guillotine motion introduced in 1935.  The Taoiseach has not told us how much of the time was taken up on that occasion by Deputies who are now members of the Government Party.  He will find, if he looks up the debates on that occasion, that it was the Opposition Party that was taking up practically all the time of the House.  The practice, about which he is complaining, was always adopted during the time we were in opposition and by the Cumann na nGaedheal opposition during our term of office.  We had to introduce a guillotine motion as the Opposition had taken up so much time of the House.  We have no objection to extended sittings but I think it is only fair to recognise that the Opposition has a constitutional right and duty to put its case so that the public will have an opportunity of seeing all sides of the question.  That duty does not fall so much on the Government Benches.  It will be noted that, since the new Dáil was set up, at least equal time has been taken by Deputies on the Government side.  It may be that since the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture started the balance may have been on our side but prior to that it will be found that there was almost speaker for speaker.  Therefore if there is going to be any blame attached to members of the Dáil for delaying time I think it must rest equally on the shoulders of every Party in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want unduly to delay the proceedings or to hold up the financial business but we do think that the proposals put forward by the Taoiseach are a bit unnecessary and are going a bit too far.  We had an opportunity of consulting the country members of our Party and I think the views which they expressed would probably be endorsed by the country Deputies in all Parties. They say that to start at 10.30 on Tuesdays is rather expecting too much and that if we were to start at 3 o'clock on Tuesday and to go on until <Col N="276" /> midnight it would be more acceptable. We are prepared then to agree to sit at 3 o'clock on Tuesday until 12 midnight and then at 10.30 a.m. both on Wednesday and Thursday until midnight. The country Deputies also think it is unreasonable to ask them to remain here until 5 o'clock on Friday. Some of them have to travel long distances and they think that a sitting of from 10.30 to 2 would be ample.  In that connection, having consulted the members of our Party I think the Government need not be unduly alarmed and that they will be able to get the financial business by Friday week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be possible by our arrangements to get all the financial business by that date. You will get all the Estimates through by Friday week if our proposal is accepted.  I therefore would ask the Taoiseach to amend that proposal to meet us, as the time we propose should be ample to finish this business.  We did get in touch with the Whip's office, but there was a ring again to say that Deputies would have to await the motion.  Our proposal would add 56½ hours from to-morrow morning.  Of course, the other Parties will also have to curtail their speeches and to stand in under this arrangement and not to expect us to do all the standing down.</P>
      <P>I know that where you have such a conglomeration of Parties in a Government it is hard to come to an arrangement, but the different Whips should try to control their Deputies.  We do not want to delay the business at all and until the Estimate for Agriculture was reached, the order was almost speaker for speaker from each side.  If the Taoiseach will accept the suggestion that I have made I think it will be generally acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make one suggestion?  To-day we met at 10.30 and we are going to sit until 12 midnight. I think it is only fair in these circumstances that there should be a reasonable adjournment for meals, that there should be an adjournment from 1 to 2 o'clock for lunch and three-quarters of an hour in the evening for <Col N="277" /> tea so that Deputies like myself who are trying to keep the House going will get a chance of getting out to have something to eat.  I think that is a reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy Cowan's point of view but at the same time I think it has been contrary to the practice of the House. When we have so little time available, to take one and three-quarter hours off for meals would represent a serious inroad on the amount of time left.  As regards Deputy Boland's suggestion, the only purpose I have is to get the business done.  It is not my desire to bring Deputies up at an unreasonable time on Tuesdays but I think I am entitled to say that we exhausted every method of getting accommodation before we brought forward this motion. This proposal is substantially the same as that put to the Party opposite by my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, and I told him that I was prepared to recommend it to the various Parties in the Government provided that there was agreement that the business would finish on Friday week.  I got no such agreement.  I waited until I came into the House, when I asked my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, if he had heard from the Opposition, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The only purpose of this motion, or any other motion, is to get the business done.  I will accept any agreement which meets the wishes of the House to achieve that purpose and it is no use for Deputy Boland to say: &ldquo;We wish&rdquo;, &ldquo;We hope&rdquo;, and &ldquo;We believe&rdquo; that the business will be done. We want some undertaking or guarantee that it will be done on Friday week.  There will be only one Tuesday on which Deputies will have to come up at 10.30 in the morning.  If I can get agreement from the Opposition that, within the hours suggested by them in the amendment to the hour suggested in the motion, the business will be finished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the agreement reached, I will set a good example.  One of the first things the <Col N="281" /> Minister must do is to bring as much artificial manures as possible into the country at as reasonable a price as possible for the people who will use them to increase the fertility of the soil.  I want to say also that if the Minister goes ahead, as he is going ahead, with the poultry production scheme, he is going to make a mark for himself in that branch of agricultural activity, because the profits which can be had to-day for flocks of poultry are far in excess of anything ever seen or dreamed of in this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the farm buildings scheme, we have had wails for the past day or two from the Opposition because the scheme is to be held up for the next 12 months, but I would remind the House that it is not within the past 12 months that we needed farm buildings.  They have been needed for the past 30 years and the fact that they have now to lie over to enable materials to go to more essential purposes for another year is not going to upset the whole economy of the farming community, or bring about a position in which they will never see better farm buildings on their little homesteads and farms.</P>
      <P>While I have every confidence in the Minister&mdash;and I like the way he is stepping off on the right foot&mdash;and while there are approximately 85,000 people who style themselves farmers and who live on holdings of five to 15 statute acres, the Minister can do very little to increase the output from these small holdings, and I hope he will whisper in the ear of his colleague, the Minister for Lands, and will be able to get something done towards increasing the size of these holdings, so that the increased production he is so anxious for will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time as a Deputy, I never intervened in a debate on the Estimate for Agriculture. Because I have no practical experience of farming, I thought it well that the time allotted by the House to the discussion <Col N="282" /> should be utilised by men who, from their knowledge and experience, are able to make an effective contribution to the debate.  That left me and others like me on my side of the House open to the charge that we were completely ineffective members of the Dáil but it had one valuable effect: it at least permitted the business of the Dáil to be carried out with reasonable expedition.</P>
      <P>The reason for my intervention in the debate to-day is that I view with approval a certain feature of the Minister's policy and, because of the way it has been presented by those who favour it and criticised by those who dislike it, I am afraid the advantages of it might be lost except there was from this side of the House some expression of approval and particularly an expression of approval from a source that could not be suspect of having any Dillonesque leanings.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given some thought to the preparation of the way in which he should present this Estimate.  He has, as a result, departed from his usual contemptuous and didactic manner and has become somewhat more reasonable.  While he has used many words that have no meaning, yet he has been, for him, somewhat conciliatory and constructive.  My mind does not march with the adolescent optimism of the Minister.  He painted a very darksome and gloomy background and then pictured himself as the Messiah of our economic salvation coming through that dark background. But I do believe that there is a great future for agriculture in this country and I do believe that by following a certain policy&mdash;part of the Minister's policy&mdash;there will be big dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies speaking in this House &mdash;very seldom I speak&mdash;seem to keep to the Party line rather than consider the merits or demerits of the proposal before the House.  I want to take a different line.  I am very much in agreement with the policy of the Minister in regard to grass production. Again I say that as a result of the method of presentation of this policy by its proponents and the criticism of the policy by those who oppose it, the value of the policy is apt to be misunderstood <Col N="283" /> and much of the discussion may lead to a misunderstanding of its value.  According to those who support the policy, and in some fashion according to the Minister, we are to have a grass policy wholly and solely, to the neglect of other farming activities. That will be the general understanding particularly because of those who speak in support of the Minister rather than what he himself says.  If we are to adopt this grass policy, it ought to be associated with a general increase of farming production in every line.</P>

      <P>I have made a very careful and detailed examination of grass pastures over the past few years and I am convinced, not merely of the value as a productive agent of a grass policy, but also of its value as a soil regenerator.  I wish to stress that viewpoint because I feel that any Party bias should not be permitted to militate against the value of a policy, no matter by whom it is proposed, and I feel it is right to support the Minister in putting that policy into operation, as I see it, because he will be up against a good deal of difficulty in putting it into operation.  He will have to overcome the dead weight of custom. He will have to fight against and combat the objection there is to putting into operation any new ideas and he will have to bring home conviction to the people who are most deeply concerned with the matter.  Again, he will have to disabuse his own mind of certain ideas to which he is apparently wedded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard him and other grass lovers pointing out that we have vast acreages of very valuable old pasture that should not be disturbed under any circumstances.  That is a fallacy.  I have again made careful examination of pastures that were highly regarded and that were not affected by the depredations of the Fianna Fáil policy&mdash; they have never been ploughed&mdash;and I was amazed in going over these pastures with a man who actually knew what he was talking about and was a practical farmer, to find that 40 per <Col N="284" /> cent. of these highly regarded pastures were useless.  They contained bent, sedge, worthless non-nutritious fescues; they were covered with plantain, with sorrel and other noxious weeds and gradually, from year to year, the cumulative effect of these was destroying the valuable grasses in the fields. I think too much has been made of the value of old pastures.  I think they have been deteriorating year to year, and not because of the fact that we grew wheat, because these pastures I know of have never been touched by the plough.</P>
    <P>Again, if we do try to bring this valuable grass production policy into operation, I would like the Minister to say, when he is replying, what the cost of this production will be.  All of us know that Irish farming is under-capitalised and that it will not be possible to put a policy of this sort into operation widely and swiftly enough.  I am not asking the Minister to provide grants or even cheap loans for the purpose. I prefer always that people should help themselves and be helped to help themselves.  Therefore, what I suggest to the Minister is that he should try to provide as cheaply as possible the requisite seeds, fertilisers and lime and that the direction should be intelligent, energetic, sympathetic and well-considered.</P>
    <P>I have been accused here on occasion of having interfered with the work of inspectors of the Land Commission.  I have been in public life since 1914 and until I went to the Land Commission in 1943 I had never seen a Land Commission inspector, and in all my life I have only once met an agricultural inspector&mdash;and that was in a pub, when he was off duty.  I do not know what the work of agricultural inspectors is, but I suggest that the Minister might consider as their main work the creation of demonstration farms.  The demonstration farm, if it is such, in Glasnevin is of very little use to a farmer in Cork.  Precept is all very well, but it is not so useful in trying to get a farmer to follow a certain policy.  It is better to create the example for him. In every district you will find an intelligent, progressive farmer who will co-operate with the inspector.  If you concentrate on that farm, to influence <Col N="285" /> the farmers, it would do a lot for the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister rightly says that it is foolishness to pursue in times of peace a policy adopted to war-time. He has given us very specific, if negative, instructions with regard to the disposal of his body after death, but even if he does not want to be seen dead in a wheat field I would like him to get over his prejudice against wheat. This argument about the destruction of fertility by wheat is an overrated one. We may have, at any time in this uncertain world, to depart from a peacetime policy to a war-time economy and we should certainly take precautions to be able to adapt our policy to changed conditions.  In spite of the Minister's insistence that we should not grow wheat, I am convinced that we should have at least a certain minimum of wheat that would permit us to go on to a war economy immediately it is necessary.  Wheat cannot be such a destructive agent to the soil as the propagandists against it have said.  I am informed that wheat only secures from the soil 5 per cent. of its sustenance, but I am also informed that there is a great difference with regard to soil destruction as between winter wheat and spring wheat.  Those practical farmers with whom I have discussed it believe we should concentrate entirely on the spring variety.</P>
      <P>Maybe the Minister and I part company in regard to his live-stock policy. It seems to me that it is a policy of beef for Britain.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to that.  I think it is a good thing, but I do not wish that the dairy industry should subserve that policy or should be made the maidservant of a policy of that nature.  I confess I was deceived by the result of the policy of the late Deputy Hogan, Minister for Agriculture. I noticed that there was a tremendous improvement in the appearance of the cattle and I thought that meant a definite improvement <Col N="286" /> also in production, but I was deceived. However, I think that Deputy Hogan's policy was never really put into operation. When he enunciated his policy of &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo; he was enunciating a policy on which we could all agree.  But Deputy Hogan was the only effective Parliamentarian in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and he was entirely preoccupied with the defence of the Party here in this House.  He kept them together for many years and when, unfortunately, he died the Party collapsed&mdash;which was not unfortunate, of course. Because of his preoccupation with the work of this House, the civil servants, who had been trained in the old Scotch bull tradition, continued the policy that had been in operation.</P>
      <P>This bull inspection system is all wrong and has completely ruined the dairy industry.  It has caused a drop of at least 100 gallons per cow in the last 20 years and that means 120,000,000 gallons per year.  If the Minister is concerned with pig production, the production of 120,000,000 gallons of milk per year should be tremendously interesting to him.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Lehane say to-day that there is no such thing as a dual-purpose cow and I am fully convinced that he is right.  I have no objection to the dairy Shorthorn, even though my colleague from North Cork has made it the basis of his political career; but I think we ought to breed a dairy Shorthorn as a milch cow and now as the prospective mother of beef for Britain.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of having a dual policy instead of a dual-purpose cow?</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's statement during the debate that he had raised the price of the calf from 10/- to £10.  That is wrong.  It was only £5 last week when he spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Much has been made of the slaughter of calves.  All my life I have seen calves slaughtered, because <Col N="287" /> of the number we get every year and because there are many badly coloured or bady shaped, while others are delicate and die themselves without any external aid.  You can only have a certain number of calves.  While you talk of a dropped calf and include in the price the value of the cow to the farmer, you must consider that, instead of making £5 per calf for the calves that survive, it probably works out at about £1, when you count them all, and Deputy Corry was probably right.</P>

      <P>Let us not argue about it.  The Minister is wrong, anyway. One thing that affects cattle in the South, and particularly in Kerry, is the result of erosion.</P>
      <P>I think that, pending some speed on the part of our Forestry Department, an attempt ought to be made definitely to curb those who burn the heather and the furze off the mountains. In the spring, the herbage on the mountains is burned for the purpose of producing a little grass for sheep grazing.  The result is that the sheep eat that down bare to the ground and their hooves cut the mountain so that instead of having the water that falls gradually eased off the mountain and held by the herbage it comes down in rivers.  I have seen, as a result of that, the rich valley lands in Kerry completely covered with sandy grit which makes the grass inedible.  When the hungry Kerry cattle do eat this gritty grass they develop some kind of murrain.  I think it should be made an absolute crime to burn a mountain because the amount of profit that is made from it cannot compare one thousanth part with the eventual damage done to the country.</P>
      <P>I was very much surprised to hear of the departure of Deputy Cowan from our midst.  I read his speech on Marshall Aid, and I thought it was a very reasonable criticism.</P>

      <P>I will relate my speech to the debate.  The Minister spoke about the Marshall Plan.  I have read <Col N="288" /> his speech.  I sincerely trust that this country, and our policy for agriculture, will not have to depend either upon Marshall Aid or Marshall grant.  I hope that we are sufficiently strong financially to refuse to permit the sovereignty that we have so hardly won to be wrenched from us by another country, no matter how powerful.</P>
      <P>Finally, I was very glad to see that the Minister showed his concern for the agricultural labourer.  It is an easy thing to say that we are in favour of the agricultural labourer, but it is a hard thing to mean it.  It will be a difficult thing for the Minister, with the best policy in the world, to help the agricultural labourer out of the condition in which he lives, but I can assure him, no matter how Fianna Fáil may disagree with any point of his policy, or with all of it, that in anything he can do for the agricultural labourer we will be wholly with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the &ldquo;New Look&rdquo; adopted by this House at 3 o'clock to-day I intend to be very brief.  Agriculture in this country depends on the amount that each individual farmer can produce.  Until such time as we can step up our production we will be at the same level as we have been for years past, and when I say that I do not mean the last 16 years but a much longer period.  I am not going to throw any bouquets at the Minister, nor will I do so until there is some positive proof that the policy he has enunciated is going to be a success. He has to face the position from a point of view that nothing succeeds like success.  He has gone into his work wholeheartedly, and I have no hesitation in saying that his optimism will be realised when we meet to discuss this Estimate in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points that I want to put to him.  The first is to step up the production of pigs.  I believe that we in this country are in a position to produce more pigs per acre than any other country in Europe.  I do not think that my estimates are radically wrong, but if we produce three or four pigs to the acre we will be doing better than any other country in Europe.  I should also like to say a word about the cow-testing associations.  I think that the <Col N="289" /> area represented by Deputy Halliden, Deputy Moylan and myself has done a great day's work in furtherance of the object of producing a better type of cattle for the dairying industry.  I am afraid that the system that more or less is operated there will not lend itself to bringing these cow-testing associations to the peak which they would reach if they were nationalised. I think if that were done it would do more than anything else to step up production.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to indulge in a haphazard policy in regard to the segregation of certain types of cattle, such as the Hereford and the Shorthorn. I think it was Deputy Lahiffe of Galway who spoke about the Hereford. The farmers of Galway are in a far better position than those in most counties to feed the small calves which they get from the Cork and Kerry areas and to bring them to a condition in which they can put them on the market, mainly by reason of the county's geographical position.  The Hereford is not going to be a success in the milk-producing areas.  I think that in those areas the Shorthorn cattle would prove to be the most productive.</P>
    <P>I do not know very much about beef. I am not very much concerned about producing it for Britain, Holland, Denmark or, as I said a while ago, for Russia.  What I am concerned with is the stepping up of production, so that Irishmen, living here, will benefit as a whole from it.  I am glad that Deputy Collins agrees, and I am also glad that this comes from Deputy Collins from West Limerick because that is a country that can very easily be improved at the moment by the production of a better type of cattle.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to exhaust every avenue possible to procure the necessary phosphatic potash and nitrogenous manures to revive the fertility of the soil in this country.  I am not going to criticise the former Government for their policy in wheat-growing; I have the greatest appreciation of the effort they made to extricate this country from the unenviable condition it was in between 1939 and 1945. <Col N="290" /> I would ask the present Minister to do everything possible to produce at an economic price the phosphatic potash and nitrogenous manures to revive the fertility of the soil that had been deprived of that fertility owing to the emergency.</P>
    <P>I would also like to direct the Minister's attention to the development of veterinary services for the dairy areas. Deputy McAuliffe asked him quite recently a question and his answer was not as satisfactory as I would like it to be.  However, I dare say he has his limitations.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of a veterinary service for small dairy farmers, and I hope he will give consideration to it.  By initiative and application it may not be impossible for the Minister, by applying himself to it, to state in the future&mdash;and I hope the very near future&mdash;that the mortality that has developed over a number of years, not due to any external reasons, will be obviated and reduced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I quite realise that the agricultural community have been on the Plimsoll line for a number of years now and I hope, with the assistance of the Minister, the co-operation of the House and the co-ordination of every Party, a new buoyancy will be injected into them&mdash;a buoyancy which will put them on an economic basis so that everybody will be in a position to enjoy life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect in front of agriculture now is definitely hopeful, and I suggest that the Minister should give very serious consideration at this juncture to provide finance for farmers who may be in need of it according to their own present conditions and the system of finance prevailing in the country.  With better prospects in front and a definite need for the nation to increase output, the time is opportune.  Many farmers find themselves completely out of production in some cases and able only to produce partially in others.  They should be brought into the full volume of production for the nation, but they are prevented by the absence of the required capital.  Many farmers need help, some through a cause of their own, neglect, and others through no <Col N="291" /> cause of their own, through conditions beyond their control, through bad luck perhaps.</P>
      <P>A serious period for small farmers when they very frequently find themselves hard-pressed is when they are trying to raise a large young family and their means are exhausted.  A young farmer who finds himself in that financially reduced condition with his stock sold needs capital.  The joint stock banks in this country make small provision for that type of borrower however.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has been instituted but it in turn is not serviceable in a general way to small middle-class farmers, so actually no provision is made available for them to come into production at this vital time.  Anyone in business knows that there are certain times when capital has great value and when indebtedness for farmers or for businessmen is bad business.  There is no doubt that in time of a rising market, to give reasonable financial assistance to a man who is serious about his business will result in more production and better business.  I would ask the Minister to cause an examination to be made among that section of the community I refer to.  He can get valuable assistance from the Department of Local Government who know the number of defaulting ratepayers in the county and through the Land Commission who know the number of defaulting annuitants in the county.  The numbers may not be very great, but there are still a substantial number of people who are neither paying annuities nor rates.  These people's lands are derelict and their families are living in very poor conditions.  If an examination were made and if there were a close investigation into the character of the people who owned these farms, it would be found that many of them were in that position, through no neglect of their own, but because of family conditions or one cause or another.  I would direct particularly the Minister's attention to that section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would direct his attention further to the question of finance generally with regard to agriculture.  There is no <Col N="292" /> easy approach and I do not want an easy approach.  There is no reasonable medium by which agriculture can find the requisite capital to carry on.  If we are to get the output the Minister has in view, and as there is to be a full market in years to come, it is important that we should get back into production the greatest possible number of our people.  To do that financial assistance is required, and if it is found, the better output will be there.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have expressed different views as to the breed of cattle most suitable for this country.  Some advocated the milking strain as a valuable asset.  Unquestionably, the production of milk is of immense importance nationally.  I would suggest, however, to the Minister that there should be no general standard set to meet the requirements of each part of the country.  It is the duty of the Government to legislate not for a part of the country, not for the southern milkproducing area or any other area but for the needs of every section of the community, and the poorer they are the more attention they deserve.  It was absurd to find the Department of Agriculture over a number of years arbitrarily deciding what type of cattle the farmer in districts in County Leitrim should produce.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and the former Minister claim that they know better the needs of the farmers of these districts than the farmers who are the successors of generations who have farmed these areas.  If these farmers feel that their land is adaptable for the production, development and feeding of a certain type of cattle, say the Polled-Angus breed, and if the Department of Agriculture forces on them the acceptance of a good quality milking strain or a good quality Shorthorn, the result is that their land is not capable of feeding these animals. The quality of land required to produce and to feed a fair average beast of the Polled-Angus type is incapable of producing and feeding a beast of the Shorthorn type.  After the winter they are in such a low condition that it takes months of grass to bring them back to a condition where the milk will be of average quality or where <Col N="293" /> they will be able to give an average quantity of milk.  The farmers in these districts know their own requirements better than any outsider and it is wrong and absurd that a Government Department should compel them to have something which the Department thinks it better for them but which they know from long experience is not suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the result of this policy over the last 25 or 30 years, or during the last 15 or 20 years when it has been much more rigidly enforced. Ask the creameries what is the effect on the milk supply in these districts. Successively, year after year milk production has gone down, although the Department of Agriculture insists that by their policy milk production was bound to increase.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a general policy as to the type of animal suitable for the production of cows for milking and cattle raising cannot be applied and is ruinous to the smaller and poorer districts.  It has reduced the quantity of milk produced and reduced the cattle population.  These are the tests to be applied in order to see if you are going on the right lines.  You should give the areas with the poorer land the type of animal which the people there think is most suitable to produce and to feed.  Is it any wonder that farming has become so unpopular? The farmer is supposed to be an independent man, but he is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>

He is not allowed to sell a dozen of eggs until his premises are inspected and conform to the regulations. He is not allowed to produce the type of pig he wishes to feed.  He is not allowed to send milk to the creamery except it is up to a certain standard and conforms to certain regulations. Where is his independence? Is it any wonder that farming has become very unpopular and that we hear all this talk about the flight from the <Col N="294" /> rural districts?  The farmer should have a say as to the type of cattle his land is capable of rearing successfully.  Ask the committees of agriculture in certain counties, through which premiums for the purchase of bulls are given with the approval of the Department, how many applications there were over the last 15 years for Polled Angus bulls and how many did the Department allow.  It is a question of the judgment of the Department of Agriculture as against the judgment of the farmers, who are supposed to run their own business and who are told they are independent.</P>
      <P>As to the general agricultural policy, I have no doubt that the present Minister means well and that his predecessors meant well.  They are supposed to legislate for the community generally. There has been a great deal of talk during the past few years about soil testing and the suitability of certain soil for various crops.  Let us see what certain areas are capable of producing. There is the question of the new price fixed by the Minister for barley.  That may be an excellent thing, but it is definitely going to be a lien on the congested areas and the farmers in the poorest parts of the country, just as the production of beet and wheat has been since its inception.</P>

      <P>On the question of the availability of capital to farmers I think that the general practice of making money available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation or through the joint stock banks to the more well-to-do farmers but not to the poorer ones calls for some special attention.  We should make provision for the congested areas which have always been so sorely pressed and give them special consideration under the poultry scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our turf production has gone&mdash;probably it will never be revived.  That gave initial relief to the workers in the poorer districts.  Why not make some special arrangement now under which the dwellers in these areas can get loans or grants to put into fullest production their inherited capacity for the rearing of poultry?  As these people know all about poultry, why not give them facilities in the way of loans or grants that may be required?  That will give them a reasonable start and it will in some way compensate them for the hardships suffered by them because of the general agricultural treatment meted out to them over all the years. There are many people in the West of Ireland who understand quite a lot about poultry and to whom it is, and always was, a pleasure to rear poultry. Of course, they may not have done so in the scientific way in which it is done nowadays but there is a great opening before them in that connection now. The trouble is that they are not able to take advantage of it because, even the present grants that are made available towards the provision of poultry houses and stations, they have not any spare cash.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to devise a scheme to overcome that difficulty.  It would encourage those people by proving to them that it is Government policy to ensure that they are not completely left out of all forms of legislation and <Col N="297" /> that their special needs are known, are being considered and are, as far as possible, being dealt with.</P>
    <P>One further matter to which I wish to refer is the treatment of our grass. It is possible that we may receive some cereals for feeding stuffs from outside the country without which increased production in beef, pigs or poultry will undoubtedly be seriously jeopardised. In the matter of feeding milch cows, however, the proper treatment of grass is one of the most important and vital necessities&mdash;apart, of course, from fertilisation which I trust will be made possible by artificial fertilisers becoming available.  The scientific treatment of grass is of the utmost importance to this whole question of cattle raising and particularly of milk production.  I am sure the Minister is not losing sight, in his desire for scientific advancement, of that highly important problem.  In spite of all that has been said and written nothing practical has been done in that regard.  In the very near future I hope to hear some pronouncement from the Minister in regard to a practical plan by which the grass of this country can be utilised in a far more effective way than has been the case for generations back.  The Minister should not forget his duty in regard to the poorest parts of the country.  I hope that he will not make the mistake so long practised by his Department, of thinking that general legislation for agriculture can never do anything other than what was done in the past&mdash;demoralise our creameries; reduce the milk supply; reduce the stock supply and banish the people. They are the most valuable section of the community.  They are practical, industrious and trustworthy.  It is our duty to ensure that we do not lose the national heritage of such people.</P>

      <P>In these last few days while we were debating the Estimate on the Department of Agriculture I was interested in the solution of one mystery.  The Minister for Agriculture alleged that the reason the farm buildings scheme was not proceeded with was because his predecessor in office had left him 22,000 unopened letters relating to that scheme in his Department.  The actual column of the <Col N="298" /> debate in which he said those words has already been quoted.  When, however, a specific question was put down to him on that matter, he had to retreat and he had to admit that of the 25,000 applications that had come in before the 18th February, 17,000, 18,000 and 20,000 of them had been dealt with by the officers of the Department of Agriculture and that 17,000, 18,000 or 20,000 forms had been sent out and had actually been returned to his Department before the 18th February. Now, why was it that the Minister for Agriculture told an untruth about that particular matter?  The sum of money involved in the postponement of the farm improvements scheme to next year, and the resultant saving to the Exchequer, is £250,000.  I think I know the solution to this mystery.</P>
      <P>The reason that the farm buildings scheme is not being proceeded with this year and the reason why it will not be proceeded with until the next financial year is not because the former Minister for Agriculture and the officials of that Department did not deal efficiently and promptly with the applications for grants under the farm improvements scheme, and it is not because building materials are not available; it is because the Minister for Agriculture is going to save £250,000 for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, outlined a number of alleged savings he was going to make, but he left undetailed a proposed saving of £1,122,000.  In Volume 110, column 1040, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am also taking account of further reductions in expenditure totalling £1,122,000, which I am closely pursuing and confidently expect to capture, but of which it would be premature to give particulars until they are safely in the net.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is going to capture £250,000 and put it into the Minister for Finance's net.  That is the reason why the Minister for Agriculture told the untruth about the delay in dealing with applications under the farm buildings scheme and has not had either the courage or the courtesy to withdraw.  The Minister for Agriculture has also put on as long a finger as public opinion would allow him the <Col N="299" /> expenditure under the farm improvements scheme.  Advertisements, which normally went out in the spring asking farmers to apply for grants under the scheme, were not published this year until May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not published until July.  Under the farm improvements scheme the former Minister for Agriculture had proposed to spend £350,000.  In the last few years he was not limited to the amount of money appearing in the Vote for that particular scheme.  Excess applications beyond the provision made in the Estimate were met out of the Transition Development Fund.  By delaying the advertisement in this particular year, the time at which the farmers would normally carry out a lot of these works has passed, so that these works cannot be done in this year.  They, therefore, cannot get the grants and the Minister for Agriculture is going to capture some of that £350,000 for the Minister for Finance's net.  The Minister for Finance said it would be premature to announce these savings. The Minister for Agriculture is trying to cover up the savings he proposes to make for the Minister for Finance by telling untruths about his predecessor and about the efficiency of his Department. In fact, in order to save money for the Minister for Finance in this particular way, he has kept a lot of &ldquo;gaitered inspectors&rdquo;, of whom he was so contemptuous, kicking their heels around the country with nothing to do.  But they are on the public payroll. That is the type of economy this economising Government are putting into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were not always so much afraid of public expenditure.  Last year when this Vote was being debated, the present Minister for Finance intervened to the extent of 36 columns and, in his castigation of the then Government, he denounced the tardiness of development of agricultural capital.  He quoted reports from all parts of the world as to what could be done for the capital development of agriculture.  He quoted one report in particular of Dr. <Col N="300" /> Kennedy, in which he suggested that £217,000,000 was necessary in order to improve the capital value of our farms and farm buildings.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture may get a fright at the mention of £217,000,000 in relation to agricultural capital seeing that he has hesitated, manoeuvred and twisted in order to save a paltry sum of something less than £750,000 for the Minister for Finance this year.  If £217,000,000 were required to be spent on the capital development of agriculture last year, surely there should be something near that sum required in this year and surely, instead of saving £750,000 for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture should have done all he could to go somewhere&mdash;even a few pounds &mdash; on the road to the £217,000,000 that the Minister for Finance advised should be spent last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in criticising the former Minister for Agriculture, was not a bit frightened of an expenditure of £217,000,000.  Indeed, he said £217,000,000 is not a frightening sum.  You get that particular phrase in column 2147 of the Dáil Debates, 18th June, 1947.</P>
    <P>In urging the immediate development of agricultural capital, in urging capital improvements on our farms, the present Minister for Finance would not be satisfied and would not take any excuse that material was not available. No such excuse was put forward, but he tried to put it into the mouth of the then Minister for Agriculture that he was not encouraging capital development on the land because materials were scarce.  He had a few very sharp and bitter things to say about the excuse he put into the mouth of the then Minister for Agriculture.  In Volume 106, column 2152, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It comes badly from a Minister who believes in a policy of selfsufficiency to tell us that we are so completely dependent on outside aid in the way of materials that nothing can be done to increase production in the country this year.  I did not know we had come to that profession of self-insufficiency in regard to production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> According to the Minister for Finance, a year ago, after the most devastating war in history, he was not prepared to listen to any excuse that materials were not available in sufficient quantities to enable farm improvements to be carried out.  He sneered at anybody who might attempt to raise the question of expense.  The Minister for Agriculture to-day is attempting to sneak away with his saving of somewhat less than £750,000 in the grants for agricultural development, farm improvements and farm buildings, on the plea that we have not got the materials.</P>
    <P>I ask him to get ahead with this work.  Many Deputies have pointed out that if the farmers get the grants they can build houses out of local materials that are available to them. At least that should be tried, and the Minister for Agriculture can very well say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;In view of what you said last year in regard to the speeding up of farm improvements and farm buildings, I cannot very well, at the end of the year, admit that you have netted anything out of the farm building scheme.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance last year demolished the argument that capital development in agriculture would cause inflation.  In Vol. 106, col. 2149, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you put certain money into a scheme to aid production, that will not cause inflation.  The only money which has an inflationary effect is money which is spent and produces no return in goods.  The only form of expenditure in this country now, if we are looking for an immediate return in consumers' goods, that will not have an inflationary effect, is expenditure on agriculture.  If we spend £4,000,000 this year and get £2,000,000 worth of extra production, we have not caused anything like the inflation effected by tourists who come into the country.  The only safe investment, the only safe way to spend money and to avoid inflation, is to invest it in agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see that the Tánaiste, who was very voluble in the same debate denouncing <Col N="302" /> the development of the tourist industry and the application of materials to increase facilities for tourists, was down in County Meath yesterday.  He has rather changed his mind from agricultural development just like the Minister for Finance, who suggested that everything possible should be done immediately to develop agriculture, but he is very keen on developing tourism and tourist camps.  While the Minister for Agriculture has the excuse, when he is saving money to the extent of £250,000 for the Minister for Finance, that there are no materials, the Tánaiste, or Minister for Social Welfare, was down in County Meath praising the development of tourist camps and the material put into them.  The Minister for Agriculture is asking the House to believe that the only reason he is saving on the farm building scheme is that there is no material.  I better quote that so that we will know where we stand.  The Minister for Agriculture, when introducing this Estimate on the 9th July, said, in column 2609:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot say that we are prepared to speak of the farm buildings scheme with the same urgency and immediacy, because the plain fact is that, when my colleagues cannot provide the cement for such a task as the plastering of the end of the House of God, you cannot very well start on work of this kind in the same parish&mdash;when cement has to be withheld from other tasks such as the urgent requirements of domestic housing.  They are claiming all the available supplies and, therefore, we cannot make any claim for a supply until the back of the domestic housing problem has been broken.  I do hope, however, early in the next financial year to set constructional work in progress with regard to the farm buildings scheme....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could also quote answers to questions he gave repeatedly on the same lines, that he could not go ahead with the farm building improvement schemes because they had not any materials, the materials that the Tánaiste proposes to provide for the further development of tourist camps.</P>

      <P>That is right.  We shall pass away from the Minister for Agriculture's excuse for not proceeding with the farm building scheme and we shall consider for a moment some of the arguments that have been put forward here to-day for the immediate provision of farm credit.  Last year the Minister for Finance, as I said, spoke for 36 columns of the Report, on the provision of finance, of capital, of credit for farm development.  A sum of £270,000,000 did not frighten him. In column 2147 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;£217,000,000 is not a frightening sum....  It is less than one year's national income, supposing we spent the whole of it at one go, but, of course, we could not do that.  There is a great need for investment in land, he says, and it is rated as highly as £217,000,000.  Can we get it?  Of course we can, and more.  I am not now talking about the £300,000,000 that we have abroad, the £300,000,000 that we shall never see, because it is being depreciated at a much faster rate than normally it could ever be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was no talk last year of saving a mere £750,000.  Deputy Davin was urging, as well as the Minister for Finance, that we should spend and create all the money we wanted for farm development and for other purposes.</P>

Deputies opposite will have to take responsibility for betraying the people who voted for them on the plea that they were going to give the farmers free manures, free credit to an unlimited extent, and were going to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent.  I should be glad to hear from the leader of Clann na Poblachta whether he proposes to carry out the promises he made to the electors in order to get the votes he got, or is he going to betray the voters who voted for him on the assumption that, if they elected to &ldquo;Give MacBride the reins of Government&rdquo;, as it was put, they were going to get free manures to an unlimited extent, free credit and that the cost of living would be reduced by 30 per cent.</P>

That is very far away from free manures, as the Minister for Defence will admit.

      <P>One other aspect of this particular Estimate that I am interested in is this: The Minister for Agriculture seems to me to be in process of substituting a system of blackguarding the people and blackmailing them into doing what he wants them to do at any moment for a rule of law.  It was within the competence of this Dáil to pass a law compelling the Dublin butchers or the butchers in any other part of the country to pay whatever price he liked to fix for beef.  He could have said they must pay a minimum of 100/- a cwt. or 105/- or 95/-, or whatever he liked to propose to the House.  Deputy Davin would have voted for it.  He would have borne one-seventy-fifth of the responsibility for that Bill.  But, instead of passing such a law, the Minister for Agriculture came into this House and started to blackguard the Dublin butchers for having done what <Col N="313" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce told them to do.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Whether it be the pork butchers or the beef butchers who try to strike at the agricultural community of this country, they will find that there are resources at the disposal of this Government which, if necessary, will be used to smash any conspiracy whencesoever inspired which seeks to destroy the farmers of this country or their livelihood.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We may not like the task of challenging the racketeers, but those who choose the road of racketeering do so at their own peril and when they learn the consequences and feel them, let them blame no one but themselves.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is rather violent language for a Minister to use to people who are carrying out the policy of his colleague. It has been ruled as not being Parliamentary to call it blackguarding them, but I would like any Deputy to give me some other word that will fit the facts.  I am only interested in this butchering aspect of it to point out the road that the Minister for Agriculture is travelling in leaving the rule of law and substituting blackmailing language in order to compel people to do what he thinks is right from day to day or that he thinks is politic from day to day.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture not only used violent language against the butchers, to compel them to do something which his colleague did not want them to do in regard to price, but he used very violent language against the people who have the temerity not to have departed from a policy in relation to breeding that he outlined a couple of years ago as being ideal for dairy farmers.  Deputy Corry quoted the Minister for Agriculture in his speech on this Estimate two years ago, in which he said that any dairy farmer who was not keeping Friesians was a cod and a fool.  Supposing any one went into Friesian cattle in order to avoid being called a cod and a fool by the then Deputy Dillon, what happened him the other day?  The Minister for Agriculture told the House the other day that the man who kept a Friesian herd, a Guernsey herd or a Jersey herd was an old maid and a crank.  He went on to call those herds of cattle the &ldquo;Pekinese brand&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I know there are a lot of old maids and cranks in this country who keep Jerseys and Guernseys and Friesians and the rest of them.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, we will get a little bit further.  In 2604, he talked about the treatment the &ldquo;Friesians and the rest of the Pekinese get&rdquo; and, half-way down, he talked about the Pekinese brand in relation to the same type of farmer who may have a Jersey, a Guernsey or a Friesian.  At the end of the same column he said: &ldquo;However, let those who yearn for the Pekinese breed...&rdquo; My complaint about the Minister is that, if he wants to make it illegal&mdash;wants to compel people&mdash;not to keep these breeds, he should promote a law prohibiting it. It is not right for him to be blackmailing the people of the country one day into keeping Friesian herds and, two years afterwards, into keeping the dual-purpose Shorthorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he proposes a Bill here, we can discuss it on its scientific merits and discuss it calmly, as to whether it is a proper policy to have only the dual-purpose Shorthorn breed or whether it would not be preferable to have one or two dairy breeds crossed by beef bulls that would give us good store cattle; or instead of depending upon the beef Shorthorn for good stores, which stores are indistinguishable from the progeny of the ordinary single dairy Shorthorn, it would not be better to have good <Col N="318" /> pure strains, either Shorthorn or Friesian or what not, of dairy stock and cross them with a beef bull, the progeny of which could be recognised by the eye.</P>
    <P>No one can say that they could tell, from the conformation of a Shorthorn bull or a Shorthorn cow or a Shorthorn calf, whether there is much milk behind it, but anyone who saw a cross of a Hereford with a Shorthorn or with a Friesian would know perfectly well that there was a Hereford cross in that particular calf.  If the Minister wants to scare the country and browbeat all the farmers into slaughtering all the Friesians and Guernseys, he should do it under a rule of law and should not be blackmailing them, in order to compel farmers to carry out the policy that seems good to him on this particular day.  Every time he gets up, he has a new brain wave, and no one knows whom he will call old maids and cranks to-morrow&mdash;it may be the people who are keeping a dual-purpose Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on one other occasion, departed from the system of law to the system of blackmail.  He said that he proposed this last spring to publish an advertisement that any farmer who had praiseach in his field was a lazy farmer.  Everyone will agree with the Minister for Agriculture that praiseach, or any other weed, will injure a crop, and that it is most unwise and uneconomic for a farmer to have praiseach or any other class of weed growing in his field from which he expects to get a good crop.  But there are all sorts of circumstances which might compel a farmer to have weeds in one of his fields, or even in a certain portion of his field.  The tumbling in of other crops that had to be dealt with might compel him to leave some portion of his field, or a whole field, in such a way that the weeds would get out of hand. Surely if in such circumstances there was a law that a man must not have weeds in his field he would be able to go to court and point out the circumstances to the judge.  The judge could take the circumstances into account, and if he did not find that there was a sufficient case made to warrant the weeds being in the field he could fine or imprison the man who allowed the <Col N="319" /> weeds to grow on his field.  But next year the Minister proposes, he says, to take the taxpayers' money and to publish an advertisement declaring that every person, fortunate or misfortunate, who happens to have praiseach in his field is a lazy farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in several speeches that he was going to keep the gaitered inspectors or the &ldquo;pip squeak&rdquo; inspectors, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce called them, outside the field.  Well, I think any farmer in the country would rather be subject to inspection by 100 inspectors, no matter how little he thought of them, rather than be subject to a system of slander at public expense in the newspapers. The Minister for Agriculture, in his opening speech, not only slandered the butchers, and slandered the people who keep Jersey, Friesian or Guernsey cattle, but he also proposes next year, at public expense, to buy space in the papers to slander the farmer who happens to have weeds in his fields.</P>
    <P>Now, I think there are other ways in which we could spend money.  We were so short of money this year that the Minister for Finance thought that he would save £500 on a certain type of advertisement.  How much does the Minister for Agriculture propose next year to spend in slandering the farmers of Ireland?  That is a question we would like him to answer before he concludes.</P>
    <P>I hope, in conclusion, that we are going to hear from Deputy Davin&mdash;that we are going to have the same type of speech from him now that he is the one-seventy-fifth part of the Government. I also hope that we are going to hear from Clann na Poblachta Deputies and from the Clann na Talmhan Deputies what they have to say now for the promotion of agriculture in substitution of what they used to say. That is an interesting point.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear from the Minister for Agriculture whether he proposes to embark upon the substitute policy that was put forward by the only Clann na Poblachta Deputy that I heard speak this afternoon&mdash; Deputy Kinane.  The Deputy advocated <Col N="320" /> that compulsory tillage should be allowed to go, but that for every two acres a man was compelled to till he should be compelled to keep a milch cow&mdash;no free manures for anybody but compulsory milch cows for everybody.  His other solution was not free manures for everybody, but nobody was to be allowed to export a heifer in calf.  How he was going to induce the farmers to produce in-calf heifers if he was going to cut away competition and restrict them to the prices on their flooded home market he did not say.  However, that was his solution&mdash;compulsory milch cows for everybody and no in-calf heifers to be exported.  I would say that it would take a number of inspectors to see that that was carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said one day that he would have no inspectors, but yesterday I thought I heard him interjecting to say that anyone who was going to feed wheat to pigs was going to get it in the neck.  I do not know how he is going to get the information &mdash;whether the pigs will tell him or whether, in fact, he is going to send out inspectors, and if the farmers are going to be subject to inspection.  The Minister said he is going to give it in the neck to the farmer who feeds wheat to pigs as indeed the farmer should get it in the neck.  Let there not be any mistake about my attitude on that, but how is he going to find that out without inspectors?  If the inspector has to stand outside the gate or outside the ditch until he is invited in by the farmer, how on earth is he going to find out whether or not the farmer is feeding wheat to the pigs?</P>
    <P>I think that the farmers, who have a great sense of freedom, according to certain Deputies here since the Minister for Agriculture made that worldshaking pronouncement that the inspectors would have to stay out until they were invited in, will find that the Minister for Agriculture will have changed his mind before very long about inspectors having to wait outside until they are invited in.  I trust, as I said to the farmers immediately after Deputy Davin took a 1/75th responsibility for Deputy Dillon that they would, in spite of Deputy Davin putting in Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="321" /> continue to grow wheat: that there was a serious situation in the world which might develop, a situation over which we have no control, and that we might find that our people, if they wanted bread, would have to depend on their own supplies of wheat to make that bread.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice that a fair bit of wheat has been grown this year and I trust that we will have a good harvest to give us a fair quantity of wheat from our own resources.  I hope that the Minister for Finance was completely wrong when he said that this year we were only going to produce from our own resources one-fifth of our requirements, or less than one-fifth. The Minister for Finance said in the Seanad that we were only going to produce 100,000 tons of millable wheat this year; the Minister for Agriculture corrected that, saying that we would have 200,000 tons.  Between them I do not know what amount of wheat we will have this year.  A further question is, what amount of wheat will be collected for the mills?</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputy Davin to use his one-seventy-fifth influence to make certain that the farmers are told now that in view of the situation, they must not feed to pigs or cattle wheat that is capable of being turned into flour for human beings.  Whether it is necessary to send one inspector or ten inspectors to see to it, it must not be done.  This Dáil is going to adjourn very shortly now, I understand, and it is advisable, no matter what our political differences may be or whatever cracks we give each other on occasion, that we should combine to ask the farmers not to use wheat that is fit for human consumption for feeding farm stock.  Our farmers should do everything they can to save all the wheat they can in the best possible condition and to make the best possible deliveries to the mills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that practically every aspect of the agricultural industry has been discussed already in this debate and in view of the agreement that was come to this morning that speeches should be as short as possible, I will not detain <Col N="322" /> the House for very long.  I wish to say, however, that owing to the foresight, the wisdom and perseverance of the Minister for Agriculture as well as the great confidence he has in himself, the farmers of this country have at long last got what they have been agitating for over a number of years, guaranteed prices and a remunerative foreign market.  Up to this, the farming industry was the Cinderella; prices fluctuated and we had slumps; prices would go up, rocket sky-high and then we would have a slump, with the result that the farmer was the one man in the community who, year in year out, had no security in his income.  He was dependent on the seasons; the weather might be good or bad but the professional man has his secure income at all times.</P>
      <P>The fact that the farmer had no security in that respect made him more conservative, less amenable to organisation and generally held out very little prospects for him, for his family or for his workers.  It is very gratifying, therefore, that our present Minister for Agriculture has raised the hope that that nightmare will disappear and that for the next four years at least, perhaps for considerably longer, the farmers will have a guaranteed price for their produce.  That will enable farmers to go ahead with their work with enterprise and initiative and in the hope and with the guarantee that they will have a price for their produce quite different from the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I would not be very long on this matter but there is just one subject that has not been touched upon except very briefly by Deputy Keane &mdash;cow testing.  We know that for a number of years the average milk yield of our cows has been declining.  That is clearly exemplified by the rates of milk at the creameries.  During the past 16 years I must say&mdash;and I am speaking from practical experience&mdash;that the cow-testing scheme for the development of dairy cattle generally was just barely tolerated.  No advance has been made in that direction worth speaking about and the hub of the industry, the supervisors of the cow-testing associations, have had no encouragement to get on with the work, with the result <Col N="323" /> that the scheme has just dragged on year in year out.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Report of the Commission on Post-War Agricultural Policy laid down a very definite and encouraging scheme for the development of cow testing and despite the fact that I got a promise in this House from Deputy Ryan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, and also from Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture, that the findings of this commission would be implemented, nothing has been done, with the result that the one way by which our dairy herds could be improved has been hopelessly neglected.  I think that is a great mistake and I am sure, from the pronouncements made by the present Minister for Agriculture to the dairy farmers in Mallow and elsewhere, that when he has time he will take the matter in hand and make sure that we will have a proper cow testing scheme on the lines laid down by the commission's report and that those who are practically the slaves of this scheme, the supervisors, will get adequate and proper remuneration for their work. That is very important and its importance might be explained in a few words.  We know that the average yield of 400 gallons per cow is entirely uneconomic, but in areas where the cow testing association has some 50,000 cows on test the average yield is 550 gallons.  If all the cows in the country were brought up to that standard&mdash;and it would not be impossible&mdash;it would mean in increased income for our dairy farmers of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 per year.  That is worth striving for and I hope the Minister for Agriculture will implement the findings of the Report of the Commission on Post-War Agricultural Policy and that that £3,000,000 will some fine day find its way into the pockets of the dairy farmers.  We would then have an increase in butter and an increase in that most valuable of all human foods, milk, which is so necessary and desirable for our young people.</P>
    <P>It is very deplorable that here in Dublin City and elsewhere an acute shortage of milk occurs at various times of the year.  I hope the Minister <Col N="324" /> will be able to devise a scheme whereby children attending national schools, whether in rural areas or cities, will get a certain amount of milk for their lunches.  That is impossible at the present time owing to the scarcity of milk. I hope the Minister will take his courage in both hands, as he is inclined to do, and implement the findings of the Commission on Post-war Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>As is well known, our grassland is suffering seriously from want of fertilisers. The produce of our tillage lands has been reduced owing to lack of fertilisers.  Not only is it essential that these fertilisers should be produced and obtained here but the price must be very substantially reduced. Speaking on this Estimate last year, I gave figures showing the difference between the cost of fertilisers here and in Northern Ireland and England.  I hope the Minister by some means, whether by subsidy or otherwise, will ensure that adequate supplies of fertilisers, as well as seeds, will be made available to the farmer during the coming and subsequent years.  It will be one way, and a very definite way, of increasing production from the land.</P>
    <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister on the elaborate scheme he has put forward for the development of the poultry industry.  In my opinion, that can be made one of the most valuable side lines of the agricultural industry. I have tremendous sympathy with farmers in the poorer districts, farmers with five, six, seven, eight or nine cows, who are living on poor land on which they cannot grow beet or wheat.  As we know, the pig industry has been practically killed in those areas and they have nothing to bring them in an income except the milch cow and the calf.  It is a good thing for these people that in future at the slack time of the year they will be able to derive a very substantial and desirable income from the poultry industry during the months of September, October, November and up to April.  That is a scheme that heartily commends itself to these people and it has been enthusiastically taken up through the country.  As time goes on and there are guaranteed prices for eggs, poultry of all kinds, <Col N="325" /> cockerels, pullets, day-old chicks, old fowl, etc., there should be a great future for that industry and it should be of particular value to cottiers and small farmers.</P>
    <P>I think practically every aspect of the farming industry has been touched upon except the particular one of trying to increase the milk yield of our cattle in order to produce more human food in the way of butter, cheese, and other by-products of milk for the people in the towns and cities as well as the rural areas and the desirability of putting a supply of milk and butter within the reach of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I believe that a great era of prosperity is before the agricultural industry generally and, when it does come, that prosperity will percolate to the towns and cities, because if the farmers are well-off, the villages, towns and cities automatically will be well-off. If the farming industry is not prosperous for one reason or another, there is no flow of money into the towns and cities and industrial works are held up for want of buying capacity.  Therefore, everything goes back to our primary industry and when that is in a state of prosperity the country generally is bound to benefit.  I am glad the Minister is taking the matter up so wholeheartedly and enthusiastically and, particularly, that farmers will have an assurance that for a number of years to come they will have guaranteed prices for all their produce.  That will mean that there will be more produce and the more there is the better it will be for all concerned. I strongly commend the attitude of the Minister in these respects and I hope he will succeed in the very ambitious and very onerous task which he has undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducting the Estimate for his Department, the Minister made a wide survey of the condition of the agricultural industry at the moment.  Having covered in the survey the productive capacity of the soil and the cattle, pig and poultry population, he found that the condition was anything but encouraging.  Naturally, he took a rather serious view of <Col N="326" /> the position as a result of that.  At the same time, he said he was not without hope that the agricultural industry was entering upon a period of expansion unknown hitherto.  I agree with the Minister that the condition in which the industry is at the moment is not very good.  As a matter of fact, in some respects I think it is worse even than the Minister pointed out, worse, at least, as far as those engaged in the industry are concerned.</P>
      <P>Tillage has been increased by practically 1,000,000 acres since pre-war and I think it is generally agreed that, even with that extended acreage, we have a smaller net return than we had when the land was in better fertility. Earlier this year I pointed out, when quoting some figures with regard to my area, that the milk supply to the Killeshandra Co-operative Creamery which, in 1936, was 5,000,000 gallons per year, had gone down by practically one-third. Therefore we have every evidence of decay and, as a result of that decay, naturally the cutting down of the return which the agriculturist has for his labour.</P>
      <P>Although I make the point that the return to the agriculturist is low, yet I have to admit that the prices of agricultural produce at the moment appear to be high.  They are so high, according to official figures, that the agricultural price index figure for last year, taken on the 1938 basis, was 225, while the cost-of-living index figure was only 97.  If these figures are to be taken as correct, we must assume that the agriculturist is getting an undue share of the national income at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, however, to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the agriculturist suffers very much from the comparison of these figures as they are there.  As most people are aware, the cost-of-living index and the agricultural produce index figures were compiled before the 1914-18 war. Therefore, we must relate the present figures to that period in order to get a true picture of the comparison at the moment.  The agricultural index price figures were taken over the years 1911, 1912 and 1913, while the cost-of-living figures were, I understand, taken for July, 1914.  It seems to me that it was <Col N="327" /> right that a three-years' period should be taken as a basis for the agricultural index figure.  One year would not be a correct basis.  For instance, if last year was taken as the basis with a very low yield from crops it would not be an accurate index of the position. I agree that a three-year basis was the correct one for an agricultural index.  On the other hand I cannot understand why one month&mdash;July, 1914 &mdash;was taken as the basis for the cost-of-living index.  One month could scarcely be a correct basis on which to base the cost of living.</P>
    <P>There is another factor involved.  I have been making inquiries and so far as I can find out there was, some time during that three-year period on which the agricultural price index was based &mdash;1911, 1912 and 1913&mdash;a very protracted outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  Any Deputy and any farmer will understand that a protracted period of foot-and-mouth disease has a very lowering effect on the price of live stock.  Yet that occurred during a period on which these cost-of-living figures were based.  Therefore, at the outset of that period, agriculture was placed at a disadvantage.  Tracing it from that origin we come to 1938 when the index was changed.  In 1938 the agricultural price index was only 111.9.  That means that it had gone up from 100 to 111.9 whilst the cost of living at the same time had gone up from 100 to 173.  That shows that agriculture was very low.  Another point is that at the same time clothing had gone up to 225 in comparison with the starting point of 100 in 1914.  It is clear, therefore, that agriculture has been placed at a gross disadvantage in taking the year 1938 as a base for present index.  From that period, 1938, we now reach the figures I quoted at the outset.  The agricultural price index at the moment is 225 whilst the cost-of-living index is only 97.  What appears to be great prosperity in agriculture by the figure of 225 in comparison with the figure of 97 is not correct. Furthermore, the 1947 figure for clothing is 100.  If we take the figure 111.9 as the 1938 base, to which this 225 at the present time is related, and for <Col N="328" /> easy calculation multiply it by 2¼&mdash; that means 2¼ times its base of 112&mdash; that would bring the agricultural price index at the moment to 252 over the 1911 to 1914 basis, whilst at the same time the cost-of-living figure was 97 for 1947.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the House. I will raise that figure to 100 for the purposes of easy calculation&mdash;in reality it was 99 in February of the present year, so I am not being unjust grossly. That means double its 1938 base of 173, which brings it up to 346.  On the basis of calculation, from its original base in 1914&mdash;agriculture stands at 252 &mdash;the cost-of-living figure stands at 346. At the same time clothing from its 1914 basis stands somewhere around 500.  I want to point out how unfair calculations can be, and how they can misrepresent the position by making it seem one of comparative prosperity.  I hope I have succeeded in pointing out that agriculture has not got justice in these comparisons.  I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week and I was assured by him that the period of the cost-of-living index was under consideration but that no definite decision had yet been arrived at.  I hope&mdash;I am now addressing the Minister for Agriculture who, I regret, is not here at the moment&mdash;that he will see to it that the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not base the new period for the cost-of-living index in a way that will place agriculture at such a disadvantage. In view of that, I see no hope of keeping people on the land if there is not a more even distribution of the national income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan quoted some time ago &mdash;I think he quoted from a White Paper which was published in 1938&mdash;to the effect that of the national income the amount each individual engaged in the agricultural industry was earning was £60 per annum whereas the nonagriculturist was earning £177 per annum.  If that were the case in 1938 I think we can hardly say that the ratio has changed since.  If that state of affairs is to continue what inducement is there to anyone to engage in the agricultural industry?  We blame the people who are flying from the land but how can we hope to keep them <Col N="329" /> there unless there is a redistribution of the national income so that the agriculturists will not be at the disadvantage they now are.  These people are the most important section of the community. This State depended on the farmer, with the aid of his paid labourers and the unpaid family labourers, to carry the people through during the years of the emergency. They produced the food for the people and by doing so they depleted the fertility of their land.  The numbers of their live stock were also depleted.  The Minister for Agriculture gave the relevant figures in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>A word about the agricultural labourers.  It is customary for all speakers to say that they are anxious to raise the standard of the agricultural labourer.  I wish to join in that appeal.  In doing so I make no pretence of being a hypocritical philanthropist.  I do so for a selfish reason, namely, that I myself was brought up on a small farm such as is typical of the county from which I come.  To give the Deputies some idea of the relative size of the farms in that county, of the 16,000 odd farms something in the region of 12,000 are under 30 acres.  From a selfish reason, therefore, I want to see the family labourer get as good a wage as the hired labourer.  The agricultural labourer, in comparison with the city worker, receives only 55/- a week.  The family labourer has not been getting anything like that.  I hold that the farmer does not get even as much as would pay the labourer the minimum wage.  That is an understatement of the position.  In proof of that, I hold that the farmer is not getting as much himself as he is paying his labourer; and I would point to the fact that the organisation of which I have been secretary for the past 12 years issued a challenge to the two preceding Ministers for Agriculture.  We challenged them to take over an averaged-sized farm in each county and find out for themselves if it would pay the hired labourer even the minimum rate of wages and at the same time show a profit.</P>
    <P>I have joined with another Deputy in this House in issuing the same challenge <Col N="330" /> to the present Minister.  The two preceding Ministers refused to take up the gauntlet.  It remains to be seen if the present occupant of the post will accept it.  If he, too, refuses to accept, then we shall take it that he is as well aware, as were his predecessors, that the farmer is not getting as much as his labourer.  Only time will prove if that is correct.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about milk production.  There has been a considerable reduction in milk production over the past ten years.  It is difficult to estimate exactly what that reduction means in our agricultural economy as a whole.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that over the past ten years the average milk yield of the cows has gone down by as much as 100 gallons per cow.  In proof of that I shall quote figures of a cow testing association in my county.  Within the past few weeks Kilnacrott Cow Testing Association held its annual meeting.  It was attended by Mr. R. M. Bloomer, of the Department of Agriculture.  The supervisor, in his report, stated that 69 cows had completed their lactation period last year with an average milk yield of 4,572 lbs., a decrease of 849 lbs. on the previous year, with an average test of 3.30; and butter fat yield of 138.6 lbs., a decrease of 59.13 lbs., with an annual return of £16 16s. 10d. per cow last year.</P>

      <P>Kilnacrott, Mount Nugent.  Cow testing has been referred to more than once during the debate and I am very interested in cow testing.  At the same time the figures are not a complete indication of the actual conditions that prevail in the dairy industry throughout the country. I have analysed the figures of another cow-testing association in my county, <Col N="332" /> that is Milltown.  That association started operations in 1940 with 185 cows with an average milk yield of 4,663 lbs., a butter fat of 186.86&mdash;not a bad average with which to start. The following year the figure had gone up to 4,745 lbs., but the butter fat had dropped to 177.11.  In 1942 the average milk yield was 4,668 lbs. and the butter fat 174.65; in 1943 the average milk yield was 4,558 lbs. and the butter fat 172.93; in 1944 there were 115 cows and the average milk yield was 4,287 lbs. and the butter fat 158.18 lbs.; in 1945 the milk yield was 4,660 lbs. and the butter fat 180.42; in 1946 the yield was 4,918 lbs. and there were 190.93 lbs. of butter fat.  That is the last year for which I have figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The milk yield has gone up steadily?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has increased in those years by 225 lbs. per cow and the butter fat has also increased by 4 lbs I am sure the figures for all cow-testing associations should show something similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought a few minutes ago you were making the case that the average yield had gone down 100 gallons per cow?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making that claim for cows all over the State.  That cow-testing association was as closely related as possible to a creamery area. In the Milltown co-operative creamery, from which area this cow-testing association has drawn its members, while the milk supply to the local creamery in the first year of operation was 286,457 gallons, in 1946 it had dropped to 226,169 gallons.  Whilst in 1936 it was 366,191 gallons.  I submit that is a very considerable drop.  In spite of the fact that cow testing in the area showed a tendency to increase, the milk supply went down.  We can take the figures for that cow-testing association as representing the condition of the dairying industry all over the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the number of suppliers to the creamery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know Taking all these figures into consideration, I think we can say that the dairy <Col N="333" /> industry is not in a sound or healthy condition.  To my mind, the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925 has had a bad effect on the dairy cows of the State. I am not without admitting that the starvation consequent on the depletion of soil fertility has had a very serious effect on the milk yields, but, at the same time, it is my experience that, starting with a herd of fairly good Shorthorn cows, I find in breeding from the bulls that were licensed by the Department's inspectors the milk yield of the heifers from those cows has been steadily going down, with the result that, although I have not had to go to the fair to buy many heifers to replace the older cows, the average had gone well down.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, an effort must be made to pay more attention to milking properties, even with the Shorthorn cows.  I admit I am a Shorthorn fan.  I claim the milking properties have gone down considerably, and until they are restored, either through breeding or considerably through feeding, the dairy industry cannot get on a proper footing so as to be profitable to the producers and it cannot supply milk and butter to the people of the State, much less have anything to export.</P>
      <P>That takes me to the question of milk prices.  In face of the figures which I have given I think a claim can be made for a higher price for milk as an encouragement to people to continue in the industry.  I admit that I am, drawing into rather dangerous ground, ground into which I am sorry I have been drawn, because it is more or less getting into a family quarrel&mdash;that is, a quarrel between the ex-Minister for Agriculture and the present Minister for Agriculture.  As everyone knows, anyone interfering in a family quarrel is likely to come in for hard knocks.  In view of what the ex-Minister, Deputy Smith, said when he was speaking on Friday, and again yesterday, I can hardly let the occasion pass without at least a word of explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was hoping for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith referred to a new Deputy in the House who, while Deputy Smith was Minister for <Col N="334" /> Agriculture, and previously, had been advocating higher prices for milk.  He said that now that I was in a definite position, through having taken a hand in putting the present Minister for Agriculture into office, he was anxious to know&mdash;he referred to Deputy Cogan and to myself&mdash;if we had taken any steps to force the present Minister to give the prices which we said at one time that he should have given.  I want to assure Deputy Smith that I am as anxious now for the same prices as I asked then.  I did not have to wait for the urge of Deputy Smith to put the matter before the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In passing, let me say to Deputy Smith that, in so far as the present Minister for Agriculture holds office, I have not been consulted and I have had no part in putting him into the position he holds.  Being an Independent Deputy, I can only speak for myself.  The implication of Deputy Smith was that the Independent group selected Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  I was not consulted as to who should be appointed to any Ministry, and, therefore, I have not had, as Deputy Smith suggested, any hand in putting the present Minister in office.  I hope I have made myself quite clear on that point.</P>
      <P>Early in my period as a Deputy, I put a question to the present Minister asking for an increased price for milk. On the 4th May, in Volume 110, column 1027, of the Parliamentary Debates, the following appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. P. O'Reilly asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the decline in butter production by practically one-third since 1936, and the statutory increase in agricultural labourers' wages of 11/- per week, coupled with a serious increase in local rates since the present price of milk supplied to creameries was arranged last year, he will consider arranging for an increased price for milk to the farmer to cover his extra cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: The cost to the Exchequer of maintaining the present prices of milk for the farmer and of butter for the consumer is over £2,250,000 annually.  Any increase in the price of milk delivered to <Col N="335" /> creameries would add very substantially to that charge on public funds, and could not, in present circumstances, be justified, but as improved methods of grassland management make the realisation of our aim to produce butter from growing grass more proximate, the consequent reduction in our costs of production should materially increase the dairy farmers' profit and that is what matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then put the following supplementary question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the fact that the prospects outlined may take years to accomplish and that the costs of production have considerably increased at the present time, does the Minister think it is just to compel the farmer to sell his product at the same price as he had been selling it at when the weekly wage of the worker was 11/- less than it is at the moment, and when the farmers' rates were lower than they are at the present time?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Deputy says that this development may take years to mature, he is apparently overlooking the fact that I am now Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to refer for a moment to these replies.  I think the House will have to admit that these were perfectly fair questions, urged by my desire, and by the instructions of those who put me here, to get what they considered was a price that would pay them at least a labourer's wage for their work in the production of milk for butter. I must say that I was dissatisfied with the Minister's reply.  I did not show signs of it because once one goes into public life, one must be prepared to take it &ldquo;tough.&rdquo;  At the same time, I felt the agricultural industry was not being properly treated.  The point made by the Minister that £2,250,000 annually was the sum that was being paid in subsidy for milk production does not appear to me in the same light as it appears to him and, as it appears, I am sure, to a great many other people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I am going to make a claim which, so far as I know, no other Deputy has made so far.  I know I shall be tripped up on it.  Nevertheless, I make it and it is this: there is no subsidy for the agricultural producer on anything. There is a subsidy for the consumer of agricultural produce.  The first charge on any industry is the cost of production and until that is given, in the form of the price which the produce brings to the producer, there can be no question that any aid is given from an outside source.  It is only right that anyone engaged in the production of any commodity should get the cost of production, and in the case of milk, the cost of production is the upkeep of the cows, the cost of labour, if paid for, and if it is not paid for, if it is family labour, the producer is still entitled to be paid for it.  I claim that cost is not being given, and if there is any suggestion that £2,250,000 of the taxpayers' money is being given to the agricultural producer for milk.  I say that is not correct.  So much for Deputy Smith's taunt to me that I was not fighting for a price for the agricultural producer.</P>
    <P>I asked a further question as to the cost of producing pigs on the 13th May, as reported in Volume 110, No. 12, of the Official Debates.  The question I put was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether his Department has any figures of the cost of production of pigs on home-produced foods, such as potatoes, compound meals and separated milk at present, and whether he will take steps to ensure that those persons who are endeavouring to preserve the industry shall at least get their costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of pig production on home-produced foods depends largely on the cost of production of the various foods used.  These costs vary from farm to farm and it is not practicable, in present circumstances, to collect figures on which a reliable national average could be based. From such information as is available, however, I would say that the present prices for bacon pigs cover <Col N="337" /> the cost of production where the pig rearers themselves grow most of the food required and show reasonable efficiency in their methods of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then asked the following supplementary question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can the Minister say that the Pigs and Bacon Commission accept the statement that it takes 22 cwts. of potatoes to produce 1 cwt. of pork for bacon and, in view of the present market value of 14/- per cwt. for table potatoes and even taking a lower value of 10/- per cwt. for ware potatoes for pig feeding, does he think the present price for bacon pigs is adequate to cover the cost of production?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel quite certain that the Deputy and the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Commission will agree with me that a pig can no more live on 22 cwts. of potatoes than he or I could live on blancmange.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I claim that was not a satisfactory answer.  Later on, as a matter of fact I think it was on the same occasion, I made an effort to get in a further supplementary, but the Chair, with all respect, owing to some confusion which arose, passed on to the next question and so I did not get an opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I did not describe it properly.  Taking the Minister's reply, that he believed that the present price of £9 10s. 0d. per cwt. was adequate to pay the cost of producing pigs for the farmers who produced the bulk of the food required and who showed reasonable efficiency in doing so, and, furthermore, my supplementary in which I suggested that <Col N="338" /> it took 22 cwts. of potatoes to produce 1 cwt. of pork and his reply, which implied that that was not a balanced ration, with which I agree, I would suggest a substitute ration which would be made up as follows:&mdash;17 cwts. of potatoes at 10/- per cwt., amounting to £8 10s. 0d.; 1 cwt. of maize meal or even of compound meal, 28/- per cwt.; skim milk, 10/-.  That would give a total of £10 8s. 0d.  There is nothing allowed in that calculation for the cost of fire, labour and the risk of loss. If, with food grown on the farm it costs £10 8s. 0d. to produce 1 cwt. of pork, without taking into account the cost of labour and the risk of loss, how can the Minister claim that pork can be produced and sold profitably at £9 10s. 0d. per cwt.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would want to be more than £10 8s. 0d.  I am not giving any figure for the cost of fire, the cost of labour or the risk of loss, and I would say that it would want to be considerably higher than £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I have not accurate figures for these items and I will not put up a figure on which I cannot stand.  If the Minister wants to encourage either milk production or pig production, prices must be increased.  I see no hope of doing either, unless that is done, and, so far at least as milk production is concerned, it is a matter of concern not alone for the people engaged in milk production, but for the people of the cities and towns, because, with the present very remunerative prices for store cattle, there is a great temptation to those who have been engaged in milk production for a long number of years to reduce it still further.  The actual figures of milk production for the present year will not bear out what I say at the moment, in comparison with last year.  I understand that there have been increased supplies of milk to creameries in the present year, but that, I hold, is due to the mild spring <Col N="339" /> and consequent improvement in grass. The temptation, however, is there to turn over to the production of stores, particularly on those farms where hired labour has to be employed.</P>

      <P>The fact remains at the moment that, having a much lesser labour content, it offers a better prospect for the farmer who has to carry on with hired labour.  Self-preservation is the first law of nature and he must turn to what yields him the greatest prospect of reward.</P>
      <P>I think it was a mistake for the Minister to have made these clever replies which were made here, because they have a discouraging effect on the people down the country.  I find, in moving amongst the people who put me here, that there is much greater resentment on their part than on mine by reason of the replies the Minister gave, and I appeal to him, for the sake of the future of the industry over which he now presides and the conditions of which we are all aware he is very anxious to improve&mdash;there is no question about his sincerity in that respect&mdash;to adopt a more reasonable attitude towards the people engaged in the industry.  It is a mistake for the leader of any Department to antagonise the people whom he proposes to lead.  I claim that he will not get the same results as he would get if he adopted a more reasonable rather than slight.  I hope that my attitude, an attitude of encouragement intervening in the family quarrel between the Minister and the ex-Minister will not bring a ton of bricks down on my head, but, if it does, I hope I will survive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am possibly the last of the newcomers to this House and I waited very specifically for this debate to make this, my maiden speech.  I naturally had a very specific reason for waiting for this debate, it being that I come from an area which is described as the premier dairying county in Ireland, Limerick.  I felt <Col N="340" /> very pleased on Friday last when I heard the Minister for Agriculture paying a tribute to the former Minister, Dr. Ryan, for introducing the farm improvements scheme.  I appreciate that very much.  As a working farmer in West Limerick, with a practical knowledge of this scheme, I should like to tell the Minister and Deputies that more drainage under this scheme has been done in County Limerick than in any area of its size in the State.  The Department's figures, I am sure, will bear this out, which goes to prove that the part of Limerick I come from is not wholly or solely in the Golden Vale.</P>
      <P>In selecting the farm improvements scheme as No. 1 on my programme, I do so for the purpose of appealing for a 60 per cent. grant towards the total cost as against 50 per cent. of the labour cost of five years ago, when wages were 25 per cent. lower.  I think the Minister and every Deputy will admit that drainage is the most reproductive of all the works under this scheme.  More manual labour and more skill is required than in the case of other works.  In the congested area of West Limerick from which I come, it takes an average of 16 to 18 perches for main drains and 60 to 70 perches of minor drainage to the statute acre. In support of my appeal for 60 per cent. rather than 50 per cent., I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister this very important fact.  Many farmers, to my knowledge, quarry stones and cart them six or eight miles for this work and pay 3/- to 5/- for each horse load at the quarry.  It takes two good loads of stones to do three perches of drains which gives an idea of the cost, apart from the labour of excavating and closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy will admit that we had practically no field drainage in this country for the past 30 or 40 years, until this scheme was started, and in fact I will say that the farmers had almost lost the art of drainage.  Were it not for the six or seven years' constant instruction and supervision by the Department's officers, hundreds of our farmers would have lost the art, which in itself is an answer to the Minister in the matter of inspectors going inside the ditches <Col N="341" /> and boundaries of our farms.  I should like the Minister to take note of this fact, which I repeat: the art of drainage was lost, were it not for the fact that officers of the Department of Agriculture were there to instruct and supervise.  The work now done is far superior to any work done for the past 50 or 60 years.  I heard the Minister pay a tribute to the old Board of Works, but I say that the work done in the past five or six years is far superior to any work done by the old Board of Works, or even by the old landlords.  If my words are doubted I invite any Deputy to come down to West Limerick and see for himself the work which has been executed west of the Mullach an Radhach range on the low-lying land around Newcastle West and Drumcollogher.</P>
    <P>I come now to the point which Deputy O'Reilly made with regard to potatoes.  This has been my own experience in West Limerick.  I have seen from ten to 12 tons of potatoes per acre produced on land which was drained under the scheme and which formerly had been useless.  If we are to balance our economy I see no better way than to reclaim the thousands of acres that could be reclaimed so as to feed our pigs and poultry instead of looking for uncertain supplies of maize from the Argentine and the United States.  When the dollar pool has been drained we must then come back again and drain the cut-away bogs to feed our live stock. The policy of the pig in Ireland and the plough in the Argentine is a bad policy.  It is an unwise policy.  It is a most uncertain policy.  Many of my neighbours have increased their cows by 20 or 30 per cent. by reclaiming land and have been able to have more winter feeding per head than formerly.</P>
    <P>I would like, for purposes of comparison, to mention one point and to bring it home very forcibly to the Minister, especially in connection with the new scheme which he recently initiated for the Counties of Mayo and Galway.  The grants paid for drainage under what we will call the &ldquo;Dr. Ryan scheme&rdquo; usually cost the State about £8 per acre and the work generally costs the farmer from £20 to £25.  I wonder will the drainage in Galway <Col N="342" /> and Mayo cost the State £30 per acre and will it be as well done?  Farmers have told me that they would not let unskilled men in to drain their land, even if the Minister for Agriculture paid them.  I will tell the Minister why.  A badly made drain or a burst drain will definitely leave the land in a worse state than it was formerly. There is no way in which intensive drainage can be so efficiently and so economically carried out&mdash;I am sure the Minister will agree with me&mdash;as under the supervision of the owner with labour selected and employed by him.</P>
    <P>I hope I am keeping within the terms of the debate.  I am trying, this being my maiden speech, to do the best I can.  Probably I waited too long but it never harms a man to sit, to listen and to learn.  I got the point from Deputy O'Reilly about feeding pigs on a ration of maize and skim milk.  I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the aid of his experts and the officials of his Department, can challenge me now or later in this House, but I would like to tell him that 12 tons of potatoes from one reclaimed acre will fatten ten pigs and there will be enough seed for another acre.  It will take three tons of Argentine maize, paid for by dollars, to feed the same number.  Is that any guide to our future economy?  If the Minister is prepared to abandon his wheat quota, he might replace it with a potato quota secured from the reclaimed land, not alone in West Limerick, but in many other counties in Eire.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with another matter under the heading of farm improvements. Fences, of course, are a most necessary part of the work of land reclamation.  They provide shelter as well as drainage in addition to the ordinary uses associated with them.  I have listened to the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Lands and I have seen Deputies on my right, especially Deputies from Mayo and Galway, who struck me as being completely absorbed by one main subject, namely, land.  I listened also to the debate on forestry.  I heard very few Deputies giving any indication that they were greatly concerned about <Col N="343" /> forestry.  The Minister, as I have already indicated, paid a very well-deserved tribute to Deputy Dr. Ryan. I appreciate that.  But we who live in rural Ireland would like that, in conjunction with the farm improvements scheme, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands would agree that for every £10, say, given in the form of a grant for farm improvement there would be a grant of £1 at least for the purpose of putting down shelter belts.  The Minister has told us that he has at his office about 35,000 to 36,000 applications under the farm improvements scheme.  If we could get 35,000 farmers in any financial year to plant 35,000 shelter belts, the Minister would be surprised at the transformation that would take place in many very barren areas.  We should all be united in that common purpose. Whether we are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or anything else, the important thing is to improve the general estate, which is Eire.</P>
    <P>There is another important heading under the farm improvements scheme, that is, the provision of grass silos.  I said in my opening remarks that more drainage has been done in County Limerick than in any other county of its size.  I go further and say that more grass silos have been erected in County Limerick under the scheme than there have been in a dozen other counties put together.  The grants for these, I think, should be increased by 50 per cent.  There is no better way of helping the dairying industry and helping the rearing of calves.  The Minister will readily understand that most of these silos have been filled during the past few weeks.  When artificial manures become plentiful, I look forward to there being a silo on every farm of eight to ten cows. Some farmers in portions of West Limerick have two or three silos already.</P>
    <P>All County Limerick is not blessed with a great rainfall.  In my place we get a break from the Brandon Mountains and possibly have too much water, but there are some parts, immediately west of the Mullach an Radhach <Col N="344" /> range, where for years dairy farmers have been seriously handicapped through lack of water.  Under this scheme, there are water tanks for the storage of rainwater.  Tanks to hold several thousand gallons have been put up in Drumcollogher and other areas bordering County Cork.  They never went up until the scheme came in.  In dry periods I have seen two or three men employed daily with horses and carts in carting water.  The grant was not sufficient to buy the cement, but notwithstanding that, it was largely availed of.</P>
    <P>Farm roads have been built under this scheme which would be a credit to any county council, often in remote places.  The grants for this were only 10/- per perch.  I know men who quarried and carted stones two or three miles and paid £3 10s. per day to the owners of stone crushers to make the roads.  I waited specially for this particular Vote in order to subscribe to this farm improvements scheme, as I realise that it has been of tremendous importance to the people, especially in West Limerick.  In view of the increase in agricultural wages and materials and the great reproductive value of this work, I appeal to the Minister to extend the good work of his predecessors and increase the grants under all the headings I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister this grand and glorious statement, leaving it to his own judgment to guess the author.  It has a very direct and important national application to our country:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Remain faithful to the earth: it will always give something to eat to those who work it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I come to the burning question that has been debated in this House for years before I came in.  The farmers in County Limerick sent me because they believed, not alone in my sincerity but in my fighting ability, no matter who was in power, to try to do something to improve the condition of the dairy farmers in the County Limerick.  On Friday last and yesterday, I listened to Deputy Smith making what, notwithstanding what Deputy Madden said about him last night, I <Col N="345" /> thought was the finest speech ever made in this House.  It lasted four and a quarter hours.  I thought the record of the late Miss Mary MacSwiney of Cork would never be broken, but I am glad to say that if anyone broke that grand and glorious record of the scorching attack on the Treaty in Dublin in 1921 and 1922, it fell to the lot of Deputy Smith.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly drove home a very hard and true fact when he interjected in the speech of Deputy Smith that it was costing the Government £2,250,000 to subsidise our dairy industry.  The Minister should be prepared to ask his Government for a further increase to subsidise dairying.  I make no apology as to where the money can be got, so long as I can, in my own way, make a decent effort to improve the lot of the dairy farmers in Limerick.  I am a believer in the golden rule that the customer should pay for everything.</P>
    <P>Deputy Madden said last night that he was tired of visiting the former Minister, Deputy Smith, and prior to that Deputy Ryan, on behalf of the dairy farmers of Limerick.  I am surprised the Deputy did not tell this House, so that we could have it on record and publish it in the <i>Limerick Leader</i> or the <i>Limerick Guardian</i>, that quite recently&mdash;some time in the month of May&mdash;a very respectable deputation of the dairy farmers of Limerick was introduced by Deputy Madden to the Minister.  The Minister is pretty well aware that at least four-fifths of that deputation, who came up from that dairying county of Limerick, were 100 per cent. Fine Gael adherents.  They came up&mdash;I will give the men their due &mdash;to make a decent fight&mdash;they themselves being dairymen&mdash;for the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not misquoting the result of the findings of that interview. If I am, I have the man who led them sitting here on my right.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister is a very busy man he entertained the deputation for two and a half hours.  My information is that he simply lectured them on what they should do in the County Limerick to improve dairying conditions.  By <Col N="346" /> way of preface, I should say that before Deputy Madden brought up the deputation from the County Limerick, the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture, I understand, on at least two occasions, had invited the Minister down to Limerick.  He refused to go down to discuss dairying conditions with that committee which represents the premier dairying county in Ireland for the reason that he was a new Minister and had not time to go.</P>
    <P>I could be critical and say things, but I do not intend to do that, because, in my opinion, you never get any dividends from doing so.  Anyhow, the Minister did not go down.  The deputation came up and the Minister started off by severely criticising the county committee of agriculture and Deputy Madden for being so unreasonable as to expect him to go to Limerick at all.  At the same time, he emphasised that he was a very busy man since he had assumed office, and that he had no time for the grievances of the farmers in the County Limerick in regard to the price of milk.  He then lectured the deputation and he tried to convince them that he was a real champion of the agricultural interest with an absolute knowledge of agriculture and of the dairying industry from A to Z.  In other words, he assumed to himself that he was the dispenser of knowledge and the dispeller of gloom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Now there is a point I would like to make in connection with something that transpired between the Minister and the deputation.  He assured the deputation that by the policy he was about to inaugurate, whereby he was going to give us two months' extra grass in the year, he <Col N="347" /> would change the whole economy, so to speak, of our dairying industry.  He hoped that by next spring he would be able to propagate, by new strains of grasses, the pastures of Limerick with a higher feeding value.</P>
      <P>I referred to silos a little time ago. I am an absolute believer in silos, but I am not an absolute believer, although I am here to be convinced in this, that the Minister's policy of two months' extra grass in the County Limerick is going to be a success.  I will tell the Minister why.  With all due respect, the Minister is basing his political arguments on some report that he received from an expert in New Zealand or elsewhere.  When the Minister makes comparisons with countries like New Zealand, I would like to tell him that in New Zealand they have ten months of growth and two months of dormancy.  The climate is so mild in the dairying districts that they do not need even to house their cattle.  I wonder had the Minister considered the climatic and geographical conditions of this country when speaking so much about his two months' extra grass.  Let us, for instance, take this past spring.  As we all know, we had a beautiful soft month of March.  There was a grand soft growth in that month, but what happened?  In the County Limerick, where we are in the habit of putting in early potatoes, we just had them, so to speak, shooting above the ground when we got bad April frosts that simply cut them down.  That in itself should be a clear indication to the Minister that what is a sound logical economy for a country like New Zealand can be a very doubtful and very unwise policy for this country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be considered as an absolute critic altogether.  I should like to be constructive and to contribute in my own little way some constructive ideas on this matter.  I put it to the Minister that he should get down to the principle and the policy of encouraging people to put up silos. If we do that we will be doing something useful and can forget about foreign feeding for our dairy stock and dairy cows and for the rearing of our calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> I come back now to the important factor, and that is the price of milk and where the money is going to be got.  I do not mind whether the Minister has to go to the Minister for Finance or, indeed, where he has to go to get the money, but I am going to make a serious effort in this House to try to bring home to him that agriculture is the basic industry of this country and that, unless it is prosperous, no other industry in the country can be prosperous, because it is only on the spending ability of the farmer classes and on the wealth that they actually produce from the land that our other industries can draw the money that will enable them to carry on.  I would like to see my Labour friends realise that fact.  Possibly we will be putting them to the test in the very near future&mdash;that every businessman, every wage earner and every labourer in the country is entirely dependent on the farmer for his wages.</P>

Deputy McAuliffe cannot convince me that if the dairy farmers in North Cork are struck down the agricultural labourers in North Cork will not be struck down too.  I am sorry the Minister has gone.</P>
      <P>With regard to the price of milk, there is one point that I would like to bring home to the Minister for Agriculture. He says that he cannot go to the Government and ask for a figure greater than £2,500,000 in order to keep our basic industry agriculture, and the dairy industry, the backbone of the Irish nation, on their feet.  If he does not like to go to the Government, possibly the reason he would put forth in support of it is this magic figure known as the cost-of-living index, which is a thing that all Governments and all Parties play up to.  My conception of this magic figure is that we all try to keep the cost of living down for the wage-earning classes; that is the important thing we are all interested in. I would like to tell Deputy Dunne and the other Labour Deputies who are here for Dublin that 75 per cent. of the wage-earning classes of the country are housed in greater Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire.  That means there is 25 per cent. in the balance of the area in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

      <P>The wage-earning classes, my dear friend Deputy Davin, whether they be white-shirted, greyshirted or not shirted at all.  The point I want to make in connection with that argument is that in County <Col N="350" /> Limerick it takes 2.29 gallons of milk to produce 1 lb. of butter and for the same quantity of milk the housewives of the wage-earning classes in greater Dublin and Dún Laoghaire are paying 6/8d.  We have unfortunately only 6 ozs. per head of butter as our ration, which at the subsidised price costs roughly 1/- per head.  If the Deputies on the Labour Benches and on the other benches associated with the Government are seriously concerned with preserving the dairy industry on a sound footing they must be prepared to do something to keep it there. In England, for instance, the basic industry is coal, but our basic industry is agriculture.  If the cost of production of coal in England goes up any points, the costings can be passed on to the subsidiary industries, but when the costings go up in the dairy industry here who are we to pass it on to?</P>

Deputy Dunne and the other Labour Deputies would be on their heels in an uproar if the cost-of-living index went up.  At the moment the butter ration costs 1/-per head per week.  If we could induce an average family of five or six people &mdash;or people who are interested in the dairy industry would help and Deputy Madden would help to induce them&mdash;to increase the cost of milk to the farmers it would increase the price of the present ration by twopence.  That is an increase of 1/- per week to an average family.  We could then guarantee an all-round price of ¼ per gallon to the dairy farmers, not alone in Limerick, but in Cork, Kilkenny, Tipperary and elsewhere.  I may be censured by the Labour Deputies for making such a suggestion, because by <Col N="351" /> making it, I am encouraging a rise in the magic figure, the cost-of-living index.</P>

      <P>In making the demand that we should pass on the increased price of butter to the wage-earning classes and the others, I should like to say that the actual producers, the farming community, consume one-fifth of the total production of butter in this country, because they are entitled, owing to their supplies of milk to the creameries, to an extra ration over and above what an ordinary person is entitled to receive.  We had a bread strike recently in Dublin and the cost of living factor was a very important matter in connection with that.  The <Col N="352" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce told the master bakers that they would get no relief from his Department. The result was that they passed on the increase which was given to the bakers to the consumers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin need not have any doubts about that.  They passed on the increased cost to the consumer.  If the Minister for Agriculture is in any way reluctant about going to the Minister for Finance and asking him to provide the funds or the wherewithal to give the dairy farmers an increased price for milk&mdash;Deputy Madden last night asked for ? per gallon; I will be more moderate and say that the dairy farmers of Limerick will be satisfied if they get ¼ a gallon all the year round&mdash;I would suggest that he would put the points which I have made before the Minister.  I think Labour Deputies representing Dublin would hardly disagree if we asked the ordinary householder in Dublin for a weekly subscription, so to speak, of 1/- in order to keep that basic industry on a sound, firm footing, especially as the dairying industry is the backbone of the nation.  I do not think any family in Dublin would be reluctant to contribute that extra amount.  We must realise that from the dairy industry we get a large number of subsidiary industries.  We have the condensed milk industry, the cheese industry, the tinned cream industry, the skimmed milk industry and other industries which are dependent on the by-products of milk.  I was listening to Deputy Hickey's speech and I was really surprised that a man with a city mentality should have such a fine, thorough grasp of the conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what Deputy MacEntee called him.  As <Col N="353" /> a newcomer to this House making my maiden speech I think I am entitled to a fair hearing.  I am doing my best.  I would not be scared by anybody.  What I think and how I feel is a matter for myself.  Not even the Minister for Agriculture, who has all the art and guile of the old Parliamentary school, would upset me.  I will stick to my guns.  Deputy Hickey was making a comparison between the milk yields and the milk production in Southern and Northern Ireland.  While his point was, I think, a very important one, I should like to answer him in this way. When he accuses us, so to speak, in County Limerick, County Cork and County Tipperary of dropping down on our milk production, I should like to inform him that that was not the fault of our farmers, because during the war they had plenty of fertilisers in Northern Ireland but we had none at all in Southern Ireland.  The British Government were never considerate to us except it suited their own book.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister talking about phosphates, basic slag, etc.  I should like to get from the Minister a very clear assurance on the question of ground limestone.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, had a scheme for that which I have no doubt he would have put into operation. The present Minister, I think, stated that he is handing over this particular scheme to private individuals. If that is so, I should like to ask him what steps, if any, have been taken to initiate a scheme for the farmers of West Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has abandoned the principle of the scheme prepared by his predecessor, Deputy Smith, I should like him to inform me what steps if any are being taken to put the lime scheme in operation in County Limerick.  I believe that it is absolutely necessary to subsidise heavily lime or other manures so as to assist the farmers to regain the fertility of the soil.  The Minister is perfectly well aware of the fact that manures were not available during the war.  Now, of course, artificial manures are too dear for the small farmers.  That is admitted by everybody.  Without the aid of a heavy subsidy I believe that <Col N="354" /> it would be years before the pasture would be fit to maintain dairy cattle in normal production.  I would ask the Minister to go full steam ahead with that lime scheme.  Drainage and manures are very closely related, but without drainage manures are useless. Taken together they are, however, conducive to good milk production.  For that reason we in the County Limerick want more lime.  We have more people in the congested areas of Limerick depending on lime than on basic slag. The Minister is quite well aware that 65 per cent. to 75 per cent. of it is lime &mdash;the rest is dross.  In the congested areas crushed lime or burned lime is the manure that is particularly suitable. If our farmers could get it, it would be an incentive to them to produce extra milk and I need hardly say that the more milk we produce the more butter we can produce also.  When I mention basic slag I should like to impress upon the Minister that in West County Limerick we have to pay £13 5s. a ton for it although that quantity is only sufficient to manure two acres of land.  For the same amount of money we can purchase burned lime which will adequately manure six acres of land.</P>
    <P>I make that point for the sole reason of driving home to the Minister the vital necessity of lime.  In the congested areas of Limerick plenty of lime is needed.  I am not suffering from an overdose of optimism in any way with regard to the points I have made.  I shall not generate any false enthusiasm such as our present Minister for Agriculture did when he told the British that he would drown them with eggs.  I should, however, like to tell the Minister that if we in County Limerick, which we can claim to be the premier dairying county, get a fair break we will, so to speak, choke him with butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have heard so much in this Debate about animals and inanimate things I think it is high time we had a few words about human beings.  The human beings to whom I want to refer are, firstly, the agricultural workers of this country.  While they may be in the minority so far as the industry is concerned, in that they <Col N="355" /> are numerically less than the proprietors and their families, I hold the view that the agricultural labourer is, in fact, the backbone of the industry. It has been stated here over and over again until it becomes almost nauseating, but it is nevertheless true, that agriculture is our basic industry. Everybody agrees upon that.  I consider that the principal operatives in agriculture are the agricultural labourers.</P>
      <P>Listening to speeches made in the House by Deputies of all Parties, I have felt for a considerable time past that so far as the agricultural labourer is concerned, he is a forgotten man. Very little care exists as to his welfare whatever expressions&mdash;such as was made last night by Deputy Corry&mdash;of worry in that regard may be made. These things mean nothing when it comes to a question&mdash;as was the case last Saturday at Cork County Committee of Agriculture&mdash;of improving the lot of the agricultural labourer. These statements of concern are just so much eyewash.  While they are being made for the purpose of capturing votes at election time, the fact is that the agricultural labourer throughout the length and breadth of the country suffers relatively more than any wage earner in any other industry. His standard working week is longer than that obtaining in most other industries.  His wages on an average are approximately little more than half the wages of unskilled workers in far less important industries.  On top of that, what is to me the greatest crime of all and something which the agricultural employers of this country should well be ashamed of is the fact that the agricultural labourer alone of all sections of the community has not yet got, in 1948, a weekly half day.  He has not even got four hours off out of the 54, nor yet has he got six days' annual leave in which he can rest himself and take his family away somewhere with his meagre savings&mdash;if he has any such thing as savings&mdash;which I doubt.  I feel gratified by the expression of concern which was made by the present Minister with regard to the status of the agricultural worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> He stated that the status of the agricultural worker should be raised to that of the industrial worker in the cities and the towns.  He is conceding something with which every member of the Labour Party and every progressive idealist in the country are in complete agreement.  There are certain steps which must be taken fairly soon. It is a long way from the status of the agricultural worker at the present time to the status of the industrial worker. There are a variety of reasons for the difference in the wages and working conditions of the industrial worker and the wages and working conditions of the farm labourer.  But the principal reason is one which has not been stated too often in this House.  In my view the reason is the absolute lack of organisation on the part of the agricultural workers in years gone by and the high degree of organisation in the industrial sphere when it comes to matters relating to simple rights.  In this important debate I would ask the Minister to indicate in his reply what his attitude is in regard to the introduction of a conditions of employment Act for agricultural labourers?</P>
    <P>At the present time we have an Agricultural Wages Board.  It is, I think, the most undemocratic board that was ever set up in this country.  On both sides, its members are hand-picked.  So far as I am aware they are not elected to sit on the board by any body of employers or of workers.  They meet at odd intervals&mdash;once or twice per year&mdash; and they lay down what they consider to be a fair minimum rate for agricultural labourers.  It is true to say that that minimum rate is based upon the productivity and upon the results gained from the most unproductive farms in the country.  I have a certain sympathy with Deputies who come from very impoverished areas where the land is bad and the farms are small; I have sympathy with their point of view when they indicate their difficulties in those areas in paying labourers.  But I say that in an area such as Limerick, about which the last Deputy spoke, or in Leinster and the best part of Munster, there is no difficulty whatsoever in paying a living wage to the agricultural workers; there is, however, great difficulty in getting the farmer employer to <Col N="357" /> admit the right of the agricultural labourer to a fair share of the wealth that he produces.  It is an unfortunate comment on our social structure that that particular parsimony seems to derive from ownership of land, not alone in this country but in other countries as well.  The Minister has circularised the county committees of agriculture asking for their views upon the grant of a weekly half-holiday and six days' annual holidays to agricultural labourers.  As far as one can gather from the Press reports, the replies so far have been somewhat mixed.  It does not surprise me to see replies coming from certain county committees of agriculture absolutely rejecting the idea. Most of these county committees of agriculture are made up of farmers who feel that they would be voting against their own interests if they were to admit any such right on the part of their workers.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been advanced in the Press and at meetings of county committees to prove that if this terrible step is taken of granting a half-day per week to farm labourers and six days' annual holidays, the agricultural industry will be destroyed.  On one occasion during the last half century in Britain, when little children were working in the spinning mills, it was proposed in the British Parliament that a law should be introduced to prevent this ugly practice.  The announcement of that proposal was heralded throughout the country as something which would bring about the downfall of the mighty British Empire. At the present time we are being asked to believe that if the agricultural labourer gets one half day per week and six days' annual holidays irremediable harm will be done to agriculture. I regard that as utter and complete nonsense.  In refutation of that puerile argument one need only visit the North County Dublin.  That area contains some of the most efficient tillage farmers in the country&mdash;farmers who get as much, if not more, from their land than do their colleagues in other parts of the country.  That area, too, has its share of dairy farmers.  In that district 99.9 per cent. of the farmers allow their workers at the present time a weekly half-holiday, six <Col N="358" /> days' annual holiday, a 50-hour week in the summer time&mdash;not 54&mdash;and a 47-hour week in the winter time.  They run their farms to their own satisfaction and with, perhaps, greater efficiency than those in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the present Minister for Agriculture and the inter-Party Government would be taking an important step forward and admitting the equity of the workers' claim to decent treatment, by introducing an Act which would protect them.  No matter what the farmer Deputies of this House may say as to the general goodwill towards agricultural labourers, it is true that the agricultural labourer is to-day an exploited individual.  Only in the rare case does one find that happy relationship where the agricultural worker is more or less part of the family.</P>
    <P>Take, then, the indoor worker&mdash;the spalpeen.  I think it is time that some measure was introduced to abolish the present contract system in relation to indoor work.  At the present time there is absolutely no restriction upon the number of hours that the indoor worker may be required to put in by his employer.  It is time we got away from that state of affairs in this country.  Whether it be popular or unpopular should not be the test.  The test should be whether it is right or wrong.  Beyond question, it is wrong that a man should be made to work a considerably greater number of hours than his colleagues for a considerably lesser wage per week.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk about emigration and a commission has been set up to investigate the causes of emigration.  I believe that the low standard of living of those who ordinarily get their bread and butter by working on the land is the principal contributory cause to emigration.</P>
    <P>The young people, the male youths especially, when they come to manhood, hear of the better conditions in the cities and towns or abroad, and they are attracted away from the land, attracted from the rural areas, by reason of the fact that they cannot get a decent living there.  I do not deny <Col N="359" /> that agriculture is something of a problem, a basic problem.  Neither do I attempt to deny the obvious fact that much must be done for the working farmer.  I do absolutely deny that the present wage of the farm labourer represents the maximum of the farmer's ability to pay.  I also reject absolutely the idea that Irish agriculture cannot afford a weekly half-holiday and annual holidays to its workers.  I hope sincerely, for the sake of agriculture, for the sake of its prosperity in the future and in order that the maximum number of workers may be held in rural areas, that this elementary step of providing these fundamental rights will be taken by the Government during the current year.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to compulsory tillage. It seems to me that among the Opposition there is considerable disagreement over this question.  From my point of view, I am not without fear concerning the abandonment of compulsory tillage.  I am aware that the Minister believes that by virtue of the offer of guaranteed prices over a number of years he will be able to induce the farmer to continue to till.  I wish I could find it within me to accept that idea, but unfortunately I cannot.  I think there is a likelihood of a falling-off in tillage when compulsion is removed, and in the present circumstances it would be a major tragedy for the country if tillage were reduced to any extent.  One only needs to read the daily papers to see that to all intents and purposes we are racing headlong for another international conflict. We all hope very earnestly that that does not materialise, but our hopes will have very little to do with it.  If it does materialise, we must look to our own resources.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the Minister and the Government the desirability of reconsidering the abandonment of compulsory tillage before the year is out.  I think it is a most serious step, and it is not a request I would make were I convinced, as the Minister appears to be convinced, that the farmers will voluntarily sow.  I do not believe they will.  As has been stated here by some <Col N="360" /> Deputies representing the farmers, I think that there will be a tendency to get out of tillage if there is money to be made more easily in other directions.</P>
    <P>It is not wise, I would say, in view of Ministerial statements recently made, that emphasis should have been upon grass, a return to grass.  In years gone by we had a sad history so far as our grass lands were concerned.  We all have memories&mdash;and I am sure the Minister can recollect too&mdash;of vast estates peopled only by a man and his dog.  I do not want to return to that state of affairs.  If there is a reduction in tillage it seems to me there will be a likelihood of a falling-off in the volume of employment available for labourers in rural areas and that will be a distinct disadvantage from the point of view of the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the technical side of the dairying industry.  I want to make some reference to the human side of it, if Deputies do not mind too much.  It has been found in many areas that men cannot be induced to work at dairying, that workers will not undertake jobs milking cows.  I have heard wonder expressed at that. I do not wonder because the reason is obvious to me.  The dairy worker is in an especially bad position from the point of view of treatment and wages. In many cases his is a seven-day week. The conditions under which he has to work are often most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that in the City of Dublin milk production is carried out in a most insanitary, scandalous and dangerous manner from the point of view of public health. During the last 12 months there was a report issued by the Commission of Inquiry into the Milk Supply in the Dublin Sales District.  That report constituted a complete indictment of the whole business of milk production and supply in Dublin City and County. The milkers in the City of Dublin, working purely for the city dairymen, work under conditions that are simply appalling to think of.  In many cases they come to work at 1 a.m.  They milk their cows, return to the city with their milk and knock off in the region of 5 a.m. or 6 a.m.  They return to <Col N="361" /> work at 2 p.m., continue for four or five hours, and for the seven days of the week that goes on.</P>
    <P>While the aggregate number of hours worked may not be more than 50 in some cases&mdash;more often it is in the neighbourhood of 60, 70 or 80 hours&mdash;at the same time, the terribly racking effect that that kind of existence must have on the health of the individuals concerned is obvious. It was mentioned in the report of the commission to which I referred&mdash; mentioned in the usual guarded way of such reports&mdash;that the labour conditions in this industry in Dublin leave much to be desired.  It is quite obvious to everybody that if the conditions surrounding the sources of the milk supply are not the most ideal, the danger to public health can be very great.  I do think that the tremendous incidence of tuberculosis in this city is traceable to no small extent to the very bad conditions that surround the supply of milk which is used by almost 500,000 people in the city.  There are very few dairies in the City of Dublin that can be said to be really hygienic.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to examine that report and to undertake at the earliest opportunity the consideration of the question of what can be done to improve the conditions surrounding the production and supply of milk in Dublin City and County.  It seems to me to be a job on which those primarily responsible have fallen down completely.  It may well be said that in Dublin City we have a type of milk producer that does not exist elsewhere. It may well be that in Dublin we have a problem which is peculiar to the capital in that connection.  I do believe that in time to come it may be necessary to consider the municipalisation of this industry in the interests of public health alone, apart altogether from the very essential interest of the workers in that industry.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter to which I want to make reference, one concerning the capital and also concerning the small farmers of Fingal, to whom I referred previously.  We have a market in the centre of the city for the sale of the produce of the small farms <Col N="362" /> in North County Dublin principally. This market is a disgrace to any modern city both from the point of view of its size and from the point of view of the conveniences, or lack of conveniences, provided there for the working farmers and labourers who come long distances driving their horses from ten to 14 and up to 18 miles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually it is the Corporation of Dublin which controls this market.  I simply want to draw the attention of the Minister, as Minister for Agriculture, to this market, and I would ask him to take the opportunity on some occasion, to view it for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister must be aware of the inadequacy of this particular market.  If it were in order, I think his Department should draw the attention of the corporation to the need for the establishment of a new, better, more spacious and more modern market for these men who from the point of view of producing vegetables for the citizens of Dublin, represent a very essential lifeline for the city.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to refer to a matter which I raised yesterday by way of question, and which concerns the payment and the working conditions of the workers employed at the Munster Institute in Cork.  The Munster Institute, I understand, is run under the authority of the Department of Agriculture. The Albert College in Dublin is run under the authority of University College and it operates by virtue of a grant which, I understand, comes through the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for which I am not administratively responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>These colleges are known or at any rate the Albert College is known as the Model Farm.  Whilst it is true that model crops are produced there and that every attempt is being made to produce a model cow, it cannot be argued that the wages and working conditions of the employees are in <Col N="363" /> any way model.  Bad and all as the conditions are in the Albert College in Dublin, the workers at the Munster Institute in Cork enjoy considerably less in the way of wages and working conditions.  I have never heard any farmer, except very rarely, object to the payment of higher wages for agricultural workers except on the one score, the score of inability to pay. They all say that the agricultural worker deserves more but that they cannot afford it.  That is their stock argument but it is not an argument that can be used in connection with the Munster Institute in Cork.  No hardship would be incurred by the authorities granting to the workers engaged at that institute, similar conditions to those prevailing at the Albert College in Dublin.  Again I would urge on the Minister to give reconsideration to this question, in so far as he has power to deal with it.  Finally, I want to say that so far as I am concerned I represent primarily in this House the agricultural labourers and, as a supporter of the present Government, this Government, by me at any rate, will be judged on the amount of progress made on behalf of the agricultural worker and on the extent to which the agricultural worker is lifted from his present depressed condition to a condition of pride and dignity in this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in my contribution to the debate on this Estimate, as I understand that an agreement has been reached that speeches will be curtailed in so far as it is possible to curtail them, consistent with a fair treatment of the particular points in which Deputies are interested.  Let me say at the outset, that I think we all realise that the farmer is the backbone of the nation. He was always the backbone of this nation, and until we put the farming community on a proper footing and give them the same social uplift as the rest of our community enjoy, we cannot expect the full return from the farmers that we would otherwise get.  There is need for the greatest co-operation between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture.  The future of our agricultural economy is <Col N="364" /> bound up with the policy which we pursue with regard to land.  I do not propose to deal with matters which arose on the Estimate for Lands, but I believe the two are bound up, and that only in future years will we realise what the present trend in our agricultural policy means.  We must have agreement or a common line of thought between those who guide the policy with regard to land and those who guide our agricultural policy.  I do not propose to speak any further on that, as I think my meaning is quite clear.</P>
      <P>I think it is the aim of everybody in this House, irrespective of his political affiliations, to try to stem this terrible flight from our land.  The Minister has a great responsibility on his shoulders in that respect.  A lot will depend on his approach to this problem while he is in office.  We know that we cannot stop our young people from leaving the country, from deserting the countryside, unless we have some alternative to offer them, unless we are able to give them employment on the farms at home at a decent wage and with recreational facilities which will prevent them from being tempted to the towns and cities.  In order to do that, we must give a proper return to the farming community, and, by the farming community, I do not mean merely the farmers, but the farm labourers.</P>
      <P>I think it is a recognised fact that, although roughly half our population are engaged in agricultural pursuits, that half of our population reap only one-quarter, or a little more, of the national income.  That is a wrong state of affairs.  Something must happen in the meantime, and it is no use blaming Fianna Fáil or the previous Government for their term of office.  It is a much more deeply rooted problem, but I can say that the solution of that problem was not greatly helped in recent years by the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not here, because I should prefer to say what I have to say on particular aspects of this Estimate when he is here.  We in Clann na Poblachta realise that at present we are going <Col N="365" /> through a transition period in connection with our economy.  We are at the change-over from the seven or eight years of war economy or of a policy suited to the emergency period, and we, therefore, do not propose at this stage to be too critical of the policy which the Minister is about to pursue with regard to agriculture.  I think we all realise that it would be premature on these grounds to criticise the Minister who has been such a short time in office.  I want to suggest to the Minister, however, on behalf of the Party I represent, that we are prepared to give him every co-operation in carrying out his work and carrying out his policy; but if we find at a later stage that there is a reversion to the policy pursued here in previous years&mdash;I refer to the policy of the ranchers&mdash;then we will not, as a Party, give our support to that policy.  As I have said it is as yet premature to judge.  The country at the moment is going through a transition period and we are prepared to give the Minister every opportunity and every help that lies in our power to carry out those aspects of the policy which we support.</P>
    <P>Let me also say that we are not critical of the Fianna Fáil efforts in the early years of their administration. They pursued a policy to the best of their ability at that time to overcome British aggression or British domination in this country.  Their former aim was self-sufficiency, in so far as it could possibly be achieved.  We, in Clann na Poblachta, fully believe in that policy.  We realise that if we have not got the greatest possible measure of self-sufficiency in our economy, we can never hope for the political freedom we all so earnestly desire, namely a thirty-two county republic.  That is why I say that, in the early stages of Fianna Fáil administration, they had good ideas which they carried out, but which they did not carry far enough.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of all Parties is to put agriculture and the agricultural community on a sound basis.  To do that we must get down to brass tacks and help the farmer in every possible way.  The present Minister has very good ideas in regard to placing machinery at the disposal of farmers <Col N="366" /> for the cultivation and saving of crops. I would like to stress that we believe that machinery should be placed at the disposal of the farming community on a co-operative basis.  I say that in spite of the criticism that was levelled at the idea last night.  We were told that the sun only shone for so many hours and so many days, and that there would be jealousy and trouble in regard to the machinery.  I do not agree, and I do not think that most Deputies would agree.  The machinery that I envisage should be in every parish and it should be at the disposal of every farmer in the parish.  That is one of the means by which we can help to restore the agricultural community to its proper position.</P>
    <P>There is another question, namely, the zoning of agriculture.  I do not propose to go very deeply into that question at the moment.  During the war years we had a compulsory tillage programme, the idea of which was quite good but the execution of which was very bad.  There is no use asking a man to grow crops for which his land is not suited.  Land which is suited to a certain crop should be devoted to the production of that crop.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect in our drive to help the farmer is education. At the present time with many farmers the idea is that what was good enough for their father is good enough for them.  That attitude is changing, but the only way we will eradicate it is by providing proper educational facilities for the young men and women whom we hope to keep on the land.  They should get every opportunity of learning the most up-to-date and most scientific methods of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Until we reach the stage that the farming community has the same status as other sections in our political life, we cannot hope for the return from agriculture which it is capable of giving.  If agriculture is down in the dumps, other sections of the community are bound to suffer.  If agriculture is on the top of the wheel, every other section is bound to benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another vital matter, that is the question of a guaranteed market.  It is not right that the farmer, year in, year out, should be <Col N="367" /> anxious as to what the price of his crops will be.  The present Minister has remedied that situation, and the fact that he has given a guaranteed price is a great encouragement to farmers.  We want that kept up.</P>
    <P>A great deal of reference was made to the pig industry.  One criticism that I have of Fianna Fáil is that in 1932, when they came into power, they did not make full use of our natural resources, one of which is fisheries.  I would not deal with it on this Estimate but for the fact that fishmeal as a mixture is an ideal food for pigs.  If we had our fishing fleets, the problem in our pig industry would not be nearly as acute as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on cattle&mdash;I do not pose as an expert on anything&mdash;but I am entirely in agreement that we should get the best possible price for our cattle abroad.  It strikes me that we are selling 3d. worth of goods in a 1/- wrapping.  We let our cattle go out on the hoof to Britain and elsewhere and we lose the best part of them.  The Minister should explore every avenue and use every influence to see if we could get a good market for canned products.  It is only common sense that if we kill at home we will have the best part of the produce and can sell the rest to foreign countries.  In turn, that policy would create employment in canneries and factories and fresh industries could be started which would help to check the drift from the land.  That would be fully in keeping with the policy which we in Clann na Poblachta always maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could offer criticism of that.  It would be a great means of checking the rush from the land, not only to the cities and towns, but to Britain.  I wish the new Minister every success in carrying out his policy and I hope that, with the help and encouragement given him by our Party in conjunction with the other Parties of this inter-Party Government, he will be on the right lines and that, at the end of his term of office, we will not have to criticise him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the privilege or the facility of reading the Minister's <Col N="368" /> speech carefully, to see the points he made, especially in regard to policy; and I am rather surprised to hear members of the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta talk about the Minister's policy, as if it were different from the Fianna Fáil policy.  I do not see very much departure from the policy carried on in the last 15 or 16 years in agriculture.  The Minister may have stressed certain tendencies, but he has not definitely made any statement in his speech which would show that he is departing from that policy&mdash; except, perhaps, that he is not going to go as far as we went and, therefore, should be less palatable to Deputy McQuillan and Clann na Poblachta than the Fianna Fáil policy on agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister was guilty of certain inaccuracies and he contradicted himself a few times.  He certainly was guilty of a great deal of exaggeration. He starts off by saying, as given at column 2588:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We find ourselves in the remarkable position that the live-stock population of this country has fallen to the lowest levels that have ever been known in our recorded history.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to give the number of cows, three-year-old cattle, two-year-old and yearly cattle and calves.  In fact, the statement is not true.  The total number of cattle, for instance, was lower at one period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. He stresses in particular the number of cattle between one and two years old&mdash;that number was lower for a number of years under Cumann na nGaedheal.  It is true that the number of cows and calves was lower in 1947 than they have been in this century&mdash; which may mean history as far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so terribly important whether his statement is right or wrong.  If the number of cows is low, what we are really concerned with is what we can do about it.  If anyone would make a table of the trend in butter prices and beef prices and the number of cows, it would be apparent that, when milk prices are more remunerative than beef, the number of <Col N="369" /> cows will go up, and when beef prices are more remunerative than milk, the number of cows will go down.  That is a fact we must keep in mind, as it appears to be a fundamental fact which is not altered by any other condition whatever.</P>
    <P>The next point is that practically half the cows are kept by farmers outside the creamery districts.  I heard several speeches here which stressed the creamery farmer's difficulty more than anything else.  We must remember that almost half the cows are outside creamery districts; in other words, in the farmers' butter area or the liquid milk area where liquid milk is supplied to cities and towns.  Take those farmers who are not in a creamery area and who are not supplying milk to cities and towns.  The only sales they have, so far as cows are concerned, are sales of farmers' butter.  Last year, the price of farmers' butter to the farmer&mdash;that is, the price of fresh butter&mdash;was 2/11. Evidently the farmer did not think it a very good price, because, though we have not got enough statistics yet to test this, every Deputy here will say that, as far as his experience goes, there is not an increase in cows between April, 1947, and the present time.  If that 2/11 a lb. that was paid last year had been an attractive price, one would expect to see more cows in the country.  The only conclusion we can come to is that it was not an attractive price at all.  Even so, the present Minister withdrew control this year and the result is that in many areas farmers' butter has been sold at ? a lb. this year, as compared with 2/11 last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And this year they are getting 2/3 per lb.  Who paid for it I do not know, but that is the position. Deputy Lehane and Deputy Fagan are now so concerned as to who is paying for it that we can hardly get on with the business here.  So far as I know, we got no increase in the number of cows last year when butter was 2/11 per lb.  Deputy Fagan says that we are going to get an increase this year.  If we are, well and good.  May I say that if we are we made a great mistake in paying so much for butter last year? However, we have not got agreement on that and we may pass on.</P>
      <P>About April of 1947 the price of milk to the creameries was fixed at a certain level.  Some people said it was a good price while others said it was not enough.  I think that practically all the Deputies who were on this side of the House at that time thought the price was a bit too low, but since they went to the other side of the House they seem to be satisfied enough with it.  Meantime, the price has not gone up, even though the creamery farmer has his extras to meet.  In the meantime his rates and wages have gone up, certain other expenses of the farmer have gone up, so that we have reached the point that the price that was paid last year to the creamery farmers did not bring about, as far as I know, an increase in the number of cows.  Does the Minister for Agriculture think that, by sticking to the same price this year and with the farmers having to bear heavier expenses, we are going to get an increase in the number of cows?  I do not think so. If the Minister thinks that he is he must have a very optimistic mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third class of men who supply liquid milk to the towns and cities.  They say they are not getting <Col N="372" /> enough.  Of course, their price is a very involved matter.  It changes practically from year to year.  At any rate, they complain that they are not getting enough.  Taking all these things into consideration, is it likely that we are going to get more cows in this country?  I do not think so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it was necessary to have somebody like John Brown to deal with Deputy Fagan and people like him.  All that I have said points towards a decrease in the number of cows.  I do not think there can be any doubt about that.  It does not matter much about the Broy Harriers or about the Blueshirts.  They are finished with.  What does matter is the future with regard to the number of cows in the country.  That is what we want to get at, and see if we are moving in a direction where we will get more cows because that is very important.  I do not think that we are. I want the Minister to give us the reasons that he has in mind for believing that we are going to have a vast increase in live stock in the time to come.  The Minister, despite the blue spectacle which he painted, and which Deputy Fagan has been painting of 1935, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I still believe that we are standing on the threshold of the greatest period of expansion in the agricultural industry of this country that we have ever known.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think you can have a great expansion in agricultural production unless you have an expansion in the <Col N="373" /> number of cows, because that is very important.  It is the foundation of the biggest item in the agricultural industry. It helps in many of the other component parts of agricultural output. Therefore, if we are not too sure that we are going to get an expansion in the number of cows, I do not think we can hope for a great expansion generally.  Now, you must have cows to have milk, butter and cheese.  That must be evident to everybody, even to Deputy Lehane, and unless you have cows you cannot have calves, and unless you have calves you cannot have cattle, so there you are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have to go back to 1935 I must tell the younger Deputies here that we had to take those measures because the Opposition was helping the British against us at that time.  We could not help it, we had to do it.  As well as having more calves it will eventually mean more cattle. The number of cows in the country will have an influence on some of our other live-stock industries&mdash;in the feeding of pigs, poultry and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been talk here about the fertilisation of our soil.  I think there are no animals so important as cows because they are winter fed, and if they are well fed they will have a bigger influence than any other class of animal on the fertilisation of the soil.  If the Minister is right, that we are on the threshold of a big expansion in agriculture, we want to be sure, first of all, that we are moving in the right direction to increase the number of cows in the country.  In order to be sure of that, those on this side of the House at any rate&mdash;I cannot speak for the Deputies on the other side&mdash;will want something more tangible than a Ministerial prophecy, because we do not think that is a sufficient ground to go upon.  I do not want to delay on any of these items too long, but I think that there is nothing more important than the number of cows from every point of view, and I hope when the Minister is winding up this debate he <Col N="374" /> will give us some grounds for agreeing with him that there is a chance of the number of cows going up rather than going down, as would appear to be the trend at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks he is going to bamboozle the farmers of Cork he can try it.  I want to go on to the farm buildings scheme.  The Minister for Agriculture in his speech, which is here in column 2591, talking about Marshall aid, said that if Marshall aid be made available to our country by way of grant it would be possible to do certain things, among them the reconstruction of our farm <Col N="375" /> buildings.  Up to this point when the Minister made this speech, we were under the impression&mdash;the members of the Government may know better&mdash; that the farm buildings scheme could not be carried on because there were no materials for farm building, but now it is evident from what the Minister said that if we got money from the Marshall Aid Plan by way of grant, we could form a fund and do several things, among them the reconstruction of farm buildings.  He confesses now that he could go on with the farm buildings scheme if the Minister for Finance would give him the money, but the Minister for Finance will not give it to him, and he therefore hopes to get it out of the Marshall aid fund.  I thought the Minister was a little bit contradictory in some of his statements, for later on, when he was talking about the farm buildings scheme on column 2609, he said that it could not be carried on for lack of materials.  He had even forgotten in the space of an hour or so what he had said about Marshall aid, that if he had the money he could go ahead and he goes back to the old excuse of the lack of building materials.</P>
      <P>I suppose that we cannot compel the Minister to answer any question, but I would like him to tell us if it is money or materials.  Which of them is keeping him from going on with the farm buildings scheme, because in one part of his speech he shows it is lack of money and in another part he shows that it is lack of material?  If we knew which it was, at least we could understand, maybe, why the Minister is not going on with this scheme.  When he gives two different excuses from two different angles in the same speech, it is very hard to know what the facts are and what is preventing the Minister from going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said then that he was going to drop this system of inspection. In columns 2593-4 he says that the Minister for Agriculture down to his most junior inspector will enter a farmer's land in future by invitation or not at all.  Is that a considered statement of the Minister or is it one of his rhetorical exaggerations?  We want to <Col N="376" /> know what the fact is.  Does he mean that inspectors will never again enter a farm except by invitation, and if he does, suppose there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, will he and his inspectors wait until the farmer sends word that he would like an inspector to call, and if the adjoining farm does not invite in an inspector, is he not to call?</P>

Deputy Fagan may think that the Minister has made a childish statement, but whether he did or not, the Minister should give us a clear indication of what he means exactly by this statement &ldquo;only by invitation.&rdquo;  Does it mean that we are going to drop all those Acts, the Weeds Act and the Livestock Act?</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not mean exactly what he said, what exactly does he mean?  Does he want it to apply in fact or in any respect except compulsory tillage?</P>
      <P>Talking of compulsory tillage, he goes on to wheat.  I heard, as I said, that already Clann na Poblachta and Labour were talking about the Minister's policy.  The Minister has adopted the Fianna Fáil peace policy on wheat, that is to offer a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market to the farmers for any wheat that they might market.  I suppose we should be very proud that we had converted such a very pronounced anti-wheat man as the Minister was over to that side.  At any rate, he has adopted the peace policy of Fianna Fáil with regard to wheat growing by guaranteeing this price for four years to come.  Some Deputies asked what was the policy of the previous Government on this and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A White Paper was issued by the Government two years ago which gives the views of the Fianna Fáil Government and their intention as to the future policy in regard to wheat, tillage, live stock and all the other matters.  They stated specifically in that White Paper that they thought that compulsory wheat growing should stop as soon as the emergency was over and that we should guarantee a price <Col N="378" /> and a market for farmers who wished to grow wheat under such guarantees. The Minister, at any rate, endorsed our White Paper.  So far, so good.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is wise in departing from the emergency policy on wheat growing.  Are we sure, for instance, that the supplies of wheat will be sufficient next year, the year after, and so on?  If we are not very sure, it appears to be only common sense to take the necessary precautions to see that we grow a very good proportion of our requirements ourselves.  I am only putting the question as to whether it is wise or not. I can only say that I hope the Minister is right in his optimism that we shall have plenty of wheat coming in.  I can only say that I cannot agree that he is wise in taking that chance.  I think we should have carried on and seen to it that we grew a great proportion of our wheat requirements at home for at least another year.  I should like the Minister to give us his views on what the future policy should be on tillage in general.  Other Deputies also asked for that.</P>
    <P>About the 20th March this year the Minister issued an advertisement which is headed: &ldquo;How farmers can help?&rdquo; The answer was that the farmers could help the Government by completing the compulsory tillage quota and sowing five extra acres, if they have a big farm, and one extra acre if they have a small farm, of barley or oats, and the farmer's wife by marketing more eggs.  That is all very good advice. The Minister goes on to say that he believes co-operation works better than compulsion&mdash;a very admirable sentiment. But look at what comes next: &ldquo;Let's show them.&rdquo;  Who are &ldquo;us&rdquo; and who are &ldquo;they&rdquo;?  He talks about co-operation being better than compulsion, and then says: &ldquo;Let's show them.&rdquo;  I do not know who the contemptible &ldquo;they&rdquo; are and who are the &ldquo;us&rdquo; who are going to show them. It is a strange way of looking for co-operation. That advertisement is signed: &ldquo;James M. Dillon, Minister for Agriculture,&rdquo; and I presume&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that it was paid for by the Department of Agriculture.  I hope the <Col N="379" /> Minister will tell us who &ldquo;us&rdquo; are and who &ldquo;they&rdquo; are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced that he was going to give 55/- a barrel next year for barley.  I presume that is for the 1949 crop, not the 1948 crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better quote what the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want the farmers to produce next year 700,000 barrels of malting barley at least, for which I guarantee them a price higher than they received in any year for the last ten years, it will not be less than 55/-and it might be more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is taken from the Official Report of 9th July, column 2595.  That does not refer to this year, I presume.  The Minister went on to say that the Fianna Fáil Government had prevented the farmers from getting the price they could have got from Messrs. Guinness and Company and the other brewers; that they would have paid, say, 60/- a barrel or more, while the Government compelled the farmers to accept 35/- or 40/-; that the money which Messrs.  Guinness made on that barley was extracted from them by the British Government by way of surtax, etc.  He builds up a very damning story in an <i>ex parte</i> way.  If he believes it is as bad as he says, why does he delay in regard to this price until next year?  Surely it would be only fair to put the money into the farmers' pockets this year and take it from Messrs.  Guinness and, in turn, from the British Government.  Why delay until next year to right what he believes to be a wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> Perhaps I should say that there was a reason why the price of barley was fixed from 1940 to 1946 and 1947. Everybody in this House remembers the years 1942, 1943 and 1944.  They will remember the high extraction of wheat which we were using in bread, how brown the bread was at one time, and also that we had to ration bread in the end.  Surely that makes it plain to anybody that we were up against it here with regard to wheat and bread and that we had to endeavour in every way we could to get what wheat we could produce.  We were not getting enough wheat by voluntary means and we had to have a quota of wheat on every farm.  In the old tillage districts we were getting more wheat than the farmer was compelled to grow by quota, and we knew, and I am sure the Minister and everybody knows, that if we made barley more remunerative to the farmer than we did we would get less wheat and, therefore, we would have less bread.  That was the reason why it was done and for no other reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that it is a damned queer device, but the question is has he some better device up his sleeve for dealing with these things.  I hope for many reasons that the Minister will not be up against an emergency of that kind while he is in office, but if ever it does happen we will see what his devices are.  The biggest barley growing county by far in this country is County Wexford.  I had to do that when I was Minister for Agriculture.  For what reason?  I had to do it for the sake of the country and it could not be for any other reason.  These barley growing farmers had to put up with it and they did, because they understood it, but the Minister does not understand it.  I am quite prepared to meet these barley growing farmers with the Minister and explain the position to them again and see whether they will tell the Minister that they understood the position or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to barley as a feeding stuff.  He says that the scientists say that it is as good as <Col N="381" /> maize.  They do, but the Minister made experiments himself and he found that it was not as good as maize.  He does not agree with the scientists.  Experiments were carried out in the agricultural colleges and by the staffs of the county committees of agriculture in this country.  All these experiments proved that barley is equally good as maize.  I would point out that these experiments were carried out when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in power and before I took office as Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister has the records in his Department.  He can look them up and he can then ask himself why his experiments differed from those carried out in the agricultural colleges and by the staffs of the county committees of agriculture.  I want to ask him about maize.  He said that it is better than barley.  I understood him to say that he was getting 70,000 tons a quarter.  I should like more precise and up-to-date information on whether that is a firm decision or merely a hope.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All we can do then is to hope for the best.  I should like to point out that when I was Minister for Agriculture I was very keen on the lime scheme.  I agree with the Minister that there is an unlimited need for lime in this country.  I think it will be agreed by all that it would take years and years with all the lime we could possibly turn out to satisfy the land of this country.  We may at least start off on that point.  Whatever else we <Col N="382" /> may do in our lifetime we are not going to put too much lime at the disposal of the farmer.  My idea was that we should have fairly big units.  The big unit turns out lime more rapidly and, I suppose, more cheaply&mdash;say 100,000 tons in the year.  On the other hand freight is a very important factor in regard to lime.  We must not have the units too far apart.</P>
      <P>As a compromise between the big unit and the low freight by not having them too far apart, we might have ten good ones turning out, say, 100,000 tons each in the year.  That might not prove to be enough, but that aspect of the matter could be looked into afterwards. If we can do that it is all to the good. Then it is necessary to get the farmer to use it, so it must be made available to him cheaply.  That is why the big unit and the short freight are necessary. I am not sure that, even at the very cheapest rate at which we can do it with the big unit and the low freight, we may not have to give some subsidy on that line in order to get the farmer to use it as it should be used.  Above all, however, the farmer must have time to deal with it.  It is difficult for the farmer to find time to spread lime in the old way.  Some of them used to mix in, say, compost, clay or old headland and so forth and spread it in that way.  They have not the time to do that now.  I was investigating&mdash;I do not know how far those investigations have proceeded&mdash;whether it was possible to have it mechanically spread. I think that it could be done in that way.  If we could say to the farmer: &ldquo;You will get so much lime applied to so many acres of your land at so much an acre; it is brought out and spread by contract&rdquo;, then I think the farmer will be prepared to put on more than he otherwise would.  I believe that he would be prepared to pay more than he otherwise would, because the system would be convenient and reasonably cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are hoping to develop that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  The Minister has told us that the Government has authorised him to buy all the phosphates he possibly can.  That is very <Col N="383" /> good.  I should like to know how much he has any hope of getting.  We got an increased amount last year but it was not enough.  It will be the same for many years to come, I believe.  We should, therefore, make every endeavour to get all the phosphates we can. I agree again that much of our phosphates could be used as ground phosphates and not as superphosphates, but that is something to which the great majority of the farmers are alive. They are using ground phosphates wherever they can use them, on a pasture in particular, and they are using the superphosphates on crops. The Minister, however, after a certain amount of self-glorification in how well he had done in getting those phosphates and potash, launches out with an attack on the International Emergency Food Council.  I do not think that to abuse organisations such as the International Emergency Food Council will do any good.  It would be better if the Minister were to do all he possibly can to get lime, phosphates, potash and sulphate of ammonia for the farmers than to abuse such organisations.  He should keep whatever abuse he has for this side of the House&mdash;we do not mind &mdash;but leave them out.</P>
      <P>With regard to soil testing, I was reading in column 2601 of the Official Report, 9th July, 1948, that the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would be glad if Deputies beyond, particularly, would be as busy moving about amongst their neighbours telling them of the availability of that service as they have been busy instructing their neigh-bours in certain other items....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we been guilty of?  It would be better that we should know exactly what the Minister has in mind. If we have transgressed in any way in spreading wrong reports about the Minister's Department I think we should be told in order that we may mend our hands.  There is no use in these veiled threats or attacks because we do not know what the Minister has in mind.  The Minister then goes on to say that he has secured for us an unlimited market at a remunerative price <Col N="384" /> for the first time in history.  I am afraid that is a big claim to make&mdash; the first time in history.  As far as I know there was no restriction on produce going into Britain until the Act of 1932 was brought in.  Evidently the Minister's history does not extend beyond 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I think the Minister is to a great extent relying upon Couéism. If you repeat that everything is brighter and better often enough and with sufficient emphasis everybody will think that everything is brighter and better.  That is the sum total of the Minister's philosophy.  He gives no reason whatsoever for his prophecy that we are going to have an expanded market and remunerative prices for all our produce.  He stated that was the fact, and that is all we have got from him so far.  When he is replying we would like a little less prophecy and a little more fact.  Then we shall see where we stand.</P>
      <P>Apart from price, I think it is most important that social amenities should be made available in the rural areas. I hope that the Minister will do all in his power to further rural electrification, the laying on of water to the houses, main drainage and sanitation. I think the country people are entitled to the same amenities as the city people enjoy in these respects and I think the provision of such amenities will go far to stopping the flight from the land.</P>

      <P>If the country as a whole and the farmers in particular want to take full advantage of the recent trade agreement with Great Britain they will have to play their part in making a contribution towards increasing the volume of agricultural production.  I listened attentively to the long and interesting statement made by the Minister.  I listened also to the majority of the speeches delivered during this debate.  I have some doubt as to whether the policy outlined by the Minister in regard to his method of increasing the volume of agricultural production will bring about the desired effect.  I am not too sure that the <Col N="388" /> Minister's method of not going on to the farmer's land until he is sent for to see whether the farmer is tilling the necessary acreage of arable land is going to increase the volume of agricultural production.</P>
      <P>My doubts are based on the experience I have gained as a representative of a tillage constituency.  The constituency I have the honour to represent has always made a wonderful contribution to the acreage under tillage.  It was one of the counties to erect the first beet factory established in this State.  The land in that constituency and in adjoining counties has been tilled mainly by the working farmers who will in the future, as in the past, respond to the wish of the Minister in this matter.  The Minister stated that he had a peace-time policy and an emergency period policy.  Who to-day can say when the next war will be launched?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who have the power to declare war to-day will not give much notice of their intention. Therefore, in the dangerous days in which we are living, with trouble brewing all round us or threatened, we have to be in a position all the time to provide for the requirements of our people.  Every owner of land, whether big or small, must be put under some obligation, an obligation of honour, if necessary, to make his contribution to the supply position.  My experience of the big farmers in my constituency has been that they will till only whatever arable land they are compelled to till. It is necessary that the Minister would have someone on the look-out to ensure that they will carry out their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the policy of voluntary effort as against conscription.  A soldier who volunteers to fight is a better man than a conscript, and to that extent I agree with the Minister's policy.  If the Minister succeeds in achieving the acreage under tillage that he desires, if he succeeds in getting the farmers, big and small, to increase the volume of agricultural production, then he will be a miracle worker.  I am issuing a friendly warning to him.  It was only <Col N="389" /> this evening, in company with my colleagues in the same constituency, when we were discussing the question of acquiring untenanted land in my area, that it was pointed out that a certain big farmer who does not reside on the holding put 19 barrels of wheat into about the same acreage last year and threshed 18.  He scraped the surface of the land in order to comply with the regulations and the same individual will do the same thing again only when he is compelled to do it.</P>
    <P>I want to make certain, in the dangerous days in front of us, that every landowner will be obliged to make his contribution to the agricultural production the Minister wants. The Minister can take no chances.  I do not think we have arrived in this country at a stage where we are disciplined to the extent that everyone will carry out the orders of the people in control.  The rising generation of farmers, like the sons and daughters of those who work in industry and other forms of activity, are not half as good as their fathers or grandfathers. We have to admit what we know to be a fact.  We also have to admit that, although the acreage under tillage during the emergency increased to a considerable extent, still there was a decline in the volume and the value of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>From the limited experience I have of the land in my constituency, I would say that we could increase the volume of agricultural production by draining and reclaiming the land.  That is the policy of this Government, and a good start has been made.  We can increase the volume of agricultural production if we take the big ranches that remain in the hands of the big landowners&mdash; the large estates&mdash;and hand them to the sons of small farmers and to labourers who have experience of land. Every time you do that you will increase agricultural production and prevent farmers' sons and daughters, and labourers, from getting passports to do that same work in a neighbouring country.</P>
    <P>We can increase agricultural production, and I am sure the Minister will lend a helping hand by providing cheap <Col N="390" /> money for the farmers.  Listening to the Minister some time ago, I thought he had some doubt as to whether there was a shortage of working capital among the agricultural community. There is, and I am sure the Minister is anxious to help in that direction. He will have to make sure that cheaper money than is at present provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be provided.  Will the Minister or any Deputy say that in these days, with the surplus of money we have in our banks&mdash;too much for the goods that are available in the country&mdash;that 4½ per cent. is not an unreasonably high rate of interest to expect farmers to pay?</P>
    <P>The last Government was, for a short period, providing money at 2½ per cent. to enable local authorities to build houses, and that policy will continue, so far as I understand, under the present Government.  If the local authorities who, in the long run, are the rate-payers, consisting largely of farmers, can get money to build houses at 2½ per cent., why cannot the farmer get the capital he badly needs at the same rate of interest?  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was never established as a profit-making institution. It was established for the purpose of providing cheap money for the agricultural community in order to lower the cost of production and give the farmer a profitable return for the use of his land and his labour.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look into this question and, if he believes there is need for cheap money for the agricultural community, that he will endeavour to provide money at a cheaper rate than is at present being provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I admit quite frankly that the Minister is entitled to the grateful thanks of the people of my constituency for the increased prices he is offering the farmers for their barley, presumably during the coming season, as well as in future years.  There is no doubt the price inducement will increase the acreage under barley.  Someone said&mdash; I do not know whether he is right or <Col N="391" /> wrong&mdash;that you could not grow wheat at a profit in the same land where you could grow barley.  I have seen good wheat grown in the two counties in my constituency, which have had a long record for growing barley and selling it to Messrs.  Guinness and their agents at an uneconomic price.  I salute the Minister, and take off my hat to him for his offer to the farmers to provide them with a profitable price in future.</P>
    <P>As the eldest son of a small farmer, when going to school I thought it was a disgraceful sight to see the small farmers, after a hard year's work, take their barley to the local brewery and have to part with it at a pawnbroker's price.  The majority of them were not able to get even a pawnbroker's price. Some of them were turned away after a hard year's work.  Thanks to the present Minister, they will not have to face that situation either this year or during the period that he will continue, as I hope, to be Minister for Agriculture.  It certainly is an inducement to produce barley, at any rate. Whether the same thing will be done in regard to other crops I am not too confident or certain.  I hope I am wrong and that the Minister is right, because I agree in a policy of voluntary effort as against a policy of compulsion.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, already touched upon by Deputy Dunne to which I wish to refer, and that is the question of the rates of wages and conditions of service of agricultural labourers.  If the Minister will be able to say at the end of his five years' period in office that he has fulfilled the promise which he made in his opening statement on this Estimate, I will say he is a miracle worker and that he will be entitled to the gratitude of agricultural labourers generally.  He will get the support of this small group for that, if for no other purpose, in his endeavours to carry out that policy. That policy, however, cannot be operated as long as the Agricultural Wages Board as at present constituted remains in existence.  I hope he will take steps at an early date to dissolve the Agricultural Wages Board, which has been constituted on a purely political basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> We have many organisations in this country such as the Beet Growers' Association, and the people associated with the dairying industry, who can claim to represent the working farmers. We have workers in such organisations who can claim, within reason, to represent agricultural labourers, but no business-like board that I ever heard of, constituted of the popularly elected representatives of the agricultural labourers and working farmers, works in the way in which this board works. The real power in the Agricultural Wages Board is vested in the chairman, who has a salary under this Estimate of £900 a year.  The regional representatives are called to meetings two or three times a year.  They are consulted by the chairman, undoubtedly, and he listens to what they say but he does not say much himself.  When he has arrived at his decision the National Agricultural Wages Board is summoned and the representatives are allowed to express their views, but in the long run, as the Minister knows, it is the chairman, and not the members of the board by a majority, who decides whether an application for an improvement in wages or working conditions should be approved or not.  It is time that this out-of-date system was done away with, that the board as at present constituted was dissolved, and that a proper wages board, based on a democratic foundation, took its place. I am sure the Minister will lose no time in seeing that the necessary steps are taken to ensure that end.</P>
    <P>In regard to the costs of production, I am not going to detain the House very long, but I should like to point out to the Minister that the closing down of branch railway lines in my area has already increased the cost of production for small farmers who sell cattle at the local fairs.  Wherever a branch line was closed, the live stock had to be carried over the alternative road service, inside a 50-mile radius, and the cost of the carriage of such live stock has increased by 100 per cent. as compared with the railway rates on the branch lines.  That 100 per cent. was not borne by the cattle dealer.  It came out of the pockets of the small farmers who sold cattle at <Col N="393" /> the local fairs.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to that and I hope he will bear it in mind when he, as a member of the Cabinet, comes to discuss the reorganisation of the transport services.</P>
    <P>I have heard some complaints about the price of milk.  I was very glad to be a member of this House who shared with my colleague of some years ago the responsibility&mdash;it was a pleasure&mdash; of helping to establish new creameries in my constituency.  I regret to say&mdash; I am only acting on information given to me by milk suppliers in the area&mdash; that a very large number of the people who went into the dairying industry at that time have gone out of it since because they allege they were not getting an economic or a proper price in the local creameries.</P>
    <P>The Minister surprised me when he stated that the increased price now being received by farmers for calves means the equivalent of 3d. per gallon in the price of milk supplied to the local creameries.  That is a surprising figure the accuracy of which I cannot challenge but I want an assurance, if we are going to have the dairying industry as we now know it&mdash;and it has been in a decaying state in my area for some time&mdash;that the farmer suppliers will get a proper price.  If a subsidy for the establishment or maintenance of any industry is justified, it is justified when the person to whom it is given can provide an adequate return in labour and in the proper use of his land.  I hope the Minister in a short period will be able to persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide a sufficient subsidy to maintain this valuable industry as a section of a very valuable basic industry such as agriculture.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief but there are a few matters to which I should like to refer in regard to this Estimate.  I am going to support the motion to refer it back because I believe the Minister is trying to revert to the policy of Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal.  It was amazing and amusing to hear two farmer Deputies speak in this House this evening and tell the House that agriculture was in an improverished condition and that the <Col N="394" /> farmers were no longer prosperous.  I would answer these Deputies by asking them the question, what is the state of the collection of the annuities this year?</P>
      <P>What arrears are there in the country?  What is the state of the rate collection in every country in Ireland? What percentage of rates was collected on the 31st March last?  What about the bank debts?  Are these debts still in existence?  Shop debts, the debts which made gombeen men of the shopkeepers and placed the farmers of this country in a dependent position on the people who were giving them money that was often necessary in order to keep the bailiffs away, do not exist to-day.  Agriculture is not in that improverished condition that Deputy P. O'Reilly and Deputy Halliden would try to make us believe.  I assume that both these Deputies are farmers.</P>

      <P>Milk and dairying must be regarded as the fundamentals of agriculture, because, without the cow you will have no calf, and without the cow you will have no milk, no stores, no beef, no tillage and no manure, and consequently, the cow must be regarded as the fundamental of agriculture. What was the condition of the dairying industry when Fianna Fáil took over the Government of this country in 1932?  Butter was cheaper than car grease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Who were the people who put it in the flourishing condition into which it came in 1938?  What was the price of our exportable butter? 56/- to 60/- per cwt.  At the same time, the Government of that day permitted Australian and Danish butter to be sold on the market here.  Fianna Fáil, however, protected the Irish market for the dairy farmer, thereby giving him the first chance to rehabilitate himself. The reduction in cows has been gradual and it was inevitable because of the increased acreage under tillage.</P>
      <P>You cannot have it both ways.  If you have more tillage, you must have a lesser number of live stock&mdash;that is pretty evident to everybody&mdash;but, notwithstanding the fact that we had more tillage last year, we have a greater number of two and three-year-old cattle than we had in 1946.  We have a lesser number of yearlings and calves and that lesser number of yearlings can be accounted for to a certain extent by the severe spring we had in 1947.  The best evidence of that is probably to be found in the Minister's Department in the thousands of applications made for loans for the restocking of the land of this country as a result of the damage done to live stock during that severe period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which accounts for that lesser number is disease.  Disease is a heavy financial loss to the farmer and it is also a disheartening occurrence. Disease is caused by germs or spores which are easily passed on by either infection or contagion.  Conditions on most farms are favourable for the spread of disease, because dirty and dark conditions help to harbour germs.  The late Government introduced a scheme in connection with the building of outoffices which would have gone a long way to counter the disease we find in younger stock.  That was a scheme of building proper houses and providing proper accommodation with plenty of ventilation, cleanliness, and sunlight, the greatest enemies of <Col N="396" /> disease germs.  But what has the Minister done?  He has, by a wave of his hand, placed that scheme in abeyance&mdash;the new word coined in this House for &ldquo;abandonment,&rdquo; as we have had evidence in other directions and from other Parties.  By putting that scheme in abeyance, he is perpetuating the diseases that have been so evident &mdash;hoose, mammitis and all the other diseases which go to reduce our live-stock population.</P>
    <P>The first and most essential thing the Minister should have thought of when he talked of the great expansion in agriculture which we were to have, and, I presume, in our live-stock population, was to see that this scheme would have been carried into effect. As showing how desirable that scheme was, and the farmers knew it was desirable, the Minister admitted here that he had 25,000 applications, and surely the numbers of people who wanted the scheme put into operation must be an indication of how popular that scheme was with the farmers; but the Minister comes along and tells the farmers: &ldquo;I am going to expand agriculture and to make every farmer in the country richer&rdquo;, and yet the one scheme which the farmers showed they wanted to see put into operation, as a scheme that would help them, the Minister by a wave of his hand abandons.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a predominantly live-stock/agricultural policy, it would appear that we must have a systematic breeding policy, having due regard for the necessity for maintaining an economic level of milk and the production of high-class stores.  The policy pursued over many years has resulted in an improvement in the conformation of our store cattle, while providing for a reasonable milk yield where cattle are bred and maintained under intelligent management.  A point had been reached, however, at which a further improvement in store cattle was going to be at the expense of milk yields. To counteract that tendency, the previous Government changed the policy which had been in operation regarding Shorthorn bulls, but that policy was not changed until the farmers, the dairying farmers and the cattle producers, <Col N="397" /> decided for themselves, after consultation with the Minister, that they desired that change.</P>
    <P>I happened to be a member of that consultative council on that occasion and I heard the views put forward by the people from the dairying districts who were unanimous in their desire to get rid of the Shorthorn.  Personally, I would not be in complete agreement with them, because I believe that the only foundation stock we have is the Shorthorn, but these people desired it, and, as I have said already, dairying must be regarded as the foundation and fundamental of agriculture. The Minister has stated that he has increased the price of calves from 10/- to £10.  He would need to do that in order to compensate the dairy farmer.  A dairy cow giving 600 gallons of milk at present-day prices is worth £35 per annum.  Assuming that the Shorthorn yields 400 gallons&mdash;I do not think the Minister will contradict me if I place her yield at that figure&mdash;she will realise in or around £23, representing a difference of £12.  In other words, the dairy cow starts off with an advantage of £12 on her calf.  The Minister has made great statements about what he has done, but he has to bring that £10 up to £12 in order to equalise the position with the dairy Shorthorn.</P>

      <P>Sorry, Sir.  In any case, the Minister has annulled the Order made by the previous Minister. I would suggest, if he is so concerned about the live-stock industry as he pretends to be, that he would set up a system of free veterinary assistance for farmers.  I know that it happens very often, particularly with small farmers, that one or two or three cows fall sick, but the farmer will not call in a vet. at the proper time.  He goes to the nearest druggist and he loses probably as much money as would pay the fees of a vet.  The mortality in live stock, particularly young live stock, must be enormous because of that.  A system of free veterinary assistance would be a very valuable asset to the live-stock industry.  What I would like to know and what a great number of people are very anxious to know is why the Minister decided to take away the subsidy on farmers' butter.  Has he been misled by his advisers?</P>

      <P>Why was it that the Minister circularised the committees of agriculture on the 24th March, telling them that they were to advertise a scheme under which a grant would be allowed for the erection of poultry houses?  I quote from the poultry development scheme issued on the 24th March, 1943.  There was to be a grant of £20 towards the erection of a poultry house with accommodation for 100 adult birds or more; £15 when accommodation is provided for 75 adult birds or more; £10 when accommodation is provided for not less than 50 adult <Col N="400" /> birds.  These grants were to be made available under the farm buildings scheme, and, because of the advertisements in the local papers as a result of this circular, many farmers bought day-old chicks in the hope of obtaining the grant.  The Minister by abandoning that good scheme that was introduced by Deputy Smith when Minister for Agriculture, placed these people in the position that they have not proper accommodation for their poultry and they have been put to the expense of paying 18/- a dozen for day-old chicks for which they have no accommodation.</P>

      <P>We will deal with that in a moment.  In 1929, 1930 and 1931, the farmers could not sell a lb. of <Col N="401" /> barley in the harvest-time, because of the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they permitted Messrs.  Guinness to import Russian barley at 9/- a barrel.  That was one of the reasons why the wheat scheme became a success in the early years&mdash; there was no market for barley.</P>
      <P>I remember being on a deputation, the first Messrs.  Guinness ever met, in 1935, when they told that organisation that their requirements were 500,000 barrels and no more.  If it were not for the Minister for Agriculture that day, Deputy Dr. Ryan, the farmers who were then growing barley would not have a market for it.  There was a surplus of barley all over the country during those years, until the people changed over to the wheat scheme.  If it had not been for the agitation and sabotage practised on the people during the economic war when this scheme was put into effect, we would have markets for the crops.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies have stated that the Minister must be complimented on giving the guaranteed prices.  Do Deputies on this side realise that we have had guaranteed prices for the past 15 years?  I know there are not many representative farmers on the far side of the House and consequently they know very little about farming.  I am a farmer and I know I was getting a guaranteed price 15 years ago for my produce and we did not have to wait until the present Minister came in to get a guaranteed price.  Deputies are making great play with the fact that the Minister has fixed the price at 62/6 per barrel for the coming year.  That price was fixed last October, and not by the present Minister.  The sooner they give up that campaign throughout the country, that this Minister was responsible for 62/6 per barrel for wheat, the better.  Let them be honest with the people down the country.  That price was fixed by Deputy Smith when he was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given a guarantee of 62/6 for five years, but has he taken <Col N="403" /> into account the cost of production over those five years?  Will he place that price on a sliding scale, when it will be far better for the farmer? Farmers in this case are possibly being misled.  The tendency at the moment is towards increases in the cost of living, which is going up, as we are all aware.  Rates are going up substantially, helped by the present Government and their policy.  Because these things are going up, the cost of producing wheat is going up&mdash;whether it be through increased cost in outlay or expenditure in production.  If you have a lower income at the end of the year, your cost has gone up, and the cost of this wheat has gone up even since last October.  The advantage conferred on the farmers and wheat growers may amount to nothing in the finish and we may be in a worse-off position than we were before the Minister gave the guarantee for five years.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to beet.  The Minister was asked a question, when the wages of agricultural labourers were increased immediately after the price of beet being fixed, if, having regard to the increase in wages, the Minister would instruct the sugar company to increase the price of beet, and his answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Now, what concern had that Minister for the farmers? I know he has always regarded wheat and beet as being a cod, but it was not a cod in 1941.  It was not a cod to have flour and bread and sugar in 1941. To-day, the Minister is only concerned with feeding that old and valued customer that starved us in 1848, and chastised us afterwards.  Is it the Minister's intention, in 1948, to provide them with cheap food and chastise them afterwards?  Would it not be better for us to chastise them before we give it to them and ask Britain to take her fingers out of the pies in this country and permit us to have a united country here?  He thought he could serve best by giving cheap food to England.</P>

      <P>The Minister is concerned with free food for England.  He does not want to give free food to the fly-by-nights on the Continent, but he does want to give it to England at the expense of the Irish farmer.  The best evidence of what he has done has been proved over the last three weeks at our fairs, and it is not the Dublin butchers who are responsible for that.  When the people of this country realise that the trade agreement that was made when the world was starving for food is of no material benefit to them, I wonder what the Minister will have to say?  I heard critics of the 1938 Agreement, when this country and every other country in the world was overloaded with food and when it could be given away, say that it was a good agreement.  It was good not merely from the farmers' point of view but from the national point of view as well. In 1948, when the Minister got the chance of making an agreement that would be of material benefit to the Irish farmer and when the world was starving for food, he went and dealt with the old and valued customer that he would like to feed at a cheap price and at the expense of the Irish farmer.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned Marshall Aid in his opening speech.  I wonder does he realise that a great many people all over the country are beginning to think that, if he had not been so foolish in some of the statements that he made regarding compulsory tillage and compulsory wheat-growing, the great American <Col N="405" /> nation, in its generosity, might consider giving us a grant instead of a loan?  Does he realise that Europe is starving, and that America is doing everything that is humanly possible to help the people of Europe?  But here we are with a Minister for Agriculture who tells the world that we will have no more compulsory tillage and no more compulsory wheat growing.  In effect, it means that we were going to grow our own potatoes, but that we were not going to grow our own wheat unless in so far as our farmers do it voluntarily, and that there is going to be no compulsion. Does the Minister realise that the farmers of this country are not going to continue tillage over great parts of the country unless they are compelled to do it?</P>
      <P>When did it dawn on the Minister that there has not been compulsion in this country?  So far as the farmers are concerned we had it under the British régíme and under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  It has always been necessary, and we must have it to-day.  Even at times the Minister himself has to be compelled to do things.  We cannot get on without compulsion.  What seems to be forgotten is that the people of this country are going to utilise their land in the future as a result of the Minister's statement in the easiest way they can, whether they are going to make much of a profit or not.  That is going to be the position.  We know how laborious tillage work can be, but we also know the amount of employment that it gives and will continue to give.  Think of all the employment that beet-growing gives.  There is employment on the land, there is employment in the factories, there is employment with sack manufacturers, for road transport anl on the railways.</P>

That was a white elephant, was it not? <Col N="406" /> At the same time the Government were paying 33/- to the Irish farmer for producing wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it 15 years ago. Wheat is the most valuable crop that we can have in the country.  It gives employment on the land and it keeps our mills working.  The policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was to import flour into the country. That policy left the mills idle.  To-day, because of the wheat scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil, the mills are all working and the workers are being paid overtime.  The same thing applies to the men who are employed where the wheat is stored.  They get overtime during the harvest period.  I would remind the Minister of this&mdash;perhaps he does not know it, with all his theoretical advisers&mdash;that you can save 20 acres of wheat while you would be saving three acres of barley.  Does he realise that, even in the morning if he were to give 55/- as against 50/-, wheat would be grown in preference to barley in many parts of the country?  I told the Minister that I would not grow barley.  I will grow wheat in preference to it.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to refer to the abatement of rates, the question of having the abatement applied to casual workers on the land.  We have seasonal work on beet, mangolds and turnips and on sowing the crops in spring where casual labour is taken in, but unless you have continuity all the year round you are not entitled to that abatement.  It has often happened, however, that the number of casuals is far greater than the number of permanents a farmer might have and, consequently, these men should get the benefit of the abatement.</P>

      <P>This has been an important Estimate, and the fact that so many Deputies have spoken to it proved that it is one of the most important Estimates that will be brought before the House.  Listening to the debate, it struck me that a great many Deputies who spoke seemed to have one common object in view, to defeat at all costs the policy which the Minister has so ably propounded when introducing this Estimate.  I should like, as an ordinary Deputy in this House, to remind the Deputies opposite that when a Minister for Agriculture gets up in this House it does not matter to me a &ldquo;tráinín&rdquo; whether I belong to the Party of which he is a Minister or not.  I have sufficient intelligence and sufficient patriotism left in me to know that he is speaking in the interests of all the farmers of this country, whether those farmers are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta.  It should be the duty of all Deputies of this House, irrespective of what Party they belong to, to support as far as is humanly possible the policy that has been abumbrated here on last Friday by the Minister for Agriculture, because that policy is the policy that has been adopted by the Executive Council that guides the destiny of this country at the present time.  I might also remind the Deputies opposite that he is here by the votes of the people and that he has been elected, rightly or wrongly, by the Taoiseach, who is a man who commands the respect and admiration, not alone of the people of this country, but of the people of other countries as well.  Consequently, I deplore many of the speeches that have been delivered here on this very important Estimate since last Friday.</P>

    <P>References have been made to the wheat scheme, the barley scheme, the oats scheme and the poultry scheme. The Minister has stated here in no uncertain way that he is prepared to guarantee a price for the growing of wheat for the next five years.  That is giving the option to any section of our farmers to grow wheat, notwithstanding what he may have said in years gone by.  We know that you Deputies on the far side are fond of referring to <Col N="408" /> the past.  Although I do not want to do it, I could refer to the past as well, and to some of the statements made by the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, but I look to the future. We want to put the agriculture of this country on a solid basis.  Are you going to help or are you not?  That is a question I want to put to you as Deputies representing a very large section of our people.

      <P>Are you going to help the Minister for Agriculture to get the farmers, the men who helped you, to produce 700,000 barrels at the fixed price of 55/- as against the 35/- or 40/- which obtained for the past 15 years?  Are you going to forget politics, forget your prejudices, your envies and your jealousies that you have shown here since Friday, and act the part of Irishmen, not of traitors? Are you going to help him to produce all the oats that the farmers of the country can produce in order to ensure the survival of the country which you profess to have such an interest in? Are you going to help the Minister for Agriculture to produce for export, in addition to the quantity that will be produced for home consumption, 50,000 tons ware potatoes at prices ranging from £10 to £11 a ton as against the prices reigning hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In part of my constituency in North Cooley, where we have the best farms that are to be found in this country or in any other country, the farmers were selling their potatoes at an average price of £4 10s. for the last 15 years. Are you going to enable the Minister for Agriculture to produce that 50,000 for export?  I wish my colleague, Deputy Aiken, were here now so that I could put that strong question to him regarding the £3 10s. that was paid to the farmers of Cooley.  We came on a deputation to get that extra £1, £4 10s. or £5 10s. as against the £10 or £11 which has been guaranteed <Col N="409" /> to the Minister as far as 50,000 tons are concerned.  Will you help the Minister for Agriculture, not for his personal interests but in the interests of the Irish people and tell your farmer friends down the country to rear and produce all the poultry they can and all the eggs, and that they have a guranteed market for all they can produce during the few years that lie ahead?  Those are the questions I would like to put to the Deputies opposite who have been elected, as I have been elected, to come to this House and work in the best interests of the people as a whole, not for any section of the people, to forget their own small little ways, the small little jealousies that have been shown here during the last few days.  They are inwardly wishing that the Minister may fail in his policy during the coming year.  I am one of the men who call a spade a spade.  I am here elected by the people of Louth, independent of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, or any of the other Parties that constitute this Dáil at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am here to serve the interests of the people who have sent me here. During my term of 21 years, and especially during the last 15 years, I have treated with sympathy whatever Minister was in the Fianna Fáil Government. I did my best in my native country to help him in whatever policy the Government of the day propounded and which they thought would serve the best interests of the people as a whole.  I tell Deputies that if they are going to act up to the principles which they have professed and propounded here during the last three or four days, each and every one of them will go back to their respective constituencies and do their humble best to induce farmers and all concerned to make the policy propounded by the Minister on last Friday the success which it deserves to be.  In doing that, they will be working in the interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>References have been made to what the Minister was supposed to do, to promises that he made and did not fulfil, and to schemes he turned down. I ask Deputies to try to endeavour to read intelligently the statement of the <Col N="410" /> Minister.  If they did that, they would not have made the speeches they made during the last three days, especially in regard to the farm improvement scheme, because it seems to me that a great many Deputies do not know the difference between the farm improvement scheme and the farm buildings scheme.  They do not seem to have read the Minister's statement, otherwise they could not have made the speeches which have been made during the last three days.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said by Deputies opposite with reference to the feelings of farmers as regards the supposed dropping of this scheme, let me say that the Minister was quite right in view of the position with regard to building materials that exists at present, especially with reference to cement.  Does any Opposition Deputy, with the experience that he has had during the last three or four months, think it right that cement or any other materials incidental or ancillary to the building of houses for the working people of the country should be used in farm buildings or in carrying out farm improvements?  If not, why, then, twit the Minister about what he is supposed to have done and what he really has not done at all?  This scheme will go on.  The Minister has said so.  He has praised the farm buildings scheme. He has given his reasons for the delay so far as proceeding with the scheme is concerned.  Opposition Deputies, of course in order to score some little political points, had to misrepresent what the Minister stated in his opening speech last Friday.</P>
    <P>Let me again say in regard to this farm improvement scheme and this farm buildings scheme, that I am one of those who happen to mix as much with farmers as any Deputy, and I can say that I have never heard one farmer in County Louth criticising the action of the Minister in regard to the farm buildings scheme.  I think they are as good and efficient and industrious farmers as are to be found in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Of course Deputies opposite were so anxious to score off the Minister that they did not think it worth while to read his statement intelligently so as to enable them <Col N="411" /> to discuss this Estimate with credit to themselves and advantage to the people whom they represent.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think I can say on behalf of the majority of the farmers of this country that they are all delighted with the statement made by the Minister on Friday last.  It is now up to Deputies to do their level best to make his work as easy as possible.  In doing that they can be fortified in the thought and belief that they are not doing it in the interests of the present Minister, but in the interests of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>A lot has been said on this Estimate concerning the methods for increased milk production.  Unfortunately, I am refreshingly ignorant in matters of this kind and I would not dare to venture to make any suggestions in the matter.  What I am really interested in is that, in the great drive for increased agricultural output, the great objective of farmers and milk producers should be more and more milk.  Along with that I should like to think that the motto of our people should be &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo;. Unfortunately, we in this country are very much behind other people in our milk consumption per head of the population.  I feel, and I think rightly so, that that has had and will continue to have a detrimental effect on the health of the community generally. But, if people are to be encouraged to drink more milk, the very least we can do is to ensure that these people will have no doubts in their minds as to the manner in which this commodity was produced.  I feel it my duty to suggest to the Minister that the time has arrived when steps should be taken to see that the milk supply of this country is produced universally under such sanitary conditions as will ensure its being the valuable article of food which it ought to be rather than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me turn then to the question of the tuberculin testing of cows, if that is relevant.  I maintain that in so far as the State assumes responsibility concerning human tuberculosis, it should take upon itself the responsibility of providing the necessary cost for the tuberculin testing of cows and in any such cases where, as a result of the testing, those animals have to be destroyed, the State should make good the loss to the owner.  It is rather a wide subject, I have been informed, but I think that it is one worth considering.  With regard to our agricultural output generally, I would say that, unfortunately, in the past efficiency has not been an outstanding trait in our people.  Rather have we been inclined to adopt an &ldquo;It will do rightly&rdquo; attitude to a lot of things.  That tendency has, I am afraid, percolated down through the centuries.  Admittedly, in the past, no great inducement was ever held out to us to do things really well.  Now, however, that agriculture has become our own responsibility, I think the Minister will not resent my suggestion that quality in our agricultural output should not be lost sight of in his quest for quantity.  To achieve quantity in our agricultural output I would say to the Minister that, in my opinion, our agricultural output will be strictly proportional to the degree of contentment that exists amongst the workers on the farms.  For that reason, if for no other&mdash;and there are other reasons&mdash;I would appeal to the Minister to consider favourably at the earliest possible opportunity the conditions of service and the wages of the agricultural labourers and to ensure, if possible, that their status will be at least brought up to that of industrial employees.  Until agriculture and industry in this country become handmaidens to one another we can never hope to stem the tide of the emigration of the youth of this country to work <Col N="414" /> in other countries.  I am sure that the stemming of emigration is the objective of every Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>Although the recent milk strike in Counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath has fizzled out, I would ask the Minister not to assume because of that that those milk producers suddenly realised that they were getting an economic price for their milk.  In my town alone two of the principal milk suppliers have ceased to supply milk altogether.  The Minister must realise that there is no comparison between the costs of production of milk in Counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath and the cost of production in the other great milk producing districts of the South such as the Golden Vale of Limerick, Tipperary and Cork.  In the North, and in our county particularly&mdash;the Minister's own constituency&mdash;I am sure he must realise that farmers there have to hand feed their cattle for two months of the year more than the milk producers down South.  For that reason, I would ask him&mdash;I am sure he will come up against them in the future&mdash;to see to it that those milk suppliers in Monaghan, Cavan and Meath get at least an economic price for their product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been somewhat disturbed to-night by the trend of the advocacy towards compulsion.  If there was one part of the Minister's statement more than another which appealed very strongly to me it was that in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the Minister of Agriculture down to the most junior inspector in my Department, he will enter on his neighbour's land in future by invitation or not at all.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quoting from columns 2593-4, Official Report of the 9th July, 1948. To me that statement is something very fundamental.  It is an outlook which has been lost sight of for many years past in this country.  I welcome the return of that point of view.  On all sides of the House Deputies expressed alarm and dissatisfaction at the Minister's policy in this respect.  With regard to those people who are very ready to apply compulsory methods I would say that of all the nations in the <Col N="415" /> world I want to belong to Ireland most; I want to be an Irishman more than a citizen of any other country, but I want to be a free Irishman.  I do not want to be bossed.  For that reason I commend the Minister's attitude and I welcome his statement.  I am quite confident that the Irish farmer will fully justify the confidence the Minister is now reposing in him.  I am a firm believer in government by inducement rather than by compulsion.  If any Government wants any section of the community to put into effect any particular part of Government policy, then it is the Government's business to make it attractive for that particular section of the community to do what the Government thinks ought to be done. Deputies on the Opposition Benches may not yet recognise or realise that that learning towards bossing of Irish people contributed to a very great extent to the fact that they now find themselves in opposition.</P>
    <P>I would like to issue a word of warning to the Minister, having commended him as I have done.  I want him so to direct his policy as to avoid any return in this country to the ranching system. The world to-day is faced with a conflict between two philosophies&mdash; between the philosophy, I think it right to say, of Moscow and of Rome. The surest material bulwark in the material sense against the odious menace of Communism in this country is to have a satisfied community of land-holders on moderately sized economic holdings.  If you have a satisfied farming community&mdash;which, in my definition, includes the agricultural workers as well as the farmers&mdash; you will have, next to religion, the strongest material bulwark you can have against Communism.  The Minister should, therefore, direct his policy to that end.  You will not have a satisfied people and, above all, you will not have satisfied Irishmen, if they are being told&mdash;as the Minister himself said&mdash;what to do and how to do it, what time to get up in the morning and what time to go to bed at night, what they are to eat and how often.</P>
    <P>I would also say to the Minister that I do not want this country to be <Col N="416" /> England's larder.  If we can read from the Minister's pronouncement that that is one of his ambitions, then I would like him to know that I am not at one with him in that.  In the history of the relations between this country and England there is no reason that I know of why we should have any feelings of very great friendship towards our neighbour across the Channel.</P>

      <P>I believe that our first allegiance should be to Ireland&mdash;first, last and all the time.  I certainly do not consider that in justice, at any rate, we owe anything to our neighbour across the Channel whatever we might owe in charity.  Accordingly, I do not approve of the Minister's leanings towards the making of this country a larder or a kitchen garden for England.  It may be said that it is a sure market.  I think it would be wiser to take the best there is from day to day in the present state of events in the world and, if we can get better terms anywhere else, then I think we ought to take them.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat disturbed at the trend of the debate and I was disappointed,. too, because of the extraordinary and unnecessary bitterness which was introduced.  I deplore that sort of conduct in debate.  In fairness to the House, I may say that unfortunately the bitterness was not confined to one side of the House.  We could all of us conduct ourselves more like Christian Irishmen rather than conduct ourselves in the manner we have witnessed here on this Estimate in the past few days.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With a great deal of what the Minister stated I quite readily agree.  I disagree with some points and other points, I think, would create a certain amount of distrust and suspicion in my mind.  That, however, may not be justified, because the Minister is at times undoubtedly inclined to a little exaggeration.  With regard to his rather alarming statement as to the reduction in our cattle population, I think that he is hardly justified in the picture he drew.  He took last January as the date on which to base his figures.  My memory goes back over a long period, and I know that in this country at one time there was very little sale for cattle from October until February.  Last year there was a continuous sale of cattle all the year round and cattle were being exported without interruption during the winter months. I would say that the decrease could be largely accounted for in that way. In fact, for several years the sale of cattle has been very brisk.  If we sell them and send them out of the country, we cannot have them here.  There is, of course, a possible shortage of cows, but that is largely accounted for by the big prices prevailing.  So long as people get a better price for dry stock they will not concentrate on cows, and unless the Minister can bring about some departure from that, that state of affairs will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I am really concerned with is what appears to be the Minister's policy of departure from tillage and a reversal to the grazing system.  I hope I am not right in that, but, judging by a number of the Minister's statements, it would appear as if he is bent on concentrating on a policy of grazing and the production of cattle mainly for export to England.  I will not deny that a large amount of export is required, but it should not be the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, above all men, to concentrate on a grazing policy.  I agree with several Deputies opposite who said that we should aim at the splitting up of the larger ranches.  This moral suasion or <Col N="418" /> persuasion is all right, talking of ordinary people, but the experience of all of us is that you cannot persuade the rancher to till; it is the last thing in the world that he wants to do.  I have seen that for myself.  In this matter I have no personal feeling against any man.</P>

      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House on these interruptions, and I will proceed to deal with the policy in relation to tillage.  I agree with the Minister when he says that, if possible, you should use persuasion, enticement or inducement by way of guaranteed prices.  That is perfectly sound, and there is no departure from Fianna Fáil policy in that connection.  That policy has been pursued for a long time and I hope it will succeed.  There may be cases in which it may not succeed, and there should be provision made for that, especially in times of crisis.  Now as regards wheat-growing, the pet aversion of the Minister for Agriculture to wheat-growing is one of the things I cannot understand.  Again and again the Minister said that he regards wheat-growing as all cod and nonsense.  I do not quite understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not his statements show how much he is against it?  We <Col N="419" /> all agree wheat growing is necessary, and if it is good policy for the people in the Argentine and Canada and the United States to grow wheat, why should it be bad policy here?  Surely we should try to produce the food we require in so far as it is possible to do so?  I agree with the Minister that in certain impoverished lands and other types of land, you cannot successfully grow wheat, but in most of the counties of Ireland you can grow it successfully, provided that the land is properly tilled and manured.  I do not say you will get a good crop of wheat after an oats crop, but in most districts you would get a good wheat crop after potatoes or other root crops.  Why cannot we grow wheat in the lands that are suitable?</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with our chief agricultural officer in County Roscommon and he satisfied himself by experiments that in those lands where wheat has failed the reason was lack of lime and phosphates.  These are the things the Minister should concentrate on&mdash;making lime and phosphates available for those lands.  If he does so, he will find that the people can get splendid crops of wheat.  Years ago I was harvesting a crop of wheat and a man who had been in the United States happened to come along.  I asked him his experience in that country and he told me he had been engaged in harvesting wheat and he said the crop I was harvesting was at least twice as heavy as the United States crop would be.  If that is so, there is no reason why we should not grow it here in suitable land.  I hope the Minister will change his ideas and cease calling this nonsense and all cod and encourage the growing of wheat and beet and other things we can grow so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has in mind schemes for the production of burnt lime and crushed limestone.  It is time such schemes should be proceeded with and in this connection I feel sure he will have the hearty co-operation of everybody.  The main point is to make these things available in backward and boggy districts, where they are so much required.  Of course, transport may make it impossible for some <Col N="420" /> farmers to get it, unless there is some organisation which will place this burnt lime and crushed limestone at the disposal of the smaller farmers particularly.  Boggy lands are always in need of lime, but never so much as at the present time.  The Minister should concentrate on cheap crushed limestone and have it transported to those backward areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the testing of soil by the officers of the county committees of agriculture.  That is a very commendable thing and I congratulate the Minister on putting that idea forward.  I hope he will continue with it.  At the present time there are various crops that turn out a failure. On testing the soil, it may be found that there are certain elements missing which can be supplied by farmyard or artificial manure.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an expert in the dairying industry, although I was reared in a district where dairy cows constituted a very important factor as the means of living of the small farmers.  I would like to tell the Minister that there is a very real grievance in the cutting away of the subsidy on farmers' butter.  If the Minister believes, as he seems to, that there can be a very good price got, despite the fact that the subsidy has been cut away, he should provide some organisation by which the small country farmers who have no creamery within reach will get a market for their butter.  I can assure him that within the last few days I have known of people who took in their country butter to the town where last year they had no bother in selling it and they could not sell it.  Even where they did sell it during some weeks past, they did not get anything like the price that is paid for creamery butter.  That is not as it ought to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you why. In the towns the country people are entitled to a ration of butter.  In the summer time they do not take it and in the towns they now have an extra supply.  The ration that would normally go in winter time to the country people is used by the townspeople and they do not want the <Col N="421" /> country butter.  That is the position and I think it is a sufficient explanation. If there is a market outside, I suggest to the Minister that he should get some organisation going.  I am not going to criticise him for that.  I do not blame the Minister for Agriculture altogether because I think the Minister for Finance introduced the matter in his Budget, but, in any case, he should have some organisation through which country people would be able to sell their butter.  That is all I ask. There is no use in saying that the country woman can sell her butter at a good price at the moment.  Possibly if some organisation were in existence she could, and I would ask the Minister to get such an organisation going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>All I know is that people tell me they cannot sell it in local towns.  If some organisation was set up and if the Minister has a market for it, they could get it.  A good deal of time has already elapsed, as May, June and July are the months in which butter is mostly produced.</P>
      <P>I am going over these matters rather hastily, but I want to say a word or two in regard to the matter of pigfeeding. We all know that there is a great shortage of pigs and bacon and the Minister, I think, has got the idea that that is due to the fact that there is a black market in bacon.  There may be a certain amount of that, but I do not think that that is the main cause of the shortage.  The main cause why pigs are not being produced at the moment is that you cannot produce pigs at the present price, even if there was no shortage of feeding stuffs.  I state that deliberately, speaking from my own experience.  Unless there is an increase in the price of pigs or a reduction in the cost of feeding stuffs, you cannot have an increase in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you tell your own Minister that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Strange to say, the prices of feeding stuffs have gone up <Col N="422" /> rather than come down.  Potatoes are much dearer than they were last year. I am not making any political point out of this nor do I wish to make any political point out of any matter that I have raised this evening.  The price of feeding stuffs is such that pigs cannot be produced at a profit at the moment.  If you buy a pair of slips at £12 or £13 and feed them for three months, I defy you to make a profit or pay for any labour involved in feeding these pigs out of the price you will get for them.  We all want to see increased production, but unless there is some change in the cost of feeding stuffs or an increase in the price of bacon, you are not going to get the pigs.  You simply cannot at present prices.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the farm improvements scheme, the building of out-offices and reconstruction.  Deputy Coburn stated that he did not hear any complaints in County Louth.  That is probably correct, because Louth is a very up-to-date county, but if he would come with me to West Roscommon, North Roscommon, Mayo and County Galway, where the farms are not so up-to-date&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture knows these areas very well&mdash;he would see that there is a very big need for improved farm buildings.  There is no need to convert the Minister on that point.  I agree with the statement of Deputy Dr. Ryan that some of this work at least could be put under way. For instance, cement may not be required in all cases.  I would ask the Minister, if it is at all possible, to make provision for these works where materials are available and where the works would not call for a supply of cement that he should allow such works to proceed.  In that way, he would be getting rid of some portion of the problem, because it is a problem that is cumulative.  I think something could be done in cases where materials are available, the use of which will not detract from the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question that has been very lightly touched upon is the question of agricultural education.  The Minister, of course, says that no inspector will be authorised to enter upon a farm <Col N="423" /> without an invitation from the owner but, no matter how you may look at it, the ordinary farmer in this country is not properly instructed in agriculture. The instructors under the county committees do very good work, no doubt, but their scope is limited.  It is an absolute impossibility to visit every farm.  I am present at nearly every meeting of the committee of agriculture in my county and I find that there is an aggregate of some hundreds of visits by these instructors.  I do not say they are invited in every case, but they go in there on friendly visits.  That is work of a very useful nature, but I say it is not enough.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was what I might call an agitation in favour of an agricultural bias in education.  In those years a number of reading lessons on agricultural subjects were provided in books in the national schools, but within recent years these have been abandoned.  As a matter of fact boys and girls leaving the national schools know practically nothing about agriculture. I think that is a great mistake. We should undoubtedly give an agricultural bias to the education imparted at least in country schools. I would say at the very least we could have lessons in agricultural subjects included in the reading books.  Simple as that may appear, it would certainly arouse the people's interest in the subject of agriculture.  On many occasions I have put up in my own constituency and elsewhere a plea that there should be a class room attached to country schools in which vocational or agricultural subjects could be taught.  When boys and girls reach the age of 12, or between the age of 12 and 15, I do not see any reason why they should not get some instruction in agricultural subjects. The teacher may not be qualified in all cases to give this instruction but in some cases it could be done by itinerant teachers under the vocational system.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think more could be done under the auspices of the county committee of agriculture. To do this, of course, would require more money. The present Minister knows some of <Col N="424" /> the potentialities of these committees. He knows they are very much in touch with the people and that they could do a lot of useful work.  I have seen myself classes conducted by poultry instructresses in the keeping of poultry and the making of butter, and that is a matter which I regard as very important in country districts.  If these classes were multiplied I think a great deal more could be done.  I was present recently at a conference on food production, but I think if, in addition to his proposal to have scientific research carried out in agriculture, the Minister would make provision for additional instruction in country places he would be doing a very useful work.  As I said at the outset, I do not want to make any political capital out of this matter one way or the other.  I happen to be chairman of the county committee of agriculture, and I am fairly interested in the subject. I am sure the Minister could, by assisting such committees in the directions which I have indicated, do a considerable amount for the furtherance of agricultural production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that a new chapter in the history of our agricultural economy is opening up, and I am further convinced that the farmers have been released from bondage and that, for once in their lives, so far as the past number of years are concerned, they can breathe freely and enjoy the freedom they desire.  The agricultural industry is the predominant industry, but it is an industry which has been neglected and forgotten.  One of the first steps of Fianna Fáil was to industrialise the country, but they forgot about our agriculture and about the foundations on which that industry should be based.  In doing that I feel that they put the cart before the horse, because their first duty was to establish our agricultural industry on a firm and solid basis.  So many years have passed and this neglect has been so <Col N="425" /> continuous from year to year that the Minister is faced with a stupendous task in bringing it back to anything like what it should be.  He has tackled the problem in a businesslike way and I have no doubt that, as a business man, a practical man who has studied the industry from A to Z, he will, at the end of his term of office, show very satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Like a number of other Deputies, I detest the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;.  I think that to most Irishmen the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; is obnoxious, because for years we laboured under various forms of compulsion.  At the outset of my remarks I said the farmers had been released from bondage, and by that I meant released from that obnoxious obligation of compulsory tillage.  While tillage was essential during the emergency and while a certain amount of compulsion was necessary, I think it was carried to extremes.  A quota of three-eights of the arable land was excessive.  First, there was not sufficient labour to harvest that amount of crop; and, secondly, it was a rough and ready form of tillage that was carried out, for the simple reason that people were not able to comply to the full with the quota requirements.  If a much smaller quota had been fixed, far better results would have accrued.  With less tillage, there would have been more food, if the quota had been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that that has ceased once and for all, and I have no hesitation in saying that the farmers will respond to the call of the Minister and of the House to produce much more food and much more grain than they produced under compulsion, in circumstances very different from those which prevailed for the past few years.  In my county compulsion was resented by almost all farmers, particularly in connection with wheat, and I agree with the Minister up to a point that, so far as my county was concerned, the growing of wheat was a pure and absolute &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  There is no doubt about that. Unlike Deputy O'Rourke, I have seen no satisfactory results from wheat growing in my county, and, in 99 per cent. of cases there, more wheat was <Col N="426" /> put into the ground than was ever taken out of it.</P>
    <P>Let me give my own experience. My quota was three and a half statute acres, and last year I spent something like £19 on seed wheat.  I did a decent job on the sowing of that wheat.  I produced a decent seed bed, manuring it perfectly with both farmyard and artificial manure.  The net result was that I sold my wheat last harvest and got £14 12s. 6d. for it.  The seed alone cost me £19, without taking into consideration my expenses in labour, ploughing, sowing, reaping, threshing and so on.  That was my experience, and the experience of at least 70 per cent. of the farmers of County Roscommon. When it is impossible to grow wheat in a particular area, people should not be compelled to grow it, a policy which continued unceasingly for six or seven years.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the trade agreement.  The farmers, from North to South, show signs of happiness, contentment and of anticipation of better times as a result of it. Heretofore, the farmer did not know exactly to-day what his condition to-morrow might be, but he has now got a long-term guarantee for four years in respect of prices for his cattle and eggs.  He has a fixed guaranteed price for his wheat and barley for the next five years and he is no longer going around in the dark as he has been for some years past.  He was like a man playing blind-man's buff and did not know where he was going.</P>
    <P>In dealing with agriculture it is necessary in many respects to couple it with other industries, and for that reason the activities of other Departments, such as the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce and Education, are closely interwoven with the activities of the Department of Agriculture.  In that connection, I refer to drainage.  Drainage and agriculture are closely associated, and I suggest to the Minister that there should be a certain amount of co-operation between his Department and the Department of Finance in relation to drainage.  We want to increase agricultural production, no matter what it costs, and, if we want to put more land <Col N="427" /> into production, we have to carry out an extensive scheme of drainage.  Such work has already started, but there are some minor drainage schemes which have been neglected and there are thousands of acres of land which could become productive, if these minor schemes of drainage were undertaken. I suggest that the Minister should make representations to the Department of Finance with a view to getting these schemes carried out under the Board of Works, with minor relief grants, if possible.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is also closely associated with education.  Deputy O'Rourke has already referred to this, and I am in entire agreement with him in that respect.  The child's mind is formed in the national school, and I suggest that, in receiving his primary education, the child should be given something in the nature of an elementary knowledge of agriculture.  There was a time, some 30 or 40 years ago, when agriculture was a recognised subject in these schools.  It is amusing to see the readers that I see with my young children.  Whether Irish or English, they invariably deal with wild animals, perhaps the Polar bear in Russia or wild animals in some other part of the world, whereas if they contained nice little instructive lessons on the cultivation of plots we would be laying the foundation of an interest in agriculture. The mentality of the younger people is a drift away from the land and that has been brought about by the attractions and inducements of the city, where there are more amenities and more comforts, cinemas and all the rest of it.  If we could inculcate in the young people a taste for agriculture it would gradually develop and it would encourage them to engage in the most desirable occupation we can offer to our people, namely agriculture.</P>
    <P>The teacher should have some qualifications in agriculture and before entrance to the training college there should be some test to show that he has an elementary knowledge of that important subject.  Although we have a number of agricultural schools, the number is far too few.  The existing schools are utilised to the utmost and <Col N="428" /> I have heard that it is very difficult for farmers' sons to gain admission to the schools.  There should be more of these schools.  As a matter of fact, I would suggest that in each of the Twenty-Six Counties there should be an agricultural school and a demonstration farm attached to that school, because at present there is not sufficient accommodation for all the people who wish to pursue a course in such a school.</P>
    <P>As to the cost of feeding-stuffs and its effect on pig production, a great deal can be said.  At the present time pig production is not a profitable business because of the high cost of feeding-stuffs, and I would ask the Minister to consider the price of one very important feeding-stuff.  namely, maize, and to make representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to that matter.  Maize is unsurpassed as far as pig production is concerned.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question here yesterday, I heard a price of £22 or £22 10s. 0d. being quoted for maize at the port. The present retail price in my part of the country is £1 8s. 8d. per cwt.  I understand that maize is being sold to the mills at about £23 10s. 0d. or £24 a ton.  If the margin of £4 10s. 0d. is allowed to the millers, I consider that excessive and I would advise the Minister to consider that and to reduce the profit to £2 a ton, which would be sufficient for any miller.  I would ask the Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see that the price of maize would be reduced by at least 2/- a cwt.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest that the Minister should use his good offices to have rural electrification spread all over the country.  The farming community at the moment are a discontented community.  The great difficulty with the farmer is to get his son to settle down on the farm.  Many factors contribute to the unrest, uneasiness and discontent.  If there were rural electrification the young farmer could fodder his cattle, pulp his turnips and crush his oats at night.  It would be an inducement to him to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would suggest that the matter of water supply should not <Col N="429" /> be neglected.  That is another amenity to which people in rural areas are entitled but which they are deprived of in many cases.  The Minister should consult with whatever Minister is responsible for that matter.</P>
    <P>The debate has been very protracted and there is nothing very much left for me to say except that I, on behalf of the people I represent, wish the Minister many happy years of office and I know, and I am glad to say, that the people in my constituency expect the great things from him that he has promised us.</P>
