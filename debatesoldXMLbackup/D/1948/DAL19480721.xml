      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was speaking on the question of Partition.  There is no single matter that affects our external relations so deeply and affects the general position of this country in time of crisis so much as this question of Partition.  It is a vital question for <Col N="948" /> solution if relations between ourselves and our neighbours are ever to be satisfactorily settled.  I said that the first thing we had to do was to make clear the facts in relation to this situation. These facts are not known abroad.  As I said last night, a myth has been created, suggesting to the people abroad that there is the same difference in this country as there might be, for instance, between the Jews and the Arabs.  There is nothing of the kind. It is completely wrong to pretend that the situation here is, as has been suggested, that we have one part of the country occupied exclusively by people of one racial strain and the other part occupied exclusively by people of a different racial strain.  There is no truth in that.  The racial strains are mixed right through the country, in different proportions it is true, but to suggest that there are in this country two completely different stocks, living in separate areas, is wrong.  It is also wrong to suggest that in the Six Counties we have some historic unit such as an ancient Irish province.  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also wrong to suggest that you have there a people who are homogeneous in political opinions, homogeneous in religion or anything else.  It is only part of the area to which such a suggestion might even be roughly applicable.  You can take the greater portion of that area and you will find that within it the desire to be attached to this country is the dominant political opinion.  I say political opinion because the differences that exist there are fundamentally political differences. They arise out of political controversies and they are political differences of the same type that might occur in any democratic country.  If we say that these political differences are to be solved by cutting off a part of the country occupied by a section holding a particular view differing from that of the vast majority of the people and if you admit that that may be done there is not a single democratic State in this world that could preserve its integrity. You will find that in every State there are some particular sections in which there is a more or less frozen political opinion which did not change in conformity <Col N="949" /> with opinion throughout the country as a whole.  No democratic State could last if such a principle were accepted.</P>
    <P>There is, in fact, no real justification for the division of this country.  I said last night that Britain was responsible for it.  So she is.  That is quite true. It was created by a British Act of Parliament and it is British forces that maintain it to-day.  Britain may find certain difficulties in solving it to-day, but Britain has created these largely for herself by the action of her statesmen in the past.  Britain, of course, at that particular time utilised these differences of political opinion in this country in the same manner that any country with hostile intentions towards another will utilise any differences of opinion in order to do something which she might want to do. Aggression in Europe could be brought about and attempts made to justify it by precisely the same methods to-day. Suppose there is a part of a country in which you have people who hold different political opinions from those held by the majority of the people in that country though they represent only a small part of the nation, they put up the plea that they are entitled to self-determination and they attach themselves to some outside nation which uses them to achieve its own particular purpose.  Would we admit that that was just?  We regard such a thing in this country, and it has been regarded by Irishmen always, as a hostile act.  As long as that hostile act continues against our nation it is ridiculous to think that our people are going to have towards Britain the feelings which it would be desirable both in our interests and in the interests of Britain herself that we should have.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at the manner in which the Minister dealt with the matter of the British Nationality Act. I think he has been altogether, from the Irish point of view, much too moderate in the terms he has used.  When we were the Government we indicated from the start that there were in the proposals put forward features which were highly objectionable to us. <Col N="950" /> Fundamentally, these have not been changed.  It is true, as the Minister said, that the new position of the British law will be an advance, a considerable advance, on what it was, over a certain part of the field.  Over the remainder of the field the fact that there is this reassertion of the British attitude at this particular time as against the Irish attitude is a distinct drawback.</P>
    <P>When we were dealing with this&mdash;I am sure the present Government has dealt with it in the same way&mdash;we dealt with it simply from the point of view that every advance was to the good.  The Minister pointed out very clearly last night, in another connection, that Governments shelve difficulties if they can.  There is nothing more natural for Governments than to take the line of least resistance.  If we want any British Government to face up to the problem, we have to present it to them in a firm and vigorous manner, and let them understand that the question of Partition is fundamental and vital as far as the relations between our two countries are concerned.  This Bill does not make for a settlement of these questions.  In this Nationality Bill, a copy of which I have as it left the House of Commons, it is quite clear that they are still maintaining that our citizens in the Six Counties who are natural born Irish citizens, owing allegiance to this nation and to no other, are now to be bound and dealt with exactly as if they were citizens of Britain.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that cannot be dealt with apart from dealing with the question of Partition.  I admit that quite frankly and freely.  We here, however, ought to express our protest and make it quite clear that we are not satisfied with that situation, and that anything that may be said by the Government in the way of commendation of any advances that have been made will not be understood or thought in any way to suggest that we are otherwise than completely dissatisfied with this position. I am perfectly sure that the Government is not satisfied with it. The past Government was not satisfied with it, and there is no Deputy or <Col N="951" /> Irishman in this country who is satisfied with it.  Let us say to start with that we protest against this partition of our country and protest against the occupation of it by Britain: that we protest against compelling the people of this country who have allegiance to this nation, and to this nation only, to be dealt with as if they had obligations and allegiance to another country.</P>
    <P>But we have in this Bill two other things of fundamental importance.  By our Nationality Act of 1935 we made it quite clear that none of our citizens was a British subject.  We made it quite clear that, as far as Irish will and Irish law was concerned, that situation had passed.  I have here our Nationality Act and I think it well to read a section of it.  Section 33 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1918, if and so far as they respectively are or ever were in force in Saorstát Éireann, are hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, therefore&mdash; and it is our will that should determine the matter in this as in the case of every sovereign State&mdash;as far as our will is concerned, there is no Irish citizen here who is a British subject, and the suggestion that they can remain or be such is completely wrong. Sub-section (2) of the Act provides&mdash; and this was, lest there should be any doubt about it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The common law relating to British nationality, if and so far as it is or ever was, either wholly or in part, in force in Saorstát Éireann, shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might have been suggested that because we had taken over the British code that even by our own law they were British citizens.  To make sure that there could be no plea of that sort suggested, there was that repeal of the common law in so far as it could be regarded at all as possibly dealing with nationality here.  Finally, because claims were being made from the British point of view contrary to this, we set out again most explicitly that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The facts or events by reason <Col N="952" /> of which a person is at any time a natural born citizen of Saorstát Éireann shall not of themselves operate to confer on such person any other citizenship or nationality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We wanted to make it quite clear that the fact of people being born in our territory did not mean that they could be classed as British citizens.  How, then, can we stand over and be taken as agreeing to the suggestion that people in this country who have been declared to be Irish citizens and Irish citizens only&mdash;declared to be that by our law&mdash;and not to have British citizenship, how can we stand over the suggestion that they can &ldquo;remain&rdquo; or be so?  We protested against such a proposal, and I feel certain that the present Minister also protested against it.  Despite these protests, this thing is being done.  We did admit that there were people who had, by overt act, accepted obligations by going into the British service, that they had accepted the obligations of British citizens and could be regarded as having embraced British nationality and inferentially abandoned ours.  We have, in fact, in our Nationality Act a section, Section 21, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Save as is otherwise provided by this Act, every citizen of Saorstát Éireann who, after he has attained the age of 21 years, becomes a citizen of another country shall thereupon cease to be a citizen of Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our view&mdash;my view, anyhow&mdash;was that those who had gone into the British service and accepted allegiance and the obligations of citizenship in another country could be regarded as having abandoned, so to speak, their Irish citizenship.  It would not have been inconsistent, in the case of those who had, by overt act of that particular kind declared themselves, so to speak, as ready to accept the obligations of British citizenship to admit that they could be allowed to do so and that we could make provision for them.  But in this Bill it is provided that if anybody at any time here claims&mdash;that is practically what it means&mdash;to be a British subject, he can be accepted as such.  He has <Col N="953" /> only to write to the British Home Secretary and make his claim.  It is true that the claim would have to be based, number one, on grounds that he has been in the Crown service. He can make the claim at any time. Surely some effort should have been made, and if there was this good will on the part of the British Government to meet our point of view, there could have been a time limit to this making of claim.  There should not have been this provision that they can at any time in the future make a claim on the basis that they have been at some previous time &ldquo;in the Crown service under his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom,&rdquo; or that they have had a passport.  That is open to a certain amount of questioning, too.  These passports in the past were issued under circumstances very different from the circumstances which obtain to-day.  The question is whether, if they are going to make that concession, there should not have been a time limit or some more definite specification.  &ldquo;If he is by descent&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know how far back you can go by way of descent. Then you have &ldquo;residence&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;by descent or residence.&rdquo;  We have four categories: in the crown service, those who have a passport issued to them, by descent or residence, and people can claim on any of these grounds.  I have tried to show you how wide these are, but surely the worst of all is that we have the alternative &ldquo;or otherwise,&rdquo;&ldquo;by descent, residence or otherwise.&rdquo; Descent and residence would be difficult enough to get into a class and say that the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> would apply.  It would seem to me that the only way I could make a case to get descent and residence into a class would be on the considerations determining citizenship generally, and I doubt very much if the British Home Secretary will be inclined to interpret it that way.</P>
    <P>What does that mean for us?  Our law, as we have declared it to be, is that our citizens have one allegiance, but according to this anybody who has even the remotest connection with Britain can claim to have allegiance to her.  This &ldquo;British subject,&rdquo; as I make it, means obligations of allegiance. All the time we have resisted <Col N="954" /> that, and I see no other meaning to it. If the question of allegiance does not come in I would like to know what does come in or what is the meaning of it. We have always resisted the giving of allegiance by our citizens to any State outside our own.  In the case of Ireland and Britain, it is particularly important, in view of the struggles of the past, that there should be a clear definition of the rights of every citizen in this country.  We have tried to give a clear definition in the Constitution. I have not the Constitution with me to quote it word for word, but in general terms it says that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are the first obligations of a citizen.  We cannot have in this country people whose first allegiance is not to our nation, and we should make it clear, if there are such people, that we do not regard them as our citizens, and we should know where we stand in respect of them.  What they are, to which country they are loyal will only appear in times of crisis. We are in a time of crisis; we have experience of them now and we should provide for times of crisis in the future.</P>
    <P>I think that the British Government is very far from meeting our point of view.  I am expressing this, lest by any chance it should appear from the statement which the Minister made last night&mdash;I can appreciate his attitude&mdash;or from the mild way he dealt with the subject that we are satisfied. I think it is particularly important, in view of some of the statements which were made in the British House of Lords recently and gave a completely wrong view as far as Ireland's attitude is concerned.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied with this Bill. We admit that it is an advance over something that was intolerable; there was an arrogance on the part of the British in dealing with us in this matter in a way that she would not have dealt with any outside country. Citizenship is one of the things which touches nearest the question of nationality.  No other country would tolerate the law as it existed and Britain knows that.  I have here a note regarding something that happened in 1922.  In 1922 the French <Col N="955" /> Government decreed that all residents in certain French territory should be French citizens and then sought to apply to them compulsory military service.  That was in Tunis and Morocco.  Britain, on behalf of her citizens, objected; France contended that it was a matter of domestic jurisdiction.  The matter was carried to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague and the court, in May, 1923, gave as its opinion that this dispute was not solely a matter of domestic jurisdiction.  The court pointed out that it did not lie with France alone to say that the citizenship of all the people on the territory she controlled was a matter of domestic jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>What I have said upon that is simply to point out that in treating us and dealing with our people as if they were British citizens in the past despite our law, Britain was acting in contravention of what was a well-recognised international rule.</P>
    <P>I have dealt so far with two of the objections from the Irish point of view to the provisions of the Bill.  First, it reasserts their attitude towards Partition and affects the great majority of our citizens in the Six Counties who do not admit of any foreign allegiance. We hear about coercion; we hear the old cry: &ldquo;Ulster will not be coerced&rdquo;, but surely it is coercion of the worst sort to compel a person to forswear the allegiance he naturally as a natural born citizen here has and to compel him to accept obligations of allegiance to another country.  If there is compulsory military service, are our people up there to be conscripted?  That is objection number one.</P>
    <P>Number two is the question I have been dealing with of continuing to be British subjects, but we have a third, and as far as our immediate position is concerned it is probably the most provocative of the lot.  I mean the question of the authority of our law here.  It is not the most objectionable fundamentally.  The most fundamentally objectionable feature is the reaffirmation of Partition.  Next to that comes the ignoring of our law and the insistence that British law should <Col N="956" /> in certain cases prevail over our law in the matter of citizenship.  It is a question of making Irish citizens, if they be in the Six Counties or in Britain or in British colonies subject to the obligations of British citizenship. That as a principle is completely wrong. I have read to the House how France tried to impose on British citizens in Morocco the same obligations as could be imposed on French citizens there. The Permanent Court of International Justice held that it was not a matter of domestic jurisdiction and we hold that it is not a matter of domestic jurisdiction either.  Our citizens in Britain should be dealt with as citizens of a sovereign, separate, independent State.  If relations are to be established between us on the basis of citizenship, if we are to make provisions for their citizens here and ours there, special from those with other countries, a convention must be duly arrived at between the two countries. That ought not to be done by unilateral action&mdash;by Britain.  We have to object to that.  I will admit that the Bill was very much worse in its original form, when it was suggested that the obligation of British citizenship should apply to Irish citizens everywhere.  There has been an improvement to the extent that it is now confined to our Six Counties and to British territory. There is a sort of corollary in the provisions making the terms of the British Shipping Act apply.  But the area is widened, imposing upon Irishmen the obligations which are only legitimate obligations to be imposed on British citizens.  Our people in Britain, so long as they remain Irish citizens, ought to be treated as the citizens of a sovereign, independent State, and in no other way.  I hope there is nothing in the suggestion&mdash;I was wondering if there was&mdash;that our Government have agreed to it.  I think we should not agree at all to any such unilateral action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Some statement was made which made me anxious.  I hope it is not true, and, if the Minister tells me that it is not true, I accept it unquestioningly.  It would be a serious matter if we accepted Britain's unilateral legislation in the matter. That has to be settled.  If a matter of mutual convenience or interest is involved, it has to be settled between the two countries, providing for our citizens there and for their citizens here on a status different from that of other countries; that is a matter to be arranged between the two countries in the manner in which it would be arranged between any two sovereign States by mutual agreement&mdash;by a convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, then, to object to that provision in the Bill.  Are our people to be dealt with in Britain in the same way in which the French wanted to deal with English citizens in Morocco?  The French action in that case might have led to war, because a strong nation would not permit that to be done with its citizens and would defend them against any attempt to impose obligations upon them which were inconsistent with their natural right and the accepted rules of international law. There might very well have been war over that, but both parties were wise enough to submit it to the Permanent Court and the decision in that case ought to be accepted as a decision determining the international law on the matter&mdash;that a State is not permitted in a vital matter of this sort to deal with the citizens of another State within their territory, just as if it were a matter of purely domestic legislation. I want to do everything I can&mdash;and I have, from the very beginning, tried to do everything I could and I have said so publicly, not merely during my period in office but long before it&mdash;to bring about good relations between the <Col N="958" /> two countries, and, if I speak as I speak now, to assert our position it is, because I know that, if that position is ignored, those good relations cannot be established.</P>
    <P>I have here the Minister's statements and perhaps it would be as well for me to make comments upon them. I think that, from the point of view of asserting the Irish position, they were much too delicately phrased.  I have to admit that I do not think the British Government have come as far to meet us as they should.  I think this was an excellent occasion on which to try to take hold of and deal with this question of Partition.  When they realised what our attitude would have to be, as we pointed out from the beginning, they should have tried to tackle this problem in a fundamental way&mdash;the only way in which it can be tackled successfully.  There is an old proverb that things are never settled until they are settled right.  I admit that the British Government have serious problems on their hands and I admit that they are only acting in the way in which most other Governments would act, in shelving a difficult question, but there is no use in our giving them the idea that we are satisfied with their leaving this fundamental matter unsettled.  Certainly, when they encroach upon our sovereignty, we ought to protest in the strongest possible manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement introducing this is not so very long and the House perhaps will bear with me if I make my comments upon it as I read it.  The Minister says, to start with, that there has been an improvement in the mutual feelings between our two countries.  I hope that that is true. Certainly, any advance will probably be helpful, but, so long as the fundamental source of quarrel remains&mdash;and, so far as we are concerned, we have a just reason to resent the present position, we being the aggrieved party&mdash; it would be quite wrong to suggest that any great progress has been made. We faced a critical situation during the recent war and I have no doubt whatever that, if this new critical situation should develop, we will have the same conditions exactly as <Col N="959" /> obtained then.  We will have approaches and suggestions made to us that, if we take certain lines of action, our doing so will lead to the ending of Partition.  If any Government in this country is wise, it will make one answer to all such suggestions, and it is, that we have been fooled before and we are not going to be fooled again.</P>
    <P>A large number of our people went out during the 1914-1918 War to fight, as they thought, to secure the rights of small nations.  When the war was won, those of our people who survived &mdash;many thousands had died&mdash;found that what their nation had to face was the Black and Tans, and when those who had suggested that Irishmen should go out and fight in that war tried to get the promises which had been made to them redeemed, they were told: &ldquo;Ulster must not be coerced&rdquo;.  That is a very easy excuse which will be used at any time, and I should like to put it on record that any Government in Ireland which accepts such a promise is going to be fooled, and that the proper attitude for any Irish Government, in circumstances of that sort, is to say: &ldquo;We have been fooled before and we are not going to be fooled again&rdquo;.  If there is to be any question of the unity of our country playing a compelling part in determining vital national decisions, the proper thing to do is to have the matter of the unity of our territory settled first.  Let the unity of this country be brought about and then leave it to the Irish nation, to its proper representatives, properly elected in a democratic way, to decide any national issues which have to be decided; but if there is any Irish Government foolish enough to be led into a particular line of conduct involving sacrifice by our people on the basis that it is going to serve the nation, to the extent of bringing about later the ending of Partition, I say that that Government is going to find itself fooled and the nation fooled. The excuse for the evasion of any promise given is too ready to hand. Ulster must not be coerced.  If there is to be any question of any such <Col N="960" /> promise affecting the national decision, the proper attitude is to say: &ldquo;Let us have a united nation, restore to the nation the part of the territory that is taken from it&rdquo;.  Let that united nation then, through its proper representatives, decide, as being the proper body to decide, what the national action should be.</P>
    <P>Only in a modified way then is it true to say that the feelings between the two countries have been improved.</P>
    <P>Continuing the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not least in helping to promote the better understanding have been the steps taken by the British Government to remove some startling conflicts of nationality law between our two countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have told you the extent to which that has been done.  To the extent to which it has been done, I add my welcome and my pleasure to that of the Minister.  The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under British law, as it had existed hitherto, Irish citizens were regarded as British subjects, whereas, of course, the position under Irish law was guided by our Constitution and our own Nationality Act.  A very serious effort to meet our viewpoint was made by Mr. Attlee's Government....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will say that that was a very generous tribute, more generous than, I am afraid, I would be inclined to give.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;and embodied in the British Bill which has just passed the British House of Commons.  Some of the provisions of the Bill as passed by the Commons still fall considerably short of our viewpoint; such, for instance, as the imposition of a non-Irish status on our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can say is that that phrase is extremely moderate: &ldquo;non-Irish status on our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties&rdquo;; &ldquo;still fall considerably short&rdquo;.  I think the whole of this suffers from understatement.  In a <Col N="961" /> matter of this sort we ought to state it without exaggeration and we ought to state it fully and we ought to make known to the British people, to the British Parliament, to the British Government, to everybody concerned, our deepest feelings in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and the clauses dealing with the retention of British nationality. However, the provisions of the Bill, as adopted by the Commons, constitute a vast improvement on the position that has hitherto existed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite willing to admit that it is an improvement, that it is an improvement to the extent that the arrogant claim of still, despite our law, regarding our people as British subjects has been eliminated.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is outrageous&mdash;in my opinion, of course&mdash;that, by unilateral action, the British Parliament should purport to deal with our citizens in Britain in a way that they would not deal with the citizens generally of a sovereign State.  I have said it is the unilateral action on their part that constitutes one of the most grievous evils of this proceeding where they assume that they can do this unilaterally. I think, as I have said, it is contrary to accepted international principles, principles which are not often as well defined as they have been by a judgment in the case of the Permanent Court of International Justice.  Consequently, we ought to protest against it and, if there is to be special relations, then any such should be settled by way of a convention between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I think I should not detain the House any longer on this.  The principal matters that come for discussion at this particular time have been dealt with. I have said that I assure the Minister that he will always find, as far as we are concerned in this House, sympathetic understanding of his difficulties. In our criticism we will always try to see that it is helpful criticism, criticism that is meant to strengthen the national position and not to weaken it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the war dangers, I would like to repeat, and once more <Col N="962" /> impress upon the Government, that they ought to take time by the forelock, that there is nobody, as far as I know of any understanding or experience in any part of the world who has not come more or less to the conclusion that with the present outlook war is inevitable within a short time.  When I say a short time I mean a period of a few years.  That it may come sooner is an added reason why we should make provision.  We should not imagine for one moment that the world has come into a peaceful situation.  I do not think that the realisation of that will help to bring the dangers anyway nearer and any steps that we take, even though they may impose a certain burden upon us, ought to be taken, the burden being borne as if it were an insurance.</P>
    <P>When shortages and difficulties arose during the last war, the preceding Government were often blamed very severely for not having looked ahead and for not having made the provision that could have been made if one had envisaged war for a certainty.  Little will be lost, it seems to me, if you do that.  Not a terrible lot will be lost in that way but the nation may be lost if you do not do it.  I do not see any evidence in the actions of the Government as a whole that they realise that situation and I do hope that the Minister for External Affairs, who by his contacts will be able to get the feeling much better than his colleagues, will be able to impress upon them the necessity for making provision in time, provision not merely in a material way, but provision also in the spiritual and intellectual way.</P>
    <P>Very big decisions may have to be made by this country.  Public opinion has to be informed.  Our people will have to realise what the things at issue are and what the dangers may be. Everyone of them will have to balance from the national point of view, the interests of this nation and the various pros and cons for any course that may be suggested.  I have lived through times of crisis of various kinds and I do not know that any time was so dangerous from the point of view of this nation as the present crisis.  A divided country with, possibly, divided <Col N="963" /> opinions about issues involved, will create tremendous difficulties here for any Government.  We ought to try to clear the ground as best we can so that the difficulties that lie ahead may become fewer.  One of these fundamental difficulties is the one of Partition and every effort ought to be made, in view of this crisis, both through diplomatic channels privately and through public channels to try to remove that fundamental difficulty out of our path. It is a difficulty which obviously will create internal difficulties and, of course, any internal difficulties will be exploited by any outside power; so it is essential for the well-being of this country that every effort that can be made to end Partition should be made now.</P>
    <P>The Government ought not, as some members seem to, show any irritation at efforts being made by anybody to try to bring public opinion to bear on this question.  I see no reason why the Government should have any objection to any Irish citizen doing everything in his power to expose the facts and make them clear.  It is quite wrong to play petty politics on a matter of this sort.  I hope the Government will take steps, if they want to get proper cooperation, as they should get, from all Irish citizens on Partition, to see that there will be an end to these petty suggestions that Irish citizens should not speak about this question.  There is nothing that affects every citizen so much.  In fact, one of the troubles has been that, knowing that everybody in this part of Ireland was against Partition, we have had no demonstrations here in this part of the country against it; and some people abroad think that, because we are not demonstrating here and doing the things that we did formerly when we were striving to get Irish independence, we were complacent about Partition.  That was a wrong view, but what can you do to meet it, if people get this idea abroad? You may have to show these people, and I have asked every Irish citizen who has friends abroad with whom he is corresponding, to use that correspondence to tell these people that we in Ireland regard the Partition of our <Col N="964" /> country as a grievous wrong to our nation and that we are not going to be satisfied until that wrong is undone. Why should any member of the Government find fault with me or anybody else, if we use whatever means should be at our disposal to try to spread the knowledge of the facts of Partition? Why say it is nationally wrong to do anything of that kind?</P>
    <P>Why should it be suggested that it is only now that I have been active about Partition?  Both publicly and diplomatically, as the Minister can assure himself, I have done everything in my power to try to get a move on with regard to this particular thing.  Whenever I had a medium in which it was possible to voice this matter, I have used that medium.  If I differed from Deputy Esmonde, it was not because I did not want to do it but because I did not think it was going to be effective for the particular time and place. If the Deputy reads the whole context he will see that it was a most difficult situation.  One of the difficulties of Partition is that it imposes upon the Irish Government the most odious of tasks.  It means that, in order to keep discipline and order here in this part of the country, we must deal very severely with anybody who unlawfully tries to disrupt the national unity and purpose in a difficult situation.  It was in a Bill dealing with that that the Deputy made the suggestion.  I want to use every means that can be made effective.  There may be a difference between us as to the particular means. That is a legitimate point on which to differ, but the desirability of ending it is the common desire of everyone.  In this critical situation facing us, it is the most urgent of all our problems and wherever the Minister meets Ministers of other countries interested in getting unity of action amongst the different States and pressing for it, unity of action and unity of thought, he should point out that there is no use in talking about bringing unity between nations which have been distinct and separate for centuries and at the same time persisting in dividing up the national unity of this territory which we had for thousands of years.</P>
    <P>We, on this side, shall co-operate to <Col N="965" /> the fullest We reserve our right of criticism and I hope the Minister will understand my criticism on his action. I can understand the view that it is better to welcome an advance under any circumstances.  On the other hand, lest our whole national attitude be misunderstood, we in this House must make our position abundantly clear. There must be no suggestion that that measure as a whole has Irish consent. The British Parliament has the power to pass it if it wants to, but it violates some of the fundamental rights of our nation, doing something which is not new, except in so far as it is a reaffirmation at this stage of an old wrong attitude.  They are affirming a position to which we objected.  In anything we do as an Opposition, our desire is to work for the interests of this nation.  We believe we have a duty in this matter, just as the Minister and the Government has, and we are seeking to discharge our obligations as best we can.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in this particular case there does not seem to be that violent change of direction of policy which took place in other Departments.  My criticism of the Minister is not to be taken in that way.  I am simply reaffirming at this stage what I believe I would have done if I were on the other side of the House.  Different people will tackle the same situation in different ways.  One person will think that by understatement he is strengthening his case.  My belief is that in this case the circumstances demand, not an understatement but a complete and full statement, in order that the national feeling and the national position may be thoroughly understood on the other side.  It is far better that they should understand us now than that difficulties should arise later.  It would not be right for them to think that we agree that our citizens in Britain or in British territories or, as provided in the Merchant Shipping Acts, should be dealt with exactly as if they were British subjects and with the obligations of such subjects.  We think that is wrong, that it is an invasion of our rights.</P>
    <P>I put down this Motion so that the Chair would give the necessary permission <Col N="966" /> to deal broadly with these matters which I felt it necessary to raise.  I have no intention of pressing it to a vote and the motion is simply put down to meet the rules of order of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only natural that in a debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs the question of Partition should play a prominent part.  If it did not do so, there would be something lacking in the character of this House.  We are all glad to appreciate and realise now that the correct forum for the discussion of this vital matter is this House and the correct vehicle and instrument to carry the wishes of the Irish people and to lead the struggle for the abolition of Partition is in the hands of whatever Irish Government is in power at a particular time.  But there is a factor which I think each successive Government in turn has overlooked and it is an important factor in the solution of this problem.  It is the time factor. We lawyers have a principle which is known as the statute of limitations.  It is an old principle which grew out of the wisdom of judicial decisions in the past and was later on defined in legislation. Year by year the solution of the problem of Partition is becoming more difficult by reason of the statute of limitations which is being enlarged from year to year so long as this problem is not cleared up.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which also urges upon us the necessity of realising the importance of the time factor and that is that year by year on both sides of the Border you are creating a vast vested interest&mdash;it is growing from day to day&mdash;a vested interest that will not allow itself to be influenced by a proper national outlook.  I am sorry to have to say that.  I believe that there are on both sides of the Border a number of people whose interests are so vested that they will allow those interests to superimpose themselves upon what should be their proper national outlook, and that body of persons will expand from day to day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another important factor which we are inclined to overlook. We are sitting smugly here&mdash;I do not use the expression in any <Col N="967" /> offensive sense&mdash;in our national Parliament representing 26 of our counties. But let us recollect this.  The fight for Irish freedom since its inception, no matter what form it took, whether it was on the floor of the House of Commons or on the battlefield in Ireland, was a fight which our fellow-countrymen in the North took part in and that it is largely owing to their efforts in the past, together with our own, that we enjoy the freedom we have in this part of the country to-day. I do not think that it is right or fitting that this debate should pass without some reference being made to the debt that we owe to our fellow-countrymen across the Border who contributed to the freedom of this part of the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, very serious harm is being done to the country as a whole. I know that the arguments which I am advancing are arguments which have been advanced from time to time. They should, however, be emphasised in this Assembly of ours.  God intended, nature intended, that this country should not only be physically one but that it should be also nationally and economically one.  I do not believe you will ever move to a final solution of any of our problems or be able to get to real grips with any of our problems, social or economic&mdash;leaving out the national aspect either on this or the other side of the Border&mdash;until you can do so through the medium of the executive action of an Irish Government responsible to a Parliament for the whole of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a point in our approach to the solution of Partition that must never be forgotten.  In the year 1918, the then Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. Lloyd George, was faced with the problem&mdash;Deputy de Valera referred to the position of affairs between 1914 and 1918&mdash;of redeeming promises the British Government had made to this country and to the then representatives of this country, who included Deputy Alfred Byrne and myself. He was faced with the necessity of redeeming the promises to the Irishmen who went out and fought on the side of the Allies in the 1914 war. <Col N="968" /> There was no way which he could find of getting out of redeeming those promises except the invention of a particular myth.  Out of that grew the myth that Ireland could not have selfgovernment for the whole of its territory because Irishmen could not agree amongst themselves and because the problem was an Irish one.  Let us not get away from that fact.</P>
    <P>The idea that it was not an English-Irish problem was created by the then Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George. Ever since then the opponents of the unity of this country have always sought to make it clear by every action and every word that the reason why Ireland is not united is that the Irish are not able to agree amongst themselves. The sooner the public of England and of the world realise that you must get back to the position and the mentality that existed before 1918 in this matter the better for the solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House one instance of the clever propaganda that goes on against us in this regard. Immediately after the passing of the Constitution of 1938 the name Éire was applied to the entire 32 Counties.  It is the Irish name for Ireland, which is also mentioned in the Constitution as applying to the 32 Counties.  Previous to that, the Twenty-Six Counties had been known as the Irish Free State. The very next day and from then on in every English newspaper and in every public statement the word Éire was used constantly and consistently, the meaning assigned to it being that that is the name the Irish people have given in the English language to the Twenty-Six Counties and the object being to show that a distinct entity in the Twenty-Six Counties is recognised by us.</P>
    <P>As I have referred to the period of 1918, let us examine for a moment what the position was then in order to show the fallacy which was then invented that Irishmen could not agree amongst themselves.  I will take the Six Counties for example.  What was the position at the dissolution of the British House of Commons in December, 1918? We will all admit that, of the Six <Col N="969" /> Counties, Tyrone and Fermanagh have ever since, election after election, registered their desire to join us.  That leaves Down, Antrim, Armagh and Derry.  Of the cities represented then in the British House of Commons, Belfast had four members, one being the late Mr. Joseph Devlin, Nationalist. The City of Derry, the second city of these four counties, was represented by an Irish Nationalist.  South Derry was represented by a Home Ruler who always voted with the Irish Nationalists on that question.  South Armagh was represented by an Irish Nationalist.  South Down was represented by an Irish Nationalist and the Borough of Newry was represented by an Irish Nationalist.  The only county of those four counties and of those boroughs that could leave the House of Commons in December, 1918, and say that they could cast every vote in favour of Partition was the County of Antrim and in the case of Antrim there is a substantial Nationalist minority. That was the situation in 1918 when a clever and astute politician invented a theory that the enemies of the union of Ireland have acted upon ever since.</P>
    <P>I would say to those people in Northern Ireland that they are very foolish.  They have everything to gain by joining us.  To take an illustration again from 1918.  I recollect crossing on the steamer <i>Dún Aengus</i> to the Aran Islands in the summer of that year. In so far as there was any sizeable cargo on board, there was a large cargo of sacks of flour going there and on every one of these sacks was written &ldquo;Belfast Flour Mills&rdquo;.  The people in the Six Counties have everything to gain and nothing to lose, economically, by joining us.  It is only because the theory that Irishmen cannot agree amongst themselves was seized upon by certain political bosses in the North of Ireland that Ireland is not united at the present time.  What have they to fear here?  Since the inception of this State&mdash;continuously&mdash;there has been a judge reared in the Six Counties in either the High Court or the Supreme Court.  Since the inception of this State there has been a Minister of State from one of the Six Counties in the Government.  Is that not surely an <Col N="970" /> answer, and a positive answer, to anyone who might suggest that this country is not one for the people of the Six Counties because they would not get a fair show?  Perhaps it is only reasonable to expect that anyone who speaks with a certain amount of force and with conviction on a matter of this kind would have some tangible and sensible contribution to make in the way of suggesting a solution.  I have consistently and always advocated, although other persons have disagreed with me, the use of our wireless for propaganda purposes.  I still advocate it.  I will pass from that because I think it is so obvious that it does not require elaboration.  In a matter of this kind we should speak as a united people without any difference of opinion.  We should be able to present our unanswerable case on a plate, with the views of the entire 100 per cent. of the people of the Twenty-Six Counties behind us and the bulk of the opinion from the Six Counties.  What I suggest is that we should elevate this question of Partition to a proper plane and that we should keep it from being anything other than a national matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that it has not descended to a question of Party politics.  My suggestion is that we should formulate some form of committee or bring into being some sort of all-Party committee with, if you like, quasi-executive functions, whose only duty would be to watch and to guard our interests with regard to Partition; to disseminate propaganda, and to take every step from a national point of view on the road towards the abolition of Partition.  I say &ldquo;quasi-executive functions,&rdquo; but I might go even further and give it executive functions.  Let it be a committee somewhat analogous to the Foreign Affairs Committee in the United States.  In that way we could present our case as a united people on behalf of a united Parliament.  I believe that that would have a very good effect.  At the present moment I take it that propaganda on behalf of the abolition of Partition is the care of the Minister and the Department which we are now discussing.  A committee such as I have referred to would, however, be responsible for disseminating <Col N="971" /> propaganda&mdash;and when I use the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; I do not mean vilification. We have got a good case. Nobody who ever went to court had a better one and no advocate going into court with a good case is such a fool as to loose it by vilification.  We have all the trump cards and all we have to do is to get our case across to the jury of the public and we can do that in a dignified and in a reasoned fashion. That is the type of propaganda I would like whoever is responsible to indulge in.  Certain questions arise from time to time.  They arise in the British Nationality Bill which is now before the British Parliament.  There is another matter that seems to have passed the observation of everybody altogether.</P>
    <P>There is an inclination now&mdash;I think it is a definite drive&mdash;on the part of those who are interested in the maintenance of the Border to give to the Government of those Six Counties in the North a status greater than that of a Legislature subordinate to that of the Parliament in the United Kingdom. Two doors away from the Irish Tourist Office in London&mdash;in the very heart of the West End where almost every foreigner who visits London must pass and within a stone's-throw of Piccadilly Circus&mdash;there is an office which was officially opened with great <i>éclat</i> within the past two years.  A British Government representative was present at the opening.  That office calls itself, under a title which it has no right to assume, the &ldquo;Ulster Office&rdquo;.  There is no such State as Ulster.  The Government of the Six Counties not only had the effrontery to build their office two doors away from the Irish Tourist Office but, in addition, to put up the Arms of Ulster and to call itself the &ldquo;Ulster Office&rdquo;.  That is a matter that could be dealt with by such a committee and it is one that should be dealt with.  It is one of those things that would come under notice from time to time.  I am glad the Minister made it quite clear in his opening speech last night that the people of the North have nothing to fear from us.</P>
    <P>I am glad he made it quite clear that <Col N="972" /> we are willing to grant them any concessions which might be considered reasonable under the circumstances. They would only be concessions necessary from their point of view.  But I venture to think that if they accepted these proposals, there would come a time when, having lived amongst us and worked with us here as brother Irishmen, having demanded these concessions from us, they would come to us, or to whatever Government was in existence at the time, and they would say: &ldquo;We have had the experience now of working with you and we regard any concessions that we asked for at the time we joined you, which we asked to be enshrined either in the Constitution or in the laws of the country, as entirely unnecessary and a reflection upon us as real Irishmen&rdquo;. which some day we hope they will be.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is one which I approach with a certain amount of diffidence because I realise the necessity for care and circumspection in approaching questions of our foreign and external policy.  I think, however, that I may be permitted to put before the Minister and the House certain considerations which should govern the policy to be pursued by the Minister's Department.  Very naturally, the problem of Partition loomed large in the Minister's speech and in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and in the speech of Deputy Sir John Esmonde. I think that it would be a mistake for us to regard Partition merely as it exists to-day as being the cardinal factor for consideration.  I would prefer to approach the problem from the point of view that our external policy is conditioned by our history&mdash;a history of the invasion of one country by another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I realise the danger of over-simplification, I would prefer that the Minister and the House should consider this problem as the problem of an invading Power continuing to occupy six of our counties.  I think the House must agree with me that, while that condition of affairs exists, the remainder of our foreign policy and our external relations with Powers other than Britain must be conditioned by our recognition of that fact.  Deputy <Col N="973" /> Sir John Esmonde suggested the setting up of a Party committee on Partition with quasi-executive powers and functions.  I think that is something that the Minister might very well consider. Deputy de Valera dealt in an exhaustive way with the Minister's speech and adverted to certain criticisms that had been made of the anti-Partition propaganda conducted by himself and his colleague, Deputy Aiken.  As far as the Clann na Poblachta Party is concerned I would like to put our view on record that we welcome the propaganda given to Ireland's case and the case against Partition by Deputy de Valera and by Deputy Aiken just as we would welcome similar propaganda from any other influential Irishman.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera took the Minister to task, albeit perhaps rather tenderly, in respect of the Minister's remarks and approach to the Nationality Bill at present before the British Parliament. With some of those criticisms I might, perhaps, find myself in agreement were they to come from any Deputy other than the author of our Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1935 and our External Relations Act of 1938.  I would say to the Minister that I think it is a pity that in introducing this Estimate he did not give us some indication that the anomalous constitutional position which has existed since the passage of the External Relations Act would be speedily ended.  I do not want to appear to press the Minister unduly on that matter but I would suggest to him that the anomalous position in which we find ourselves to-day is due to an act of this House which gave powers and functions, however limited you may like to describe them, to a British King.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera was allowed to speak without interruption. I am endeavouring to obey the ruling of the Chair and to confine myself to matters under discussion upon this Estimate.  I appeal to the Minister to pursue a policy which will bring the evils of the occupation of six counties of our country by Britain before the rest of the world.  I ask him further to bear in mind that in the event of any repetition of the state of emergency that we knew here between 1939 and 1945, in the event of any major conflict, this country will not be committed in any way to the assistance, militarily or otherwise, of the Power which occupies six of our counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned certain proposals for a United States of Europe. He did not indicate whether he had formed any very definite views as to how such proposals should be approached by this country.  I suggest to the Minister that before giving consideration to any scheme whereby we would participate in a United States of Europe, these proposals should be subjected to the closest possible examination. I speak personally in this matter, perhaps, when I say such proposals should be approached with a good deal of suspicion.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to bear this in mind, that as regards the achievement of those good relations with the people of Britain and with all peoples, that we as Christians must desire, he should bear in mind that they can be permanently achieved only when Britain recognises the right of the people of this country to the possession of the 32 Counties and to the republican form of government for which the people of this country have expressed their preference.</P>

The position, of which Deputy Lehane should be well aware, is that in 1932 under the old Constitution in which the King was a definite organic part, passports were issued in <Col N="976" /> his name, but now our Constitution, starting with the enactment that makes the people of this country sovereign and without any provision for external sovereignty, settles our constitutional position here.  There is no doubt about our sovereign position here and, in accordance with that, passports since that time have been issued.  For the benefit of Deputy Lehane I will read one.</P>

On the front of it is &ldquo;Éire (Ireland).&rdquo;  Then there is the word &ldquo;Passport&rdquo; in Irish, English and French.  I will now read a translation of what is in Irish.  It comes to this: &ldquo;We, the Minister for External Affairs for Ireland, hereby request and require all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance and afford him every assistance and protection of which he may stand in need.&rdquo;  That is in French also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, having regard to the number of times that they have been repeated and refuted, these misrepresentations are deliberate.  The Deputy talks about the External Relations Act but there is nothing in that Act that affects the status of this nation as a sovereign people.  It is simply a matter of expediency.  Anyway, the Minister is competent to introduce <Col N="978" /> such legislation as he likes to change it.  It simply requires a simple Act to alter that situation.  If the Deputy wishes to alter that situation the Minister has the power to do so. There is no use in making a noise about it.  It merely requires a simple Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that is not necessary.  He can change it if he wishes without legislation.  It is a permissive Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is permissive. You have now a Clann na Poblachta Minister in power and let him deal with it.  When the Deputy comes along with this type of insinuation, he leaves himself open to the suspicion that he is not sincere in his protestations.</P>
      <P>To come back to the Estimate, the Minister in his opening speech made a number of references to our position in the world of to-day.  I, completely in the spirit in which the Minister asked us, realise that this is a Department that calls for tactful handling, but I should like him to expand a little more what he meant when he referred to isolationism as being no longer possible and when he referred to the surrenders of sovereignty that are necessarily associated with the establishment of any so-called United States of Europe.  These things are of very great moment to the people, and it might perhaps be well if the Minister could be a little more definite as regards our policy for the future in case of difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw one aspect of the situation to the Minister's attention. Before the last conflict broke, it was very difficult for us to secure certain equipment that we needed to maintain the position of neutrality which we had adopted and to weather the storm of the war.  The Minister's Department is one which has a number of contacts and the only suggestion I would make is that, having regard to the unsettled state of Europe at the moment, the Department should be alive to the necessity of exploring the possibility of securing such commodities and stocks of equipment as we might require in the case of another emergency.  I think it is not too early to consider such a matter and although <Col N="979" /> this would probably be more to the point on the Estimates for the Ministers for Defence and Industry and Commerce, still the Department of External Affairs has certain contacts and certain functions with regard to what is available in other countries and it should interest itself in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  Prior to the last war there was a certain lack of day-to-day information in other Departments of State that presumably was available, or could be made available to the Department of External Affairs.  The previous situation was that there was not sufficient contact between the Departments and it was not realised how important it was that there should be.  I should like to suggest to the Minister the necessity, for instance, of keeping the Department of Defence accurately posted in details.  The main things are always passed on.  Information available to the Minister himself, when he considers it of sufficient importance, will undoubtedly be exchanged at meetings of the Cabinet but I am thinking rather of a lot of details which might be overlooked by him but which, taken in conjunction with other facts, might be rather significant.  Even details which taken from the Minister's point of view might not be very significant, might acquire much greater significance when looked at by the appropriate officer in either the Department of Defence or the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In speaking of this matter I have really in mind a recommendation of the general staff a good many years ago on the importance of keeping the Army authorities posted on the details of information which come into the hands of the Department of External Affairs.  It greatly assists them in the tasks which they have to perform.  The same thing might apply in the case of other Departments as well.</P>
    <P>As the time for this debate is limited, I shall confine myself to these observations although there are other matters to which I should like to refer.  If things become more acute, the people of the country are interested in knowing positively where we stand in regard <Col N="980" /> to our associations and relations with outside nations and what are likely to be the problems with which we shall be faced.  I think early information on that matter given by the Minister would be desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to congratulate the Minister on his statesmanlike, lucid and realistic approach to our external relations.  The Minister has appealed for the co-operation of all Parties in regard to external policy.  He has suggested that this nation in regard to other nations should speak as one man.  I have no doubt that possibly the Leader of the Opposition Party would endorse that view, if he were the one man.  I think there is a great deal to be said for having a foreign relations committee to discuss extenal questions, a committee representative of all Parties. The suggestion has been made by two Deputies that there should be an anti-Partition all-Party committee.  I think it would be better to go further and have an external relations committee of all Parties which would take cognisance, not only of the Partition question but of all other cognate issues affecting our external relations.  While Partition is the big issue, I think it is essential that we should not lose sight of the other aspects of external policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, perhaps, as the Leader of the Opposition Party said, that we cannot take part in any world-wide campaign for peace while this country suffers under the wrong of Partition but, in the line of thought which Deputy de Valera adopted, there is a danger that in our competition, first of all amongst ourselves, to show how ardent we are for the abolition of Partition, in perhaps our natural desire to advance the cause of national unity and the world-wide propaganda for that cause, we might find ourselves pushed into the position of being lined up, not in agreement with, but in opposition to, the freedom-loving nations of Western Europe.  We have had the experience in our external relations during the past 25 years that it was our world-wide publicity campaign for the independence of our country, particularly as pursued in the United States, that contributed in a very large <Col N="981" /> measure to the breaking up of the League of Nations and to co-operation between the United States and Europe.  That in a way contributed to the position which led to the recent World War.  Because we realise all those dangers and realise what a powder magazine the world is at the present time, I think we should view all aspects of our external affairs and take our decisions prudently and wisely.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that the most difficult international questions, and particularly questions which involve an injustice on one nation by another, can always be settled, provided there is a fair measure of good will and understanding on both sides. That is why I want to suggest that, having first of all shown our sense of responsibility by setting up a national all-Party world affairs council, we should next proceed to initiate direct negotiations between this country and Great Britain.  In recent months we have effected a very comprehensive trade agreement with Great Britain, a trade agreement which may have and which, I believe, will have very good results as far as trade between Great Britain and Ireland is concerned.  There is not any reason why our Ministers should not sit down with the Ministers of the British Government and point out to them the dangers of the present position in regard to Partition, the dangers which are involved in that position not only for this country but even more for Great Britain and I would say, also, to the cause of unity between those nations which are opposed to aggression and opposed to world domination by the forces of Communism.  I think that if the Minister would turn his mind to the desirability of having direct negotiations with British Ministers on this question useful results might flow therefrom.</P>
    <P>We are, undoubtedly, a small nation but, as I have pointed out, we have in the past contributed in a very large measure to the shaping of world events, and it is possible that we can contribute quite a great deal to the preservation of world peace in the <Col N="982" /> years that lie immediately ahead. Every cause of dissension between the nations of Western Europe may aggravate the dangers of the present European situation and may assist towards promoting another world conflict. Therefore, the removal of these causes of disunity and dissension between Great Britain and Ireland is now a matter of great urgency, and the urgency of that problem should be brought home very forcibly to the Ministers of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly in his opening statement to the possibility and desirability of a United States of Europe.  Sooner or later that organisation must come into being.  Some people in this country may be inclined to view such a development with suspicion, but we can always, however, use our intelligence and consider all aspects of the question.  The Minister very rightly pointed out that if a world war comes again&mdash;there have been two within the memory of most of us here&mdash; the main causes for it will be materialism, expediency and fear.  We may be inclined, for reasons of expediency or fear or even material advantage, to stand aloof from the other free nations, and by so doing may weaken the forces that stand for peace.  I think that the best way to prevent another war would be for those nations which do not believe in aggression to stand firmly together.  Anything that can be done to bring about that unity between free and democratic nations should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of misrepresentation carried on then.  I want to deal with one thing&mdash;the tourist industry.  The Minister for External Affairs at that time derided and decried the tourist industry in this country.  Now, of course, some of his colleagues in the Government come <Col N="983" /> along and praise it for being worth £35,000,000 to this country.  I hope the Minister has changed his mind on that, and that, as Minister for External Affairs, he will encourage that industry since we all know how essential it is for bringing about a balance in trade. The success of the tourist industry will depend to a great extent on the good work of our diplomats in foreign countries.  I hope the Minister will do his best to see that that industry will improve now and for the future.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of external affairs that I am very anxious about and take a deep interest in.  I take this opportunity of congratulating the previous Minister on the way he, during his time of office, under very adverse conditions, improved the position of our trade relations with other countries.  I think that our trade representatives abroad should have the opportunity of seeing what we have to sell so as to build up our export trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Our trade relations, like the tourist industry, are very important to our country's economy and I am sure that the Minister for External Affairs will see as far as possible that the very best trade representatives are sent to these countries with a view to exchanging trade and exporting some of our manufactured goods and the things that they have not got in other countries.  I believe that the Department of External Affairs could play an important part in building up our trade abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that our short-wave broadcasting station has been put in abeyance, I believe that our representatives should try in the meantime to encourage our cultural influence abroad. I wish to pay a compliment to our representative in England.  Friends of mine have spoken highly of him and the good work he has done for Irish culture, Irish enterprise and Irish artists and others in England.  That was encouraged by the previous Minister for External Affairs who realised <Col N="984" /> its value to our nation and who was anxious to put our country on the map with the other civilised countries of the world, and he was responsible for bringing great credit to our country. I hope that the present Minister for External Affairs will also encourage that aspect of Irish cultural organisation.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with our diplomatic representatives, I would like to see a representative sent to India, because I feel that that country and our country had a good deal in common during their struggle for national independence. I was more than delighted and very happy to see the reception given in India to the previous Taoiseach, who has a place in Irish history that no man can take from him.  I know that it costs money and that the expense of sending representatives to other countries would be a drag on the resources of the country, but it is very essential, and I would not like to see the adoption of the shortsighted policy spoken of by some Deputies here last night of begging the crumbs from our neighbouring nations' tables.  Many projects have been put in abeyance, which is not a proper thing for a young country like ours.  After years of trying to give our country the same status as other free countries throughout the world, we should avail of every opportunity possible to develop our national prestige.</P>
    <P>There are many of our nationals in other countries and I have heard a reference in the debate to the possibility of appointing honorary consuls or honorary representatives abroad. That would be a very commendable thing, as there is hardly a country in the world where there are not some of our nationals.</P>
    <P>The subject of Partition has been dealt with and the Minister will have the co-operation of the whole House in trying to right that wrong that has been perpetrated on our country.  The previous Taoiseach should be complimented by the people of the country on his tour throughout the world and not be referred to, as he was by some of his opponents, in a disrespectful manner.  He is an Irishman who has done wonderful work throughout the <Col N="985" /> world to show up the wrongs perpetrated on the country over the centuries and which people are trying to make permanent now.  We should all be united on that national issue.</P>

      <P>This matter of external affairs and the problems that affect us, both nationally and internationally, are, I think, probably the most important matters to come for discussion and decision in the Dáil at the present time.  By arrangement between the Parties, a period of six and a half hours has been allocated for the discussion on this Estimate.  One should imagine that within two hours of our assembly here this morning it should not have been necessary to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that less than a quorum of Deputies was present.  Almost every Deputy will talk in every place of the importance of external affairs and Partition, but, when the matter is under consideration here, it does not receive the attention from Deputies that it should.  That is disappointing.  If we are going to treat this House in the way in which it is being treated, we are going to bring this Parliament into disrepute.</P>

      <P>The big problem that confronts us seems to be our constitutional position.  What is our constitutional position?  Many people do not seem to have a clear appreciation of what our constitutional position is at the moment.  Are we a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations or are we, as has been stated, an independent republic?  If we can be clear on that, there should be no difficulty about discussing this matter in a sensible and intelligent way, but the trouble is that we say amongst ourselves <Col N="986" /> that we are a republic, whereas we act as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  That has been perfectly clear from the speech made by the Minister introducing his Estimate and it was perfectly clear from the contribution made by Deputy Eamon de Valera.</P>

Our approach to the British Nationality Bill would be very different from the approach of the Minister.  It would be very different from the approach of Deputy de Valera because this British Nationality Bill, that would attempt to make British citizens of Irish citizens, would be a hostile act as far as this country is concerned and, if it is a hostile act, it should not have been approached by the Government of this country in the way the Minister states he has approached it.</P>

I do not want to be led into any discussion between the Minister and Deputy de Valera on that point.  I want to steer clear of that particular trouble but, if we are an independent republic, the British Nationality Bill is a hostile act as far as we in this country are concerned and it should be approached on that basis.  That is why I said at the beginning that our present constitutional position is the difficulty that arises.  My own personal point of view, looking at the matter as fairly as I can, is that, constitutionally, we are a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

I want to remove these blinkers and to look facts in the face. The fact cannot be denied that when foreign representatives come to this <Col N="991" /> country, they come accredited to the British King.  They are met here by the Minister for External Affairs, representing the British King.</P>

      <P>I have never in my life spoken one word in the opposite direction.  Is that a sign of our independent sovereignty that a foreign representative should come here accredited to the King of a nation with whom we are not associated?  Unless we face facts, we will not solve the problems, and the fact is that we cannot be and are not an independent republic at the moment and it is the duty of this House, and the duty of this country, to take such steps as are necessary to achieve that independence and to establish a republic here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, unfortunately, the position, that we still have a distance to go.  I freely admit that, during the last 16 years and under the Administration of Deputy de Valera, we did make considerable strides towards the achievement of that goal but we would only be fooling ourselves if we were to say now that we have reached <Col N="992" /> it, when in fact we have not reached it. There are more ditches to be crossed. We have yet to achieve the ultimate, the final independence of this country and we have yet to set up our republic.</P>
      <P>It is only right in the debate on external affairs, that we in this House should make it perfectly clear that we do intend to take the steps that will establish this country as an independent republic, whatever those steps may be, and whatever sacrifices may be necessary in the process.  That is my view, expressed deliberately and honestly.  While that is so, our approach to this problem of Partition may be somewhat difficult.  For 25 years I have heard discussions on Partition and I would say that probably the most effective step that might have been taken to solve Partition was taken by Deputy Aiken 25 or more years ago. I have heard predecessors of the present Minister speaking in exactly the same way as the Minister has spoken about the dangers to the friendship between Ireland and England unless the Border was removed and Partition was ended.  When the Minister spoke last night; he said nothing new on this problem; he said nothing that has not been said by Deputy de Valera before him; he said nothing that has not been said by Ministers of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera says that the Minister may have understated the problem.  That is a matter of approach but this approach to the problem, whether it comes from the Minister, from Deputy de Valera or Deputy McGilligan, who was, I think, his predecessor, accepts the situation that Partition has been established there by the British Government and that apparently it can only be solved when people on both sides of the Border get sensible and when the British remove whatever influences they have in the Six Counties.  But we have had 25 years of that.  Will the Minister or Deputy de Valera say that we are going to make any appreciable advance in the next 25 years?  Will the Minister or Deputy de Valera say that we are going to make any appreciable advance in the next 50 years?  It is all very well to talk about the evils of Partition.  We <Col N="993" /> are all aware of those evils.  With every word the Minister has said, with every word Deputy de Valera has said, here and elsewhere, every Deputy agrees; but we have had 25 years of talking and 25 years of talking have not brought us nearer a solution of the problem.  I say deliberately that another method of solving this problem must be taken, and must be taken quickly.  If we are to have regard to the sacrifices that have been made in this country over many years, many generations, many centuries, to achieve the ultimate ideals of freedom, we ought to be taking the practical steps that would bring about the ending of the evil of Partition.</P>
    <P>If we go back prior to 1916, every speaker in Irish politics, every member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, every patriot in that period from Parnell down, spoke about the dangers to friendship between Ireland and England unless they gave us our freedom&mdash;and after 40 or more years of that talk, it took other methods to achieve something.  I have respect for those other methods and I do say in this House that it is only by those other methods that we are going to achieve the unity of this country in our time.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister refer to the international situation and say very specifically that our sympathies in a coming crisis were clearly with the Western States of Europe. That can mean only one thing&mdash;that we are making it clear to those Western States that we will be on their side in the event of a crisis.  It is ráiméis to talk in that way, when we have in this country a Defence Force much less than five or six battalions strong.  We indicate that in a war situation, our sympathies&mdash;in other words, if the Minister likes to push it that far, our active support&mdash;will be with one set of belligerents, and we have not enough troops to-day to defend, or even protect, the Shannon airport.  We ought to be realistic.  If we are going to take that line of identifying ourselves with one set of belligerents in a coming war, let us prepare to take our place there.  You cannot talk in <Col N="994" /> that way with your tongue in your cheek, or when you have wiped out the Defence Force.</P>

      <P>Lest the Deputy's remarks might lead to misunderstanding as to what I did say, I think I should repeat, for the benefit of the Deputy, what I said in relation to that matter:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We here are not much troubled by conflicting ideologies.  We are firm believers in democracy in its true sense and are firmly attached to the principles of Christianity.  Our sympathies, therefore, lie clearly with Western Europe.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Our sympathies are clearly with the Western States of Europe&rdquo;&mdash;that is what the Minister said, and what the Minister wanted to be assumed from that was that, in any coming conflict, we could be trusted to play our rôle on one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of the Minister for External Affairs in this present world situation was a statement that should be considered with the greatest care.  Every word should be weighed and nothing should be said that might give a wrong impression. If a wrong impression has been given by those words, it is regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Man has a higher rôle to play than to be a cog in a fly wheel.  I will not trust myself to comment on that, as it would be outside the scope of the debate.  In the last tragic war, when Europe was overshadowed by a terrible menace, when Nazism and Fascism were rampant on the Continent, this country took the line of neutrality, for several reasons. One of the main reasons was that while an injustice was being done to our country by Great Britain we could not take the side of Great Britain in that war for freedom.  If we were to approach a war to-morrow, I agree with Deputy Lehane&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting <Col N="995" /> him&mdash;that while that injustice is still being done to our country no Government, no Administration or no Minister should lead this country into war on the side of Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with those who say that there is a danger of immediate and terrible war.  There is a situation that could readily result in war, but it seems clear to me that those great nations at the moment are playing a game, that none of them wants to fight a war or is prepared at the moment to fight a war.  I am satisfied that there will be no war in the immediate future.  If we go back to the years after 1918, to the 1920s, and look at the files of the world's newspapers for that period they would be an eye-opener.  Every day during these years you saw a crisis here, a crisis there&mdash;Germany, Russia and Italy&mdash;and assassinations.  I find that it is a very useful thing to take up these newspaper files and compare those crises at that time with the crises of to-day.  The war did not come until many years afterwards, until a great country had committed its destiny into the hands of a madman.  In conclusion, I may say that I welcome the suggestion of the Minister for External Affairs that there should be a committee on foreign affairs in this House.</P>

      <P>I think it would be for the good of this Parliament and this country if a number of Deputies were to specialise in the study of matters affecting our external affairs.

If the formation of that committee resulted in more Deputies and more citizens generally taking an active interest in our external affairs and relationships, then it would be a good thing.

      <P>If you rule, I must.  I withdraw it.  The Minister, in opening up this debate, made an appeal for co-operation and unity in regard to our external relations.  He delivered a very good homily on the whole matter and if he were sincere in asking for co-operation I would very heartily welcome and agree to the meeting of his appeal.  However, when the Minister allows his colleagues to misrepresent the external affairs position he cannot get the co-operation that should exist between all Parties in this State on questions of our external affairs.  I leave that particular aspect of the External Relations Act&mdash;I have already made the position clear in that regard. The Minister and his colleagues in the Clann na Poblachta Party may misrepresent it as energetically up and down the country as they did with regard to our position in relation to the British Commonwealth.  Some day or another, however, they will have to admit, as the Minister for External Affairs admitted here to-day, that they were wrong in relation to this particular matter as they were wrong in relation to our membership of the British Commonwealth.  Of course, Deputy C. Lehane is afraid to admit to his followers throughout the country &mdash;if there are any left, as I am reminded&mdash;that Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, is in control not only of our agricultural policy but also of our external affairs policy.</P>

      <P>The Minister for External Affairs has handed the reins of government that he got from the people to the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister for External Affairs got sufficient votes to enable him to control the present Government if he was prepared to use his power.  Instead of that he has given the reins of government to Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, and he has given them unfortunately even in relation to our external affairs.  It would be very interesting if the Minister for External Affairs would state what he thinks of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the dangerous international situation which he outlined in his opening speech last evening.  If we are facing war a few years hence, or if there is an immediate danger, why on earth should we now reverse the agricultural and economic policy that enabled us to take our own decision in the past war and to stick to it right through in spite of all the pressure that was brought to bear upon us in order to make us change our minds. If we are to decide our own policy in time of war we require very much more than a constitutional right to do so&mdash;a constitutional right recognised internationally. We require the economic strength to support that political or constitutional decision.  The Minister for Agriculture is at the moment going round the country telling the people that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One Minister of this Government has told us that there will be no war.  On the other hand, the Minister for External Affairs rightly took up some time in outlining to the House the dangerous international situation that exists to-day.  We know that this gentleman who made the declaration about no war said in 1938 also that there was going to be no war then.  I hope he is nearer the truth to-day than he was in 1938, because none of us wants to see another holocaust. I do not think anybody is so mad as to think that any good is going to come out of another holocaust either <Col N="1002" /> for this or for any other country in western Europe.  We hope that a rule of international law will be agreed upon and put into force without having to use the awful weapons of destruction that are available to mighty belligerents at the present time.  However, suppose it happens that our will is not to rule in that regard and that a war does break out.  It is of the utmost importance, first of all, that we should agree here about our constitutional situation and that nobody is going to make treasonable remarks about our present constitutional position. Secondly, being clear on the constitutional position of this country and on our constitutional right to make any decision we may wish to make that would seem to the benefit of Irish interests in regard to that war, we should have the economic strength built up to enable us to support such a decision.</P>

They want time in which to get teachers so that the young people in the future will not be disqualified in open competition.  I want a united Ireland.  I stand to-day for a united Ireland as I have always done. In 1917 the British Government sent representatives to the Irish Party and they offered us 28 counties.  I voted against the acceptance of 28 counties then.  Nobody could ever accuse me of being anti-Irish or non-national.  For 30 years we have been working with 26 counties.  I make the suggestion as to whether it is not possible that we could get these Northern counties to come in with good will and by proving to them that no injustice will be done in them.  Can we tell them that they will have the same social services and the same old age pensions if they come in with us; can we tell them that we shall try to level up our social services to theirs rather than bring them down to our level?</P>

When Deputy de Valera was in power did he ever consider the possibility of appointing a representative in Northern Ireland and equally a representative of Northern Ireland here.  I think that might have gone some way towards solving our problem.  These representatives could have discussed the points upon which Deputy de Valera is now so irritable.

It is only by goodwill and good Government that we will get these two people together, the people on our side of the <Col N="1007" /> Border and the people on the Northern side.</P>
      <P>I hope the present Government will do something to induce the coming together of these peoples&mdash;at least to discuss the matter with them and ask them what objection could they have to coming into a united Irish Parliament. We could tell them &ldquo;We will give you all the guarantees you ask for.&rdquo;  We can assure them that every guarantee it is possible to get we at this end will be prepared to give.  We are prepared to go a very long way in order to get the people on both sides of the Border to work together in a united Irish Parliament.  I suggest the Minister should do something along those lines.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate him for the statement he made here last night.  I was encouraged by that statement, that it is his intention sooner or later to get the two peoples together.  Please God, in his time Partition will be removed without any threats to the people of the North.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that Deputy Byrne addressed his remarks to Deputy de Valera in connection with this matter because, in my view, and in the view of Irish people at home and abroad, the solution of this problem of Partition rests in the hands of Deputy de Valera.  I am not in the least reflecting on the ability of the present Minister for External Affairs when I say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather disappointed, as one closely associated with the Border and the demoralising effects accruing from it to the people on both sides, not to hear from the Minister some definite plan for the solution of this problem. I was expecting something of that nature, considering that the Minister blazed his way into this House mainly through his attitude and his statements about Partition and judging by the softening-up barrage in the form of telegrams from one of the candidates in my constituency prior to the recent election.  The time for an active national policy in relation to Partition is long overdue.  Every Party in this House has declared its support of our <Col N="1008" /> people's demand for national unity and independence.  It is time we combined to put that demand into practical effect, into a definite active policy&mdash; that is, if we are really sincere and earnest in what we say.  Our friends at home and abroad are asking for some definite sign of our national determination.</P>
    <P>Knowing the evils of Partition at close range, I say we should be ashamed that the advocates of unity in the partitioned Six Counties are forced to organise down here in free Ireland an anti-Partition league in order to bring us to a realisation of our national duty.  This Government, I may say, entered on a course in regard to Partition which had been carefully watched and probed by the Fianna Fáil Government for 16 years.  In my view everything had been made ready by them as a springboard for future action.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening remarks mentioned the possibility of establishing a council of all Parties on external affairs.  I would have preferred if he had suggested a council of Deputies of this House to deal exclusively with Partition because, unless concerted action is taken, we are going to have nothing more than talk, as has been happening for so long.  There is one thing we must do, and that is to make up our minds to cease confusing the national issue by a manifold policy concerning Partition, and this is particularly in danger of happening owing to the number of Parties comprising the present Government.</P>
    <P>There should be one clear policy, one clear and definite demand that the coalition Government, with all Parties, north and south, should make because it is fundamental to all progress on this issue.  That is, compelling the British Government to clear out its entire military occupation forces and cease at once spending Marshall aid dollars in the continuous imposition of a Parliament against the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people.  Let us anchor on this demand and cease the impracticable and senseless proposals put forward recently by puerile politicians.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Byrne reminded me, a <Col N="1009" /> Minister of the British Government recently said, when queried about Partition: &ldquo;I would prefer if you would settle that among yourselves.&rdquo;  Until England has cleared out bag and baggage, we down here can make no approach to our Protestant friends in the Six Counties.  As long as the English garrison and American dollars are available, they will cling to them no matter what the ultimate economic and social loss may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the religious aspect of Partition and I am sorry he should have suggested, should the opportunity ever arise or should the unity of the country take place, the provision of additional safeguards in the matter of religion, when the world knows&mdash;and no people better than our Protestant friends in the Six Counties &mdash;that in no country in the world is there such consideration and such provision made for non-Catholics as in this country.  For that reason the suggestion of safeguards was unfortunate in that it might give the impression that they were necessary.</P>
    <P>The religious aspect of Partition is merely a wedge driven by the British and Irish Ascendancy Parties between Catholics and Protestants in this country for no reason other than to perpetuate ascendancy rule to the grave disadvantage of both Catholics and Protestants.  Especially in face of the world-wide anti-Christian menace, the Christian religion should be above place, power and the spoils of office, but unfortunately there are politicians in the Six Counties who never hesitated to barter it on the political exchange. Before concluding, I should like to pay a tribute to the indomitable few in the Six Counties who for 25 years at a great personal sacrifice, including imprisonment, have kept the world informed of the injustice of Partition. I think they call for, and that they deserve, more consideration from us than they have got in the past. I think the House will agree with me when I say that it is about time the responsibilities and duties of so many ceased to be the burden of so few.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke began his speech by suggesting that the Minister was guilty of misrepresentations <Col N="1010" /> in this House.  Naturally the inference was that his speech was a misrepresentation. Fortunately Deputy Burke did not continue on these lines, but a hint of misrepresentation on the part of some members of the Clann na Poblachta Party was made by Deputy Aiken.  May I say that it is rather difficult to decide whether the proper attitude to adopt in treating allegations of that kind, coming from the Fianna Fáil Benches, is to treat them with contempt or to attempt repudiation of them.  Deputy Byrne raised a very simple question here when in talking of Partition he mentioned the difficulty which, he stated, was put to him by some friends in Northern Ireland.  Immediately three of the five Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House pounced on Deputy Byrne and began to make speeches in interjections. Deputy Byrne was accused of doing injury to the Irish langnage by putting his case.  Deputy de Valera announced quite clearly what his position was in regard to the culture and development of the Irish language.  We all know that and none of us yields to Deputy de Valera in the desire for the propagation of the Irish language but we do object, and very strongly object, to making the development of the language the racket it has been.</P>

      <P>The approach to the Partition question made by the Minister for External Affairs is something which is new.  His method of approach is quite different from that adopted by his predecessors and it is because of that approach that an extraordinary resurgence of advocacy for a solution of that problem has taken place.  In his tour throughout the United States and in Australia, Deputy de Valera contributed, as we should expect from him, his share in the propagation of the views of the Irish people in regard to that problem.  I am sure that nobody would fail to pay him adequate tribute for what he has done, but I do not think that he has done what he might have done when he was able to do it. I do not think that when he was in office he did as much as the present Minister for External Affairs has done <Col N="1011" /> within the last few months.  In the campaign to end Partition, all Irishmen are united in the desire to make our country one.  There is no doubt whatever in the minds of all who love their country on that score.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sir John Esmonde has stated, the basis on which that ideal can be achieved is by the re-establishment of the unity which prevailed in 1918 and which continued until 1921.  In order to strengthen the Minister's hands, it is necessary that he should be fortified by the cohesion of all our people.  In the re-establishment of that spirit which Deputy Sir John Esmonde desires, it is refreshing to know that it took 26 years to attempt to reestablish that spirit.  The formation of the inter-Party Government has been the first great step towards the re-establishment of that spirit and the reunion of our people.</P>

      <P>On the whole I should like to congratulate Deputies, with a couple of exceptions, on the tone adopted in the course of the debate on this Estimate.  I do feel that it would be of considerable help to the House if Deputies would criticise in a constructive and reasonable fashion in this House, and would, if possible, ascertain their facts before making statements which are often not in accordance with the facts.  As was inevitable, a large portion of the debate centred around the biggest national problem that we have, namely, Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little that I can add to what I said in opening this debate, or that I can add to what the Deputies of this House have said.  The continuance of Partition is a constant indictment of the elementary principles of democracy. It is a constant infringement on the right to national self-determination.  I think I made it clear in opening that the Partition of Ireland is something that no generation of Irishmen, that no Irish Government and that no Irish Parliament will ever accept or <Col N="1012" /> acquiesce in.  I think I also made it clear that the continuance of Partition would prove a hindrance to the good relationship and co-operation that should exist between this island and Britain.</P>
    <P>One thing, I think, is rather essential. It is that no Party, and no particular individual on any side of this House, be he Minister or leader of a Party, should seek to monopolise Partition as part of his personal policy. Partition is a national issue upon which there is complete unity in this House and in the country, and it does not belong to any one Party.  I would like that this House should always maintain a united attitude in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment especially Deputy Sir John Esmonde for the speech he made in the House to-day. It was a most constructive and a most helpful speech on the issue of Partition.  I think that there is probably a lot in the suggestion that he made, a suggestion that I propose to have examined more carefully that there should be an all-Party committee of this House to deal with it.</P>
    <P>One or two particular issues have been raised in relation to Partition. Deputy Byrne raised one particular question, and I must say that I am in complete agreement with the remarks passed by Deputy Dr. Brennan in relation to the interruptions to which Deputy Byrne was subjected.  I think that Deputy Byrne did raise a question that must be faced up to, and I think that the Leader of the Opposition would, on examination, realise that a lot of our friends in the Six Counties have genuine fears, fears that may have been deliberately created for an ulterior reason, but be that as it may, I think that a great many of what we may call the Unionist population in the Six Counties have very genuine fears about certain matters.  I think that it is our duty, in so far as we can, to lay these fears at rest.</P>
    <P>A great many of these fears have been deliberately propagated by those who want to maintain the division of this country.  The people there have been told that we are intolerant, that if Partition were ended their religious or civil liberties would be in danger, <Col N="1013" /> that they would be compelled to learn Irish, that they would be precluded from securing employment unless they knew Irish, that their children would be made learn everything at school through the medium of Irish, and that we would interfere with their religious services or their religious liberties.  We have no intentions of the kind, but it is so.  Why should we let that propaganda go unanswered?  We have no intention of in any way interfering with the civil or religious liberties of the people in the Six Counties; we have no intention of trying to compel the people of the Six Counties to learn Irish or to deprive them of the right of employment because they do not speak Irish. Is it not just as well for us to say these things right out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, when in the right context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy, on reflection, will realise that it is of value to lay these fears at rest. Likewise, I think it is of value that we ourselves should appreciate the realities of the position, and that we must in this House realise that it is essential that we should establish conditions in this part of the country from the social point of view and the point of view of the social services which are as good as those that exist in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Likewise, I think that it is essential that we should convey to our friends in the Six Counties that if they have to pay higher taxation, if they have to undergo shortages, it is because of Partition; if they export vast quantities of goods and get none in return, it is because of Partition.  These are economic facts that there can be no argument about, and I think that these facts should be explained to the people of this country.  I am not suggesting that historical reasons or sentimental reasons should not also be dealt with, but I think that you want to deal with all aspects of Partition and get the people, not merely of this country, but the people of England and of the rest of the world to understand these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy made what I consider to be a rather mischievous suggestion, which I have no doubt will be exploited <Col N="1014" /> to the fullest on the other side of the Border.  I do not know whether it is Deputy Cowan's intention to suggest that this country should declare war on Britain and should invade the Six Counties.  If that is his suggestion, I think he might have told the House in so many words that it was and proceed to explain how that war should be waged.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the Nationality Bill which has just been passed by the British Parliament, is, as far as we can see here, quite clear and unambiguous.  The last Government made its views most clearly to the British Government; the present Government did likewise.  As I stated at the beginning&mdash;and I do not think that there can be any doubt about it&mdash; the views of the two Governments were identical on the matter, and those views were communicated to the British Government.  I stated that yesterday evening and I do not know whether Deputy de Valera meant to suggest anything otherwise when he referred to the &ldquo;mild way&rdquo; in which I dealt with the position.  I would rather if this matter had not come up for discussion in the House.  I do not know whether Deputy de Valera would consider that any useful purpose would have been served had I indulged in vituperations directed to the majority of the members of the House of Lords and to the British Government.  Personally, I do not think that it would have served a useful function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the British Government or the British Parliament had any doubt as to our attitude.  I have read the debates which took place in the British House of Lords and the House of Commons fairly carefully and I am satisfied from these that our attitude was known and that those who had carriage of the Bill in the British Parliament made it clear that this Bill was not acceptable to us in its present form, that we had objections that had not been met and that all we could say about it was that it was an improvement on the position that had existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> Lest some of the things that have been said might be taken as an indication that this Government or my Department had in any way failed to make the position clear, I think it would be well if I told the House, without going into detail, the position as I found it, when I took over the Department, in relation to this matter. I found that there had been since early 1947 conferences dealing with nationality and citizenship held in London at which we had been represented.  These conferences lasted some considerable time in the early part of 1947; we were adequately represented at them by several of the higher officials of my Department.  Therefore, we were fully informed as to what was taking place; therefore, the Leader of the Opposition was also, at that time, fully informed as to what was taking place.  He was the Minister in charge of the Department. Subsequently the views of the Government were, as we know, imparted in memoranda that were sent to the British Government, views with which I concur completely.  These views, however, were not wholly accepted by the British Government, and when this Government was appointed by this House and when I took over the Department of External Affairs, I found that the matter was closed and that the Bill had been introduced in the British Parliament.  As far as we were concerned, the matter was ended. After lengthy discussions and an exchange of memoranda, it was introduced into the British House of Lords. Owing to certain provisions that were still in the Bill, and lest there be any misunderstanding as to the position, I felt it necessary to reopen the matter and I think I can say that as a result of reopening it, we were able to secure some further improvement in the Bill, improvements that were incorporated in the amendment moved on behalf of the British Government in the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as introduced, an Irish citizen was amenable to the British criminal law in England in respect of an act committed in Ireland. An amendment was introduced, as I <Col N="1016" /> have informed the House, on behalf of the British Government in the House of Lords rectifying that position and providing that an Irish citizen would not be guilty of any offence against the laws of the United Kingdom in respect of any act done in Ireland, or in any foreign country, unless that act was an offence if he were an alien.  These, broadly speaking, are the provisions of that section.  But the position was, when we took over, that this Bill was introduced and the matter was closed, so far as negotiations were concerned.</P>

      <P>I hoped that would have been so.  I am not in any way trying to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition failed to do what he should have done in connection with the matter.  Let me say this quite frankly: so far as the conduct of affairs in the Department of External Affairs is concerned, I have no criticism to offer or to suggest against the Leader of the Opposition, but I think that, on reflection, he must agree with me that it is not quite fair to suggest to the House that we have in any way done or omitted to do anything which should have been done in connection with this nationality Bill.

It has complete jurisdiction in its own Parliament.  Many countries at present have laws which impose military service on non-citizens resident there.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that this Bill is an ideal Bill, that it is the Bill which this Parliament would have drawn up and passed, if it could do so, but we have to recognise certain facts.</P>
      <P>We have to recognise in relation to this particular matter that there are three viewpoints.  There is our viewpoint upon which, I think, we are unanimous.  There is the viewpoint of the British Labour Government, that goes a certain distance to meet our viewpoint, and there is the viewpoint of the Conservative majority of the British House of Lords, that takes the same view as Deputy Cowan does, namely, that we are part and parcel of the British Empire and the Commonwealth.  I am glad to see that there is some identity of view even between the most extreme sections of opinion in both countries.</P>

We are not members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. This is typical of the type of damaging statement that can be made in this House by Deputies.  Statements made in this House are often quoted back in other Parliaments.  The House may remember that there was an adjournment debate in this House on the question of the Nationality Bill.  That debate, and some of the statements made in that debate, formed part of a stick that was used against us in the British Parliament a short time afterwards.

      <P>In relation to certain other matters that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition, I quite agree <Col N="1022" /> with him that everything possible should be done to ensure that visitors to our country, be they tourists or otherwise, are treated properly when they come into the country and, if he has any information concerning any unnecessary delays or inconveniences that may have been inflicted upon any of them, I shall be very glad to have the matter looked into.  Strictly speaking, it is no part of the function of my Department to look after the transport of tourists or such matters but I do take the view that it is in the interests of the foreign policy of this country that we should ensure that visitors to this country are treated properly.</P>
      <P>The question of the cultural committee is going ahead and so is the question of a suitable handbook.  I do not think I shall have quite the same views as to the form that handbook should take as possibly my predecessor had.  I think a somewhat different type would be more suitable, but that is only a question of detail.</P>
      <P>In relation to the opening of a Consulate in Philadelphia, I would like to have a Consulate in every town in America where there is a large Irish population and I would like to have diplomatic representatives in many countries where we have not got them at the moment.  We have a Consul in Boston and in a number of other American cities.  Generally speaking, we have no Consuls save in American cities with big populations and cities that are also ports&mdash;that is, apart from Washington and New York, where we would have a Consul at any time. Philadelphia is within easy reach of both Washington and New York.  I would like to have a Consul there, but I do not see that the expense would be justified at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Vivion de Valera who mentioned my references yesterday to the United States of Europe.  I referred to it, not to suggest that it was a practical possibility at the moment, but to convey to the House that it was one of the plans that are being discussed in Europe at present, not by Governments but by Parliaments in Europe independently of Governments. We here should try to keep abreast of <Col N="1023" /> political developments in the international sphere in other countries, we should know what things are being discussed by them and we should think out our attitude in advance.  We should not wait until a <i>fait accompli</i> is presented to us.  Discussions on these things amongst ourselves, either in this House or in the Seanad, are useful, as they get people thinking of the various problems that confront the country and the world at large.</P>
    <P>Because I stated that isolationism is impossible now-a-days, it was sought to suggest that I was proposing that this country should commit itself to participation in a war.  I thought I had explained fairly carefully that the advance of science, the advance of the means of communication, of wireless, transport, and aviation, made isolationism impossible.  We cannot lock ourselves up, away from the movements of the world, away from the thinking indulged in in other countries.  It is in that sense that I mean that isolationism is impossible.  Our tendency in the past&mdash;not in connection with the last war &mdash;was to be a little bit isolationist and insular in our thoughts.  That was so in the early part of the century.  We cannot keep on a policy of that kind, even if it were advisable, because of the development of wireless and transport. We cannot but be influenced by the thought in other countries and, therefore, it is much better that we should think ourselves in these terms rather than let ourselves be influenced by propaganda that may reach us afterwards.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised by Deputy Cowan for having said that our sympathies were with Western Europe.  What I stated was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We here are not much troubled by conflicting ideologies.  We are firm believers in democracy in its true sense and are firmly attached to the principles of Christianity.  Our sympathies, therefore, lie clearly with Western Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if any Deputy wishes to challenge that seriously.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to feel that when we have to discuss external <Col N="1024" /> affairs, Deputies will exercise a greater degree of moderation in their language, bearing in mind that what they say here may very often be misconstrued in other countries.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £417,875 <Col N="1025" /> be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £30,605 in the net provision for this Vote as compared with last year is mainly due to a reduction of £28,118 in sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  This reduction is due to the closing down of the food allowances branch, following the replacement of food vouchers by cash supplements, and to the co-ordination of functions previously performed by separate Departments.  The total number of staffs shows a decrease of 138.</P>
    <P>Closely allied with the question of possible economies in staff is the question of accommodation which creates a very big problem for me, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country. The Department's Dublin offices, excluding four employment exchanges, are housed in no less than eight separate buildings at widely scattered points ranging from the Custom House to the Castle and from Lord Edward Street to Earlsfort Terrace.  This position, together with the existence of some duplication and overlapping of duties performed in different offices (which were formerly under different Departments) necessitated special arrangements for liaison and supervision and for the amalgamation of sections in the interests of economy and efficiency.  In present circumstances there appears to be little possibility of reducing the total number of city offices, and I am afraid that the ideal of a central headquarters office is remote. I am endeavouring, however, to find some solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>The largest provincial offices of my Department are, of course, the employment exchanges and, in towns where there are exchanges, the ultimate aim is to house all the local officials of the Department in these buildings so far as practicable.  Action towards this end has been initiated in some towns but, unfortunately, many of the existing employment exchange buildings are too small to accommodate any extra staff <Col N="1026" /> and others are unsuitable even for their present use.  In present circumstances, the acquisition or erection of suitable premises in a number of towns is not feasible and we must do the best we can with our existing premises, except in so far as urgent requirements compel us to make a change.  I look forward, however, to the future when we can reorganise our local offices in suitable premises, housing all the local officials of my Department under one roof and eliminating the present wasteful system of scattered offices.  In the meantime, within the limits of our resources, the aim is to reduce duplication, improve accommodation, where possible, and effect all possible savings in administraion and cost of premises.</P>
    <P>I am also considering the problem of the 80 or 90 branch offices associated with the employment exchanges throughout the country.  Except in a few cases, these offices are not staffed by civil servants and many of them are located in unsuitable premises. Deputies are already aware of the shortcomings of this system and I should like to assure the House that no time or opportunity will be lost in my efforts to remedy those defects.  Consideration is being given at the moment to the feasibility of setting up a more satisfactory system.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimates were circulated certain changes in the different schemes of social welfare have been under the consideration of the Government. It will be recalled that the late Government, as a temporary expedient to deal with the rising cost of living during the emergency, provided the recipients of benefits under several social security schemes with supplements to those benefits.  In urban areas these supplements first took the form of food allowances, which during last year were replaced by cash allowances. In rural areas the supplements were in cash from the beginning.</P>
    <P>Last year's cash supplements were given to recipients of benefit under both contributory and non-contributory schemes and represented generally a flat rate increase in the benefit and their whole cost was met by the Exchequer. The only exception was the supplementary cash allowances provided by assistance authorities to recipients <Col N="1027" /> of old age pensions in rural areas, in which case 75 per cent. of the cost was borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>These supplements to the various benefits were, as I have stated, a temporary expedient designed to meet the position which had arisen during the emergency period, but the necessity for them still continues.  So far, however, as the insurance schemes of national health insurance, unemployment insurance and contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are concerned, the grant to beneficiaries of supplementary benefits payable in full by the Exchequer was a departure from their insurance basis, and I feel that the time has now come when the insurance principle should be restored.  Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, 1948, which was introduced yesterday, I propose, therefore, if the Oireachtas approves, to abolish the cash supplements at present payable to recipients of benefits under the insurance schemes, to increase the benefits by an equivalent amount and to increase the contributions to the amount necessary to meet the increased benefits.  The effect of these proposals will be that cash supplements, which are now voted annually, will be amalgamated with the basic benefits and will be received as of statutory right by virtue of contributions paid.  The House will be asked on the Bill to fix the 4th October next &mdash;the beginning of the second half of the current financial year&mdash;as the date from which the higher contributions will operate.  The Exchequer will, of course, bear its normal proportion of the cost of the increase in the amount of the benefits.</P>
    <P>On the non-contributory side it is proposed in the Social Welfare Bill to provide a scheme of old age pensions dispensing with cash supplements and payments through public assistance authorities and to have a new scheme of weekly pensions ranging from a minimum of 5/- to a maximum of 17/6 without any differentiation as between dwellers in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, it is proposed instead of the four existing <Col N="1028" /> areas to have two areas&mdash;one an urban area comprising the county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and incorporated towns, and the second a rural area comprising the remainder of the State.  In the proposed urban area the maximum weekly pension would range from 14/- for a widow alone to 58/- for a widow with ten or more children; in the new rural area the corresponding range of new weekly pension rates would be from 10/- to 54/-.  It is also proposed to pay non-contributory pensions at the age of 48 (instead of 55 as at present) to widows who have no dependent children.</P>
    <P>For both old age pensions and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions it is proposed to modify the means test considerably in favour of the claimant.</P>
    <P>The changes being made in the old age pensions and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions codes will mean that substantial increases will become payable to beneficiaries under those services; the estimated additional cost in a full year will be around £2,500,000.  As I have already explained to the House in replies to Parliamentary Questions, administrative difficulties will prevent payment of the increased rates of pensions for some time.  After the necessary legislation has been passed, about 200,000 new pension books must be printed, and an individual review and reassessment undertaken in all cases.  It will be appreciated that this will be a formidable task, but I can assure the House that it will be pushed ahead with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that the cash supplement to unemployment assistance will lose its separate identity and be amalgamated with the basic allowance.</P>
    <P>Since 1941-42, food vouchers have been issued by public assistance authorities by way of additional assistance for recipients of home assistance, and grants were made available from the Exchequer each year to meet the cost of the food thus supplied.</P>
    <P>After the Social Welfare (Cash Supplements) Order, 1947, had come into force, the issue of food vouchers to certain beneficiaries under existing social welfare schemes was discontinued <Col N="1029" /> and the subsequent issue, under Government auspices, of food vouchers by public assistance authorities has been contrary to general policy.  It was, therefore, decided that no part of expenditure incurred by public assistance authorities on the provision, after the 27th March, 1948, of food vouchers for recipients of home assistance would be recouped from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It was appreciated that public assistance authorities would, as a result of the discontinuance of the issue of food vouchers, find it necessary to increase, in many cases, the amount of home assistance paid in cash.  As the sudden withdrawal of the entire State subvention at the one time might inconvenience public assistance authorities, the Government proposes to recoup to those authorities, to the extent of 50 per cent., expenditure incurred by them on the provision during the present financial year of additional cash allowances in lieu of food vouchers, subject to a maximum recoupment in the case of each public assistance authority of an amount equivalent to 50 per cent. of the actual net expenditure by that local authority on the provision during 1946/47 of food vouchers for recipients of home assistance. The estimated total amount which will thus be recouped is £75,000.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention that a similar grant should be made available in future years but that, instead, public assistance authorities will discharge their normal statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The estimated loss to the rates for 1948-49 as a result of the reduction in the grant made available to meet the cost of additional assistance for recipients of home assistance is £75,000, equivalent to a rate of less than 1½d. in the £, spread over the country as a whole.  The legislative proposals of which I have already spoken will, however, more than offset this loss, as the demands on public assistance authorities will be lessened as a result of the proposed improvements in the State-administered social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>My recent inspection of the principal Dublin institutions for the blind revealed that through lack of funds <Col N="1030" /> considerable difficulties were being encountered in the maintenance of the various services for that less fortunate class of our fellow citizens.  I came to the conclusion, having regard to the increased cost of maintaining such institutions, that local authorities should be asked to increase their annual capitation contributions to £40 with effect from the 1s April, 1948.  I am glad to say that almost all of those authorities have agreed to increase the contributions to that figure.</P>
    <P>I thought it only fitting that something should also be done from the State side, and again I am pleased to say that the Minister for Finance has approved of proposals to increase the amounts paid from State funds to the approved agencies by way of annual capitation grants.  The revised rates, which also become effective from the 1st April, 1948, are :&mdash;£40 per annum in respect of each workshop employee, £20 per annum for each worker maintained in a hostel, £20 per annum for each inmate of a home, £40 per annum for each pupil in a school residence.</P>
    <P>With regard to blind pensions, I propose in the new Bill to grant pensions at an earlier age and to modify the means test as at present applied.  I have also directed that an examination be carried out in my Department with regard to further proposals for the betterment of the conditions of the blind.  I am seeking the authority of the Government for the establishment of a consultative council to advise me in matters affecting the blind.  I need hardly say that the needs of this section of the community will be considered sympathetically by me.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the more important matters that actually arise on the Estimates, I take, with the permission of the House, the opportunity of making a few general observations on the activities of my Department.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, my Department has in hands the preparation of a comprehensive social insurance <Col N="1031" /> scheme.  I hope to be in a position before long to present our proposals in the form of a White Paper, and I do not, therefore, propose to make any statement now as to what form these proposals may take.  I should like to point out, however, that the subject is very complex and has many ramifications.  Each of its elements calls for a considerable amount of deliberation before one can be satisfied as to the best course to recommend, and I would be unhappy to present anything less than the best that our resources will allow.  In the meantime, Deputies would do well to give thought themselves as to what measures might be most suitable, with particular reference, perhaps, to the scope of the scheme (i.e., the persons to be insured) and the range of benefits.</P>
      <P>In connection with the comprehensive scheme I may say that one of the problems to be solved is the future of the National Health Insurance Society. All the schemes of social insurance, except sickness insurance, are administered directly by the Department.  In the case of sickness insurance, the direct administration of the scheme is carried out by the society.  Most of the advantage which is expected to flow from the establishment of the Department of Social Welfare in the matter of co-ordination and control of administration would be lost if, solely because of the existence of the society, sickness insurance should continue to have an administrative organ separate from all the other services.  Consequently, in the interests of efficiency and co-ordination, it will be necessary to integrate the society with the proposed comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officers of my Department have recently had discussions with officers of the Ministry of National Insurance in Great Britain and of the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance in Northern Ireland with regard to the making of reciprocal arrangements as between the various schemes of social insurance.  While there have never been any such arrangements in connection with unemployment insurance, such arrangements in connection with <Col N="1032" /> national health insurance have been in operation since 1923 and have worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Until the 5th of this month there was no great disparity in contributions and benefits under the insurance schemes in operation here and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland but, since that date, when new schemes came into operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, disparities are more marked and there is increased difficulty in effecting reciprocity.  I expect, nevertheless, to conclude, in the next few days, agreements covering sickness and maternity insurance and the insurability of seamen, and I am not unhopeful that some worthwhile arrangement will be worked out in regard to unemployment insurance. Deputies will recollect that enabling legislation was passed about a fortnight ago.</P>
    <P>I should like also, if I may, to make a brief reference to the establishment in April last of the Commission on Emigration and other population problems. Notwithstanding a few dissentient voices, I think the personnel of the commission has met with general approval, and I am confident of their ability to give us expeditiously a useful report on this most serious subject.  I would ask all who are in a position to help to consider it their national duty to co-operate wholeheartedly with the commission so that we may be able to evolve a population policy and devise means for remedying such evils as emigration and rural depopulation.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the selection boards set up by the Local Appointments Commission to select persons for <Col N="1033" /> appointments are not the final arbiters in such selections; and if he is aware that after such boards have placed candidates in their order of merit some other person or persons add additional marks, thereby changing the order of merit; and if he is aware that members of selection boards have frequently protested against this procedure and have asked for particulars of the additional marks allotted but have been refused these; and if he will take steps to ensure that for the future selection boards will not be interfered with in their selection of personnel for positions, and that no person or body will have the power to interfere with the order of merit in which the board have placed the candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The body expressly charged, by the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, with the duty of selecting the persons to be appointed to certain situations in the employment of local authorities is the Local Appointments Commission itself.  The statutory duty and responsibility of recommending to local authorities persons for appointment to offices to which the Act applies rest on the commissioners and cannot, under the existing law, be delegated to any other body or authority.  Persons to be recommended for appointment must be selected by the commissioners by means of competitive examination except where, by reason of the nature of the duties of the office, the knowledge and experience required and the qualifications prescribed, the selection cannot be satisfactorily made by this method, and it is provided that, in such a case, the commissioners may make the selection by such means and in such manner as they think proper.  In practice, the commissioners avail themselves of the assistance of boards where the method of competitive examination is not considered satisfactory.  These boards, although popularly known as selection boards are, in fact, and are called by the commissioners, interview boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dependent on the category to which the office belongs, the qualifications for appointment, that is, the qualifications as to age, health, character, education, training, experience, etc., are <Col N="1034" /> either &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; by the commissioners, with the consent of the appropriate Minister or &ldquo;declared&rdquo; by the appropriate Minister after consultation with the commissioners; and, before recommending a person to a local authority for appointment, the commissioners must satisfy themselves &ldquo;in such manner as they think proper&rdquo; that such person possesses these qualifications.  The interview board are asked to advise the commissioners as to the qualifications of the candidates in respect of such matters as education&mdash;excluding knowledge of Irish&mdash;training, experience and suitability and to place in order of merit in those respects the candidates whom they consider to be qualified.</P>
    <P>In addition to the qualifications on which the interview board advise, the commissioners have regard to knowledge of Irish and, in recent years, to service rendered in the Defence Forces and the Auxiliary Defence Services. Preferences or extra credits&mdash;that is, extra marks&mdash;are awarded in respect of these matters in accordance with certain well-defined rules.  These preferences or extra credits may, and sometimes do, result in the commissioners selecting, for recommendation to the local authority concerned a candidate other than the candidate whom the interview board have placed first in order of merit in respect of the particular matters which fall within the board's province.  On the other hand, even where the award of these preferences or extra credits produces no change in the order of merit in which the interview board have placed the candidates, the candidate placed first may subsequently decide not to proceed with his candidature or may prefer another post of which he has the choice or may fail to satisfy the commissioners that he possesses the prescribed qualifications in respect of age, health or character.  I am informed that, subject to the exceptions I have indicated, it is the practice of the commissioners to select for recommendation to the local authority the candidate whom the interview board have placed first in order of merit.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the making of an appointment indicate that the <Col N="1035" /> factors I have referred to are taken into account by the commissioners in the selection of a candidate.  Copies of these regulations are supplied to each candidate and to the members of each interview board and are also available to the public.  The board are not, however, given details of the extra credit allowed for knowledge of Irish or for defence service.  It would be feasible to arrange matters so that the interview board could be informed of the extent of the preferences or extra credit to which each candidate would be entitled in respect of knowledge of Irish or defence service, although such an arrangement would not be free from practical difficulties.  The reason why they are not so informed is that, if an interview board were aware of the effect which these preferences and extra credits would have on the final placings of individual candidates, the members of the board might unconsciously be influenced in assessing the relative merits of the candidates in other respects.  The position which obtains at present is that the interview board can confine themselves to the relative merits of candidates in regard to their professional or technical qualifications and suitability without having to concern themselves with any other considerations.</P>
    <P>There are only two cases on record in which written protests have been made regarding the operation of the preferences and extra credits.  On various other occasions, however, members of interview boards have verbally protested both at the practice of giving such preferences and at the refusal of the commissioners to disclose the extent to which they have affected the final placings of candidates.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Local Appointments Commissioners appreciate very fully the valuable public service which is rendered, gratuitously, by the men and women of high standing in the life of the community who act as members of interview boards.  They know that this service always entails inconvenience, and often serious inconvenience. It would not be possible, however, under the statutes which govern these matters, legally to place <Col N="1036" /> on interview boards the final responsibility for selecting personnel for appointment to situations under local authorities or to alter the position by which that responsibility rests on one definite body of persons appointed by, and holding office during the pleasure of, the Government.</P>

      <P>I think I can assure the Deputy that I have given fairly deep consideration to the whole of this matter before this reply was put down. The Deputy, at my request, postponed the question for some weeks.  The matter will be further and more fully considered.  I would express my own personal view, which is not the conviction of any of my colleagues, whom I have not so far consulted on this topic, that the more information given to the public about matters of appointments the better it is for the Local Appointments Commissioners, of whose integrity I have not the slightest fear.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that very many people are highly satisfied with the present method of selection <Col N="1037" /> and, in so far as persons in other years who have been placed first by the interview boards have not been appointed, it was very largely because of confidential information as to character which was obtained from the requisite authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right, and so is Deputy Sweetman. Like most other questions, the matters involved in this affair are matters on which there can be, legitimately and honestly, different views held.  There is a very strong view held in the country that there should be more publicity in reference to these matters.  Equally, there is a very strong case to be made that there should be a certain amount of reticence.  It is a matter on which there can be valid differences of opinion.  I am prepared to listen to both sides.  The only thing I and the Government wish is to see that appointments to local authorities are made in such a manner as will secure the most efficient person and as will ensure public confidence in the appointment and in the body making the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will consider amending the diocesan panel regulations affecting the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools, in view of the grave hardship which the operation of these regulations is causing (1) to teachers through (a) the breaking up of their homes and the separating of wives from their husbands and families; (b) the difficulty of finding suitable lodgings; (c) the circumstances under which assistant teachers reduce themselves to junior assistant mistresses with consequent loss of salary, and the forcing of teachers to early retiral, and (2) to managers by (a) interfering with their prerogative in the appointment of teachers; and (b) the fact that schools are often left for long periods with inadequate teaching staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the panel arrangement, salary was withdrawn from teachers whose services, as determined by the number of <Col N="1038" /> pupils, were no longer needed in the school; teachers had then to seek posts elsewhere and to suffer loss of salary until they had secured them.  The panel arrangement now affords such teachers a certain security of tenure by allowing them to continue to serve in the school and to receive full salary until such time as, within the panel area, alternative vacancies occur to which they may be appointed.</P>
      <P>I cannot, therefore, accept the view that the operation of these regulations, which were accepted at the time by the various interests concerned, constitute a hardship.  I regret that in certain cases there should be inconvenience and disturbance, but this inconvenience and disturbance is small compared with that which the panel was instituted to remove and which it does remove.  It would not be possible to contemplate a position whereby salary would be continued indefinitely irrespective of the attendance at the school and of the need for the teachers' services therein. The panel arrangement is designed for the benefit of the teachers, and the managerial authorities, on their part, accept in that spirit any inconvenience arising from its operation.</P>

The recommendation was that, as from 1st January, 1948, the basic salaries of the nursing staff should be increased by £20 a year, that a somewhat smaller increase should be granted in the basic salaries of the attendant staff, that cash paid in lieu of rations should be increased by 6d. per day, and that the valuation of rations for pension purposes should be raised from £45 a year to £55 a year.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these matters were agreed upon at a conference between the manager and the trade unions at the beginning of May, that an application for sanction of the increases was sent to the Department on the 19th June and that, when I made inquiries on the 3rd July in the Department, I was informed that no such application was received although a letter of acknowledgment was at that time in the hands of the chief clerk? Is it not the case that over a period repeated applications have been made pressing for a decision because of the fact that two separate applications were made and that if simultaneous decisions were not given it would involve a great deal of accountancy and book-keeping which might be avoided by sanction being given at the one time?  We are still awaiting sanction for these increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his statement mentioned that in many of the larger towns and cities, we had unemployment exchanges and that he hoped to get all social welfare administration into these buildings in large towns and cities.  I think that is very desirable and when I was in the Department I urged that it should be done as soon as possible.  I do recognise some of the difficulties that were raised by the Minister.  In some of these towns and cities, the building is too small.  In other cases, as well as I remember, it is impossible to get a larger space because the building is confined; while in some cases it may take a long time to reconstruct a building so as to make it suitable to house all the staff that will be necessary for the other social welfare schemes&mdash;old age pensions, national health and so on.  Everyone will agree that we should aim at getting all social welfare administered in the various districts from one particular building.</P>
      <P>On the question of branch offices the Minister did not give us his opinion. He said that he was making every effort to remedy the defects.  I would like him to say if he has made up his mind as to whether he believes that more of the branch offices should be transferred over to the regular exchanges, that is to the administration of civil servants, or not, and if he thinks that these branch exchanges are being run on proper lines&mdash;I mean fundamentally on proper lines&mdash;that is, run on contract as it were and not by the Civil Service.  Will he say what are the principal defects that he has in mind and what remedy he means to pursue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave a very brief outline of certain changes that he proposes to make in a Bill which he has already introduced&mdash;it has not yet <Col N="1050" /> been circulated&mdash;with regard to old-age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and also covering the means test.  There is no use, I think, in wasting the time of the House in discussing this matter when we have not got sufficient information.  In any event, I understand that the Second Reading of that Bill will be coming up next week.  There is, therefore, no use in covering the ground now since we will have more time and more information at our disposal when the Bill comes up for Second Reading.  I do not propose, therefore, to go into the matter further at this stage.  The Minister did mention that the proposals which he is putting before the Dáil in that Bill will mean another £2,500,000 to old-age pensioners, widows and orphans.  We will see how that sum is going to be distributed.</P>
    <P>The Minister again pleads for time. He tells us that, when this Bill is circulated, there will be some time necessary to issue the new books. That same plea was made when the Budget was before us two or three months ago.  At that time the plea was made that the increased benefits could not be given to old-age pensioners and to the other classes because new books would have to be issued to the present recipients and to the prospective recipients under the new scheme.  I remember pointing out in the course of the Budget discussions that, last year, when the Budget was brought in we gave the increased benefits not only to the old-age pensioners and to the widows and orphans but also to the National Health Insurance recipients and to the unemployment assistance recipients, and that there was no delay whatever.  In fact, the benefits at that time came into operation on the 1st April, 1947.  That is to say, they came into operation after the Vote on Account was passed and before the Budget was introduced. As I say, they came into operation on the 1st April, 1947, even though the decision was only taken by the Government a few weeks previous to that.  It was possible by various devices, such as restamping the old books, by affixing additional stamps and so on, to bring the benefits into operation, and <Col N="1051" /> in cases where there was delay, as there necessarily was in certain cases, the money was paid by way of arrears after some weeks and matters were cleared up.</P>
    <P>I think that, if the Minister were seriously concerned about giving these people the increased benefits, it would be done, and that there is no necessity to wait until the new books are issued. Now, if the Minister, on the other hand, is more concerned to fall in with the Fine Gael policy, as laid down by the Minister for Finance, to make economies and to delay any expenditure of this kind as far as possible, then the excuse about the new books is as good as anything else.  It simply delays the matter, as far as possible, from coming into operation.</P>
    <P>We should like to have heard a little more&mdash;we did not hear very much&mdash; about this question of the public assistance authorities.  The Minister pointed out that, during the last four or five years, any additional benefits that were given to old-age pensioners or, in fact, any additional benefits that were given to other classes such as the recipients of national health insurance benefits, widows in receipt of pensions, etc., were given by the local authorities. Now, whatever the local authorities spent in that way they were recouped to the extent of 75 per cent. by the Exchequer.  When the new Government took over the Minister for Social Welfare made a new Order with regard to that.  He felt that the time had come when there should be a change made in that respect.  I do not know why, except on the plea that people were better off than he believed they were before he came into Office. At any rate, he made a new Order to the effect that the local authorities would not be recouped to the extent of 75 per cent. in future.  He told us to-day that, as a sort of transition arrangement, he is going to recoup them to the extent of 50 per cent. this year, and after this year not at all.</P>
    <P>Now, that is one of those examples&mdash; there are, of course, many of them-where the present Ministers, before they took office, were very assiduous <Col N="1052" /> in their duties in the Dáil in pointing out to the Government and to the country how very inadequately the people in these classes were being treated, old-age pensioners, widows and orphans, national health and the others &mdash;that they were not by any means getting enough.  The strange thing is that when they took over office they changed their minds completely, and came to the conclusion that these people were getting too much, and they made various Orders, such as the one that I have been referring to.  They told the local authorities &ldquo;Well, if you want to give these people additional benefits it is your lookout, not ours,&rdquo; and more or less said to the local authorities, &ldquo;These people do not require any additional benefits, but, of course, if you want to give them additional benefits and if you want to incur that luxury in your local administration, well, let the ratepayers pay for it, because there is no reason why we should.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point that I want to make is to ask the Minister why he should change his opinion about these people so soon after coming into office.  Was it, that when he came into office he had access to more reliable figures, and, therefore, was able to make up his mind, when he came into the Department of Social Welfare, that he was wrong when he was a member of the Opposition: that he really was mistaken in making out when a member of the Opposition that these people were being badly treated: that, in fact, they were quite well treated and did not require any help from the local authorities?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to tell us that he has got sanction from the Minister for Finance to help local authorities with regard, I think, to the inmates of county homes.  I was not quite able to keep up taking notes when he was making his statement, so that I am afraid we will have to wait for another occasion to find out what exactly this help is, and what the significance of the Minister's point is.</P>

      <P>That is very good and I am very glad to hear it.  Anything the Minister proposes to do for the blind will have, I am quite sure, the approval of every member of this House.  He goes on to say that he proposes in this new Bill to give pensions to the blind at an earlier age than they have got them up to this and on a lower means test.  That is very good, too.  He also has decided to appoint a consultative council.  It struck me when the Minister was talking that one of the best things that ever happened to him was that he was made Minister of a Department, because there was never a Deputy in opposition who could speak with such self-assurance on all subjects as the former Deputy Norton.  When he was Deputy Norton he knew everything about the blind; he knew what they should be getting and what we were not giving them; he could tell me, when I was there, what I should do for the blind, but now he is appointing a consultative council.  There is an old saying that the more you learn, the more you know you do not know, and that applies to the Minister for Social Welfare.  He is beginning to learn now that there are things he does not know at all, but when he was a Deputy in opposition he knew everything.  I am very glad to see that the Minister has taken over this responsible position and that he has learned that even yet there are things a consultative council could give him advice on.  I wish him luck with his consultative council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is bringing in a Bill next week to give certain benefits to <Col N="1054" /> various classes under the social welfare scheme.  As far as I can understand&mdash; I have never got to know clearly&mdash;it is by way of an interim arrangement. He speaks of a White Paper.  The White Paper, I understand, is going to give the Minister's views on what might be regarded as a comprehensive and permanent scheme&mdash;I will not say final, because nothing is final in social welfare and the more we go on the more we find is necessary.  I do not know what the delay is about this White Paper.  When I took over office in February, 1947, I remember coming before the Dáil for an Estimate and I had gone into the matter as far as I could and consulted the officials concerned. I do not want to say that the officials agreed with me, but I thought, having consulted them, that I could at least put before this Dáil within 12 months what I thought a comprehensive scheme of social welfare should be for this country.  I do not want to wrong the officials, because the officials thought I was a little too optimistic, but I thought I could do it.  The election intervened.  The election took six or eight weeks of valuable time and I thought that this matter would have to be postponed until April or May, but not later than that.  If that White Paper could have been produced by April or May I do not see the reason for the delay now.  I am not saying that that would have been a White Paper which the Minister would accept; he might like to do a whole lot more than I proposed to do&mdash;we will see later on&mdash;or something different from what I proposed to do; I was allowing time for the Government to sanction it, and the data was there, so if it could have been prepared by April or May I do not see why there should be more than two or three months on the Minister's part to make the changes he wants to make, and I do not see why the Paper should not come out now or in the very near future.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know when he proposes to let us have a look at the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that there are certain difficulties, and I quite agree that there are certain difficulties. One is the National Health Insurance Society; another is workman's <Col N="1055" /> compensation; another is the present scheme of contributions by employers, employees and the Government.  These are three big points to be considered, and it requires a good deal of consideration before you can make up your mind as to what side you are going to come down on.</P>
    <P>Take national health first.  The Minister says&mdash;quite truly&mdash;that it is the only branch of social welfare which is not administered by the Department direct.  All the other branches, as everybody knows, are administered by the Department.  Old-age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance, childrens' allowances and a lot of these minor schemes which may or may not last, such as free milk, special food allowances and so on&mdash;all are administered by the Department with the exception of national health. There is an historical background. National health was brought in back as far, I think, as 1908, and societies took it over at that time.  It was administered by societies for some years, but 12 or 14 years ago these societies were amalgamated into one society in this country, and the National Health Insurance Society is now in charge of the national health insurance scheme for the country.  The Minister has now to make up his mind whether it will remain in outside control or be brought into the Department and be administered by the Department like any of the other schemes.</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand from the Minister's introductory statement here to-day, he means to amalgamate it and bring it into the Department with the other schemes.  I agree with him that he should do that, but I feel that if I had brought in this scheme of comprehensive insurance and if I had suggested that national health insurance should be administered by the Department like all the others, I should have had strong objections from the Labour Party, and from Clann na Poblachta for certain.  It is actually in their election propaganda that we were departing from Dr. Dignan's plan and they bank on the Dignan plan, as do also the Labour Party to a great extent. <Col N="1056" /> All through the elections of 1948 and previous to that, they were continually telling us the benefits of the Dignan plan and telling us that we should adopt it; that we should take all the other schemes away from the Department and bring them under the National Health Insurance Society giving them outside control, not bring the National Health Insurance Society under the control of the Department. I am wondering now if the Minister intends to go on as he has proposed.  I am quite sure he will, because it is the socialist idea, and I do not think the Minister will depart from the socialist idea that the Department should administer these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very pleasant to have to talk to a conscript audience, but I must continue.  When the Minister carries out his plan of having all these social welfare schemes, including national health insurance, administered by the Department, will the Clann na Poblachta Party, as has been customary with them for the past few months, turn their backs on their programme during the election of 1948 and agree that the Dignan plan should be dropped and that all these schemes, including national health insurance, should be administered by the Department? We will wait and see.  I have no hesitation in saying that I agree with the Minister that all the schemes should be administered by the one head.  I think that, weighing one thing against the other, the only satisfactory way of administering these schemes is by the Minister administering the whole lot as an amalgamated scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us what he proposes to do with regard to workmen's compensation.  That, again, gives rise to certain difficulties and, if the Minister has made up his mind, I should like him to give us some indication as to whether he thinks workmen's compensation, either in whole or in part, should come under the social welfare <Col N="1057" /> scheme.  Deputies know that, in workmen's compensation, using the word as a general term, there are two parts&mdash;the employer's liability and the liability at common law.  I should like to know whether the Minister would include in the comprehensive scheme these two parts, one part or none.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the third point I mentioned, a matter of considerable difficulty, the contributions.  When considering this matter in the Department &mdash;I do not say I found a solution, because it is not at all so easy to find a solution&mdash;I often thought that the present system of contributions, the employer contributing so much, the employees so much and the State so much, is not a fair system as between one employer and another.  I suppose, on strict theory, it cannot be said to be unfair as between one employee and another, although, in practice, it is no doubt much harder on the employee with the lower wage than on the employee with the higher wage.</P>
    <P>In the case of employers, there are two classes we must keep in mind&mdash;the employer who can pass the burden on in the price of his goods and the employer who cannot.  There are certain employers, like manufacturers and perhaps wholesalers and retailers, who, if they incur a higher cost of that kind, due to having to contribute more in the stamping of their employees' cards, can put the extra cost on to the price of their goods.  It makes no difference to them, so far as their profits are concerned, but there is a big class of employers who cannot do that, and included in these are the farmers. Everybody knows that the farmer has no control over what he charges for his goods.  His goods are sold either for the export market, the price on which market is fixed irrespective of his wishes, or at a fixed price for the home market.  Many such goods are controlled in that way&mdash;wheat, beet, butter, eggs and so on&mdash;and the farmer has no control over the prices.  If he has to contribute 3d. or 4d. more for each employee, as a result of a new comprehensive scheme of social welfare, he cannot pass the extra amount on.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned 3d. or 4d., but <Col N="1058" /> under a full comprehensive scheme, if the agricultural labourers are to be brought in for national health insurance purposes or for pension purposes, the amount may become very much higher.  The employer is not in a position to pass it on and it must therefore come out of whatever profits he has at the moment, so that certain employers are at a very serious disadvantage compared with others in that they are unable to pass on the burden.  I do not know what the custom is in the country generally, but, in many counties I know of, it has been the custom up to this for the farmer to stamp the card of his employee without stopping the 5d. per week from the employee, but if it becomes a matter of a 4/- stamp&mdash; roughly 2/- on the employer and 2/-on the employee&mdash;the employer may then say to the employee: &ldquo;I cannot afford any longer to pay it.  I shall have to stop 2/- from you.&rdquo;  If that occurs, the agricultural labourer will, for the first time, in a great part of the country, at any rate, be contributing to national health insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely not the first time for national health insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I cannot speak for the whole country, but, in many counties I know, farmers have always stamped their employees' cards in full without making any deduction, because it was merely a matter of 4d. or 5d., but what I am afraid of is that, if it becomes a substantial amount, the farmer will say to his employee: &ldquo;I shall have to deduct the amount in future because it is becoming substantial.&rdquo; If that happens we shall have to ask ourselves whether the agricultural labourer is in a position to contribute this amount out of his wage, which is not very substantial.  These are all questions which will arise with regard to contributions and I mention them now because they are matters which caused me a great deal of worry when I was in the Department.  I know that the Minister will experience a a great deal of trouble in trying to fix up these matters.  He cannot do it without hurting certain classes and certain people.  If big benefits are to be given, somebody will have to pay for them, and that is all there is about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> In connection with agricultural labourers, there is one point I would like to put to the Minister.  I do not know if it went on the official records&mdash; perhaps it did not, because, as the Minister will realise, I was talking to officials fairly freely about all these various schemes&mdash;but I suggested that we should consider at some stage the possibility of giving a better benefit to the agricultural labourer than we might give to other workers.  Whether that should be the agricultural labourer alone or everybody under £3 or £3 10s. per week, I do not know, but I thought something might be done for the lower-paid labourer as against the better-paid person.  I thought it might be possible to make a differentiation in children's allowances and to give a better benefit to the agricultural labourer by way of children's allowances than is given to the better-off workers.  If the Minister has not already come across that suggestion, I would like him to bear it in mind and to see if it could be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he set up a committee on emigration.  Again, the same as I have said already in regard to commissions of various kinds, applies.  The Minister is beginning to see that he can get advice from certain people and I hope he will get good advice on this particular matter.</P>

      <P>The question of social welfare has become one of the biggest questions in Government administration, especially from the financial point of view.  When we came into office, in 1932, it was not a very big matter.  At that time the State was contributing £4,000,000 per annum.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government had certain views on social services.  They had the view that people should be made to help themselves and to depend on themselves.  When we were in opposition, from 1927 to 1932, every year a motion was brought in by the Opposition, sometimes by the Labour Party, sometimes by the Fianna Fáil Party, urging the Government of the time to bring in a scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions.  The Cumann na <Col N="1060" /> nGaedheal Government voted it down every year, usually on the plea that the country could not afford it.  I mention that to give some indication of what the mentality of the Government of the time was.  They did not see that there was a necessity or, at any rate, they did not consider the necessity was sufficient to outweigh the financial considerations.  Every Deputy will remember that when that Government wanted to effect economies, one of the measures they adopted was to take 1/- off the old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>At that time there was no provision for the unemployed who were not insured under the unemployment insurance scheme and even those that were insured under that scheme, when their stamps ran out, go no further benefit. Motions were brought in here on various occasions to deal with this particular problem but nothing was done to relieve the distress which existed. The theory at the time was that if these people were in distress the local authority should relieve it.  There were no children's allowances at that time, and, as regards relieving this distress that I speak of, the amount voted each year was £150,000.  That was the position when we came into office in 1932.  We were spending £4,000,000 a year on social welfare.</P>
      <P>From that time on, there was very definite improvement.  The first Bill introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government was a Bill dealing with old age pensions.  It dealt principally with the qualifications a person should have to receive an old age pension.  That Bill was passed and, as a result, the amount paid in old age pensions increased by £500,000 per annum.  A free milk scheme was introduced and, after a few years, a scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions.  Then, assistance was brought in for the unemployed, for those who were not insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and also to relieve those whose stamps ran out.  That was known as the unemployment assistance scheme. Then a scheme was brought in for children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the children's allowances scheme is the only <Col N="1061" /> scheme in connection with which there is no means test.  It would be very interesting for new Deputies, if they want some education, to go over to the library and read the debates on the children's allowances scheme when it was introduced.  They will be surprised when they read the denunciation by the opposition Parties at that time of the Fianna Fáil Government because there was not a means test in the scheme. They will be surprised to hear the denunciation by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties of Fianna Fáil as a rich man's Government because they were giving children's allowance to the rich man as well as the poor man.  In other words, the only time that the means test was completely abolished we were denounced in no unmeasured terms by those Parties who now form the Government, and who are endeavouring to reduce the means test in other directions.  It just shows the changes that take place in Parties when they get away from opposition and take over the more responsible position of Government and have to be careful about what they say and what they do.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, there was a little more progress made.  There were various schemes brought in to meet the emergency.  These schemes were brought in because, when fuel and food came to be rationed, it was feared that the poor person might not get the same attention from the retailer as the rich. On that account more than anything else, and secondly, from the point of view of relieving distress, certain foods were given free to certain classes, such as old age pensioners, widows and orphans, recipients of home assistance, recipients of disablement benefit under the national health insurance scheme and classes of that kind.  They got a certain amount of butter, a certain amount of bread and a certain amount of milk each week.  In addition, something was done for these classes in the matter of fuel.  In some cases they got it free; in some cases they got it cheap. Then there was a scheme of footwear brought in for these classes when it was difficult for people to be supplied with footwear.  These, however, were principally emergency schemes.</P>
    <P>At any rate, with all these additions <Col N="1062" /> of schemes for social welfare, we find that in the year 1946-47, the bill to be paid by the State for social welfare was £9,000,000.  It had been £4,000,000 before we came into office in 1931-32. When the war ended, Deputies will remember, increases were given to all people who were paid by the State. Increases were given to practically all wage and salary earners employed by private individuals.  Something had to done for the recipients of the various social welfare allowances.  Early in 1947, the Government brought in a special measure to give increased contributions to all recipients under the various schemes of social welfare.  That cost about £2,250,000 last year.  In 1947-48 the total bill was £11,250,000, having gone up from £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>There was nothing to indicate that that was the end.  I had intended bringing before the Government, and with the Government's approval bringing before the Dáil, a comprehensive scheme; but I am prepared to admit now that the increased benefits would be largely contributory.  I never thought that we could reduce the amount contributed by the State last year.  I always thought that if we could get a scheme on the basis of the same State contribution, or even a little more, we would be doing very well.</P>
    <P>That was the position when the new Government took over.  Immediately, we find the Fine Gael mentality back again, and we start on the road back towards 1931.  When the Minister for Finance came in with his Budget, he talked about big economies, but in no Department did he make a bigger economy than in Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the first time since this State was set up that there was a reduction in the Vote for Social Welfare.  The Minister for Finance found the biggest economy there, when he took £950,000 off.  Some Deputies are, perhaps, not too familiar with the sums of money dealt with in the Budget as regards social welfare.  There is a widows' and orphans' pensions investment <Col N="1063" /> account, into which the State pays a certain amount each year.  Up to this, the State has never tried to balance it from year to year.  The hope was that we would put in more than we would take out, so that after some time there would be a substantial fund there, the proceeds of which would enable us to pay better benefits to the widows and orphans than they had been getting.  It was on that basis that we voted £450,000 a year into that fund. This year it was voted, as in every other year.  The Minister for Finance said in his Budget speech that the fund was actuarially sound without this £450,000.  That may be so, but we wanted to make it more than actuarially sound.  We were not content with the present pensions the widows and orphans were getting, and we hoped to build that fund up so that in, say, five years' time we could afford to pay bigger pensions to widows and orphans.  The Minister for Finance in his economy drive this year, directed, of course by the officials of the Department of Finance, put his eye on this £450,000 and took it away.</P>
      <P>There was hardly a year in the last ten or 12 that the Department of Finance did not propose to take this £450,000, but every year the Minister in charge&mdash;up to last year the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and afterwards the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;had resisted and had got the Government to side with him against the Minister for Finance and leave that money in the fund, so that we could do better some time. The present Minister for Social Welfare has the distinction of being the first Minister, since widows' and orphans' pensions were brought in, to give in on this question and allow that money to be taken out of the fund.  It is rather strange that it should be a Minister who was leader of the Labour Party who should be the first to agree with the Minister for Finance that that money was not necessary in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also agreed that some of these cash benefits that were given last year by the Exchequer, to supplement <Col N="1064" /> the benefits for national health insurance recipients and unemployment insurance recipients, should be made contributory&mdash;in other words, the State should no longer pay but the employer and employees should pay instead.  If the Minister has that view, I think it is a bit harsh.  It is the correct view in principle, but the Minister should not try to get away from the present contribution of the State.  He should let that stand and add on whatever is necessary for a comprehensive scheme, by contributions from employers and employees.  When he can produce a satisfactory scheme from the point of view of benefits, it will put very heavy burdens on employers and employees, without taking anything off the present contributions from the State.</P>
    <P>That was £950,000 saved from the Social Welfare Vote.  On the other side of the balance sheet, the Minister announced that he would have to pay out £600,000 for increased benefits for old age pensioners and widows and orphans.  These increased benefits will be better analysed when we get the Bill that the Minister has introduced and which we expect to have in our hands next Friday.  We cannot intelligently, at this stage, discuss how that £600,000 is to be spent.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the history of social welfare for the last 20 years and I want Deputies to bear in mind the figures I mentioned of £4,000,000 in 1931-32, £9,000,000 in 1946-47, and £11,250,000 last year.  Now we are beginning to go back towards the £4,000,000 in 1931-32.  Take old age pensions as an example.  There is no other class who has such sympathy from the various Parties as the old age pensioners.  The old age pensioners had 10/- a week before the previous Government came in.  The pension remained at 10/- until the beginning of the last financial year.  Although the year before that Government came in £2,750,000 was paid out to old age pensioners, the amount in 1946-47, before we brought in our supplementary allowances, was £3,750,000.  It had gone up from £2,750,000 to £3,750,000 principally because it was easier for a person to get a pension.  In other words, the means test was not applied in the <Col N="1065" /> same rigorous way.  Then last year, when these supplementary allowances were brought in, the expenditure went up to £5,140,000.  Therefore, on that one item alone the amount spent last year was almost double what was spent in 1931-32.  The Minister is going to make an improvement there and he will have the support of the House in so far as that goes.  I am sure the only criticism that the Minister will get when he brings in his scheme is that he is not doing enough, because that will practically always be the criticism of a Minister for Social Welfare in this House or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>What I want to know, however, is how Parties here can reconcile their policy with the proposals now being put before the House or the proposals which are not being put before the House by the Minister.  The National Labour Party, for instance, took their decision after the election on the plea that Fianna Fáil was not doing enough for social welfare.  The only difference between us is that the Minister is bringing in a White Paper in three or four months' time, and that I believe we would have brought in a White Paper two or three months ago.  The National Labour Party are perhaps justifying themselves on the plea that they are backing a slower but maybe a surer horse.  We will see whether it is surer or not, but it is slower.  When the Minister brings forward his proposals, we will be able to see whether it is surer.  We will be in a position to see whether we could have put before the Dáil better proposals than the present Minister when he comes here with his White Paper.  The new proposals which the Minister mentioned in his introductory speech will be more clearly set out in the Bill which we expect to see in a few days' time and we will, therefore, be in a position to discuss the matter next week more intelligently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention in the first instance to the conditions under which men are employed in the labour exchanges both as messengers and temporary clerks. Some years ago an examination was held to enable temporary clerks to be <Col N="1066" /> established.  That was a fairly stiff examination and a very limited number of those who had given good service for many years qualified at that examination. They had however, to be under 50 years of age to secure establishment so that those over 50 were not entitled to be established.  Those people who had given long service in such a difficult position I hold were entitled to some recognition for the service which they had given.  They were drawn from commercial pursuits of one kind or another and had a very difficult job in dealing with the numbers of unemployed.  They endured the hardship of being dismissed themselves when the period Orders came into operation, so that one day they were administering the unemployment benefit service from behind the hatch and the next day they were in the unemployment queue themselves.  In that way it was difficult to maintain discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limited number who secured establishment are not entitled to have their previous service reckoned for pension purposes.  I suggest that regard should be had to the years of service given by these men and that whether or not they passed an examination they ought to be considered and established so that they will not be subject to unemployment when the period Orders come into force.  In that way you will secure more efficient service and more satisfaction amongst the staff.  A dissatisfied staff cannot be expected to give of their best. These men are subject to the taunt from people outside the hatch: &ldquo;You need not be quite so stiff to-day because you will be joining the unemployment queue yourself to-morrow.&rdquo; That is not good for the service and it is a great hardship to these people. The salary or wages given to these men is of the meanest kind.  While they were entitled to get a small annual increment after passing the examination, prior to that their status had been reduced.  If I remember rightly, some years ago they were reduced from 46/- to 39/-.  They have advanced by slow stages since then.  I do not think their conditions would compare favourably with those in any <Col N="1067" /> other similar employment in the State. I, therefore, ask the Minister to look into the position of the temporary clerks in labour exchanges so as to bring their conditions into alignment with the importance of the service they are carrying out.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the case of messengers who are doing semi-clerical work calls for examination and revision.  The Minister ought to be in the position of a model employer and should not be liable to be taunted with having to stand over conditions such as these. Men who have given long service in the capacity of messengers doing semi-clerical work ought at least to be put on an established basis with such privileges as it would bring them. That would only be performing an act of justice and would make for more efficiency in that particular section of the service.  These men are almost comparable with the temporary clerks and I think I am doing no harm in directing attention to the matter.  The Minister should see that a modicum of justice is extended to the temporary clerks and messengers.</P>
    <P>There are some other anomalies in connection with that particular Department.  In many cases a widower is depending on the services of his daughter.  Where a man has a daughter or somebody else taking charge of his family he ought to be treated in the same way as a man whose wife is alive. He cannot be classed in the same category as a single man.  He has lost his wife and because his wife is gone there is no question of dependency in respect of any other female who may be looking after his children.  I may not be in order in discussing this matter because it may call for an amendment of the Act but it is an anomaly that calls for attention and revision at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I regret that the ex-Minister is worried about the delay in the issue of a White Paper in regard to a long overdue measure of relief for the people of the country in the matter of social services. Deputy Dr. Ryan tells us that had he remained in office the chances are that the White Paper would have been issued some months ago.  He very <Col N="1068" /> conveniently forgets that Fianna Fáil had 16 years in which to produce that White Paper or to introduce some measure of a constructive character in regard to social services.  It is surely bordering on being childish to complain in August, 1948, that they did not have sufficient time since January, 1932, to do so and that the present Minister is somewhat delayed in producing his proposals which are now before the House.  This new proposal foreshadows a modicum of relief but it is not as much as I would wish for.  At the same time, I believe that it is as much as can be expected in the circumstances that are now obtaining.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister upon the progress he has made in the short time he is in office.  That progress is, I trust, an indication of better things to come.  I assure the Minister of my wholehearted support in his endeavour to bring the social standards of our people into alignment with those of progressive peoples throughout the world to-day.  Our people would be prepared to wait another few months, if necessary, 16 months, after having waited 16 years.  I am glad the Minister has taken time by the forelock in his desire to bring about an improvement in our social services by introducing this measure in this House now. I wish him God speed and every success in his Department and in his important undertaking.</P>

      <P>I had not really intended to intervene in this debate, but I have been shocked to my feet by what the last Deputy has said.  He said that Fianna Fáil did nothing for 16 years. Neither he nor any Labour Party Deputy was in the House while the ex-Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, made his speech.  In that speech he pointed out that during the 17 years Fianna Fáil was in office social services mounted from £4,000,000 to £11,000,000.  Yet we are told immediately afterwards that we did nothing in regard to social services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had an opportunity of discussing the post office service yesterday.  I do not know why he should have been absent then any more than why he was absent to-day when the discussion on social services began.  He was not here even to support his own Minister. I would point out that the social services were a growth.  The items increased in amount and then it became perfectly clear&mdash;owing to Fianna Fáil Government policy&mdash;that it was necessary to make a separate Department in respect of that important development. During the war period, owing to the emergency and the amount of money that had to be spent on defence, it was not possible to put that decision into effect until two years ago.  It then took time to organise the Department. The present Government Parties should stop using as an argument the old cry of: &ldquo;Why was nothing done in the last 16 years?&rdquo;  There is an answer every time, but one becomes weary repeating it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put before the Minister a particular matter in regard to employment exchanges.  I understand that there is a system of payment of people in some of these unemployment exchanges throughout the country whereby the staff really depends on the number of people who sign on.  I have actually been informed of cases where men, engaged in work during the day, report to the employment exchange at night and sign on. I am told that that is being done to maintain the numbers on the register for some particular staff purpose that I cannot understand.  I mention that point to the Minister so that the matter may be investigated.  I understand that it is happening in some rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter in connection with unemployment assistance, which has come to my notice, is the practice of stopping the payments.  I am aware of <Col N="1070" /> a number of cases where that has happened to individuals.  They appeal against the decision and they then have to appear before a referee.  They are told that they must find employment within a certain space of time or that the payments will be discontinued for a certain period.  I am not altogether sure of the length of time during which no payments are made, but I think it is a month, two months or six weeks.  That has happened in cases of persons physically unfit to work.  I consider that system objectionable.  In one case, which I referred to the Minister, the individual concerned was a man with only one leg.  As a result of the Minister's investigations that man was reinstated but the system as it is at the moment is such that a man will be told that he must find employment within a certain space of time or that if he does not he will be knocked off unemployment assistance for a certain period.  I respectfully submit that that is wrong and that the Minister should take steps to see that the practice is stopped as soon as possible.  I do not know what the machinery is in this respect.  I do not know whether a permanent referee or umpire is available or whether that job in the Dublin area is allocated amongst a number of people.  There is, however, a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst recipients of unemployment assistance in regard to the way in which they are being treated at the final hearing of their cases.  It has been suggested to me that the suggestion has been thrown out that, after all, if they cannot find employment in Ireland there is always Britain across the way.  I am quite sure that the Minister would not stand for that.  If that system has grown up in Department of Social Welfare I feel sure that it is only necessary to call the attention of the Minister to it and that an end will be put to it.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Keyes in congratulating the Minister on the excellent work he has done within a very short period.  I am satisfied that while we have a Minister of the calibre and ability and sympathy of Deputy Norton in charge of the Department of Social Welfare all these problems, about which there has been such <Col N="1071" /> grievance and discontent in the past, will be resolved satisfactorily in a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of any extension of social services.  I hope that the new Bill will meet with success.  I would like to take this opportunity, however, of pointing out to the Minister some grievances which exist.  It is quite true to say that Section 7 of the Old Age Pensions Act died in 1932.  That was no harm.  It is now as dead as Queen Victoria.  I have always felt that the 1932 amendment did not go quite far enough. Under the present system, when a farm is transferred on the marriage of the eldest son, the father is entitled to the old age pension as a result of such transfer.  What about those people who cannot afford to transfer?  In the case of the small farmer with three or four sons and a couple of daughters, the question arises as to whom he will transfer.  The position is that he is not able to transfer and he cannot, therefore, qualify for a pension.  The better-off farmer, on the other hand, who can provide for his family, can transfer his holding on the occasion of a marriage and thereby qualify for a pension.  Side by side you have the anomalous position of two small farmers, one in comfortable circumstances drawing the full pension and the other, in somewhat indigent circumstances, unqualified for a pension. I would ask the Minister to extend the Act so that there can even be a subsequent transfer if necessary.  There are many cases where farmers cannot make alternative provision for other members of their family and are unable to transfer their farms to their sons who get married.  The people-in-law may not approve of the conditions obtaining in such households and they may not be too anxious for their daughters to take up residence there. That is a grievance that exists and it may possibly have repercussions on the marriage rate.  I hope the Minister will take some steps to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, you have the anomalous position that the value of the labour <Col N="1072" /> rendered by the family is never fully assessed.  Surely, a farmer should be allowed the full wages for his sons.  In many cases of which I know the sons are working overtime, draining the land and so on.  They work as hard and do as much labour as any agricultural worker.  Nevertheless, because they are sons the full value of their labour is not assessed.  I hope that grievance will be remedied.</P>
    <P>I think the blind are entitled to the sympathy of everybody.  I am certain that every Deputy is anxious to do the most he can for these unfortunate people. I think that a blind person is just as much in need of a pension at 21 years of age as at 30 years of age. They are as great a &ldquo;drag&rdquo; on the family at 20 as they are at 30.  I would like the pension made available to them at 21 years of age and, if possible, even earlier.  These are afflicted people who call for the sympathy of everybody.</P>
    <P>Under the old age pension code at the moment we are actually depriving this State of certain moneys.  We do that in the case of British ex-servicemen and in the case of old people here who receive help from sons or daughters abroad.  Under the means test these moneys are taken into consideration. The result is that in order that the old people will receive full pension the sons and daughters cease to send any help. I think that moneys received from outside the State should not be taken into calculation, because by that means we are keeping money out of this country. In the case of the British ex-servicemen the British Government reduces the pension to £15 12s. 6d. so that the recipient will be entitled to the maximum pension here.  I think that that is a bad policy from our point of view.</P>
    <P>With regard to national health insurance, the position has been improved considerably.  Sickness benefit has been improved by 50 per cent. and disablement benefit by 100 per cent.  I think the Minister should wipe out disablement benefit altogether.  It is hardly likely that a man's financial position will have improved at the end of six months' illness.  I think it is everybody's experience that the position <Col N="1073" /> deteriorates in that respect.  I think disablement benefit should be wiped out altogether and sickness benefit continued.  Another section of the community affected under insurance is that of the voluntary contributors. Assuming that the amount may increase to 4/- per week, the voluntary contributor would have to meet 44 contributions at 4/- per week.  In the case of people who have been in employment for 15, 20 or 30 years and who, for any reason, find themselves unable to contribute for more than one year, membership lapses.  I hope that period of free insurance will be extended to at least two years.  Some of the people who might leave the country and who are, perhaps, in receipt of unemployment benefit, will find that after one year they are entirely debarred from further benefit and they have to start afresh. That is hardly fair.  When you think that persons after 204 contributions become eligible for all benefits, additional or otherwise, it is very unfair that those who have paid such a generous contribution for many years should be entirely debarred.  The Minister should extend that period of insurance at least to two years.</P>
    <P>There are many people who are members of the National Health Insurance Society and they do not play their part.  If the employer makes himself liable to the law because of late stamping or not stamping, I believe if you are to have a real success of this scheme you must insist that the insured person will also be liable to the law.  It is quite true that he is to a certain extent, but if you were to prosecute a member for failing to produce his card you would in effect be doing away with the only evidence you could have on a future occasion.  I hope members who try to evade the law will be brought within the scope of the new measure, which, I hope, will be passed very soon.</P>
    <P>I will make a brief reference to children's allowances.  I feel that the first child in the family is as much entitled to receive the 2/6 as the third. There are many people through the country who cannot see why the parents of two children are debarred from <Col N="1074" /> receiving benefit.  That should not be. I will ask the Minister to consider that in his new Bill.  Deputies on this side of the House will be only too glad to help him.  We wish him God speed in his efforts to establish a comprehensive social insurance scheme.  We only hope that it will be what we desire and what everybody in the country desires.</P>
    <P>As regards blind persons and old age pensioners, we hope the law will be extended so that any person who has lived to such a great age and worked well for the country may rest assured that in the future he will be entitled to State assistance.  Unfortunately, there are many people who, because of the hard work they have to do through life, do not reach 70 years.  Let us assure those who do reach that age that they will be entitled to the benefits of the Old Age Pension Acts without any danger of a rigorous means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I and other members of the House congratulate the Minister on the work he has accomplished since he took office.  I congratulate him heartily on his pronouncements and the hopes he has held out to many of our people who are suffering great hardships.  As a result of his efforts I feel confident that many of these hardships will be relieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to make an inquiry into the conditions of lowly paid workers in his own Department. A month or two ago I heard that there were temporary clerks in his Department with £4 a week&mdash;married men with families, paying high rents and suffering great hardship because they have to live up to and dress the part of being a clerical worker in the Minister's Department.  No doubt he can readily understand the difficulty that type of individual will have in looking the part of a departmental clerk and at the same time keeping his rent paid up and his family in frugal comfort.  I hope the Minister will consider these young men.  There are others besides the temporary clerks, men such as door porters, messengers and those engaged in handling stores&mdash; stationery of some kind.  Numbers of these people are on small wages.  I do <Col N="1075" /> not want to single out the Minister's Department in this connection.  I understand that the same applies in all Government Departments.  There are lowly paid messengers and storemen, temporary officials who get £4 or £4 1s. a week.  There are also customs watchers at the North Wall, temporary men sent in to do that work.  I feel confident that it is the Minister's earnest desire to see that those who have grievances will have their grievances removed.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates, at the bottom of every page, you will see something like this: &ldquo;Four temporary messengers are in receipt of military service pensions of £65, £68, £50 and £70.&rdquo;  These are men who served in the National Army or in the I.R.A. They are getting merely what they earned by their services to the country, services that brought about this Parliament and placed us here.  Why do the Government take advantage of a man's pension, whether from the National Army or elsewhere?  Why not allow them to go to more than a certain figure?  Men who served in the I.R.A. were definitely entitled to the work they got in various Government Departments.  When there is an increase in pay, these men get it, but their military service pensions should not be reduced by the amount they receive in their Department.  I believe a number of men will get the 11/-increase and maybe a little more in the Minister's Department, but here is a case that will interest the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with the military service pension being paid to you by this Department, I am directed by the Minister for... to state that a return has now been received from the Department of ... from which it appears that your receipts from public funds for the financial year ended 31st March last amounted to £276 5s. 0d.  As a consequence, the net amount of pension to which you were entitled in the year, having regard to the provisions of Section 8 (1) and the Third Schedule to the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, was £33 9s. 2d.  You have actually been paid £37 3s. 7d.  Your account <Col N="1076" /> is thus overpaid to the extent of £3 14s. 5d., which will be adjusted in the payment of your pension for June, 1948.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would not be surprised if there were three or four others of that type in the Minister's Department.  The letter I received reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am in receipt of a military service pension and I find under subsection (8) of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, that I am only allowed to earn £250 per year without deduction.  Would you kindly use your good offices to have the matter raised and the amount brought up to £300 per year, as it will affect every man with such a pension in Government employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should look into the matter.  I received letters also from men in the customs and excise service who received £3 19s 0d. for a 48-hour week. All these men served the country, but are prevented from getting the increase which the Minister so earnestly desires to give them.  The position is that when they get an increase, benefit of it is taken away in another way. The Minister has made a good beginning in the Department and I hope he will see that the remuneration of underpaid officials to which I have referred will be brought up to a reasonable standard and enable them to keep their families in comfort.</P>
    <P>I apologise for having raised these points on this Estimate, seeing that it also concerns other Departments, but the fact that these men served the country tells against them when they are granted a bonus.  The benefit is taken from them in another way.  I know that in appealing to the Minister I am appealing to the converted, and that very little pressure is required to get him to take action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the congratulations to the present Minister for Social Welfare concerning the steps he has taken in this important matter.  Whatever differences we may have we are told that we want to work until a stage is reached when social <Col N="1077" /> services will not be necessary.  Personally, I think it will always be necessary for the State to protect the weak against the strong.  I am concerned principally with the administration of the social services, in so far as they affect people in the rural areas of County Dublin and throughout the country.  I felt for a long time&mdash;and I think my view is shared by many people&mdash;that the national health insurance scheme, as it applies to the rural areas, was badly administered and, not alone that, but represents, as far as agricultural workers are concerned, a complete waste of money.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where the wife of an agricultural labourer has been in hospital for a number of weeks.  She had been working before going to hospital in order to supplement the income, so that the family might be able to live. Everybody knows that an agricultural worker is not able to keep his family on his earnings.  Consequently the wives have to work.  In the case I am referring to the woman was in hospital for six weeks without getting benefit.  That case could be extended a thousandfold. I have often felt that there has been great laxity at the headquarters of the National Health Insurance Society in dealing with claims.  There was not evident that desire that should be there to deal speedily with applications.  This subject could be spoken on at great length but I do not propose to take the time of the House in doing so now. There will be other opportunities for discussing the new developments that will come under the ægis of the present Minister.  I do not propose to do what some Deputies in opposition succeeded in doing, to refer to legislation.  It was amazing to observe how concerned opposition Deputies were about the social services, when it is remembered that it is not so very long ago that the previous Government voted against an increase to old age pensioners.  It is rather late in the day now for them to concern themselves with that particular subject.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the <Col N="1078" /> Department is now in safe hands, in fact, in the most capable hands that it could be in.  I appeal to the Minister, especially when envisaging new legislation, to give particular attention to the position of agricultural workers who have hitherto been so badly treated.  Deductions that have been made from their wages for national health insurance and for unemployment assistance represented a complete waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the position of men who have to attend at the labour exchange and whose unemployed assistance is cut off if they get work after signing the register and fail to report the fact.  Would it be possible for the Minister to allow local managers to deal with such cases on the merits? If they are capable of being managers these officials should be able to take a business-like view in such cases, so that applicants would not be deprived of assistance for some weeks.  Of course, the applicants have the alternative of home assistance but, as the Minister knows, that entails delay.  I ask the Minister to bear the matter in mind and to see if he could devise some other means of dealing with cases of the type referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is not unaware of cases of old age pensioners who find difficulty in getting fair consideration of their claims.  I suggest that there should be a reconsideration of the means test.  I admit quite frankly that the Minister cannot be fully aware of what is happening. It appears to me that those in charge of that section of the Department are against all types of claims from rural districts.  For instance, in the case of a small farmer, who applies for a pension, the officials are inclined to take a very drastic view of the man's means, as against the attitude they adopt <Col N="1079" /> towards those living in towns.  If such an approach is maintained by that section of the Department, even with new legislation and the new environment, the position will remain as it is. I could quote cases of small farmers in the mountains of Kerry with valuations of £3, £4 and £5, adversely affected by the present regulations. The pension officer recommended 5/-in these cases, but the Department were very slow to acquiesce in that, whereas, in my previous experience of the Department I found that instead of bringing the pension down to the level recommended by the pensions officer, the chief appeals officer was always inclined to give the benefit of any doubt to the applicant and even to increase the amount granted by the pensions officer.  That is not the case at the moment.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the Employment Period Order.  I admit that the Minister had nothing to do with that, that it was provided for in previous legislation, and that the Order was taken for granted, as had happened in previous years.  In Kerry, however, the cessation or postponement of turf schemes has resulted in numbers of men being thrown out of employment.  Men who were in receipt of unemployment assistance in previous years were able to get employment on these small schemes, but at the moment they cannot find any such employment.  I tabled a question here recently on the matter, and although the Minister was very sympathetic, and I know he would be inclined to do his utmost to help these people, unfortunately, under the arrangements that were in existence from previous years, he could not, under existing legislation, alter the operation of the Employment Period Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked, and I ask again, why these men are deprived of unemployment assistance if they cannot get work at the moment.  Bord na Móna has come to their rescue in certain sections of the county and has employed some of these men since I <Col N="1080" /> raised the question, but there are other parts of the county where these men cannot get work and where they will not be given unemployment assistance. They are faced with the position of becoming totally destitute.  They are mostly cottiers or workers in poor circumstances, men who cannot carry on if they are not given employment. They are anxious to obtain employment and do not want to be a burden on the State if they can avoid it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good offices with the Minister for Local Government to compel the county surveyor in Kerry&mdash;and I use that word &ldquo;compel&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;to give them employment.  Under the system which is adopted in that district at the moment there is no break at all for the poor man or the working man.  If I have to table 100 questions, I shall expose the system that is being operated at the moment and get fair play for these people.  I pay this tribute to the Minister, that when I approached him he said quite frankly that he was never in favour of the Employment Period Order, and that when a man could not get work, it was imperative on the State to come to his assistance.</P>

This cult which denies the very existence <Col N="1082" /> of God and the immortality of the soul, was raising its superstructure on the necessities of the poor who had been neglected by every Government until the present Government came along.  There seems to be a peculiar anomaly in the administration of the old age pensions which I hope will be rectified.  If a farmer passes his land on to his son, he will be maintained by that son and he may have £600 in the bank.  He and his wife are, on application, entitled to the maximum old age pension.  Take, on the other hand, the case of a worker.  Here is a case which came to my notice recently.  The man is 69 years of age. He suffers from attacks of rheumatism occasionally.  The wife is 72.  Even though the husband suffers from a physical disability he takes work from time to time on the roads in order to earn enough to provide food for the two of them.  Due to that fact, his wife is excluded, through the operation of the means test, from getting the old age pension.</P>
      <P>Is that not rather strange in view of the fact that a farmer who is being maintained in comfort by his son, and who may have £600 in the bank, is not only entitled in law to the old age pension of 10/- a week, but that his wife is similarly entitled to it.  I have given the case of that worker which came before the old age pension committee recently.  In passing, I may say that these committees, as well as the county councils, ought to be abolished because the members have no powers. There is no equity or justice in treating a poor worker in the way that I have indicated.  I join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister.  He is doing God's work by introducing legislation which will carry out the dictum of Him who said: &ldquo;When you did it to the least of these My brethren you did it unto Me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is gearr an tam a chaithfhidh mé ar an Vota seo.  Níl ach cúpla focal le rá agam mar gheall air.  Deputy Madden had the cheek to talk about tackling the social services. We had that from the supporter of a Party whose leader laid down the axiom that social services <Col N="1083" /> were an evil, and whose Minister for Finance had been denouncing them for a number of years past.  Then he brought in scriptural quotations.  It was amusing to hear Deputy Dunne address himself to the question of social services, since he must know that the facts were contrary to what he stated.  He referred to our lack of interest in the social services.  Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out that when we came into office the expenditure on social services was in or about £4,000,000, and that when he left office it was £11,250,000.  These Deputies will find that when the Minister sets about improving the social services further he will have to go to the pockets of the contributors and the beneficiaries and levy a big stamp tax on them in order to do so.  If these services are to be doubled and trebled, as the Minister's programme indicates, the cost will have to be borne by the beneficiaries and by the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with an Order which was made by the Minister when he came into office.  It abolished an Order that was made three and a half years ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government at that time, which did away with unnecessary interviews with Deputies at the Custom House about old age pensions. I think that was one of the most progressive Orders that had been made for years.  Before that one-third of the time of the principal officers in the then Department of Local Government was taken up with these unnecessary interviews.  The making of this new Order, abolishing the older one, was in my opinion a retrograde step.  It will mean that you will have competition amongst Deputies in regard to old age pension claims.  Take a five-member constituency.  It will now be found that not only are the services of one Deputy yoked up on behalf of an old age pension applicant, but that the services of the other four T.D.'s are likewise being yoked up, so that you will have the five of them going to the Custom House.  I hope to see the day when the Minister will change his new Order, and when an old age pension claimant will be able to get his pension <Col N="1084" /> and will have the same right as another man has to-day to go to a labour exchange office to draw his unemployment insurance benefit.  The old age pensioner should have that right without all this political interviewing by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the means test.  It is a very arguable and debatable subject.  I do not believe in giving a pension, whether it be 10/- or 15/- a week to a man who, say, has £5,000 a year.  There has to be some kind of a means test.  I understand from the former Minister that if we had been returned to power it was his intention to modify the means test and to draw a certain line in regard to valuations, particularly in the rural areas, below which a man or a woman could get the old age pension automatically, irrespective of whether a farm of land was well managed or badly managed.  I would agree with that.</P>
    <P>I would also agree with raising the amount of income at which a person could get the old age pension.  My colleague, Deputy Davern, was on a particularly ticklish subject.  I do not agree with what he said when dealing with British ex-servicemen or with the case of a man having an income from outside the State.  What about the day when you will have to deal with our own ex-servicemen who will have pensions here?  I think the Minister has his own particular outlook on this means test.  As long as it obtains, I think my colleague was on very dangerous grounds when talking about incomes derived by people from outside the State.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the action of the Minister in passing on the cost of the food vouchers to the local authorities.  I do not believe in the policy of saving and economising at the top and then putting additional burdens on the local authorities.  I think that is all wrong.  I believe that the cost of social services should, as far as possible, be borne by the central authority.  I do agree with a point that was made by Deputy Dunne&mdash;although I hate to agree with him on anything, he is so prejudiced <Col N="1085" /> against anything Fianna Fáil did and is so anti-Fianna Fáil in his outlook&mdash; about the delay that occurs in administering national health insurance.  He referred to the case of a person who was six weeks in hospital and to other similar cases all over the country.  If the Minister would tighten up or improve the regulations so that benefit would come to the sick more quickly, he would be doing a service that would be appreciated by everybody.  I do not think that there is any other matter I want to refer to beyond repeating what I said before, that the Minister took a step in the wrong direction when he started to trot to the Custom House again over the old age pensions. I hope he will change that.  It was just a matter of who would spin the best lie to the Custom House officer or who would best pull the wool over him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons prompting me to intervene in the debate is, as a labour man, to say how proud I am to see social welfare in the hands of the present Minister.  Those of us who know the lifetime of study he has given to the subject of which he is now in charge, understand that it is in the best hands possible in the country. I understand that attention was drawn some hours ago to the fact that no Labour Deputy was present during the discussion on social welfare.  The reason for that might well be that we feel that while the present Minister is in charge of social welfare we can leave it in his hands with complete and absolute confidence, feeling sure that the people he is responsible for will indeed be looked after and that social welfare will be a reality, not a name alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one or two points connected with national health.  As an agent who has had eight years' experience of national health work, I feel that there may be some little things from an agent's point of view which the Minister could not get even from the highest officials of that society.  I would suggest with regard to optical benefits that the Minister should ask the health people to have the centres of examination much <Col N="1086" /> nearer.  I will give one instance in my own town of Dungarvan.  A workman made application for optical benefit. When it was granted he had to proceed to Waterford by bus and stay there for the complete day.  He had to pay £1 1s. fee, he lost his day's pay, and the bus journey back and forth cost roughly 7/6.  The same amount of money being available, a workman could have a private doctor or an eye specialist in our own town.  The aim of the national health system was to make it easy for people to have their eyes tested at home so that they would be induced to do that rather than delay as in the past.  I would suggest that specialists should travel to various centres so that the workman would not have to lose a day's pay or travel by bus or train.  I know it would be impossible to bring it to everyone's door, but in my own district the only centre is the City of Waterford, 30 miles away from many members of the society, meaning the loss of a complete day from work.  I would suggest that the Minister should recommend the Society to look into this.</P>
    <P>The majority of national health agents, on whom the whole work of national health devolves, are classed as part-time agents and most county agents are paid on a card basis.  Much of the delay that Deputy Dunne and others complained about depends on that fact.  Those people get the miserable wage of roughly £2 or £3 a week. If they post on Monday and a claim comes in on Tuesday they will not naturally post again until the following Monday, causing a whole week's delay, whereas if they got postage allowances it would take away that week's delay.</P>
    <P>A great many of the national health forms use such complicated language that the workman does not understand them.  There is no necessity for these complicated forms.  Many forms go up and come back again to be refilled.  I will give one instance from the claim form for ordinary sickness benefit.  One question is: &ldquo;What is your remuneration?&rdquo; I, as an agent with eight years' experience, found that 80 per cent. of the people did not understand that.  If it said: &ldquo;What is your weekly wage?&rdquo; however, they would understand.  In <Col N="1087" /> very many forms you have complete complication and it is very difficult to get the forms filled up competently. Sometimes I filled them myself and got them signed.  We were not supposed to do that, but we had to do it if we were to get benefits for the people.</P>
    <P>The revenue brought in to national health insurance could be increased if what I suggest is adopted.  The revenue is from stamps and there is a considerable amount of non-stamping all over the country.  I found that as an agent, but I found, if I checked up on an employer, that an employer who put two stamps on a card was of as much value to me&mdash;I got 1/- a year for each &mdash;as if he had put on the full 22, so there was no inducement to me to go after such an employer.  It was only loss of time and money to me to get the full facts and send them to Dublin when I got nothing out of it.  The greatest driving force for most of us is what we are going to get out of it.  If the agent got a percentage of the fine for non-compliance with national health, national health would get much more dividends than by continuing in the old way.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that agents should get franked envelopes and overcome the laborious duty of cycling to the various people.  Surely that would not be too much.  I understood when I took over the position of national health agent that I was doing practically Government work, but to my surprise on every form or letter&mdash;which was absolutely State business&mdash;I had to pay 2½d.  Needless to say, we accumulated all our correspondence and left queries, questions and claims for two or three weeks, and only gave them out when we had enough to justify a visit to the place in question.</P>

      <P>I understand that Deputy Keyes stated that during the whole period Fianna Fáil were in power nothing had been done for social services.  There is nobody who can know better than Deputy Keyes that that is a grossly inaccurate statement. One of the Votes for which the Minister is responsible is the Vote for widows' and orphans' pensions, passed in this House in the year 1935, when Fianna Fáil had an over-all majority and owed nothing to the support it got from Deputy Keyes.  The same applies to the Unemployment Assistance Act; the same applies to the increases under the Old Age Pensions Acts; and the same applies to the Children's Allowances Act.  These Acts were all passed by the Fianna Fáil Government during the period when it had an over-all majority in this House, and, if there is a Minister for Social Welfare here to-day, he is here to-day because the Fianna Fáil Government established that Ministry in the teeth of the bitter opposition of those who are now his colleagues in the Government.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Kyne, who is a newcomer to this House, wants to know the truth in this matter, let him read the debates on the Bill which amended the Ministers and Secretaries Act in order to enable the Department of Social Welfare to be set up.  He will find there that that measure was opposed by the present Minister for Education, whom Deputy Kyne supports in this House and whom he has made Minister for Education, by the present Minister for Defence who led the attack upon the proposal and whom he supports as Minister for Defence.  He will find that it was voted against by the present Minister for Agriculture, the present Minister for Justice&mdash;by every one of the Fine Gael front-benchers of that day.  Yet he is sitting check by jowl with them and prating here about how little was done by the Fianna Fáil Government for the social welfare of the people.  If we were not able to do as much as we desired to do, that is due to the fact that we were opposed in everything we tried to do by the gentlemen opposite, supported on many occasions by the members of the so-called Irish Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> What are we going to do to-day under this Minister?  We are going to pass an amended Estimate for Vote 27, the Vote which deals with the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Investment Fund.  If Deputy Kyne and Deputy Keyes will go to the Library and consult the Volume of Estimates, prepared, as we are told so often, by the Fianna Fáil Government, they will find that that Vote was for £960,000, almost £1,000,000 of public money for widows' and orphans' pensions.  Let them read the revised Estimate presented by this Minister and what will they see?  They will see that sub-head A, which provided for a payment to the Pensions Investment Fund of £450,000, has been wiped out, and that, instead of providing £960,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, the House under this Minister is asked to provide only £510,000. Which was the greater contribution to the social welfare of the widow and the orphan about whom Deputy Kyne was bleating a few minutes ago?  The policy of the present Minister, dictated, I suppose, by the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, represents nothing more than a raid upon the Pensions Investment Fund which has been built up by the surplus contributions of the workers.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kyne may know, the widows' and orphans' pension code provides for two different sets of pensions. One of these is the contributory pension, where the pension is paid to the widow and to the orphan child as of right, by reason of the contributions paid by the breadwinner when he was alive and in employment here.  In the year 1937, the first year in which the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act was in full operation, the non-contributory pensions, the pensions which are the proper liability of the State, cost £258,000.  The contributory pensions cost £27,000, but, in respect of these contributory pensions the workers paid £551,900.  There was a surplus in that year of contributions over pensions, amounting to £524,000. In the year 1943&mdash;naturally, as time went on, the surplus of contributions over expenditure decreased&mdash;the non-contributory pensions cost had jumped to £432,000.  The cost of the contributory <Col N="1090" /> pensions had likewise gone up to £297,000, but in that year the workers contributions amounted to £605,000, so that there was a surplus of workers' contributions over workers' contributory pensions of £307,000.</P>
    <P>The actuary in 1943 made an estimate of what the position was going to be in 1946.  I have not been able to get the actual figures from the Minister, but, according to the actuary the non-contributory pensions in 1946 should have cost about £402,000 and expenses of administration should amount to £80,000.  Of that £80,000, fully three-quarters is due to the cost of administering the non-contributory scheme, because that scheme involves a means test which involves inquiry and investigation, and, therefore, costs a great deal to administer.  The contributory scheme, on the other hand, costs very little to administer, but the total cost, we may take it, of the non-contributory pension scheme in 1946 would be £462,000.  The £450,000 which the present Minister is filching from the Pensions Investment Fund could not have paid the total cost of the non-contributory pensions in the year 1946. They amount to £462,000, with the costs of administration.  In that year the contributory pensions for widows' and orphans' pensions and so on cost only £408,000, and the contributions income amounted to £605,000, plus an income derived from the Pensions Investment Fund of £150,000, making the total receipts on the contributory side not less than £765,000, and against which we have to place, as I have said, the cost of contributory pensions amounting to £408,000, so that, in 1946, on the contributory side of the scheme, there ought to have been a surplus of roughly £357,000.</P>
    <P>In the year 1956 the position was going to change, however, because in that year the cost of the contributory pensions would be £646,000, and the contribution income would bring in only £605,000, so, for the first time in all this great number of years, the income from the Pensions Investment Fund would have to provide the balance of the cost of the contributory pensions.  Again, on the other hand, <Col N="1091" /> the cost of the non-contributory pensions was going to amount to £353,000, plus the cost of administration, which might be taken to be another £60,000 or £70,000, making the cost of the non-contributory scheme in 1956 about £420,000, just a little under the £450,000 which the Minister is taking away.</P>
    <P>In the year 1961, however, the position was going to change even more radically, because in that year the total cost of the contributory pensions was going to be £707,000.  We would get £605,000, as before, from contribution income, plus £150,000 from the income from the Pensions Investment Fund, making £755,000, as against which we would have contributory pensions costing £717,000, plus the cost of administration, which might be taken as about £20,000, so that the contribution fund would just about balance.  We would have an income of £755,000, offset by an amount for pensions actually paid of £717,000, plus £20,000 for administration.  The position now is that, by taking this £450,000 out of this fund, the Minister must realise £450,000 of investments which belong to contributors to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.</P>
    <P>As I have shown, the contributors to that fund were contributing at the rate of £55,000 in 1937.  They are now to be robbed of £450,000 by the present Minister.  He is the Minister whom Deputy Kyne and Deputy Keyes have been praising here, the Minister to whom they are throwing bouquets, the Minister who takes the £450,000, the money which belongs to the widows and orphans of this country, to those who are beneficiaries under the contributory widows' and orphans' pensions scheme; to the Minister who takes the money that has been collected by legal force and duress from the bread winner when he was in employment, who takes the money which has been collected from the woman who was employed as a worker and had to be a contributor under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme. That is the money which Fianna Fáil were providing last year.  That is the <Col N="1092" /> money which we provided in every year except one, when, due to circumstances which I have not time to retail to the House, the amount was reduced to £250,000 but, in every other year we paid this £450,000.  That £450,000 is not being paid this year, and, if it is not being paid over this year to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund, it is not being paid because Deputy Kyne, Deputy Keyes and the Deputies who sit in the Clann na Poblachta Party are supporting the Fine Gael administration which reduced the old age pensions in the year 1923.</P>

      <P>The House has rarely listened to so much nonsense in such a short time as it has been treated to by the now hastily departing Deputy MacEntee.  Everybody, of course, knows that Deputy MacEntee has a reputation all his own in the matter of finance but, of course, his theories in that respect are backed by no sane person who has any knowledge of the subject.  The trouble about Deputy MacEntee in these matters, as you can see from his outburst here this evening, is that he mistakes noise for intelligence and thinks, when he comes into the House in that actor-like fashion of his, indulges in mock indignation, pours abuse on Deputies and reads figures, the significance of which he does not understand, that he is making a substantial contribution to intelligent thought in this country.  Happily, of course, those who had to sit in the House for a long number of years with Deputy MacEntee do not take the Deputy as seriously as he takes himself and it is because of that that the main structure of this House has continued undamaged all down the years because, if anyone were to take Deputy MacEntee seriously, it would be quite impossible to control human impulses when people have to listen to ourbursts such as we have had this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee is on the same kind of ramp as he was on recently and not all the advice which actuaries have <Col N="1093" /> given will put Deputy MacEntee on to any line of intelligent thought in respect of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.  In May last, Deputy MacEntee delivered a lecture in Dublin, under the title, &ldquo;The Budget, The Widow, The Orphan,&rdquo; at a meeting which was described as the first of a series of lectures designed to enlighten and educate politically young people. Of all the mentors to bring along to deal with young people and to enlighten and educate them, Deputy MacEntee was selected for that high honour out of 3,000,000 people!  The Deputy there, of course, indulged in his customary nonsense, read, apparently, the same kind of drivel as he was reading here this evening, not knowing in the slightest what it meant, and finally wound up by saying that if the £400,000, more or less, of these investments are sold, the income of the fund will be very seriously diminished and the future payments of pensions will be seriously jeopardised.</P>
    <P>I would take serious notice of that if it came from anybody who had knowledge of the facts but, coming from Deputy MacEntee, one need not take the slightest notice of it.  I have here what the actuary said in the matter, and this is a skilled, trained actuary, paid by the State for doing this job. This actuary reported in 1944, when Deputy MacEntee was in office and the Deputy ought to know what was going on at the time, if that is not too great a task to impose on him.  Here is what the actuary said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the Acts the amount of the Exchequer grants is prescribed until the 31st March, 1945, and thereafter is to be such sums as the Oireachtas may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Note the flexibility there&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As indicated in paragraph 16, the sum paid during the last eight years, namely, £450,000 per annum, is substantially larger than will be needed in future and an equalised annual grant during the next decennium, commencing on the 1st April, 1945, of about one-half of this sum, say, £220,000, is estimated to be sufficient together with the contributions at their present rates and the interest on the accumulated assets to meet all <Col N="1094" /> the expenditure out of the fund for contributory and non-contributory pensions and the cost of administration thereof and to secure that in ten years' time the invested reserves of the scheme will then be substantially equal to the present balance, which is £3,900,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the actuary, in 1944, was anxious to ensure that the reserves, ten years hence, amounted to not less than £3,900,000.  In fact, already, four years after the actuary made that report, instead of the assets being £3,900,000, they are £4,500,000, so that the position of the fund to-day is stronger than it was before.  The actuary knows that.  The Departmental officials know that.  Nobody in the world is worried about the solvency of the fund.  Deputy MacEntee, of course, for petty political reasons, seeks to give the impression that there is danger to the solvency of the fund.  I give widows and orphans in this country this positive and unqualified assurance that, so far as they are concerned, their pensions will always be safe.  They will always be paid and in future they will be paid at a higher rate than they were ever paid when Deputy MacEntee adorned the Department of Local Government.  I hope, however, that the Deputy will be honest enough to stop this discreditable ramp which is a disgrace to any person who ever held Ministerial rank.  If it does anything it merely shows that Deputy MacEntee knows nothing whatever about the financing of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and, apparently, has inoculated himself against any possibility of ever learning anything about it.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Dr. Ryan asked many questions. Deputy Ryan was rather worried about what he described as the change of policy on the part of the Labour Party since the change of Government.  He was worried, for instance, because of the fact that I propose to set up a consultative committee for blind welfare. I am doing so for one reason and one reason only, and that is to bring together four or five different organisations for the blind, to get them to coalesee, to get them to act as one, to <Col N="1095" /> get them to pool their ideas and to get them to tell me from time to time what they think ought to be done on any matter affecting the welfare of the blind.  It was done so that we might get a filtering organisation through which we could get the ideas of blind persons and organisations for the blind.  Its sole purpose is to help the blind.  The organisations know that. They welcomed the setting up of this committee.  Deputy Dr. Ryan did not think of doing that when he was in the Department, but I cannot help that. He at least ought not to try to throw cold water on an effort to try to help blind persons.  In any case, Deputy Dr. Ryan was scarcely qualified to talk on any matter affecting the blind or welfare of the blind.  His stay in the Department of Social Welfare does not entitle him to any public monument in respect of any brilliant thing he did there for blind welfare.  I try to repair some of the omissions of the Deputy. I propose to provide blind pensions at 21 years of age, to modify the means test, to confer very substantial benefits on them, to step up the blind pension to 17/6 a week and to encourage other activities which will help to improve their lot.  Becoming modesty in the matter of satire by Deputy Dr. Ryan will suit him all the better in reference to my efforts in this respect.</P>
    <P>I do not want to decry the efforts of anyone to give a fair and square deal to those who, unfortunately, have to depend on social services to maintain even the meanest standard of existence.  Any effort which improves social services is good, no matter who makes it, and I do not want the issue of social services to be one of political discord or raucous decision here.  When Deputy Dr. Ryan feels disposed to criticise or twit us with any change of outlook or policy, I am bound to say in defence that what is being done for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and blind persons is better than ever was done before.  In the 16 years Fianna Fáil were in office old age pensioners in rural areas were increased from 10/- to 12/6.  I propose to raise the maximum to 17/6 and to modify the means test.  I propose also to remove <Col N="1096" /> the discrimination against persons in the rural area which has existed up to the present and to give them, as common citizens of a common country, the same rate of benefit as obtains in the towns and cities.  I do not say 17/6 is a desirable rate.  I hope to see it bigger and better and, under the new social security scheme, I hope it will be substantially increased, on an insurance basis, from this 17/6 or the 15/- and 12/6 which is being paid to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Davern should remember that no later than October last, a motion was introduced here to modify the means test only&mdash;there was no question of increasing pensions&mdash;and the cost of conceding that, the then Minister for Social Services, Deputy Dr. Ryan, said, would be £500,000.  What was the result?  If Deputy Davern looks up the Official Dáil Report for the 22nd October, 1947, he will see that his Party trooped into the Division Lobby against any modification.  Under this new Bill, they will get no less than £2,500,000 additional each year&mdash; £1,500,000 to old age pensioners and £1,000,000 to widows and orphans. After four months in office that is not a bad achievement.  It compares pretty well with the achievement of Fianna Fáil after 16 years in office&mdash;16 years which was marked by a 2/6 increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I never believed in 9/-. I think it is detestably low, and so is 12/6.  Deputy Ryan referred to the decision to require local authorities to pay the full cost of the food vouchers granted by local authorities, on the basis of State recoupment, to persons in receipt of home assistance.  It is well known that Fianna Fáil decided&mdash; rightly, I think&mdash;to abolish these <Col N="1097" /> vouchers and give a cash supplement. The voucher is a badge of poverty, a taint of the poor law system.  It may be justified in an emergency.  What Deputy wants to see his wife going into a shop to buy food with a food voucher?  I am glad it was abolished and substituted by cash payments. That was a desirable decision taken by the last Government.</P>
      <P>I have continued that policy in respect of persons in receipt of home assistance and told the local authorities we were not going to continue this scheme, but that this year we would pay half the cost of administering it, in order to enable them to adjust themselves to the new circumstances. We told local authorities that, under the 1939 Public Assistance Act, they are responsible for relieving destitution, that is, for administering home assistance.  No Minister has power to intervene in the exercise by the local authority of their discretion in that respect.  We said: &ldquo;You have to take back this administration, you have to abolish the voucher but pay a cash supplement in lieu of it.&rdquo;  I think it is right and proper to require the local authority to do, in the sphere of home assistance, what this House properly regarded as a function of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole scheme costs not more than 1½d. in the £ to the local authorities. When you see the rates levied by some of them, quite obviously this 1½d. will make no perceptible increase in the rates.  In any case, even if they have to spend more in a certain class of home assistance, they will get back something pretty substantial in return under this new Bill.  Many persons who at present depend on non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions have to go to the local authority for home assistance.  Deputies know that the local authorities spent a fair amount of money on that.  How could it be otherwise?  Take the case of a widow with five children.  She at present gets, under the non-contributory scheme, a total allowance of 20/-a week.  Obviously the local authority has to supplement that.  I propose, under this new Bill, to give that widow <Col N="1098" /> 34/-; and I think I am doing a good deal there to take the burden off the back of the local authority.  So that if local authorities lose a trifle under the instruction for the reassumption by them of full responsibility for the administration of home assistance, I think they do pretty well under this new scheme of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  Up to the present they have had to pay a proportion of the supplementary old age pension allowance&mdash;25 per cent. of it.  Under the new Bill they will have to pay none of it.  All their responsibility will be assumed by the State, so that anybody can tot up the substantial benefit which will be conferred on the local authorities for that triflling liability which is passed on by reason of the reassumption of the entire administration of home assistance and the financial consequences which flow therefrom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is only dealing with one class&mdash;the old age pensioners. You also have the disability sickness class and the national health and unemployment assistance class. Does it not affect them also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that if you say: &ldquo;We will put on the local authorities part of the responsibility of paying the cash supplement in lieu of food vouchers,&rdquo; and I acknowledge we did that, it will cost the local authorities in the aggregate 1½d. in the £.  If they have to pay that they are going to get a substantial offload in another direction.  Non-contributory widows' pensions at present are not sufficient to sustain a person and many of these folk have to seek home assistance.  In addition, a supplementary old age pension may be allowed by a local authority.  Of that 2/6, 75 per cent. is paid by the State and 25 per cent. by the local authority. Wherever a local authority has been giving that supplementary allowance, it will not have to do it in the future, because the State will now lift the pension level up to 17/6.  There again a very substantial benefit will flow back to the local authority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan raised the question of workmen's compensation and its relationship to the proposed comprehensive scheme of social service.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to throw this matter into public discussion.  We can do three things in connection with workmen's compensation.  We can amend the existing law and allow things to run under a new structure with new rates of benefit.  We can establish a State scheme of workmen's compensation, making compensation compulsory, the State getting contributions from the employer and perhaps from the employee, if you wish to do it. That is a matter to be considered.  We can administer a State scheme of workmen's compensation by integrating workmen's compensation into the general scheme of social service.  We might do any of three things and still do the right and wise thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to throw that question into the arena of public discussion in order to get public opinion formed on the question, telling the public what the advantages of one course are as distinct from another and being guided by some <Col N="1100" /> reasonable crystallisation of public opinion on the subject.  It is a thorny problem and there will be advocates for each of these courses when we come to discuss them.  I shall try to take the course which seems to be the wisest and which has the greatest volume of public support.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Ryan referred to the fact that we were proposing to raise the contributions in respect of unemployment insurance, national health insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions.  We are going to do that.  The very names of these Acts clearly indicate that they used to be on an insurance basis.  It was intended that these Acts should be financed by a contribution from the worker, on the one hand, and by a contribution from the employer, on the other hand, with approximately a State grant of two-ninths.  That was the source from which the money was to come to create the pool out of which the money would be paid. During the war, for very obvious reasons, these Acts departed somewhat from their insurance basis.  It started off in the first instance by the special allowances which were granted during the emergency.  Nobody suggested then that these allowances should be paid for by increased contributions. How could you purport to levy additional contributions for these supplementary payments at a time when you are pegging down wages?  Of course, political wisdom suggested that it was better not to try the game of increasing contributions while keeping wages down, and nothing happened. The position, therefore, is that up to the present cash supplements and Exchequer contributions have been made available for recipients of benefits under these three Acts.</P>
    <P>Clearly you must visualise the end of that type of financing what was a normal insurance activity and the proposal in the Bill is to increase the contributions so that the cash supplement at present paid may be amalgamated with the basic benefit and a combined benefit given to the insured contributor as a statutory right.  I do not know of any insured contributor who has given any consideration to a matter of this <Col N="1101" /> kind who would not prefer to have his rights definitely enshrined in an Act, not made the plaything of a Budget discussion and not depending on the whim or caprice of a Government, as the present annual Vote is.  I think it is far more desirable in the interests of the insured contributor to put this thing back on an insurance basis, giving the insured contributor the benefit of the basic benefit, plus the supplementary cash benefit.  If Deputy MacEntee thinks that there is good politics in that I make him a present of it.  It will prove to be a damp squib at all events.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes referred to the position of temporary clerks in employment exchanges.  I am having that matter examined with a view to seeing whether it is possible to have an examination held so as to provide these clerks with the opportunity of obtaining established appointments.  I realise that the examination will have to be a qualifying one, having regard to the age of the person, but we will see what we can do in the matter. Deputy Cowan spoke about branch offices and said that some people were signing on for work in order to keep the number of units in the office up to a very high level.  If that is happening, it is an obvious fraud, and, if the Deputy will let me have particulars, I will have the position investigated.  As my predecessor knows, the whole branch office position in the country is thoroughly unsatisfactory.  It is a scheme by which Civil Service work is farmed out to non-civil servants and they are paid on a unit basis and badly paid at that.</P>

      <P>I will try to find a remedy.  I will not try to justify their rates.  If the matter rested in my own hands, I know what I would do.  In any case, the position, as the House knows, is that these persons are paid on a unit basis and the more unemployed there are registered the more <Col N="1102" /> pay they get.  The less the number of unemployed the less pay they get. That is a wholly unsatisfactory system in my opinion.  Obviously it encourages the registration of people as unemployed and it certainly discourages any effort to place unemployed people in employment because the more the manager puts into jobs the less pay he gets at the end of the month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I am having that whole matter examined.  My ultimate object is, at all events, to staff these offices with regular civil servants and to have them administered without regard to these evils which are elements in the present administration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern raised the question of blind pensions.  I propose to pay these in future on a very modified means test and at the age of 21 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy A. Byrne referred to the wage scales of temporary clerks in the employment exchanges.  These officers, I understand, recently received an increase of 11/- a week.  They have made representations in the matter of remuneration and these representations are being examined.  As to his point about the payment of pensions, that is obviously a matter for the Minister for Defence.  The Deputy will have to seek a remedy for that matter in that Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne referred to the delay in the payment of national health insurance.  As a Deputy, my experience of the National Health Insurance Society did not disclose any delay in the payment of contributions.  It is very easy to make an assertion, I suppose, but the only way we can take action in that matter is to get a precise complaint.  If Deputy Dunne or anybody else has any complaint to make in that connection I shall be only too pleased to have the matter specifically investigated.  By bringing cases of delay of that kind to light we may help to evolve a better system by taking steps to eliminate possible delays in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Deputy MacGrath made the point that doubtful claims for unemployment benefit should be referred to Dublin.  I have a lot of sympathy with the Deputy in that connection.  It is essentially a service in which we have to try as far as possible to decentralise certain types of control.  I do not personally admire the system by which everything has to go to a central depot for a decision. It very often happens that the decision is finally made by a person of lower rank than the official who referred the correspondence to the central office.  I have already discussed with my Department the question as to whether it is possible to give greater authority to local managers so as to eliminate cluttering up the head office with local files and at the same time to provide for speedier administration in the matter of claims for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn seems to have been rather unfortunate in his contacts with the old age pension section of my Department.  All the Deputies will find the officers there extremely obliging and courteous.  The last thing of which they can be accused is of not taking pains with Deputies and of not taking pains to examine each individual case.  Far from receiving any instructions from me to tighten up the means test, I have asked them to deal sympathetically with every claim referred to them and to give the applicant the benefit, whatever his rights are under the Act.  They have received no instructions to tighten up. My desire, and the desire of everybody else, is that if there is any doubt at all the applicant should be given the benefit of it.  Deputy Flynn's experience is, I think, rather unique, and I hope he will find the atmosphere in my Department when next he visits it more cordial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy took me to task because I restored to members of the Dáil the right to interview deciding officers in the old age pensions department. Deputy Kennedy may not put a high value on public representation and he may not think very highly of public representatives or of members of the Dáil.  A person who gets into <Col N="1104" /> the political arena in this country and who finally secures election to the nation's Parliament has some standing in the country.  Such a person is entitled to feel that he is a man to whom the people look for guidance. Under the previous Government, Deputies were prevented from interviewing the civil servants who were dealing with old age pension cases.  I considered that intolerable tyranny, and when I came into office I abolished it.  If a Deputy wants to interview the deciding officer in the Department of Social Welfare he can now do so in the same way as he can go into any other Government Department and interview any civil servant he wants to interview and discuss the matter with which the civil servant is dealing. I do not think Deputy Kennedy's attitude reflects the viewpoint of the members of his own Party, because a number of Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have congratulated me for restoring that right which had been taken rather abruptly from them by their own Government.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce which I am presenting to the Dáil was prepared by the previous Government, and provided for a net expenditure in the current financial year of almost £17,000,000.  Nearly £14,000,000 of this amount was provided in respect of subsidies on food and fuel.  I do not propose, in my opening remarks, to make more than a passing reference to these subsidies, as they have already been discussed in the Dáil recently, and the measures which the Government have decided to take to secure savings on the subsidy payments and to obtain receipts as off-sets against those payments have already been announced. It would perhaps be relevant to mention here that I have decided to appoint a committee consisting of the Attorney-General as chairman, Mr. Eamonn McCarron, chartered accountant, and Mr. Valentine Murray, of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, to inquire into and to report to me on the necessity for the continuance of the subsidy on flour either at its present level or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Deputies will expect to obtain some statement from me as to the policy of the present Government in regard to industrial development.  That policy is to foster and encourage the extension of sound and efficient industrial activity in this country, and to this end to remove, so far as lies in our power, every impediment to the rapid extension of existing industrial undertakings, or to the establishment and development of new projects which are based on a solid foundation of efficiency.  My Department continues to receive and examine many new industrial proposals extending over a wide and varied range.  Every facility is given to the promoters of such proposals, and despite the many difficulties which promoters are experiencing in getting machinery and equipment, many of these people have actually gone into production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Suggestions have been made in certain quarters that the present Government is opposed to giving new industries that measure of protection without which they could not possibly hope to carry on against foreign competition, but I would like to emphasise here, that there are no grounds whatever for any such charge; as a matter of fact, within the past few months, certain protective duties and restrictions on imports under the Control of Imports Acts, which had been suspended for some years, have been reimposed.  It is the definite and declared policy of the Government to give to industry, such protection as may be necessary to enable it to carry on successfully, but always on the clear understanding that such protection will only be given where the enterprises show themselves capable of producing goods of good quality and at prices which appear reasonable, having regard to the many difficulties which new industries must encounter in present circumstances. No industrialist has any reason to be apprehensive that the present Government is going to hamper his activities in any way, provided he is doing a really good job of work and not merely using or intending to use tariff barriers to bolster up inefficiency or to impose burdens on the consumer in the form of unduly high prices.</P>
    <P>Whilst we would all like that the development of our industries should take place under native control and direction, we have to recognise that there are some industries which cannot be promoted, or cannot be established with reasonable speed by purely Irish enterprise without the help of persons whose expert knowledge and experience have been gained elsewhere.  In the case of such industries, where our own people have not the necessary knowledge or, for various reasons, are not prepared to launch out into these particular fields, the Government is prepared to consider proposals for such industries from persons outside the country, and if such persons are unable, for one reason or another, to comply with our Control of Manufactures Acts, I am prepared to give them new manufacture licences.  I may say here also that as regards the employment of foreign technicians, I am prepared to <Col N="1109" /> facilitate their entry where it can be shown that their expert knowledge is going to improve the quality and standard of our products.  I think we must recognise that in some parts of the field of manufacturing industry in this country there is plenty of room for technical improvement; and I will give all the encouragement and assistance I can to industrialists who are trying to keep abreast of progress in their particular line of activity.  It is now more important than ever it was for our manufacturers to turn their eyes to foreign markets.  I am well aware of the many restrictions imposed by Governments of some other countries on imports which they can do without; but there are markets available abroad for many of our industrial products and I would urge manufacturers to take the fullest advantage of such opportunities.</P>
    <P>In this Budget statement, the Minister for Finance announced that the scheme for exploration of mineral deposits, for which £85,000 is provided in this year's Estimate, would not be proceeded with.  Since then additional information has been obtained as to an intensified exploration and the subsequent exploitation of certain areas, and this matter is at present being reviewed by the Government.  It is hoped that a decision will be taken very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Department of Industry and Commerce now takes responsibility for action connected with the procurement of supplies of various commodities which was exercised during the war emergency by the Department of Supplies.  In some cases there has, since the end of the war, been a marked improvement in the supply position.  In other cases improvement has been slight but is steady, and in a few cases the difficulties and shortages still persist. I do not propose to review the supply position of commodities in detail in my opening remarks, but I will be prepared to reply to any questions which may be raised in the course of debate.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of wheat, I feel, however, that there should be some reference to it.  The wheat position is reasonably satisfactory. <Col N="1110" /> The present stocks of wheat and flour in the country, together with the further quantities which are being shipped or are awaiting shipment, are sufficient to enable us to carry on until native wheat from the new harvest reaches the mills.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are already aware, an international wheat agreement intended to operate from the 1st August next was signed in March of this year on behalf of three exporting countries and 33 importing countries, including Ireland, subject to its formal acceptance by the respective Governments not later than the 1st July.  Our acceptance of the agreement, under which we would have been sure of receiving a substantial quantity of wheat at a price considerably below that which we have been paying up to now, was duly conveyed to the International Wheat Council.  At a meeting of the council held early in July, however, it was revealed that the United States Government and a large number of the Governments of importing countries had not formally accepted the agreement, whereupon Australia gave notice of her withdrawal.  Similar action was taken by Ireland and the majority of the other importing countries which had notified acceptance in the first instance on the grounds that without the United States and Australia&mdash;two of the three exporting countries &mdash; the agreement could not be operated.  The negotiations for an agreement have not been abandoned but its early operation cannot now be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Bread grains remain subject to allocation by the International Emergency Food Committee but all indications point to a substantial easement in the world supply position.  I am confident that in the coming year we will get at least enough wheat to enable the present ration to be maintained. Without the international agreement it is not possible precisely to forecast what prices will be.  The substantial increase in the supplies of wheat may enable us to obtain wheat at the same price as if the agreement had been in operation and should ensure at least that there will be some fall below last year's level.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from supply questions, <Col N="1111" /> I wish to say just a word about fuel. Our fuel problems have already been discussed at length, but I wish to repeat that, so far as can now be foreseen, coal supplies for the balance of this year, as well as for the year 1949, are reasonably secure and there are no grounds for anticipating difficulty in meeting our needs.  As regards the supplies of fuel held by Fuel Importers, Limited, in the various dumps, more particularly turf and timber, the problem of their disposal and of the financial losses incurred is a very formidable one and is being examined in detail at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services, the bulk of the expenditure&mdash;£1,850,000&mdash;relates to the airports at Shannon and Dublin, and about three-quarters of this expenditure is of a capital nature.  It is my intention to continue with the development of the airports at Shannon and Dublin so that we will have two firstclass airports in this country providing facilities for civil aviation on a scale which will bear comparison with any other country of comparable size and resources.  Following a preliminary examination of the items included in the Estimates, I was able to advise the Minister for Finance that certain economies could be achieved even in the current year.</P>
    <P>There were two projects under consideration, one at Shannon and the other at Dublin, which I have decided can be deferred without serious detriment to the future of these airports. Plans have been under consideration for a considerable time to erect a new permanent building at Shannon Airport which would replace the existing structure. The existing terminal building is made of wood and has had to be extended rapidly.  Nevertheless, I am advised that with suitable upkeep it should continue to be usable as a terminal building for 15 or 20 years.  In the circumstances, and in view of the general shortage of materials for housing and other urgent projects, I feel that I would not be justified in proceeding at present with plans for a new permanent building at Shannon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Plans had also been made to erect a factory at Dublin Airport to provide for the overhaul of aircraft engines, equipment and air frames.  It had been estimated that the capital cost of erecting and equipping this factory would be about £350,000, and that the additional cost of having overhauls carried out at this factory, as compared with the cost of having the work done abroad, would be about £60,000 per annum.  I came to the conclusion that, in view of the general difficulties in securing materials for other purposes, I would not be warranted in allowing this factory to proceed at the present time.  Certain other economies will also be secured.  All the foregoing economies represent a saving of £93,000 in the current year.  There will, in addition, be economies in respect of subsidy for six services.</P>
    <P>The figure of £600,000 shown under sub-head M. in respect of subsidy for air services is made up of £315,000 estimated loss on the transatlantic air service, £190,000 being the Irish share of prospective Aer Lingus losses, and a figure of £86,000 included as a margin for contingencies.  The provision for contingencies will not be required.  The provision for loss by Aerlínte Éireann is not now required, but there will be some expenditure in the current year. The discharge of the Aerlínte staff in this country did not commence till May, 1948, and a few people must be kept on to dispose of the assets.  I might mention that a profit amounting to about £450,000 over the original cost price was made by Aerlínte on the sale of five Constellation aircraft and spares.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate was taken last February to enable subsidy to be paid in respect of the full losses estimated for the year.  The full amount voted was not paid as the limit of £750,000 for all subsidies from the date of the incorporation of Aer Lingus was reached; this limit is contained in the Air Navigation and Transport Acts. The Estimates for the current year had gone for printing before a decision was taken that expenditure incurred by Aerlínte in preparing for the transatlantic service should be treated as an operating loss to be met from <Col N="1113" /> subsidy rather than as capital expenditure, which had been the intention.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has established a fine reputation for technical competence, efficiency and regularity in the air services operated between this country, on the one hand, and Great Britain and the Continent, on the other.  The company has, however, incurred a serious loss, amounting to approximately £600,000 in the financial year ended 31st March last: this compares with a loss of £134,000 in the year 1946-47, and a profit of £9,000 in the year 1945-46.  Aer Lingus is now a company representing Irish and British interests; 50 per cent. of the losses are borne by British corporations, and 50 per cent. by the Irish interest.  I am aware that the directors have been very seriously concerned at the extent of the losses incurred and they took energetic steps towards the end of last year with a view to a reduction and eventually, I hope, the elimination of operating losses.  Fares were increased in December last and were again substantially increased this year.  A number of services were suspended because the board felt that the traffic did not justify their continuance. The company had, following the agreement in 1946, laid plans for considerable development and expansion; but, because of general economic conditions in Europe and foreign exchange restrictions which curtailed passenger traffic, the company's anticipations were not realised.  This experience appears to have been shared by air companies all over the world.  It was, I know, a source of regret to the directors, as it was to the Government, that the steps which were taken led to the termination of the services of considerable numbers of staff.</P>
    <P>I think I ought to make it clear, in case there is any doubt about it, that such steps as were taken by Aer Lingus to secure economies were taken on the initiative and on the responsibility of the board and not as a result of any pressure from the Government.  It is the earnest desire and the intention of the Government to foster and encourage the development of air transport <Col N="1114" /> and it should be clearly recognised by everybody concerned that there is no reason to anticipate any change in this policy.  This country cannot, of course, afford to spend unlimited sums on the development of commercial aviation, but I have no reason to think that losses of the order incurred last year are necessary to maintain air services on a reasonable scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I was taken by surprise by the abrupt termination of the Minister's introductory speech.  I thought he would have considered it necessary to have made some reference to current problems arising out of the threatening international situation.  It is, of course, possible that the dangers which that situation holds for this country may pass, for the present at least, but that they are there now cannot be denied, and public opinion would like some assurance that Government policy is being framed in the light of them and that positive steps are being taken to minimise, in so far as it is possible to minimise it, the risk which they hold for us.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce regards it as any part of his duty to take account of that situation and to make plans against its deterioration.  It may be that there will be no danger; it may be that the situation will ease, but so long as it is there, so long as it holds a grave threat for us, it is desirable that consideration should be given to the steps that could be taken to minimise the risk and that positive action to that end should be initiated without delay.  It is, of course, admitted that the measures that could be taken to reduce the risk arising from a possible war are not very considerable, but there are some, and it is in relation to matters which seem on the face of them to be practicable that I want to get some information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, if we have to deal with a situation this year or next in which <Col N="1115" /> international trade may be disrupted by the outbreak of hostilities between the great powers, the sooner we start taking steps the better.  We will have problems of fuel supply, transport, the maintenance of essential production, the accumulating of certain essential stocks which are grave enough in all conscience but which could be, to some extent, lessened by speedy action.  I mentioned these problems because they were those which developed here during the recent war. It has always been the experience of mankind that the lessons of one war were not entirely applicable to another, and it is, of course recognised that if there is any international conflict it may bring to this country problems dissimilar in many respects to those encountered in the recent conflict. Just as the measures we took in 1938, in anticipation of the war which began in 1939, were based upon the experience of the First World War, and were not entirely adapted to the circumstances as they, in fact, developed, so it is fair to assume that the problems that will arise in another war will not be exactly the same as those we encountered in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, we have to proceed on the basis of experience.  There is no other basis on which to proceed.  During the recent war we had acute problems here. They came mainly under these heads, fuel supplies, transport, maintenance of industrial production, and behind it all up to this present day, the problem of maintaining a sufficiency of essential food supplies.  In the case of fuel, I should like to have some assurance that the plans which were made for the extension of mechanised turf production are being proceeded with. Perhaps it might be possible for the Minister to tell us whether these plans could be expedited.  I recognise that it is not as easy to speed up plans in relation to turf production as might be done in relation to other forms of production, because there are certain factors which determine the periods during which work can be done, particularly with the drainage of bogs, to <Col N="1116" /> enable them to take the heavy machines which that work involves.</P>
    <P>Knowing, however, that the problems which the shortage of fuel caused, not merely in the maintenance of reasonable domestic conditions, but in carrying on essential transport and essential industrial production during the recent war, I think attention should be given to the possibility of speeding up these plans, and that the organisation responsible for their excution should be given the green light to go ahead as quickly as possible.  It might be that their expeditious completion might be a little more costly than their fulfilment on the basis of the original scheme, but that would be a small price to pay for the additional security which the increased production of mechanised turf would give us.</P>
    <P>We had, during the recent war, not merely a deficiency of solid fuels but a very considerable deficiency in electricity generating capacity.  There is a number of new generating stations under construction.  Again, I should like to have an investigation made as to the possibility of bringing forward the dates for the completion of these stations.  In so far as their completion depends on the delivery of equipment from abroad, that might not be so easy but, in so far as it involves construction work in this country, it might be possible to do so, if necessary, by introducing shift work.  We would feel much easier in mind if we had available the adequate generating capacity which these stations represent, particularly the new water-power station on the Erne and the turf burning station at Clonsast.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether these stations will be completed by the dates envisaged.</P>
    <P>It was expected that the Clonsast station would come into production next year, but in the case of the Erne it was not anticipated that it would supply electricity earlier than 1951.  Of course the Erne is by far the biggest of the stations being built, and its completion would be a very considerable safeguard.  If the Minister could give the House information as to when these stations will be completed.  I should like him to examine also the possibility of speeding up their completion, in view <Col N="1117" /> of the international situation, which may not be a matter of open hostilities this year, but may well be before the present electricity generating programme has been completed.</P>
    <P>It may not be altogether practicable to talk about oil storage in a situation where there is a world shortage of petroleum products and when we are not getting enough for current needs. The House is aware of the circumstances which made it difficult to have substantial oil storage capacity constructed here before the recent war. We had a private war of our own with the oil combines arising out of the efforts to establish an oil refinery here. Every effort made to get these companies to erect additional storage before the war was unsuccessful, in so far as they made the condition for its completion that the refinery project should be dropped.  Possibly that position has changed.</P>
    <P>I note the report dealing with European recovery, prepared in relation to the Marshall Plan, refers to the desirability of increasing the oil refinery capacity of Europe so that a project which at one time appeared to be an idea of our own has now, to some extent, received international blessing. It may be that the companies are not now hostile to it as they were previously. During the period of the recent war, and even since the end of the war, there were difficulties for this country, by reason of the completely inadequate storage capacity for petroleum products.  When, after the end of the war, additional fuel oil became available, we had a problem in importing it by reason of the insufficiency of storage capacity.</P>
    <P>In fact, I think it is true to say that for all essential commodities the storage accommodation in this country is inadequate.  I have spoken about that in public.  It is, I think, to be attributed to the manner in which our trade was carried on when we were in political union with Great Britain. Those who were described as merchants and importers in this country were really little more than the agents of British firms.  They were really commercial travellers, as they were <Col N="1118" /> engaged in selling products here for delivery from British warehouses.  That situation having developed over a number of years, we had in this country insufficient warehousing and storage accommodation.  The warehousing and storage accommodation appropriate to our trade was located at Liverpool and other British ports.  I think it would be a good policy for the Government to consider the measures that they might adopt to assist port authorities and industrial firms to establish properly-equipped and suitably-located warehouses for the storage of all commodities which pass in international trade.</P>
    <P>I think that particularly applies to coal.  There are coal dumps in the Phænix Park, but, when in the early stages of the war, an accidental development at that time made it possible for a large quantity of coal to be brought in here in a short period, there was real difficulty in doing so because of the inadequate storage accommodation for coal.  Before the war our coal merchants literally bought coal from hand to mouth.  There was a fleet of small ships bringing coal to this country every day, and, as quickly as it went into the merchants' yards, it went out again to their customers.  I think, again, having regard to the general circumstances of the times, and until a prospect of a period of permanent world peace emerges again, we should pay special attention to that problem of storage and particularly to the storage of essential commodities such as coal.</P>
    <P>In the case of turf, if turf is to be sold in competition with coal, clearly it must be handled by firms that are equipped for that purpose, not firms who have their stores located at the ports where they are conveniently placed for dealing with coal, but on the roads into the city along which turf supplies flow stores which are equipped with the mechanical devices which will cheapen and facilitate the handling of turf.</P>
    <P>I do not want to diverge too much from the main subject with which I am now dealing, namely, the precautions we should take and that we could take against a possible war situation.  I <Col N="1119" /> have dealt with the question of fuel. I should like to say just a word in that connection in regard to our general industrial position.  We knew at the beginning of the recent war that there were gaps in our industrial organisation. The nature of these gaps and their full effect on the maintenance of industrial production here in a time of crisis was made very clear by our experience during the war years.  We should be striving now to close them as quickly as possible.  If the job has to be undertaken by private firms, they must be given special inducements to act quickly, even if acting quickly means that they will be involved in heavier capital expenditure or some economic handicap which could be avoided by delay.  I am thinking particularly of the gaps in the organisation for the production of some metals and textiles.  There are some industries which can never be established here on a completely independent basis, but there are certain deficiencies which can be made good and certain industries which can be established with every hope of economic operation in future, and which, if established, would make more certain the continued operation of a number of other industries in circumstances in which international trade was disrupted by war conditions.</P>
    <P>Most urgent of all is that we should extend as rapidly as possible our merchant marine service.  There are, I think, five ships under construction and delivery of them will take place this year or next year, but even the addition of these five new ships to the present fleet will not bring it up to anything like the strength which we always regarded as the minimum towards which we should aim.  It was the policy of the previous Government, laid down in a formal minute to the Board of Irish Shipping Limited, that the shipping tonnage available for deep-sea operation should always, at a minimum, be sufficient to carry on our essential trade in times and in circumstances in which the ships of other nations would not be available. We have a long way to go before we have reached that stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> I think it is desirable that whatever plans have been made for the acquisition of new ships to bring up the tonnage to the minimum considered necessary, should be speeded up, having regard to the situation to which I have referred.  I am aware that there was considerable speculation as to whether the cost of shipbuilding was likely to fall or increase.  In placing orders for new ships, the Board of Irish Shipping Limited had naturally to have regard to the indications of future trends in that direction.  It was reasonable to assume that at some stage the cost of new ships would fall and consequently there was a disposition to postpone ordering new ships until the prices position had become stabilised.  I think now, in the circumstances of the time, it is desirable that our fleet should be brought up to the minimum strength considered necessary and that the consideration of price should not prevent that decision.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer at this stage to the problem of internal transport.  It is clearly very urgent and it is obvious that whatever is to be done in relation to our internal transport situation must be done quickly whether there is likely to be a war or not.  The same applies in regard to aviation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister regards it as desirable that manufacturers and commercial firms should be encouraged to stock up goods which are either essential or goods on which we would be agreed it is desirable we should have a sufficient quantity for as long as possible.  At the present time, so far as I can ascertain from consultation with private business interests, there appears to be a policy on the part of the commercial banks to restrict credit for commercial operations. Whether that is a policy decided upon by the boards of the banks in their own interest, or whether it has been inspired by the Central Bank or the Department of Finance, I do not know, but if there is a situation in which it is desirable that industrial firms should be encouraged to maintain maximum stocks of raw materials and commercial firms to carry stocks of manufactured goods, then clearly they must be given some financial help to that end <Col N="1121" /> by the banks or by some other agency. I also think these firms will require to get from the Minister some general assurance that, if the circumstances against which stocks are being accumulated, do not develop and that, on the contrary, prices begin to fall and goods become available in greater quantity, they will be given help and opportunity of disposing of these stocks again without loss to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say that whatever restrictions have been placed on credit by banks or other financial interests, have not been imposed on the instructions of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that from a reply given to a Parliamentary Question by the Minister for Finance.  It may be that the banks, to whatever extent they are doing it, are acting in what they conceive to be their own interests.  If they are, and if there are considerations of policy which make it desirable that, at any rate, in relation to manufacturers and traders anxious to import stocks as a security measure, that that policy should be reversed, some indication of that view should be given by the Government.  One can never be quite sure to what extent there is a policy on the part of the banks in that regard.  Individuals may have been refused additional credit for some reason which did not represent a policy.  But from quite a number of sources it has been stated that there is this general restriction of credit in operation, and it could not have been due to individual causes in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad the Minister made the statement he did concerning the policy of the Government in relation to industrial development, and particularly with regard to the provision of protection where required.  I expressed the view last year on the Estimate in the House, and on many occasions outside the House, that assuming a normal transition from a war economy to a peace economy, and of no further international upheaval, that this year and next year will be the most critical period in our industrial development.  I think that we <Col N="1122" /> can hope to get the industrial drive going again in that period, and that if we do not do it we will have very considerable difficulty in resuming it later. I think that we have opportunities in this period that may not occur again later.  It is desirable that there should be every encouragement given to persons who want to engage in industry to get ahead, and particularly, the encouragement of Government support with a clear indication that Government policy favours that development.</P>
    <P>Some doubts have been created in that regard, perhaps not intentionally, but the doubts exist as the Minister, I think, must be aware.  I do not know whether the present Government have any different views upon the desirability of encouraging industrial development by private enterprise from those held by their predecessors. It was our view that industrial development by private enterprise was likely to be more rapid and more extensive than by any system of State organisation, and, consequently, we made it known that we wanted to get an extension of industrial activity through private enterprise, and that we recognised that private enterprise was inspired by the profit motive, and that unless there was a prospect of profit it would not proceed at all.  The many statements which have been made concerning industry, and concerning the profits made by industry, the apparent irrational denunciation of industrialists who made profits, would appear to indicate either a general discouragement of industrial development or some prejudice against industrial development through private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the denunciations were in regard to excessive and unreasonable profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not always expressed in the moderate and reasonable terms which would make its application fully understood.  In fact, as the Minister well knows, there is amongst people who were listening to speeches made by members of his Party and of the Parties associated with him, the general belief that industrialists generally were nothing less <Col N="1123" /> than highway robbers, getting away with unreasonable profits.  That is not true.  I am not going to deny that there were some cases of people making higher profits than would have been regarded as reasonable, and some cases of people successfully evading profit control; but generally speaking, the profits made by industrialists were not immoderate, and in any event it is the prospect of making a profit that got private enterprise working.  Ours is a private enterprise economy, based upon the profit motive, and unless we let the profit motive operate then the whole system will come to an end.</P>
      <P>It is true that a particular industry which has the benefit of a protective duty or which, because of the limited size of our market has something akin to a monopoly position, must be satisfied with a lower general return upon its capital investment than another concern which gets its profit in the face of competition, and the size of whose profits is the measure of its efficiency. Normally, in competitive conditions the most efficient firm will make the largest profits though it does not necessarily charge the highest prices.</P>
      <P>I have frequently in this Dáil in the past referred to well known firms in the City of Dublin in order to contest the belief that high prices necessarily meant high profits or that high profits were necessarily the result of high prices.  It has been my experience that high profits in many cases were made by efficient firms charging reasonable prices, while the firm that charged high prices in a competitive market usually ended up with a bankruptcy sale notice in their windows.  It is a complete mistake to associate high prices with high profits.  They are not always associated.  There must be some permanent machinery for the supervision of profits and general efficiency in the case of protected industries. When the State gives to a private firm the benefit of a restricted market secured through tariffs, quotas or otherwise, it has the right to supervise the service given to the public and to impose such checks on its operation as the public interest seems to require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim, sometimes foolishly advanced <Col N="1124" /> by industrial firms enjoying protection to be exempt from Government interference or Government supervision, is completely unjustified. If there is to be exemption from Government supervision then there should be exemption from Government assistance as well.</P>
    <P>If, however, we are to get the fullest development of our industrial potentialities we must not rely entirely on private enterprise because there are many industries which, in the circumstances of this country, will not be established by private firms either because of the exceptional difficulties which are involved or the high capital investment required.  I have in mind, particularly, the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, to which I referred in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I know that the Board of Ceimici Teoranta were investigating the establishment of that industry here and were preparing plans for it.  I would like to know how far they have gone.  It is one industry which, I think, should be established, and established by a company set up under statutory authority.  It will never be done by private enterprise. It is an industry which is not merely suitable to this country but one which is essential to our general interests because the deficiency of nitrogenous manures during the recent war made the maintenance of agricultural output so much more difficult.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister that a proposal for the manufacture of copper sulphate by that company has been received by him.  There was public notice of the fact that the Minister proposes to make an Order under the Act which would confine the right to manufacture copper sulphate to that company.  I hope that consideration of these proposals will not be unduly delayed, and that the company will be authorised to go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>One other industry which I would like to refer to is the manufacture of steel.  The plant at Haulbowline has a varied history.  It was established by a private company just shortly before the outbreak of war and it came into production with only half its equipment <Col N="1125" /> installed and a large part of its capital unremunerative.  It ran into financial difficulties which caused it to close during the war.  Because of its importance to the country, the Government made an Order which gave it the right to appoint the directors of the company and which prevented other creditors from proceeding against it for the recovery of their claims.  It advanced to the company under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act £200,000. The company maintained production by makeshift methods during the war, but after the war it ran into financial difficulties again.  I want to make it quite clear that this is due to directions which I gave.  At one stage early in 1945 an opportunity of buying steel billets in Canada offered itself.  The question for decision was whether the war with Japan was likely to end soon or not.  If not, it was clearly desirable that we should purchase the billets, dear and all as they were, to maintain the production of steel here; if it were likely that it would end soon, however, there was a reasonable expectation that prices would fall and that the billets would be an exceptionally dear buying.  I directed the company to buy them because I considered it to be my duty to assume the worst in making plans of that sort, to assume that the war with Japan would continue for a longer period, and that we would have to have the billets in any event.</P>
    <P>Before the billets arrived in this country, the war with Japan was over and the ending of the war was accompanied by a temporary slump in steel prices so the billets which were available to the company were at a higher price than the price of manufactured steel at that time.  That was only temporary, however; the price has gone up again and that position has been completely reversed.  That involved the company in substantial loss and after some negotiations the company was bought out by the State.  It is now a State company; it is operated by a board appointed by the Minister and no private interests are left in it.  It is equipped with furnaces and a rolling mill for the production of steel bars.  I understand that part of the equipment required for a blooming mill, which is a necessary part of the <Col N="1126" /> process of production, and for a sheet-rolling mill is available on the site. Some new capital expenditure would make the mill complete by the installation of the necessary blooming process and would extend the total tonnage output by extending the production to steel sheets.  I think it would be very desirable if the Minister would promote the necessary legislation&mdash;I think that legislation would be required&mdash;to establish Irish Steel (1947) Limited&mdash;that is, I think, the name of the present company&mdash;on a proper statutory basis and provide the necessary capital to establish the industry as completely as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be that its location at Haulbowline was a mistake&mdash;some of the Cork Deputies may not, perhaps, agree but there was reason to think during the history of the concern that it would have operated more efficiently, more economically on some other location. That is, however, only partially true as long as the total tonnage of the steel being produced there is insufficient to maintain the operation of a shipping service to the island on a completely satisfactory basis.  I think that the disadvantages of the Haulbowline site will decrease in proportion with an increase of output of the concern.  On the production of steel bars and steel sheets other industries depend, including the production of agricultural machinery and, therefore, it is a key industry which should be preserved and developed as completely as possible.</P>
    <P>Another industry which I would like to see established, if it is possible by a private concern, if it is necessary by Government interests, is wool combing. There is one wool-combing plant in Cork, a very efficient plant which exports wool tops to the United States, but the total wool-combing equipment in the country is completely inadequate to produce sufficient wool tops for the country.  Steps were taken, as the Minister knows, with a view to establishing a large scale wool-combing plant here, but progress has not yet been made.  The Minister will not get that progress until he makes up his mind that there is going to be wool-combing here somehow, if not by private enterprise, then as a State <Col N="1127" /> concern.  Until he makes that quite clear, private interests will go slow. It is definitely an essential industry for us to have, but it is one that can be established here as efficiently as anywhere else, one that can engage in export from this country in competition with plants of the same kind anywhere.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1946 I laid the foundation stone of a cotton-spinning factory in Athlone which was the first cotton-spinning factory in the country. It was established with equipment merely sufficient to supply the requirements of the Athlone Cotton Weaving Mill.  I think that we should definitely take measures to encourage by State assistance, by inducements or otherwise the expansion of cotton spinning here.  It has always been the bottleneck in the development of the cotton industry.  During the war we got from Great Britain, which is our normal source of supply for cotton yarn, a ration which was at times so low as 2 per cent. of our pre-war requirements.  Again I think that this is an industry which, as far as the types of yarn that are mainly used in commerce are concerned, can be established here, although some exceptionally light or exceptionally heavy yarns may always have to be imported.</P>
    <P>In connection with the development of shipping services, I would like the Minister to take special interest in the development of our ship repairing yards.  It is possible, assuming normal conditions, to get the yards to proceed from ship repairing to ship building, but I think they will have to be given some form of assistance by the State, financial assistance, either in the form of a guarantee against loss or a subsidy, in order to get started.  There is no reason why we should hesitate; other countries have done it.  We have frequently had held up to us the achievements of Australia and New Zealand where there was a definite Government policy towards shipbuilding. A very substantial Government subsidy was given at the rate of so much per ton on all new ships launched.  I think that shipbuilding <Col N="1128" /> should be established and I think it can be done.</P>
    <P>In Dublin and Cork there are yards capable of being developed and equipped for shipbuilding as well as ship repairing.  It is important, of course, whatever we may do, that we should have adequate ship repairing facilities, assuming the possibility of another war.  I have in mind in that regard the early commencement of work on the new graving dock in Dublin. The Minister is aware that the previous Government promised the Dublin Port and Docks Board a grant of £500,000 towards the cost of constructing a new graving dock in Dublin. That promise, I presume, holds good, and the Dublin Port and Docks Board have got their plans for the construction of that graving dock ready. I think they should be encouraged to go ahead quickly.  They have, I think, been inclined to postpone the commencement of the work in the expectation that costs may fall at some future stage, but, having regard to the length of time it will take to complete it and the fact that the Government gave them the grant in order to get them to go ahead quickly with the work, they should not be allowed to delay it.  Its commencement now would do something towards minimising the problem caused by the termination of work at the timber fuel dumps at the North Wall, to which reference was made here last week.</P>
    <P>I have always been interested in the establishment here of what I might call a general engineering industry.  It is a key industry in every sense of the word.  I have always recognised that its establishment here would be difficult, unless we could give it certain bread and butter lines which would involve production all the year round. It is an industry which is, of course, very liable to trade fluctuations and I feel that we are not likely to get it established here, unless we can associate with it the workshops of Córas Iompair Éireann or some other enterprise of that kind, which necessarily involves the installation of equipment and the employment of skilled workers and which will have a regular flow of work.  Certainly, the problem of maintaining <Col N="1129" /> industrial equipment in working order during the emergency was gravely hampered by the fact that we had not got developed here anything in the nature of a general engineering industry.</P>
    <P>One other industry concerning which I am anxious for information is the project for the establishment, in the vicinity of Dublin, of a factory for the manufacture of electric motors and electric equipment.  That project was approved last year.  There were references to it in the Press and a company was formed, which, I think, acquired a site for the construction of the factory in the locality of Finglas. I am anxious to know from the Minister whether that project is proceeding, or if anything has happened to delay it.</P>
    <P>Since I shed my Ministerial responsibilities, I acquired some new sources of information and I should be anxious to interest the Minister in the manufacture of newsprint.  We are at present rationed in our supply of newsprint, mainly by currency difficulties, but it seems to me that, having regard to the enormous increase in the cost of newsprint during the war, its manufacture here should now be quite a practicable proposition.  It was always technically possible, but the difficulty was that the lowest level of cost at which we could see newsprint being produced here was substantially higher than that at which we could buy it in the slump years before the war.  I doubt very much if these slump years are likely to reappear for a long time and if we had then proceeded to establish a newsprint factory here and were engaged in the production of newsprint, we would I think be producing it at a very much lower price than that at which we can now buy it. It is, however, an industry to the possibilities of which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy has in mind, but there are newsprint factories in England, and there is one factory there at present <Col N="1130" /> exporting newsprint to the United States, believe it or not.  There is no reason why it should not be established in this country and operated here as efficiently as a similar factory in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we would have to import the wood pulp, or a substantial part of it, but that is the practice of the British factories and they are able to continue in operation on that basis. In an emergency, we could no doubt produce wood pulp of our own, but it would be dearer than that which we could now buy abroad.</P>
      <P>With regard to this whole question of industrial development, I should like the Minister to tell me whether he has interested himself at all in the plans announced by the administrator of the European Recovery Programme to encourage American businessmen to invest private capital in new productive enterprises in Europe.  The announcement, which came through the Associated Press, was that approximately £75,000,000 was to be invested in Europe in new industrial enterprises by American businessmen, with this inducement from the administrator of the European Recovery Programme to them to do so, that they would be facilitated by the American authorities in converting into dollars any dividends or profits earned on their investments. I was very much interested in that announcement and I think that the Minister should also be interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we passed the Control of Manufactures Act, which Act had behind it the primary purpose of ensuring that industrial development here would mainly take place under Irish ownership, but our particular concern at that time was the prospect that the imposition of protective duties here would lead to industrial development solely in the form of branch factories of British firms.  We feared that the British firms which had been previously supplying this market would get over the tariff barrier through the simple device of establishing branch factories here and we did not want industrial development of that kind, because such <Col N="1131" /> branch factories would not be extended beyond the minimum degree which would meet the requirements of their English owners and of course would disappear if, at any time, the tariff which caused them to come into being was removed.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the Control of Manufactures Act was to ensure that our industrial development would not take that form, and it is quite clear that the particular circumstances which make us hesitant about encouraging the investment of British capital in this country, because of the political influences or other influences which that capital might bring with it, do not necessarily apply to capital from other countries.  It is, I think, desirable that we should have, so far as we can ensure it, the direction of Irish industrial development in the hands of boards which meet in this country and which have a majority of Irish persons on them; but I see no reason why we should not make it known through the European Recovery Programme administration that we are interested in this plan they have for the encouragement of American businessmen to invest in industrial development in Europe in order to expand output and avail of that device, if it can be done, to secure the creation here of many of those industries of which we are in need and which, obviously, require a very heavy capital investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the development of exports.  I do not want to initiate a discussion here upon the trade agreement, but I want to say to the Minister that any case which the British Government are <Col N="1132" /> making that Article 1 of the Trade Agreement of 1938 does not oblige them to give free entry into Great Britain of our products is completely baseless, and, furthermore, that there are in the records of his Department documents in the form of correspondence between the Department and the British Trade Commissioner here which make it quite clear that, until last year, they accepted fully and without question the fact that that article placed that obligation on them.  Difficulties began to emerge when they made their Washington Loan Agreement.  Under that agreement, they were obliged to undertake not to discriminate against American goods, and, in so far as they wanted to limit the importation of goods from America to save dollars, they had to impose, at the same time, restrictions on the same goods coming from other sources, including this country.  We protested at the time and urged that the right we had under the 1938 Agreement could not be taken from us by any subsequent arrangement entered into by them with the United States.  Then they began to shift their ground and to argue that the requirements of their rationing and price control schemes necessitated the imposition of these restrictions, or that general balance of trade considerations justified them in cutting down their imports.  It was only when all these arguments did not diminish the force of our protest that they discovered this quibble that the article related to customs duty only and not to quantitative restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the article says, the whole agreement has to be considered in relation to the general atmosphere of the negotiations which produced it.  In these negotiations the British Government were pressing strongly for the abolition of quantitative restrictions altogether.  They were opposed in principle to the protection of industry by quotas and their aim in the negotiations was to get the Government here to agree to substitute quotas by tariffs.  They had given assurances that their policy was going to be framed upon that principle and that, in so far as restrictions might operate upon the importation of goods into Great Britain, they would be restrictions <Col N="1133" /> by way of tariff and not by way of quantitative regulation.</P>
    <P>It is in the knowledge of the general atmosphere of these negotiations that I say that they have no ground whatever for their interpretation of the Article or for the restrictions which they are now maintaining upon the import of industrial products from this country.  I do not think that their attitude is based upon hostility to our industrial development but, if that idea were to enter my head, if I thought that the case they were putting forward or the arguments upon which they were relying indicated that they were placing these restrictions upon imports from this country for the purpose of giving some form of protection to British industry or to prevent the development of industry here in the interests of British manufacturers, then I would not have the slightest hesitation in giving notice to denounce that agreement and bring it to an end.</P>
    <P>The agreement is, in fact, out of date.  I said that here when introducing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1946. There were circumstances which perhaps made it unnecessary or undesirable to give formal notice to denounce the agreement in that year.  The Minister will know what the circumstances were because I discussed the matter personally with the President of the Board of Trade, then Sir Stafford Cripps, and he met the particular case which I put forward by sending his officers over here last year to discuss the matters in relation to which the agreement was proving a source of difficulty to us, and they undertook to amend the agreement or to alter the operation of the agreement in respect of these matters.  But it was made clear to them on more occasions than one that we did not regard the treaty as being applicable to modern trade conditions at all or as serving our needs in these conditions and that, so far as we were concerned, we would much prefer to have it out of the way altogether. But I say this, that if their attitude in relation to the restriction of the export of Irish manufactured goods to the British market is based on anything except purely temporary difficulties <Col N="1134" /> of their own, is based on any desire to restrict our industrial development for the benefit of their own industrialists, then the sooner the treaty is terminated the better.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any economic future for this country, any possibility of our ever developing the economic strength required to protect our political freedom, unless we can develop our industries.  No advantage of any kind, however attractive it may appear for the time being to any other section of the community, should induce us to surrender in the least our power to develop our industrial arm.</P>
    <P>However, a particular point I want to refer to in regard to industrial exports is this: I announced in the Dáil in 1946 that I was preparing proposals for legislation to assist the development of an export trade in industrial goods. Certain proposals had at that stage been approved by the Government.  I reconsidered them myself later and did not proceed with the measure.  I had some doubts as to whether it was desirable to do so and, in any event, the general circumstances changed last year in a manner which made its introduction here less urgent than appeared in 1946.  I think, however, if we are going to get development of export trade in industrial goods, we must at least give those who engage in it the same facilities as the British give and as other countries give.  The British, for example, have their export guarantee scheme under which traders selling goods abroad are insured against losses arising from bad debts or the imposition of currency restrictions or the development of wars or other circumstances that may prevent them collecting upon consignments.  That scheme, which was introduced by the British Government before the war, has never involved the British Exchequer in the loss of a penny.  I am not at all sure that they did not make a profit on it but, in any event, it was of real assistance to their traders, particularly those seeking markets in South America or the Far East, where difficult financial and political conditions often emerge, and such a scheme would be of equal assistance to our firms.</P>
    <P>I think we must also establish some <Col N="1135" /> kind of marketing organisation.  Our problem in the development of export trade is the smallness of the individual production units.  I have frequently referred to the woollen trade as one with great export possibilities.  When our woollen manufacturers had an export business in the past, however, they got it by an arrangement under which their patterns were included in the pattern books sent out by British merchant houses.  These pattern books went all around the world and, when orders for the particular cloth manufactured by Irish manufacturers were received, they were transmitted to the Irish factories and filled from there.  It was a system that brought no goodwill to our industry.  The purchaser of the cloth did not even know it was made in Ireland.  He associated it with the merchant house that supplied it.  In present circumstances it could bring no foreign exchange to our aid either.  If our woollen mills are to develop independently in the export market then their lack of individual size must be compensated for by some combination amongst them to establish a marketing organisation which will enable them, first of all, to specialise in the production of the most profitable lines and, secondly, to offer a wide range of patterns and designs which foreign buyers will seek.  The same thing applies in other industries.  I would urge the Minister to direct his attention to the desirability of setting up some such marketing organisation or encouraging and assisting its establishment by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I think it is also true to say that there is a general idea that the Government is hostile to the development of the tourist business.  I know that idea has been offset to some extent by recent statements by some Ministers, but criticism of luxury hotels, of the activities of the Tourist Board, and so forth, has created that general idea in some quarters and it is very desirable that it should be removed.  This tourist trade is one of our largest export businesses.  I am not at all sure that it is not our largest export business and that of all the items which are included in the annual balance sheet representing our payments to <Col N="1136" /> and from other countries, receipts from tourist business are the biggest of all, far exceeding receipts from the sale of cattle or even of all agricultural produce.  It is undoubtedly enjoying a temporary boom and it may not always be in the favourable position it is in now but, if it is ever to attract that small proportion of the world's tourist business which would be of great significance to us, it is now that active measures must be taken to that end both in correcting any tendency on behalf of people engaged in holiday business to make hay while the sun shines and to reap a temporary profit regardless of future consequences, and in the general provision of facilities.  It has to be recognised that the American Government is taking measures to encourage American citizens to travel abroad and to spread a trail of dollars behind them as they do so.</P>
    <P>History records the fact that the great trade slump of 1929 was precipitated by the sudden return to America of American tourists following the stock market crash.  The flow of dollars to the rest of the world by American tourists in that year was enormous: its complete and sudden withdrawal deprived all countries of dollar supplies and, consequently, making it impossible for them to buy in America, largely contributed to the depth of the trade crisis which followed the stock market slump.  We do not want to rely entirely upon tourist trade from any one country and should try to attract them from all sources, because there is a certain insurance in doing that and because it would be less objectionable to our people if it developed on that basis.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Tourist Board is being facilitated in carrying out its functions.  I would like to say that I think I made a mistake of tactics in permitting the Tourist Board at any time to organise the formation of a subsidiary company to acquire and operate hotels.  The mistake arose from the fact that not merely was public opinion concentrated on that particular activity of the board but, perhaps even to an undue extent, the development <Col N="1137" /> of these hotels absorbed the time and attention of the directors of the board.</P>
    <P>The main purpose for which that organisation was set up, however, was to develop our holiday resorts, to provide at them the amenities, facilities and attractions which they lack and which we thought should be provided in the interests of our own people, apart altogether from whatever added inducements they might offer to the development of the tourist trade.  For a long number of years, the development of our Irish holiday resorts was neglected and that board was set up to develop them and also to protect our beauty spots against spoliation by the erection of ugly advertisements, petrol stations or other structures of that kind which might destroy their attractiveness and their value.</P>
    <P>The board ran into difficulties in its plans for the development of tourist resorts, difficulties mainly associated with the inability of local authorities to give them full co-operation.  The board was under legal obligation to make every undertaking a profit-making undertaking and advances were made to it from the Exchequer on the certificate from the board that the investment would yield a profit.  That being so, it was clear that they had to develop sites with the co-operation of local authorities in the provision of water supplies, sewerage works and so forth; and local authorities were not always able to keep in step with them.  Nevertheless, I would like to see them encouraged to get ahead with that work, by giving whatever additional powers are required to enable them to do it speedily.  The powers they got under the Act were very cumbersome.  There had to be a very long legal process followed before they could get working in any of these resorts, unless there was complete voluntary co-operation by the citizens and the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary to extend their powers, but I think it is necessary to give them instructions to go ahead with that particular part of their work and if, in order to ensure that they can concentrate upon that <Col N="1138" /> work, they are encouraged to instruct their subsidiary, Fáilte Teoranta, to dispose of their hotels, I think that would be not undesirable.  It was always the intention, anyhow, that these hotels, when developed as going concerns, would be disposed of by open sale.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer at length to the problem of turf production and I am not going to refer to it in any controversial manner.  I hope that we can get this question of developing what is a most valuable natural resource out of the contentious field.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered the proposals set out in the White Paper published in 1946.  If he has and has accepted them, there is no longer any difference of opinion amongst us as to the future development of our turf resources.  If he has considered them and considers them inadequate or insufficient, I would like him to tell us what his alternative plan is.  I am sure he recognises as well as anyone else that, if he can make our turf bogs a source of national wealth by exploiting them, it would be folly to neglect them.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister's announcement concerning mineral exploration is to be interpreted as meaning there is now a prospect that the exploration programme contemplated last year will be proceeded with, or that some exploration programme will be carried out.  If so, that is a welcome announcement.</P>
    <P>I feel I must make some reference to aviation.  I was very much disappointed by the apparent decision to change policy in relation to civil aviation and to limit the scope of its development, following the change of Government.  I had thought that the appointment of the Minister to his present office and of his Parliamentary Secretary to help him, was an indication that no change was involved, as I think they will be the first to admit that, at all times since the matter came under discussion by the Dáil, they gave no indication but one of whole-hearted approval of the policy which was being followed and of the plans which were being adopted.  I hope that these previous expressions of opinion from <Col N="1139" /> the Minister represent his real view and that they will ultimately prevail in that Department.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter of disappointment that the operations of Aer Lingus last year resulted in a loss.  I do not know whether the loss quoted by the Minister is an operational loss only or includes anything in respect of the purchase of Viking aircraft.  Again, I want to make it quite clear that, in the matter of the purchase of Viking aircraft, I alone had responsibility; the board of Aer Lingus and their technical advisers were not anxious to acquire those aircraft.  The British partners in the company were, of course, particularly concerned at the prospect that a company in which they had associations would not purchase this much-advertised British aircraft at a time when they were hoping to secure a world sale for it.</P>
    <P>At one stage, the discussions reached a point when it seemed possible that the Air Agreement we had made with Britain in 1946 would be terminated and at that stage I had discussions with the directors of the company, in which I intimated that I was not prepared to allow that agreement to fall upon the issue of the purchase of Viking aircraft&mdash;on which, of course, we had got from the manufacturers and from the British Government technical reports which appeared to be extremely favourable to them and which I thought were entitled to as much weight as the opinions of the technical officers of the company.  The aircraft were purchased.  They were not a success.  The technical officers of Aer Lingus were right.  It is not that they were unsafe in operation or incapable of being used, but that their high maintenance cost made them completely uneconomic and, ultimately, the decision was taken by the company to ground them completely; and, in fact, I think they are not now being used by any of the companies around the world which originally contemplated acquiring them.  In so far as the air company incurred a loss through the purchase of Viking aircraft, it was a loss which was in a sense imposed on them against their own technical advice and <Col N="1140" /> in consideration of the political matters to which I have made reference.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that if the operation of air transport services between this country and Great Britain could not be made completely profitable then air transport could not be profitable anywhere.  Assuming efficient management and economic aircraft, all the conditions for success are there. Not merely is there a heavy volume of traffic&mdash;Aer Lingus carried more passengers last year than the whole British European service&mdash;but there is a prospect of continuous all-the-year-round operation, which means that the number of aircraft in use can be related to the traffic and that they can fly always fully loaded.  In consequence of the agreement with Great Britain, the company has a monopoly on those services, so its fares do not have to be determined by the competition of other transport companies.  It is quite clear, therefore, so far as these British services are concerned that, as soon as the company is established on a proper basis of organisation and has solved the problem of getting economic aircraft suitable for the route, it should be a profitable undertaking.  The same, I think, applies to most of the Continental services planned, when the present restrictions in travel can be removed.  These services were begun before the present restrictions came into force.  They were, of course, badly hit by these restrictions, and their subsequent modification early this year does not overcome the difficulty.  I think it is desirable that we should establish ourselves upon certain Continental routes, but we must recognise the fact that profitable operation of these routes, whether on an all-the-year-round or seasonal basis, is not likely to be practicable until travel restrictions can be modified.</P>
    <P>The abandonment of the United States service was a very great shock to me.  Certainly when I brought to the Dáil in 1946 the legislation which preceded the inauguration of this service, the legislation which provided for the increase in the amount of the subsidy payable in respect of the air services and which implemented the agreement we had made with the <Col N="1141" /> United States Government, not a single Deputy spoke in any manner which suggested to my mind anything but the most complete approval of the decision to inaugurate that service.  The House was informed by me that the operation of the service would involve a loss for some years.  The dimensions of the loss could not be estimated.  The operation of a transatlantic service is on a different basis from the operation of services to Great Britain.  First of all, the very high standard of performance required by the aircraft engaged in the service involves charges for maintenance and overhaul very much higher than in the case of a shorter service.  Secondly, it is a highly competitive route and the rates of charge could not be adjusted to operating costs.  Nevertheless, it was thought that we could establish ourselves on that route at least as successfully as other companies on it.</P>
    <P>It is true that we had no experience. It is true that we had to train in the operation of the aircraft employed on the route everybody who would be engaged by the company in connection with the service&mdash;pilots, engineers and ground crews.  They were all sent to America to undergo a course of training. Some of them had to be kept there for a considerable period before they got their certificates of competency. However, on the basis of the high maintenance costs contemplated, it was assumed that in the first year the loss would not exceed approximately £150,000.  Subsequently that estimate was revised.</P>
    <P>The loss contemplated on the operations of Aerlinte was largely determined by the rental which Aer Lingus was to pay for Constellation aircraft when used on the British routes.  There does appear to have been considerable difficulty experienced by the company in preparing a reliable estimate.  Certainly in my period of office the estimate of the possible loss on the transatlantic service varied more than once. I understand that the latest estimate prepared by the company would, however, involve a reduction upon the amount stated in the Book of Estimates. Whether that is so or not does not matter.</P>
    <P>I think still that we should have proceeded <Col N="1142" /> with the service.  All the estimates were based on the assumption that the craft on the routes would be utilised only to the extent of 50 per cent., that there would be 50 per cent. of the possible load carried on each journey.  That is the normal, conservative basis of calculating the cost of operating a service.  Having regard to the experience of other companies on the transatlantic route this year and the substantial increase in the number of planes on the route which it was found necessary to make, I think that the actual experience would have proved that estimate of utilisation to be an unduly low one.</P>
    <P>Why should we develop our air services? It is not merely to provide travel facilities for our people but because it is desirable that these travel facilities should be provided by independent Irish organisations.  I feel that we suffered considerably by reason of the fact that we have not got available to us organisations for the provision of travel facilities outside Ireland under Irish control.  The operation of air services to Europe can be made not merely a source of national pride and prestige but financially profitable.  The establishment of these services under Irish auspices ensures employment for Irishmen, not merely in the ordinary day-to-day tasks of an air company or airport but in highly skilled occupations which would otherwise be closed to our people.</P>
    <P>Why should we develop the transatlantic air service?  Because we have got here conditions which, if we utilise them, could make this country a key point in the conquest of the North Atlantic by civil aviation.  We have also got advantages which other countries would spend a great deal to secure.  We have a fund of good-will in the United States which no advertising campaign could create, a traffic potential arising out of the association of millions of American citizens with this country and the desire which many of them will have to visit this country, a desire which could be fostered and turned into pay load for an Irish transatlantic company.  I hope that the revision of hastily-made decisions which the Government has already undertaken <Col N="1143" /> in regard to mineral development, in regard to the short-wave broadcasting station and other things will be extended in consequence of the influence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to civil aviation and that we will get a re-examination of the whole matter made on the basis of their own faith in the potentialities of the development as expressed here on many occasions before they became members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would tell us what is the future of the Prices and Efficiency Bill.  I know that that Bill is a possible cause of contention within the coalition, because during the election the Labour Party accused me of dropping the Bill and urged that I should be put out of office because I intended to drop it and that the Fine Gael Party stated that I should be put out of office for not dropping it.  Some Bill of that kind is required.  The pre-war machinery for price control was ineffective. It was not only ineffective, but it was on a wrong basis, because it was concerned only with profits and not with efficiency.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have proper supervision of protected industries it must be supervision which is related to efficiency and we should see to it that they will do their job well and not merely for the sake of profit alone.  I am also particularly interested in the enactment of the provisions of that Bill which relate to the establishment of industrial councils which will bring the representatives of the workers in each industry into conference with the employers to discuss and plan the development of the industry so far as the workers are interested and other matters.  It may be that we are proposing to go not quite so far as the British in that direction but I do not know that the British experience has been such as to discourage our following along their footsteps, at least to the extent proposed in that Bill.  I consider that the questions of policy that arise there are very much wider than they appear.  If we are going to have the development of the ordinary democratic way of conducting economic <Col N="1144" /> activities in this country then, to an increasing extent, trade union organisations must be made responsible for the solution of the problems of factory discipline in relation to which, in the past, they did not regard themselves as having any function except to protect the interest of their members.  That devolution of responsibility on trade unions is not justifiable, much less practicable unless they are to an increasing degree brought into a position of responsibility and authority in the general delineation of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I was going to speak about the price of meat but in view of the length of time I have already taken up I will pass over that point.</P>

      <P>The Minister told me, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that I fixed the price of meat on the basis of an average cost for prime beef in the Dublin market of 83/-; that the price went up to 90/3 in the first quarter of this year and that, in fulfilment of a promise made by me, he then increased the maximum price of meat by approximately slightly over 1d. per 1b.  If the present maximum price of beef is based upon the average price of 90/3 in the Dublin market, and if to-day's price, as reported in the evening papers, is 95/- to 96/&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the average for the quarter may be below that, but that is to-day's price.  Is it reasonable to expect the butchers to continue to sell at the prices fixed for meat if they continue to pay that price for beef?  How can the Minister justify an average retail selling price of 1/10½ per lb. imposed on the Dublin butchers when the Minister for Defence tells me that the cost to him of meat supplied from the abattoir to the Army is 1/10¾ per lb? Over and above the cost to the Army, the butcher has to maintain his shop, cut up the meat to suit the requirements of his customers and frequently to deliver it to them.  What I want to know is what the Minister's policy is in that regard.  Is it to keep the present average price of 1/10½ in operation <Col N="1145" /> and to tell the butchers that they should pay no more for cattle than the price which would enable them to sell at that fixed retail price with a profit and, if so, how can he reconcile it with the denunciation of the butchers by the Minister for Agriculture when they attempted to carry it out?</P>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that in relation to this question of the stock of timber in the Park and its disposal, he at least has a joint responsibility with me.  By chance I opened a volume of last year's Dáil Debates and in it I read a speech by Deputy Morrissey, who is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The reference is Dáil Volume 105, column 850, April 17th, 1947.  The extract reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister in so far as he can, side by side with the maximum effort to produce the greatest amount of turf, is just taking the ordinary precautions to build up over this summer. I know it is not the most suitable time for cutting timber.  I know that timber cut from now on to October will not be the best for burning but it is vital, in my opinion, that a big reserve of timber should be built up in the large centres of population. Otherwise I am afraid that the situation next winter will be infinitely worse&mdash;and that is, God knows, bad enough&mdash;infinitely worse than it was in the winter just passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having found that quotation by Deputy Morrissey I went through the Dáil Debates and I found a whole volume of similar quotations from people who were then Deputies and who are now Ministers.  Deputy Blowick spoke in this fashion on the 2nd July, 1947&mdash; Vol. 107, columns 696-7:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I therefore take this opportunity to point out to the Taoiseach that we are faced with at least as bad a fuel famine in the city as last year, because turf production does not seem to be going on with the same swing as in other years.  We will scarcely have as severe a winter this year so far as cold and snow are concerned, but there definitely will not be sufficient fuel for this city during the coming winter unless active steps are taken now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> We took those active steps.  We built up reserve stocks of firewood and turf and, having done so, coal became unexpectedly available.  I want to repeat that word &ldquo;unexpectedly&rdquo; because in October of last year I personally discussed with the British Minister of Fuel and Power the prospects of increasing coal delivery during that winter to this country.  There was, in fact, a time during the negotiations then proceeding when I was disposed to take the line that if they could not increase the supply of coal we were not going to continue to supply them with certain foodstuffs.  But tough as we tried to be, the reply of the British Minister of Fuel and Power was: &ldquo;We will not have enough coal for ourselves during this winter and we cannot increase deliveries of coal to Ireland before the 1st October, 1948.&rdquo;  One morning in December of last year in my office I got a telephone message to the effect that coal was coming in in unexpected quantities.  A few days later we got confirmation of the fact that it was coming in on the orders of the British Minister of Fuel and Power and that supplies were, in fact, sufficient to enable us to abolish rationing. The stock of timber which we accumulated in the Park is still there. It cannot be left there indeflnitely because it will deteriorate and it is undesirable that it should be allowed to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>If necessary the Government should be prepared to face a substantial loss on it by disposing of it at a much lower price.  Nobody will buy it at £4 a ton, but if the price is cut some people will be glad to purchase it.  They cannot get back the money it cost by maintaining the price but the poor of Dublin and others will have a temporary windfall in the form of cheap fuel by reason of these reserve stocks if it is now disposed of to them.  If I thought that these stocks would preserve their burning quality for a protracted period I would be much more hesitant about advising the Minister to get rid of them.  The situation is such at the moment that we should not dispose of reserve stocks of anything. However, it is the fact that these stocks will deteriorate that prompts me to urge the Minister to dispose of <Col N="1147" /> them&mdash;if necessary by cutting the price.</P>
    <P>I would be glad, with regard to the International Labour Conference, to know whether we can expect to get published to us here a report of the proceedings similar to that which it has been the practice to publish in other years, even though a full delegation was not present.  I understand that our Minister in Washington or that the Consul-General in San Francisco was instructed to attend as a delegate and, if so, presumably he made a report.  Even if we cannot get a report of the full kind, containing a synopsis of the speeches made, as on the previous occasion, we should nevertheless get a formal report of the conventions adopted or the recommendations approved by the conference.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has in contemplation a review of the Industrial Relations Act.  I think the time has come when it would be useful for him to enter into discussions with the organisations representing trade unions and employers as to the operations of that Act.  I do not think that the time has arrived when any substantial amendment of it should be undertaken but there have been complaints that the procedure established under it leads to undue delay; that that delay could be avoided and that, in some respects, the Act could be improved even without altering its essential character.  In particular, I have a feeling that the whole scheme for conciliation in industrial disputes is defective in one regard.  We planned that Act in consultation with these organisations on the assumption that all the process of conciliation would be exhausted before there would be recourse to the court and that the award of the court would be final; that after the court had made an award there would be no obligation upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce or upon the court to intervene in any dispute that was consequential upon a refusal to accept an award of the court.  Experience has shown that it has not worked out that way.  The machinery of conciliation is not utilised fully or, if utilised, it is merely as a preliminary to having <Col N="1148" /> recourse to the court and that in a great many cases recourse to the court is automatic and, in some cases, trade disputes have followed the publication of the court's award.  I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should intervene in such disputes.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages I saw in that Act is that it put the Minister for Industry and Commerce out of the picture so far as trade disputes are concerned and I am glad the present Minister has not been disposed to depart from that policy.  At the same time, it seems to me that it might be useful to give the court itself some power to direct one of its conciliation officers to intervene to some extent in a dispute, even if that dispute has followed upon the rejection by either the employer or the workers of a recommendation of the court.  There is, at present, the difficulty that if there is to be a meeting of the parties in such a dispute they have to agree together to meet and no third party has got formal authority to summon them to meet, which is often necessary because of the feeling which either party in the dispute may have that the suggestion of a conference is a sign of weakness.  That is why we had in recent disputes the Lord Mayor of Dublin and other citizens intervening.  That may be all right but it has been my experience that these unofficial interventions in trade disputes do not always produce the best results, and very infrequently produce a settlement at all.  If there is to be some intervention in such disputes, even at that stage, it had better be official intervention by a conciliation officer appointed by the court rather than by some unofficial person who can have no previous knowledge of the history of the dispute and who would be merely concerned to effect a settlement by compromise.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has given consideration to the problems arising out of the Apprenticeship Act or to the problem which is inherent in the reluctance of certain trade unions to admit an adequate number of apprentices to their trades.  On the assumption that the average tradesman is available for work for 25 years after he has finished his apprenticeship, it is quite clear that the ratio of apprentices <Col N="1149" /> to craftsmen should be one in five in order to maintain the number of workers necessary in the craft.  There is not, so far as I know, in any of the building crafts a normal ratio of apprentices.  The most recent figures available show that against a normal ratio of one in five the number of apprentices in carpentry is now one to nine journeymen; amongst bricklayers it is one to 12; amongst plasterers, it is one to 13; amongst painters, it is one to 15; and amongst masons, it is one to 25.  From that, it is quite obvious that the present number of apprentices in these trades is not sufficient even to maintain the present number of craftsmen and all the indications are that we require an increase in the number of craftsmen.  That matter will have to be settled by negotiation and discussion primarily.  It seems to me that responsibility for initiating such a negotiation and discussion falls most naturally upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is possible that the Minister for Local Government will now take over functions which the Minister for Industry and Commerce previously had in the regulation of matters concerning the building industry.  In that case, the responsibility might be his but the administration of the Apprenticeship Act is still, I take it, the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak about our internal transport problem at any length. The Minister has brought over an expert to report to him in three or four months.  I am sure, however, that he realises how urgent the problem is. Here is our main transport undertaking losing money, as I understand it, at the rate of about £20,000 per week. The Minister has refused to allow that transport undertaking to increase its fares and that situation is going to remain unchanged until the expert has reported.  This stabilisation of fares at their present level and these heavy losses accruing to the company week after week show, in all the circumstances, the obvious urgency of getting action as quickly as possible.  There is the statement made by the Chairman of the Great Northern Railway Company published in this evening's papers.  Evidently there is going to be <Col N="1150" /> a problem in relation to that concern also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, of course, aware that I was asked for more than that.  I was asked to give them the right to increase fares, close down further branch lines, reduce maintenance to the point of dismissing 2,500 men and to restrict the operation of private transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that.  My information came solely from the statements made at the recent meeting of shareholders and, so far as I know, the only reference there was to the increase in fares.  The point I want to make, however, is that we have not got all the time in the world to examine this question leisurely and to prepare an elaborate report on it. Goodness knows, we have had reports enough by experts and commissions upon our transport problem and I am not at all sure that any one of them added a great deal to our knowledge of the essentials of the problem.  If we are to have that problem properly tackled, there is available to the Minister in the offices of the transport branch of his Department a number of experts who will be able to advise him just as well as anybody he can bring in.  However, he has committed himself to this expert and the only thing I ask him to do is to urge upon that expert the realisation that time is not merely money but time is vital to Córas Iompair Eireann in this case.</P>

      <P>Nationalisation does not matter a rap in this connection. Here is a company operating rail and road transport services and losing money on them.  It would not cease to lose money even if you nationalised it or appointed a different board of directors.  The essence of the problem is far deeper than that and the sooner Deputy Davin faces up to the fact that nationalisation is a mere trifle in relation to this problem, the sooner he will be able to understand what we have been trying to do here and what the present Government must, I think, try to continue in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether opposed to the maintenance of some element of competition.  I must confess that when we passed that legislation in 1945, I hoped that public transport as organised through Córas Iompair Eireann would be able to carry out its plans for procuring new and more efficient equipment far more rapidly than the private traders and that the company would be able to provide, through the fulfilment of its plans, such a widespread transport service at such reasonable prices that the average trader would not be induced to purchase a lorry.  Events worked out quite the reverse.  The coal crisis, on the one hand, and difficulties encountered by the company in procuring steel and other necessary materials on the other hand, delayed their plans while, unexpectedly, numbers of new lorries became available for purchase by private traders, who purchased them and will continue to operate them.  That is the essence of the problem the company has to face. There are twice as many lorries in the country now as before the war and, in so far as private traders will continue to use them, the volume of traffic available to the company has diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I based my expectation in 1945 that the railways would be able to extend their services more rapidly than road transport would recover from the <Col N="1152" /> effects of the war upon various factors. One was the announcement, which then appeared to be authoritative, that supplies of rubber would not recover for five years.  We were told the Japanese had destroyed the rubber plantations, but it was found when the areas were cleared of Japanese that the rubber plantations were flourishing and expanding and the first commodity which came into full supply was rubber.  It helped to expedite the expansion of road transport services far more rapidly than seemed likely in 1945.</P>
    <P>I still think that even though events turned out much different from what we foresaw, the essence of the problem depends upon the discovery of methods of operating rail transport with such equipment that the cost of carrying each ton of merchandise will be substantially reduced.  On the basis of increased freights there can be no future for it.  Increased freights may be a temporary palliative until a long-term plan is practicable, but it is the reduction of cost of transporting goods by rail that will make it possible to get traffic in competition with the privately owned lorry.</P>

The Minister spoke about the rationing of bread and he assured us that he hoped he would get available next year enough wheat to maintain the existing bread ration.  I see an announcement in this evening's papers, made by the Press Association, that the British are going to end bread rationing.  That announcement may not be authoritative; it may not be true, but I should think that we would look with very considerable disfavour upon the development of conditions in which the British were spending dollars to buy enough wheat to end bread rationing <Col N="1153" /> in Britain if we were restricted in our purchases, either through currency limitations or decisions of the International Emergency Food Council, and on that account compelled to continue with bread rationing.</P>

      <P>There is that also.  In that connection I was quite interested from one point of view in the Minister's announcement that he is establishing a committee to enquire into the necessity to continue the subsidy on flour.  I can tell him in five minutes everything that the committee can tell him.  There is no industry in this country about which the Department has got so much information as it has about the baking industry or the flour-milling industry. They can tell you exactly how much a sack of flour should cost in relation to the price of wheat and how much a loaf of bread should cost in relation to the price of flour.  All that information has been accumulated through numerous investigations.  The only question to be inquired into with regard to continuing the subsidy on flour is by how much do you want to allow the price of bread to go up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is. That committee will not have to spend a lot of time before it completes its inquiries.  The officials in the Department can write out a report and have it ready for signing before the committee meets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note a statement by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, that he hopes that it will not be many months until the Government give evidence of the fact that they will accept the principle of workers being represented on some of the boards of semi-State undertakings. I would like to say this in that regard, that while I am aware that there are in the trade union movement many individuals who are highly competent and worthy in every way for appointment to the boards of these State or semi-State companies, I do not think that was quite what the Minister for Social Welfare had in mind.  He had <Col N="1154" /> in mind the appointment on these boards of persons who would be representative of the workers employed by the boards.  That, I think, would be an undesirable practice.  I think members of these boards should have one loyalty only, and that is to the undertaking. Their concern should be the welfare of the undertaking; they should not go there as representatives of any body seeking to promote the interests of those they represent, even against the interests of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>While I would strongly approve any tendency to select, from the trade union movement, people who are suitable for appointment on these boards and to appoint them thereto, I think that they should not be regarded or asked to regard themselves as the representatives of the workers in the industry.  That is the problem, the problem that, even though you may take a man who has no relations with the trade union catering for the workers concerned, he nevertheless will regard himself as the representative of the workers and will regard his function on the board as being to get better conditions or increased pay for the workers and will not concern himself so much with the general welfare of the undertaking.  That is why trade union representatives can rarely be considered from that aspect until they have retired.  I know there are a number of them who would make excellent directors.  It is the experience of other countries that it is unwise to appoint people on the boards of these undertakings representing anybody except the Minister or having any responsibility except to make the concern a success.  I could talk on matters affecting industry and commerce all night, but I had better not fall into that temptation, so I will leave it at that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate, to my mind, is equally important with the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. With all due deference to the farmer Deputies who, on so many occasions, tell us the agricultural community is the only wealth producing factor in our nation, it is just as well to remember that of equal importance is every worker who applies himself to <Col N="1155" /> any other product which adds to the general wealth of the community.  That happens not only in agriculture, but also in industry.  One of the fears that I have is that in this period we may possibly fail to realise that alongside a correct agricultural policy we also require a correct industrial policy and that it is very necessary we should pay attention to that.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the Minister's introductory speech. Possibly there are very good reasons. Since he has taken up office he has had a number of problems falling on his shoulders, not all of his own personal making and not all of the making of the Government with which he is connected. At the same time I think we ought to realise that the time has now certainly come to make it possible, and not merely possible but essential, that we should apply ourselves to this problem of a general national industrial policy.  That is why I feel that the question I asked the Taoiseach some time ago, as to the possibility of establishing something in the nature of a national economic council, should be given more attention and examination, to see if more fruitful avenues of development might be opened up.  I quite realise that, not only in this House but outside it, there are entirely different views as to the value of planning and forecasting our future line of development but the view that no planning is necessary to my mind is childish, because quite clearly no community, no concern, no deliberative Assembly can carry on its business for a day without trying to see to some extent into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is good business or policy for an industrial concern, a firm, or any other body engaged in any human activity, it must be equally so for a nation or community, especially a community placed in our position, where not only have we gone through a period of a certain type of industrial development largely conditioned by the industrial policy of one political Party, but have gone through a period of emergency and now find ourselves not merely in a period of post-war conditions but as many speakers have said <Col N="1156" /> in a period prior to the outbreak of war.  In conditions of that nature, it is surely desirable not only to evaluate the resources we have both in the way of natural resources and our industrial resources, but to see what the gaps in our defence are and to ascertain what we should do to fill these gaps in the best possible way.  That is planning in the ordinary, sensible manner.  Surely if we are dealing with a community embracing the whole of our national territory, that type of planning cannot be done by one industrial group.  It cannot be done by one Department.  It must embrace all the deliberative resources of Government, all the sources of information apart from all the sources of experience and of trained knowledge available to the community. That in effect must be summarised in the form of some natural centre which will collect all the information, analyse it and make it available to the community in general.  That is very important at the moment, because of certain views expressed in the Minister's statement and in Deputy Lemass's speech.</P>
    <P>May I say, in passing, that while his speech was quite long there was not a word in it to which I could object.  We may differ in the point of view which we take in regard to certain matters, but nevertheless I regarded his speech as a notable contribution to the solution of the many difficult problems with which the nation is at present faced.  Unlike some of the speeches to which we have been treated recently, notably in the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, which were obviously intended as an effort to make propaganda and Party capital out of the discussion, his speech appeared to be a sincere attempt to deal with the various problems connected with this Estimate as they appeared to him.  As I say, while I do not agree with a great many of his views, his example might be profitably followed by many members of his Party just as, possibly, much of the advice which he gave could be considered by many Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>One thing with which I am concerned, apart from the need of trying to understand our general industrial <Col N="1157" /> and economic position, is the general insistence on the fact that we must study our immediate situation and try to fill certain gaps in our industrial organisation because of the immediate danger of war.  I am no more insensible than any other Party in this country to what is going on outside the country. At the same time I think it well that we should not allow ourselves to be forced into the position that may cost us more than we are in a position to afford.  Before there is an outbreak of war one thing sure is that the social and economic conditions conducive to war have got to be there first.</P>
    <P>My own opinion at the moment is that although there is a very dangerous situation in the events which we see developing around us, matters have not reached that critical point yet at which war is inevitable.  The last war developed out of a very small incident but everyone who studied conditions before that particular incident occurred, knew that the development of economic and social affairs had reached such a point that all that was required was a match to set things alight and the match was provided.  In the present situation we have scarcely seen the passage of a period of more than two years since the end of active hostilities and to my mind&mdash;I may quite probably be wrong&mdash;we have not yet seen the development of a situation in regard to social and economic conditions and the building up of a machine which make possible the outbreak of another war.  There is always the possibility that a maniac may break loose but apart from that possibility there has not been that type of development which would render war inevitable.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite definite that despite all these recent developments in Europe we can still, with a certain amount of confidence, count on some years yet in which we can live as normal human beings and pursue our normal way of life.  That, however, does not mean that the advice given to us to take active measures to prepare for an emergency should not be considered and acted upon but it does mean that if we take measures for building up stocks of raw materials, <Col N="1158" /> and if we take them in the atmosphere of being immediately threatened by an outbreak of war, we may commit ourselves to acquiring these stocks at a cost far and above what we would be justified in paying in normal circumstances, whereas if we display a little less anxiety we may be able to achieve the same end at a smaller price to ourselves.</P>
    <P>In a discussion on our industrial policy in relation to our needs, we should sit down calmly and try to evaluate as clearly as we can the needs of the present situation.  Above all, we should realise as far as practicable that, so far as the man in the street in this country is concerned, our only knowledge and the only basis on which we can evaluate the situation outside this country, is that supplied by what is often the completely distorted picture presented to us by the daily Press.  I have never known a period when the reports in the daily Press were less to be relied upon than during the last few years.  From that point of view we should, as I say, very carefully study and analyse the present situation.</P>
    <P>So far as our internal policy is concerned I do not want to traverse all the ground covered by Deputy Lemass but I do think it necessary to make one comment.  Both the Minister in his statements outside the House, and Deputy Lemass here, have stressed the importance of the part played in the development of our national economy by private enterprise.  Nobody with any sense of proportion would deny that viewpoint.  I do not for a moment forget that we are still living in an economy based on private enterprise and on the profit motive.  The only point upon which I wish to join issue is that we should place so much emphasis on that aspect of our economy and concentrate upon it.  For a long period Deputy Lemass had a rather socialistic outlook but at a certain point about 1945 he began to deviate to some extent from that and he seemed to pay more regard to the interests of private ownership and private control.  I am not going to argue the merits of that policy but it does seem to me that too much <Col N="1159" /> emphasis has been placed upon it.  My point is that in critical periods we have found time after time that private enterprise does not deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>In relation to certain spheres of industrial development, we know from experience that private enterprise will not undertake these tasks and carry them out.  The reason given for that by Deputy Lemass is that private enterprise is actuated only by the profit motive.  In other fields of industrial activity we require gaps to be filled in our structure, some of which have been attempted by Deputy Lemass.  But private enterprise will not carry out the job or take the risk because it is a gamble.  It may be that the return is uncertain or not sufficiently high, and so they sit back and wait for somebody else to do it.  There are many of those gaps to be filled, such as the development of our power resources and probably of our peat resources, and the development of certain industrial supplies of artificial manure, and possibly even experimental forms of new industries.  All these developments are required from the point of view of making us as nearly self-sufficient as we reasonably can expect to be.  I believe that is a duty devolving on the Government to take the lead in the case of these particular avenues and not to sit back and wait.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the general tariff policy of the Government and gave an indication of his anxiety to have not merely Irish capital coming in but capital from outside the country as well.  I welcome his statement that his tariff policy is going to be one designed to encourage the development of Irish industry on the basis of producing goods at a reasonable price, under efficient conditions and with reasonable conditions for the workers employed, but I think something more definite than that is required&mdash;that is the intention of using the tariff policy of the Government and the resources of the community to see that a certain line of industrial development is achieved, that a certain impetus is given to it, and that we achieve certain known objects within a certain period <Col N="1160" /> of time and not sit back and wait for some gentleman either with Irish or with foreign money to come in and undertake the tasks which are immediately required from the point of view of the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>There was one item that I was glad to hear the Minister mention, and that was with reference to the consideration which is now being given to mineral exploration.  In the course of the Budget debate I mentioned that I thought it was not only a pity but that no case could be made for the elimination of the sum of £85,000 from the Estimate.  I would urge on the Minister to use whatever influence he can bring to bear to have that money restored, if not for the development and working of the mines at Avoca.  My understanding of the way in which the money was to be spent was completely different from the way in which, apparently, it was going to be spent.  My understanding was that we had made available a certain sum for the continuation of the working of the Slievardagh coalfields until we had put them in a position in which we could hope to dispose of them commercially, and that this sum of £85,000 was for general mineral exploration. Then it seemed that its expenditure was largely to be concentrated on the development of Avoca. There seems to be a wide divergence of opinion as to whether Avoca is a practical proposition or not.  If it is not, is there not a case for spending the £85,000 on what I believe was the original intention&mdash;that is, for national mineral explorations on an organised scientific basis.  It seems to me to be a pity that in that particular line, on which there is such a general measure of agreement, we should pause even for a moment on the expenditure of even a larger sum than £85,000 on mineral exploration when we realise that quite a long time may elapse before we may be able to bring together such an expert team of research engineers as that which is now available.  If we do not utilise their services now they will be scattered and may not be available when required.</P>
    <P>I think it would be suicidal not to come to a decision immediately to make that £85,000 again available as well as to indicate that that is a type <Col N="1161" /> of activity that we propose to encourage and develop as widely as we possibly can.  Sooner or later we will have to make up our minds that it is on the basis of such knowledge as we can acquire in regard to the natural resources we have in the country that we can build and get to understand what we may have to seek from outside.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the timber fuel which is lying in the Phænix Park.  I do not want to follow Deputy Lemass on that.  I think he is aware that we could have ceased buying timber much earlier than we did this year.  The problem that we are faced with now is that we have the timber there.  I do want to suggest to the Minister, and I am speaking now from my own knowledge, that he should take the bull by the horns and go to the Department of Finance and tell them that this timber has to be got rid of, and that the longer it is left there the greater the loss is going to be.  We know, of course, that the Department of Finance usually takes a long time to make up its mind on matters of this kind.  I think that, if the timber is allowed to remain there for a much longer period, the problem will probably solve itself, and that in the end there will be very little left but heaps of dust.  What we have there at the moment is timber fuel, and it could be disposed of at a price which would be within the capacity of the poorest sections of the people in Dublin to-day.  It would be not only a good financial policy to do that, but it would also be good social policy to dispose of the timber fuel in that way than wait until, as I have said, it cannot be disposed of.  If a decision is not come to quickly the problem will solve itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke of the air services. I would be very slow to suggest for the moment that the air services should not be developed.  It is correct to say that, in Aer Lingus, we have on the Dublin-London route what is generally regarded as one of the most profitable lines in civil aviation operating in Europe to-day.  Why is it, in view of that, that we have been launched in the present mess?  It is <Col N="1162" /> not merely a question of the buying of the Vikings or of the preparation or development of flights to the Continent and having them discontinued that is involved.  The mess has been there all along, and sooner or later somebody will have to step in and clear it up. Anybody who has had dealings with the company knows that you have there tier upon tier of administrators dealing even with simple trade union questions. You find it hard to discover who is the person that has responsibility.  My belief is that one of the difficulties is that the company has been operating on a Civil Service basis.  One of the peculiar answers made to one of our people when we talked about this question of overloading on the administrative side was that, in fact, they were short-handed because they had not yet reached full establishment strength. That seems to me to be an indication of the kind of organisation we have to deal with.</P>
    <P>While I am fully in favour of maintaining Aer Lingus as far as cross-Channel and Continental flights are concerned, it seems to me that if the services are to be maintained and if we are to retain such advantages as we have there, we must insist that immediate steps be taken in inquire into the whole operation of the company from the ground up.  For too long we have allowed it to operate in this way and we have had one of two peculiar instances of what is going on.  We should have this inquiry, not from the point of view of economy or of proving that this type of air policy was wrong but from the point of view that the company is started and of expanding the air policy we are committed to.  As far as the transatlantic air service is concerned, I want to be quite frank in saying that at the time when Deputy Lemass, as Minister, introduced this Estimate, I did not express any opinion against it.  I was not convinced by him that he was correct, yet I did not feel that I knew enough about the question to stand up and argue on points of which I was not convinced.  We are going to see, I think, as far as profitable first-class passenger traffic is concerned, a by-passing of this country in the transatlantic route.  I have yet to <Col N="1163" /> see in any of the arguments which have been so far adduced that there is more than the remotest possibility that the amount of money that we must commit ourselves to, both for the actual operation of the planes and their maintenance and the money invested in the development of aerodromes with all modern conveniences is warranted under present conditions.</P>
    <P>While I agree with having cross-Channel and Continental services, there is a gamble involved in the transatlantic services and we have not got any guarantee that this country will not be by-passed as least as far as first-class passenger traffic is concerned.  It happened with regard to steamships, and the technical development of aeroplanes will leave us in the same condition. We will find ourselves committed to large capital expenditure as well as current expenditure from year to year and the opportunity will be denied to us of reaping the benefit of the money we have invested.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to our shipping needs and to shipbuilding. I do not want to dwell upon this point but I would urge the Minister not to allow us to make the same mistake as we made before the last war of neglecting to provide ourselves with merchant shipping until we were bled white later in the emergency in order to obtain ships to keep our lifelines open.  If countries like Norway, Sweden and Denmark which are not countries with any colonial possessions, merely ordinary homelands confined to their own shores, can maintain, not merely merchant fleets from the point of view of their national needs, but from the point of view of commercial profits, surely we can do the same.  Our needs of shipping services, both deep sea and coastal, are as great as the needs of any nation in Europe.  We have already got the nucleus of a fleet and this should be maintained and built up.</P>
    <P>In addition to our deep-sea and coastal needs, there is the point which has been made by Deputy Lemass that the two shipbuilding yards here must not be allowed again to go down, and they are near it at the present time. We should maintain them, not merely <Col N="1164" /> by seeing that they have a measure of repair work, but by seeing that they are given actual Government encouragement as far as shipbuilding is concerned. It is a mistake not to have looked into the possibility of having them build some ships, even ships of smaller tonnage for Irish Shipping, and the fact that some of the ships which were put on our lines lately were not built in the Dublin yard was a very grievous mistake and one which we should bear in mind in future.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to refer to is that I am sorry the Minister did not refer in his speech to the question of price control.  It seems to me that this is one of the vital subjects upon which we must have some guidance, guidance of an immediate character, both from the Minister and from the Government as a whole.  Tied up with price control, we have the thorny question of industrial efficiency.  The fact that there were different views on different sides of the House regarding the Industrial Efficiency Bill is no reason why we should not realise that it is a problem we have to tackle and that we should find the means of tackling it. We need price control because we have not found the means of relating prices to production costs.</P>
    <P>It is a very peculiar thing that since the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance, advertisements have been appearing on all the papers from the leading drapers protesting their innocence and explaining how they kept within the strict confines of the law in the matter of excess profits.  It is also a peculiar thing that there has been a host, a regular flood, of sales all over the city.  I am maybe too innocent, but I believe that prices at sales are marked down, although sometimes I may have my suspicions.  It is a very peculiar thing that at the time when we have had so much talk and so much comment and references to the matter by the Minister for Finance, we should suddenly find this slashing of prices all round.  It cannot be entirely accidental. We require price control although recent developments may be the aftereffects of the emergency.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of internal <Col N="1165" /> policy and of industrial policy, if we are to encourage <i>entrepreneurs</i> and manufacturers to produce and to establish industries, if we are to enable them to enter into the earning of profits, profits should be made available to them and a guarantee of the willingness of the community to carry the costs of helping to provide them, but we must have the machinery to keep a check on the business.  It does not necessarily mean that it should be a harsh check or a strict check, but it must be an effective check.  We must not deal with prices in terms of the money charged by the retailer to the consumer but in relation to efficiency. I do not see how this Government, any more than the previous Government can side-step the responsibility of providing the machinery to deal with price control as such and with efficiency from the point of view of the burden that is being carried by the community in order to build up industry, and at the same time provide the opportunity for profits to be made by those who invested money in industrial development.</P>
    <P>We have had repeated appeals to all sections of our workers, agricultural workers and industrial workers, to give of their best efforts to increase production.  There is, I think, a gradually broadening realisation among workers that this involves something more than an effort on the part of employers to pull a fast one on them or to put one over on them.  They are beginning to realise that they have an interest themselves in increasing production, but the obstacles in the way are tremendous.  It is not merely a question of brute strength or of pouring out a little more sweat, but it requires the application of brains, technical skill and experience.  The only way in which the application of these particular qualities can be carried out is by having some access on the part of the workers to the managerial sphere of industry. The claim for some voice in the management that we hear from the workers is not a case of, as it were, pushing a door, but the logical outcome of the demand which has been made on them by the Government and industrialists.  If industrialists want increased co-operation from their <Col N="1166" /> workers and an effort to increase production, if the workers are given the opportunity of utilising their knowledge and their experience at the council table, it might be the best way of achieving that increased production. What do we find?  We find that, when this very mild suggestion is made, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers gets up on its hind legs and tells us that under no condition will they agree to labour having any say in management, while, at the same time, they go into conferences with the representatives of the workers and appeal to them to co-operate in increasing production. Surely the whole thing is farcical and sooner or later we will have to have some policy laid down in the matter.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the State and the Government should give a lead by affording representation on semi-State bodies to representatives of the workers is one way in which we can take the first step.  I personally agree that to put on to the board of a semi-State company a direct representative of the workers actually engaged in that industry will create very great difficulties, not merely from the point of view of the board of directors, but from the point of view of the union from which that person comes and of the individual himself, but I cannot see why representatives should not be put on these boards from the point of view of workers as a whole as part of the community.  We already put certain people on these boards and I take it for granted that some of these are appointed because of their financial knowledge, others because of their administrative knowledge and still others because of their industrial knowledge.  At the same time each of them in himself represents to some extent a particular section of the community and makes a certain contribution to it.  Why, therefore, should we not have a representative of the workers, of either hand or brain, engaged in industry as a whole on these bodies?</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties I see, and one of the defects in these semi-State bodies, is the failure to realise that they are not going to get efficiency and not going to put these companies on a paying basis merely by dealing with <Col N="1167" /> figures and technical matters and ignoring completely the human element. My experience is, and I am being quite frank, that in respect of the ordinary workers engaged by these bodies, more consideration and more human feeling is shown by the private employer than by these impersonal boards which we have set up.</P>
    <P>That, in my view, is the cause of a great deal of the difficulty.  We have already got it in an acute form in some of our semi-State bodies, even to the extent of actual labour disputes.  We have it particularly bad at times in our air services and there should be no need of it, because, if these are communally-owned enterprises which are run for the benefit of the community and which are answerable to the House, there is no reason why we should not be able to establish better human relationships between those we appoint to managerial posts and the workers carrying on the enterprise, than the individual employer who is dependent on his ability for maintaining his own personal position and the position of his company and extracting profits out of the labour of his employees.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to our transport position.  I do not want to dwell on it, but I suggest that, in the inquiry at present being carried on, we might have regard to one simple fact which, so far as I know, all the inquiries carried on with regard to our rail and road problem have forgotten, that is, that, in our rail system, we have ordinary men, men who work with their hands or men engaged in managerial or technical activities, who could give us a lot of very valuable advice not merely on how to run railways but on how to avoid running them in the way in which they have been run in the past few years.  I suggest that the railway expert who has been brought over from England should be advised that he will get a great deal of very valuable information, not by calling in those who are apparently what might be called the front for our railway monopoly or road system, but by going behind the scenes and making direct contact with the men who have to carry on the system 24 hours a day <Col N="1168" /> and who know that, in recent years, the rail system here has been run into the ground not by a competing privately-owned system on the roads but by those running the rail system who have had a road mentality.</P>
    <P>I feel that so far as transport is concerned, we have to make up our minds with regard to it, just as we do with regard to posts and telegraphs.  It is a public service and if we are to have it, we must do without many other things. One of these things is the facility of the private individual to take the cream of the public transport system when it suits him at a very cheap rate, and, at the same time, run his own private system on the paying loads, the big loads, and always be able to call, in an emergency, on the reserves which have to be made available by a public company.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that changing the name does not mean anything and the question of whether we nationalise transport or not will not solve the problem, but one thing will, that is, unlike both the British Labour Government and Deputy Lemass when putting the Transport Bill through the House, making up our minds to take our courage in our hands and deciding that if are to have an efficient transport system it must be all-embracing and that we cannot allow exceptions.  Otherwise, we will have no transport system and will continue to have that very grave industrial problem in front of us.</P>
    <P>So far as the Labour Court is concerned, I think the time has come to discuss not major amendments of the Act but the actual experience we have gained in operating this machinery.  The Minister should inquire into it because it is he who will have to take the initiative in calling the bodies together and letting them exchange opinions, with a view to finding out what are the difficulties in the administration and utilisation of the machinery and how we can improve it in the light of the experience gained in the two years we have been using it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise the question of transport in relation to the use of lorries not in the service of the transport company.  I <Col N="1169" /> am sure that every Deputy has had the experience recently, and particularly since motor vehicles became available to the public at the end of the war, of requests to place before the Department demands for plates in respect of lorries for hire purposes. The answer has always been in the same terms.  I understand that one of the reasons for that answer is that it is undesirable that there should be any new people entering into competition with the transport company, Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think there is a very big principle involved here. By reason of the peculiar circumstances existing in this country, an agricultural country to a large extent and a country in which there is not a very great network of railways, transport to and from distant parts of the country, those parts which are not easily accessible, should be left as much as possible in private hands and subject to as much competition as possible.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann, plus some other persons who are in possession of plates, have a complete monopoly of the transport of goods at the moment, and it is very difficult to deal with people who know that they have such a monopoly.  I think that if we had competition in the country districts, it would be for the benefit of trade in general.</P>
      <P>I know that the argument is that if you allow more lorries on the road as public hauliers, the time will come when you will have to buy them out, in the interests of keeping Córas Iompair Éireann on its feet, but, so far as I can see at present, it is going to be impossible to put Córas Iompair Éireann on its feet at all, with the consequence that the country will suffer.  There is a big matter of principle involved.  You have to go one of two ways.  You have either from now on to say that the transport policy will be based on the fact that you must not do anything that will injure the earning capacity of Córas Iompair Éireann or you must ignore that question and say that the primary consideration is service to the public and the production of wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who has a lorry which he drives for hire is a one-man business. <Col N="1170" /> He is not affected by hours of work or by very many considerations that arise when the service is provided for the public by a big undertaking.  The persons who have been applying from time to time for plates for their lorries are keen young men who would be prepared, if needed, to have a lorry at the farmer's yard at 4 o'clock in the morning and, if they were allowed to operate, a state of affairs would be reached when you would have transport at keen competitive rates and providing efficient service.</P>
    <P>In addition, you would be giving valuable employment to these little one-man businesses that are ready to spring into existence.  There is a vast number of such men in the country. There is a number in my constituency. I must have written at least 40 letters to the Department within recent months from respectable responsible persons who are prepared to invest in this business several hundreds of pounds in the shape of the price of a lorry.  They are not doing that for the purpose of throwing money down the drain.  They are doing it for the purpose of providing a valuable service to the community and getting a livelihood for themselves.  It will be a most unfortunate state of affairs if private enterprise of that kind is not encouraged because of the fact that the State has burdened itself with the responsibility of paying the debenture interest on Córas Iompair Éireann or for the purpose of keeping Córas Iompair Éireann from toppling over altogether which, as far as I can see, it is going to do.  I make no apology for saying that it is one of the most disgracefully run concerns that any country could ever be ashamed of.</P>

They appear to have gone all around the country to collect the most rattle trap lot of prehistoric conveyances that are not even the same shape or the same <Col N="1171" /> size, and that make a burlesque of our transport system, to meet people coming from abroad, possibly visiting this country for the first time.</P>

      <P>One of the statements I made was that I presumed that the director regarded the statement that every single coach on the particular train leaked as a mere pleasantry. However, we did not get any patching of the roof but I did get a visit from a very civil genetleman accompanied by a bowler hat and an umbrella.  I said: &ldquo;What have you come to see me about?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;when a gentleman like you writes a letter like that, the company always sends somebody like me around to see him.&rdquo;  But the service remained just as it was. The lavatories were not cleaned, the straps were off the windows and the carriages still leaked.  That is the sort of thing one has to contend with.</P>
      <P>It is due to the absence of competition. Where you take away competition you must have decent management. I think it is very hard luck that decent young men whose fathers are putting up money for the purchase of lorries are kept out of that business for ever in order to keep this rattletrap concern on its feet&mdash;for that is all it is.</P>

      <P>We are discussing one of the most important Departments of State.  I take the cue from Deputy Larkin in regard to civil aviation.  He went as far as to make a slight excuse for the Party with which he is associated in the matter of the abandonment of the Constellations. None of the industries that were established in this country over a number of years has paid its way inside the first few years.  There has been a great deal of misrepresentation with reference to civil aviation and the money spent on it.  I seriously ask the Minister are we not to carry on the <Col N="1172" /> services that other civilised Governments have carried on?  Are we not to have an aerodrome or an air service? I have been given to understand that we succeeded in our air service to the extent that two years ago we were regarded as having one of the most efficient air services in Europe.  Aer Lingus was developing and there was a possibility of developing an air service with the United States.  The possibilities were good there because of the number of our friends in the United States.  There are 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 Irish people living there. Many of them were anxious to see that arm of our air service developed and, with all the good-will that exists in the United States towards this country, it was worth a trial and would be a success.  This is a country young in experience and it is necessary for us to do as other countries have done in the development of air services.</P>
      <P>I have been told that there were a number of refugees who were anxious to be taken from a certain part of Europe to South America.  Aer Lingus and another company in this country had been asked to carry those passengers. There were about 3,000,000 of them to be carried.  It is a pity that the short-sighted policy of cutting down expense has resulted in the abandonment of the service.  Emphasis has been laid on the huge cost of these services, but we all realise that these services cannot be expected to pay within the first year or two.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider his decision in regard to air services.  He should look upon it as an important national development from a passenger and freight viewpoint. In years to come, it may be very useful to this country.  In the last month, or two, we see how conditions have changed on the Continent, and statesmen tell us the international position is not too rosy at all.  We might be glad to have this service to fall back upon, in conjunction with another service I am about to mention. The Minister pointed out yesterday that he would try to re-employ some of the people who were in that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number have been dismissed from Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  It is a big problem to see so many technically-trained <Col N="1173" /> young men having to leave the country and anxious to get away.  Some of those employed there at the moment feel that their jobs are in jeopardy and they are not satisfied. We have some of the best air pilots in the world in Aer Lingus.  Some of them have left and it is sad that they should go, after all their training.  Other people, in useful employment there, have been dismissed from the clerical, technical and labouring grades.  Hundreds of these have been out of work and I would like the Minister to tell us what the Government is going to do to try to stop some of those technically-trained people and others from leaving the country, through unemployment, as a result of Government policy in abandoning the Constellation service.</P>
    <P>We have had here, during the war, experience of our mercantile marine service and how essential it was to have at least a few boats.  Now we find again that it is essential to develop such a service.  We are a small country and other small countries throughout Europe and the world have developed their maritime service.  If any country has got an example of what should be done, we got a very severe warning during the last war, when we were very anxious to get a few old boats from the United States, to try to carry in the foodstuffs which we needed.  The Minister should favourably consider, no matter what it would cost our national resources, developing our marine service to meet the requirements of our country in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>With reference to industrial development under the much despised régime of 16 years of Fianna Fáil our progress was rapid under very adverse circumstances. I take cognisance of the speech made here by the Minister for Finance on our industries.  While some industrialists may have made money, I believe there are others which were carried on with small capital by private enterprise.  They should get an opportunity of putting their money back into the industry, to develop it, to get better machinery and create better employment. They should also get adequate protection under our tariff policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> Some of the modern factories I have visited have carried out some good work in providing canteens, and so on, for their workers.  They have sick benefits, too.  One industry developed from the agricultural point of view in County Dublin, has introduced a pension scheme.  That is a laudable thing. Any industrialist who is so able to develop an industry that he can introduce a pension scheme for the workers and see that he has a doctor to look after them, is doing a most commendable work.  It creates good-will and will ensure that our workers will be in good health.  A report I got from one manufacturer who introduced this scheme was that they were getting a greater output from the workers, as a result of looking after them properly. We should try to encourage other industrialists to come up to the same level.</P>
    <P>At the moment, some of our factories are competing with a lot of goods coming in and some of them are threatening to let their employees go, while others have some employees on short time.  I know it is a problem for the Minister, but I would like him and his officers to give it serious consideration. The Balbriggan hosiery, a little factory at Santry, a factory and paper mills in Clondalkin and the Killeen Paper Mills, are some of those I can mention. I would like the Minister to consider what can be done to protect the interests of the manufacturers and workers in those factories.</P>
    <P>I believe that tariffs should be maintained until we have our factories working efficiently and able to compete with foreign factories.  Deputy Lemass pointed out a few years ago that he was anxious to see industrial efficiency. It is the national aim of all of us, that we should not see a factory progressing for a year or two and then becoming derelict.  That is very important and we must look at it from the national, and not from the Party, point of view. Everyone looks forward to our industrial, development as something essential and as it played its part well during the recent war.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the most despised tourist industry, that was torn asunder by some of the political Parties on the hustings during the <Col N="1175" /> election, is now found by them to be worth about £35,000,000 to this country.  Any industry responsible for creating at least an even trade balance in the country will be welcome. We know well that an adverse trade balance would be responsible for reducing our standard of living.  The tourist industry should be developed as, if it is responsible for bringing in £35,000,000 more, it is an advantage to us.  We have so few exportable goods to go to the dollar areas that anything coming in, in the tourist line especially, is very welcome.  I hope that, in the light of experience, the misrepresentations about it will not occur again.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed at the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta voting for the elimination from the Estimates of £85,000 for mineral exploration.  We have heard from time to time that the mineral resources of our country were fairly good.  We had an opportunity of seeing whether there were any mineral deposits worth while in the country and of providing machinery for that purpose.  But the people who held themselves up as the saviours of the working class and the other miracle workers during the recent election all voted for the elimination of this £85,000.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Larkin, however, ask the Minister to reconsider that matter.  I would suggest to the Minister that, from a national point of view, he should reconsider the position and make that money available for mineral exploration.</P>
    <P>Shipbuilding is another industry in which I am interested and, if possible, I should like to see the shipbuilding yards further developed.  We are possibly on the eve of another war and it might be possible to do a little more for our shipbuilding yards.  I know it is a big problem, but I am sure the Minister will try to do his best in the matter.  As to the stocks of timber, turf and coal in the Phoenix Park, Deputy Lemass has dealt fairly well with that matter.  Deputy Lemass was only telling the truth when he said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers, when they <Col N="1176" /> were in opposition, pointed out now essential it was that we should have stocks of fuel built up.  We all know what the people had to suffer during the fuel shortage.  Afterwards, of course, we had fine weather and we got supplies of coal.  The result is that we have a big reserve of fuel and that is possibly all to the good.  With other Deputies who have spoken, however, I suggest to the Minister that he might consider disposing of the stocks of timber, because if they are left there very long they will be sure to deteriorate very much.  A number of people would be anxious to get supplies of that timber, but not at £4 per ton.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what the Minister intends to do with regard to providing employment for the people who were dispensed with by Bord na Móna and Fuel Importers Limited. The suspension of turf cutting is responsible for a lot of unemployment all over the country.  We have been told that that is not responsible for causing unemployment.  I can say it has caused a lot of unemployment in my constituency amongst people who were working for Bord na Móna and on the turf dumps in the Phoenix Park.  I should like the Minister to tell us what he proposes to do in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>There has been much adverse criticism of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The transport problem is a big one and that company has passed through a very critical period.  At one time they had to carry on with a one-day per week long distance train service because they were short of coal.  They had to buy steel and coal and other things which have gone up 400 or 500 per cent. in price.  All these things should be taken into consideration.  When everything is going well, it is easy to praise those responsible.  People should not be distributing blame, however, except they are fully cognisant of all the facts. Engines had to be converted in order to run them by fuel oil.  All these matters were very expensive and should be given full consideration.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that one service of the company is competing with another.  I thought that the Transport Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1177" /> Government would have settled the transport problem for all time.  The Minister is now bringing in an expert to go into the whole transport problem. As Deputy Lemass stated, the company is now losing up to £20,000 a week.  If that is the case, it is a very serious matter.  The railway industry should be protected if at all possible.  It has been stated that private owners should be allowed to carry on in connection with the transport problem.  Deputy Esmonde knows very well that when we had buses run by private owners the employment provided for our workers was very haphazard.  One man had one bus and another had two buses. That was a very haphazard way of carrying on and we did not get a service such as would be provided by a transport company.</P>
    <P>That was the position when the first Transport Bill was brought in.  If we go back to that position, our workers will not have continuous employment. The conditions for them will be very bad and the public will have a very bad transport system.  Whether the present company is nationalised or not is immaterial.  I believe, however, that serious consideration should be given to the transport problem.  The closing down of branch lines is a very sore question and even in my constituency it has been brought to my notice.  No district likes to see its branch line closed down.  Until the expert makes his report on the whole transport problem, I feel that Deputies should not be too critical of the people who are responsible for the running of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of talk on the subject of closed trades.  We are told that there is at the moment a shortage of skilled operatives.  If that is the position, and I believe that it is, I feel that certain closed trades are not democratic enough.  In a democratic country all things within reason should be taken into consideration.  The cases of individuals who are anxious to serve their time to a particular trade should receive consideration.  I know that it is to the interest of certain trades to have them closed&mdash;and more power to <Col N="1178" /> their members who are strong enough to see that they are closed and, in that way, worth while for themselves.  Nobody can say anything to them for looking after their own interests.  On broad national principles, however, I feel that if we have that problem developing in this country it is bad for all concerned. The least that can be said about it is that it is undemocratic when it is pushed too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some reference has been made to the immediate problem which the transport question raises in this country.  When a new Minister is introducing an Estimate as important as the present Estimate is, I think it is right that the views of Deputies should be expressed on the problem presented by Córas Iompair Éireann and the transport problem generally.  The mentality shown by Deputy P.J. Burke on the transport problem is one which is far too common in this country.  A great many people say that we must do everything possible to keep the railways running without, apparently, considering what benefit they are to the country. Surely there must be a limit to the extent to which the country can be expected to go in order to keep the railways running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a service in any country that got every possible assistance from the State it is our transport service.  Nevertheless it still presents the problem it presented in 1934 and in 1943 when two distinct measures were taken by the Government to assist it. I join with Deputy Larkin in urging on the Minister the necessity for an inquiry into the entire question of transport and the manner in which Córas Iompair Éireann should be controlled and run in the future.  I am sure that the Minister is alive to this problem and that the expert inquiry now taking place will render considerably beneficial results.  We must not forget, as was mentioned by Deputy Sir John Esmonde, that we have in this country at the present time a large number of people who were put out of business and kept out of business in the interests of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I refer to men with lorries who are well able to engage in the carriage and in <Col N="1179" /> the haulage business but who are unable to do so because Córas Iompair Éireann have the monopoly and they have not the necessary plates and licences.  In any inquiry that does take place I would urge on the Minister to remember that there is an alternative to Córas Iompair Éireann in this country so far as freight is concerned. That alternative may mean a very efficient service for farmers and those people in the rural areas who have to depend on it for the carriage of their produce and merchandise.  It is, in addition, a service which may mean cheaper freight charges in many instances.  The Minister and the Government should not view the transport problem merely in the light that Córas Iompair Éireann, as it exists at present, is essential to this country.</P>
    <P>It may well be that some limited form of railway passenger service may be necessary but road transport is a feasible alternative and road transport privately run may also be a very feasible alternative.  There are in this country to-day something between 18,000 and 20,000 lorries.  I suppose that figure represents 10,000 or 15,000 lorries more than are required for the entire freight business of the country, but the fact remains that there are a large number of idle lorries in the country to-day.  The owners of those lorries, by reason of the encouragement given to them in recent years, have claims upon the Government.  I should like to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy Sir John Esmonde that, in any review of our transport position, the claims of these men shall not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's speech to-night that he regards tourism as something to be encouraged in this country because it is a valuable source of income generally. Much may be said for that point of view and it is, apparently, a point of view which has the support of the Deputies opposite.  It would be unwise, however, to overlook the dangers which are inherent in the tourist industry in this country at a time like this.  We are, as a country still suffering&mdash;and I assume that we <Col N="1180" /> will suffer for many years to come&mdash; from shortages of essential commodities for our people.  We are told time and time again that there is a danger of inflation and that there is a situation in which too much money is in circulation.  There is no doubt that tourism has contributed largely to that situation.  The more money that is encouraged here through tourism, particularly through tourists from England, the longer you are continuing a situation which is fraught with considerable economic peril to this country.</P>
    <P>Every extra pound that comes across from England helps in its own way to shove up prices and to increase the shortage of goods that already exists. That is one very obvious result of tourism.  The Minister and other people may say that there is a return to the country in £ s. d.; that there is a return to those who run hotels and businesses that cater specially for tourists.  In my view that is a wrong attitude to adopt.  A matter like this must be regarded from a national point of view and it must be regarded from the point of view as to whether in the long run a really material benefit is being conferred upon the country.  To some people tourism is an advantage.  To some people it is a benefit.  To others it brings a loss and to the people as a whole it is a national calamity.  Apart from the dangers of inflation&mdash;I think it was Deputy Burke who suggested that tourism does help our adverse trade balance&mdash;there are other obvious dangers inherent in it.  A statement such as that made by Deputy Burke does not bear analysis.  Every holiday resort we develop, every hotel we build and every amenity or facility we supply for tourists must be imported in large measure from elsewhere.  The development of tourism entails a further growth of imports.  The very machinery required for the tourist industry here adds in its own way to our adverse trade balance.  We are, of course, discussing tourism now under abnormal circumstances and in abnormal times but I would impress upon the Minister that he should not accept the policy of his predecessor in connection with tourism without full examination and <Col N="1181" /> careful consideration.  The views expressed by the leading economists in this country within the last 12 months were all aimed at pointing out the national dangers which may ensue through tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass conceded in his speech that the Tourist Board, in so far as its activities extended to hotels, had been subjected to a considerable amount of adverse criticism.  That, of course, is quite true.  The so-called luxury hotels have provided common matter for criticism for the last two or three years. I am not so sure that that criticism is not fully justified.  I went to one particular luxury hotel built by the taxpayers' money.  It was established down in the West of Ireland in direct competition with old and well-established Irish hotels.  If one went in for a cup of tea at that hotel, on the cup one would see &ldquo;Fáilte Hotel&rdquo;, and if one examined the bottom of the cup one saw stamped upon it &ldquo;Made in England&rdquo;.  So far as the luxury hotels are concerned, they have conferred no benefit of any kind upon the country in the last two or three years.  Admittedly, they have attracted a certain type of visitor and they have attracted a certain type of money but they have not encouraged the Irish holiday-maker to spend his holidays in an Irish resort.  I would urge upon the Minister that he should reconsider present policy so far as these hotels are concerned. Under no circumstances should any future hotels be allowed to compete with those already long-established. It is regrettable that these hotels should have been built in the West of Ireland&mdash;an area which never required an Irish Tourist Board to help in its development.  I hope that this problem of tourism will receive the Minister's consideration in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made some reference to mineral exploration.  I am glad that the Minister has made it plain that the possibility of mineral exploration is still being examined by the Government. If the Government has in its possession information indicating that a locality has a potential mineral value, then money should be spent on its exploration and development.  I deprecate <Col N="1182" /> very much that type of mentality demonstrated by opposition Deputies who hold the fallacious theory that money should be spent anyway in order to prove that we are right and that somebody else is wrong.  I deprecate that mentality very much but I suggest to the Minister that if a case is made by any locality, which would suggest that there may be mineral resources in the area, that should be exploited and developed and money should be spent freely for that purpose.  It should be the aim of the present Minister to develop the resources of the country to the fullest extent.  The international situation is such that we shall be thrown back more and more upon our own resources in the coming years.  The development of minerals where possible would be a useful side-line in our industrial efforts.  I welcome the Minister's statement in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer and I hope that the Minister when he is replying will deal with it.  I have already raised it on the Vote for Local Government.  I am speaking now of building licences and permits.  I suggest to the Minister that, in the interest of more speedy work by those who desire to build their own houses, only one Department should be concerned with the necessary permission and the issuing of permits.  whether it be the Department of Local Government or the Department of Industry and Commerce; but between them the existing regulations should be changed in order to ensure that the person desiring to build his house will have to deal with one authority only and so will have his particular permit granted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly surprised at some of the suggestions put forward by Deputy Sir John Esmonde in connection with the solution of our transport problems.  I would like to ask Deputy Sir John Esmonde, and also my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, to read the speeches made here in 1944 by the present Minister for Finance in connection with the Transport Act of 1944.  If they read them carefully and study the amendments moved on that occasion by Deputy McGilligan, as he <Col N="1183" /> then was, they will see that the line he is now taking is very far removed from the line he then took.  Deputy McGilligan, I believe, understands this problem in all its aspects because, when a Minister in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, he was responsible for guiding some Transport Acts through this House.</P>
      <P>To suggest at this stage of our transport history that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should issue further licences so as to have more lorries operating on the roads is not making any sensible contribution to the solution of the transport problem.  To suggest, as Deputy Sir John Esmonde suggested, that Córas Iompair Éireann has a monopoly of the road transport, shows that, although Deputy Sir John Esmonde is an extremely able man, he has not studied this position at all. Does he know that Córas Iompair Éireann controls only 700 out of the 18,000 odd lorries that are operating legally and illegally on our roads to-day?  When he realises that, he will not repeat that statement or suggest to the Minister that he should make a bad position much worse.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to say much on this matter, because the Minister has rightly selected a transport expert to advise him in regard to the future of this undertaking and provide, within wide terms of reference, recommendations for the Minister and his colleagues in the Government.  The man who has undertaken that job has a very difficult task and he is undoubtedly entitled to suggestions from every section of the community willing to put forward suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked Deputy Lemass this evening if he could explain why his transport policy had failed, as failed it has without the slightest shadow of doubt. Everybody in this House in 1944 who studied the situation knows that Deputy Lemass and his Government colleagues at the time forced the people to undergo the cost and inconvenience of a general election on this issue because they refused to accept a majority decision of the House.  The majority of the members rejected the Second Reading of the 1944 Bill as <Col N="1184" /> originally introduced for one reason in particular, and that is, because it proposed to hand over to one man the sole control of our transport services.  Outside Spain and some other countries, responsible for the maintenance of the Fascist system, there is nothing that I know of that compares with it.  I suggest the failure of the policy enshrined in the 1944 Act is really due to the fact that one man was given control.  I am surprised one man undertook that responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise, apart from what is contained in the Act, that Deputy Lemass, who was Minister from 1944 until this year, had the power to prevent Córas Iompair Éireann from running so rapidly into bankruptcy. We know perfectly well that the people who were put in control by him had a one-sided outlook.  They could not see the railway; they could see only the roads, and they did not care who was going to bear the cost of the construction and maintenance of roads suitable to the transport system.  I assert&mdash;and it can be proved to the transport expert&mdash;that the railways did not get any chance under the 1944 Act; that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of those responsible to turn the traffic from the railways on to the roads; that there was no real desire to maintain the revenue from the railway side of that great undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened during the past two months to a number of deputations representing railway and transport workers in my constituency.  I met deputations in this city from all sections of workers employed in Córas Iompair Éireann.  Their opinions were expressed to myself and my colleagues for the purpose of endeavouring to get the powers that be to reverse the policy that tended to destroy the railway section of our transport industry.  The workers in that industry are demoralised. I would not like to be working in that concern myself, particularly with the rumours floating about as to what will happen and as to what is really happening to the detriment of <Col N="1185" /> those who might have a desire to look forward to a future in that concern.</P>
    <P>As late as Sunday week, when travelling to a hurling match in Tullamore, I was called on one side by an old railway servant and asked: &ldquo;Do you know when the posters for the excursion running to Tullamore from Mountrath, Portlaoighise, and Portarlington were issued?&rdquo;  I was told they were sent out on the 5.30 train on Friday evening. That was the first intimation that the people in my constituency had of the running of the excursion trains.  Trains were running the same week-end from the Kingscourt Branch, which has been a closed section for some time.  Do you know when the posters were sent out to inform the people in that area?  They were sent to Westland Row on the Saturday morning before the excursion and presumably they were not posted at some of the stations concerned before the excursion trains started to run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder they did not send them on the excursion train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They could have done worse&mdash;posted them on the day after the match was played.  That is one recent indication of the attitude of those people when looking for more revenue for the railways.  I should like the Minister to state the procedure that will be adopted by the expert when hearing evidence or representations. One of the deputations that met myself and some of my colleagues recently consisted of men who had a long experience in the service of Córas Iompair Éireann in the city&mdash; some of them at headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed that one very able man, who certainly would be regarded as a railway expert from his knowledge and experience, made an inquiry as to whether any risk would be involved in a man like himself going before Sir James Milne and giving evidence based on his knowledge and experience. Apparently these men feared the consequences of going behind the backs of the hierarchy of this particular company and giving evidence, fearing that whenever action has got to be taken, they might be accused of disloyalty to <Col N="1186" /> their superior officers.  I hope it will be possible to dissipate any fears of victimisation on the part of experienced railway men who go either on their own, as trade union officers or in groups before this well-known railway expert and put their views on the merits.  Whether or not they are accepted in the long run by Sir James Milne does not matter to the people concerned.  At any rate, men who have been in the service for a long period of years and who have yet a few years to go, should not be going about in fear and trembling if they choose to go and put their views before Sir James Milne.</P>
    <P>There is a general belief in the minds of railway men&mdash;and, mark you, they know because they are working in the office and have access to the figures&mdash; that in the allocation of revenue, where there is a combined rail and road service, an unfair proportion of that revenue is allocated to the road side of the service in order to bolster up the road service as against the railway and to prove that the railway side of the service is not paying.</P>
    <P>That is a very important matter when we realise that the railway is really run, or ruined if you like, at the moment by three or four accountants, and when you realise that the accountants can manipulate figures to produce a situation of that kind.  I mention that because that point of view has been asserted to me on a number of occasions, both in recent times and over a number of years, by people who have access to the figures and who know what figures mean in regard to the economy of transport.</P>
    <P>When the Transport Bill was under discussion in the Dáil in 1944, members of this group not alone put forward their own alternative proposals but put forward a large number of amendments to the Bill.  The country was put to the cost and inconvenience of saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the proposals contained in the Bill but, as everybody knows, the people of the country did not give their decision on the merits of the contents of the Bill.  When we got into the country to fight the issues on the policy that led up to the general election, of course what the people were really asked was whether Deputy de Valera <Col N="1187" /> was the only man outside the Lord Almighty who could stop the bombs from coming down on top of us.  It was put to them that he was the only man responsible for the policy of neutrality and, of course, the people were not allowed to give a decision on this matter.  If the people did give a decision, they know now that the policy enshrined in the Act of 1944 was a failure.  However, another policy must now be found when the recommendations of the expert come before the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I support very strongly the suggestion made by Deputy Larkin in his speech that early steps should be taken in the interests of the taxpayers to get rid of the dumps of timber, turf and American slack now lying in the Phoenix Park and at other dumps throughout the country.  I made an excursion round the dumps in the Park a few Sundays ago.  I had not been up there for a couple of years before and I was simply flabbergasted at the condition of the turf.  It is rapidly going into mould.  If it is partly in mould this year, what is its condition likely to be next year?  The same remarks apply to a certain extent to the timber fuel.  If the clerk of the weather had not been more sympathetic this year, and if we had more sunshine, the timber by now would have been in a much worse condition than it is.  At present there is a big dump of timber there which has not been cut and one wonders if the necessity for cutting it will ever arise.  Although the housewives in the city do not like turf&mdash;they do not like it because of the unfortunate experience they had during the period of emergency when half of the turf delivered to them had a 60 per cent. water content&mdash;there is not much water in it now, unless it was affected by last night's heavy rainfall&mdash;I am of opinion that the Minister would be well advised to get rid of it while the going is fairly good.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism in connection with the organisation and administration of the company called Aer Lingus and a good deal of justification for that criticism <Col N="1188" /> because the organisation of that company was top heavy.  I am not saying that for the purpose of suggesting that there is a redundancy there which should be got rid of.</P>
    <P>I listened on one occasion recently to a deputation of fairly senior officers of the company and I was simply astounded to find the kind of organisation that existed there and astonished also to find the extraordinary power held in that Irish company, established by a so-called Republican Government, by people who were not nationals of this State.  I had to get the names before I could believe that there were 13 out of 22 senior officers who were not born or reared in this country. Admitting that we may not have had enough Irishmen to fill the majority of the chief executive positions in the company, I believe we had Irishmen as good, some of them trained in our own Irish corps, as any of the men brought from the ends of the world to fill some of these positions.  Whenever we want to modernise our transport service or our civil aviation service it appears that we have had to get foreigners and put them at the head of these companies.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is wrong.  If the Deputy will look up the birthplace of the expert, who has been assigned this particularly difficult task, he will find that he was born in the City of Dublin and that he is entitled to be called an Irishman.  If the Deputy does not believe that, he can get the birth certificate at the Registrar's Office in Parnell Square.  I take it that Deputy Corry did not know that.  I think the Minister should be congratulated on having got a Dublin-born man to deal with such a delicate, difficult and almost impossible problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into details about the statements and complaints that were made to me by these people who came to us from Aer Lingus.  I do seriously suggest to the Minister that there is very definitely a case for some kind of an upstairs inquiry before he <Col N="1189" /> gives his approval to any other further dismissals from that concern.  I understand that people were taken in practically without knowing what they were going to be employed at.  They were employed in a hurried manner and, apparently, there has been some kind of a hurried decision to get rid of them more quickly even than they were recruited originally.  That is why I suggest there should be some kind of an upstairs inquiry.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that a committee of inquiry should be appointed by this House, but rather a committee of people who understand thoroughly the policy of the Minister and the Government in this matter as well as something about the establishment of an efficient and economical organisation suitable to the requirements of a service of this kind, bearing in mind the limited resources available from the taxpayers of this country for the carrying on of that service.  I fully agree &mdash;and I do not care who says anything to the contrary&mdash;with the policy of the Minister and his Government in suspending the proposed trans-Atlantic air service.  If we cannot provide any more money from the pockets of the taxpayers to subsidise internal transport and to subsidise other essential national services, why should we subsidise to the tune proposed by the late Government an international air service for the purpose of carrying the wealthiest people in the country?  If they want to go from this country or to enter it by air, and if they want to do that by some means other than by availing of the services of an American liner, let them pay the economic fare for being carried by air from this country to some other country, and not rely on the poor taxpayers of this country to propup, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds, a service of this kind for their accommodation. I heartily congratulate the Minister and his colleagues in the Government on the decision to abandon this unnecessary service.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned with very many interests in the State.  Naturally, the <Col N="1190" /> opening statement of the Minister brought forth many points of views from Deputies in all parts of the House.  I am sure that if it were within the power of the Minister the problem of unemployment would cease to be of any importance and would soon become non-existent.  Unfortunately for the Minister and his Department and the country generally, it is not within the range of practical politics to adopt such general schemes as may have suggested themselves to the minds of Deputies who, of course, would not have the responsibility of carrying through their plans.  In order to relieve unemployment, provided he had sufficient money at his command, the Minister could create every form of industry and develop every form of mineral research, but the reckoning would come and would be this: are these schemes practical, and has the expenditure of money on them been justified by the results? The Minister has to confine himself within these limitations.  He has to apply his own good judgment, because otherwise the State would go bankrupt in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate deals with industry and commerce but the Minister must always bear in mind this one fundamental question, that the entire fabric and economics of this State are controlled, primarily, not by him but by the Minister for Agriculture.  All other branches of industry must depend for their development on the capacity of agriculture to sustain them.  The latest statistics indicate that our population is divided fairly evenly between agriculture and industry and all other occupations.  One half is engaged in agriculture and the other half in all other occupations.  In the case of the national income, we find that two-thirds of it go to that half which is engaged in industry or commerce, and one-third to the primary producers in agriculture.  That being so we must admit that our economics are all wrong. The Minister may say that he is not responsible for that, but he must admit that there can be no progress or development under his Department unless there is a better balance of the national budget and unless the main <Col N="1191" /> industry, on which the fabric of this State is built, is compensated in a more equitable way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about tariffs.  These are essential if our industries are to be developed.  It would be a retrograde step to make any departure from affording the necessary protection to new industries. I trust the Minister will never land himself to such a course of action. Industrial production is essential not only for agriculture but from the point of view of employment, the internal trade of the country and the internal earning capacity of our people so as to enable them to live under better conditions and in that way strengthen possibilities of a good home market.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the negotiations that were carried on recently with the British Government for a trade agreement, the Minister had in mind the necessity of ensuring the right to protect within reason our industrial enterprises here and that he saw to it that in the future the raw materials, which we buy mainly from England and which are essential for our industrial production, will be forthcoming on better terms than they have been available hitherto.  Not merely have our industrialists had to suffer by paying often an enhanced price for these raw products in the English market, but they were limited as to the time and delivery of these goods, the quantity supplied, and the variety of goods offered.  Our industrialists here had often to suffer the disadvantage of paying more than an equitable price for raw products, of awaiting their delivery for a very long time, of accepting a limited range of these products and then of suffering competition from English manufacturers who had all the advantages over the Irish manufacturers and who are flooding the market with articles which are sold at prices often below the cost of production.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is interested in all these conditions of industry in the country and I am quite sure that he has borne in mind these essential things <Col N="1192" /> before entering into negotiations.  If he has succeeded in remedying these problems he has done a successful piece of work for the future prosperity of Irish industry.  Above all that, he must ensure that no restriction on industrial imports into this country is allowed that would permanently injure the progress of our industrialists.</P>
    <P>In the years gone by very vigorous efforts were made by the Government to encourage industry, and many new industries were created, thanks to the protection and encouragement given to them by the present Government's predecessors in office.  There is, however, one thing that I have always objected to, and I have given expression to that objection many times in the House.  It is the question of the concentration of all our industries in the cities and large towns to the detriment of our rural areas.  This is very unwise and is really a very unnational policy.  If progress is to be made on the lines of industry in the future, then I suggest again to the present Minister that he should ensure as far as possible that industries are sent down to rural areas to keep the people in healthy conditions, living at home and working in local factories and thus retain that rural life for our people from which for years and years they have been flying as fast as they can, That is due to the absence of employment or of any encouragement on the part of the Government to provide employment for these families at home.</P>
    <P>I come now to one of the problems which, I have found, reacted very considerably against rural industrialisation&mdash;transport. I cannot for the life of me think why a transport service which is a monoply&mdash;a semi-State-controlled industry&mdash;should be allowed to continue with rates which are prohibitive to industrial development in rural areas in favour of cities.  When there is a national transport service, why should it be allowed to charge rates prohibitive to the starting of industries in rural districts where the population and surroundings justify their establishment? I will give one instance of it.  In my own part of the country we have an industry which produces coal. The railway people, whose wheels our <Col N="1193" /> mines kept turning for the five years of the emergency, since supplies of coal became available a year ago or less on the English market, stopped their orders and refused to take any more supplies from us.  On investigation of the market in Dublin last year, we found that the rates on coal between Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin, a distance of 100 miles, was 22/- to 24/6 per ton, plus transport charges from the depot here of the railway to the point of delivery; the transport cost of coal, alternatively, from the Port of Bristol to Dublin Port was 12/- or 12/6 a ton. What possibility have we, particularly in the case of a commodity such as coal where 1/- on the ton makes all the difference of selling it against imported coal where there is a difference of 15/-a ton?</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that the railway people were kept-going on supplies of coal from Arigna for four years, but they ceased as soon as they could get English coal.  Not only that, but they destroyed the possibility of having a market in Dublin, although when our coal was analysed, on the report of the city analyst, it was equal to the best English coal coming into the country, and the cost would be less if it were not for the cost of transport.  It is the same with many other industries&mdash;the transport system is strangling and unless the Government makes up their mind that the future policy of industrialisation is linked with the possibility of agriculture being able to bear any burden placed upon the community through the development of industry and that transport be made amenable so as to enable industries to be placed in rural areas in future, then to talk of industrialisation is only a palliative and is only nonsense.  You must have a strong foundation from the beginning and build from there.  Our agriculture, transport and rural industrialisation are the lines on which you must move, as anything else is merely from day to day, playing to the gallery and building a false economy that will have its effects in days to come, and in years to come, on the life of this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to any possible development of our transport in the future, it has been mentioned here a few times <Col N="1194" /> already that consideration should be given to the private users of lorries.  I would say that all monopolies are dangerous; I would say, however careful the Government may be or however capable this expert on transport may be, the rights of private enterprise within limitations should be embodied in the scheme, however necessary it may be to create a monopoly afterwards.</P>
    <P>We have seen what monopolies have done.  I have listened here and read outside strong condemnation of the old directors of the railways, the amalgamated railways that became the great southern.  I thought myself that these men were monsters and that the sooner we could get rid of them the sooner our transport service would rectify itself.  I saw that these men promised to reform the whole position and give us efficient, cheap services.  I witnessed the almost complete elimination of the life savings of people who had invested in the various railways before their amalgamation.  We all sat here and discussed what we were told was necessary legislation in order to save for the nation its essential transport system and we saw the capital of people whose very existence depended on the capital they had invested&mdash;money invested by prudent parents for their children&mdash; wiped out by legislation.  It had to be done in the interests of the nation because our transport system was ruined by the incapable directors who had charge of it.  A new organisation was to be established, we were told, and men with great power and initiative were to take control, and, although it was sad that people had to lose their money, it was still good business in the light of the nation's needs.</P>
    <P>We saw at a later stage a wild ramp in the shares of the new transport system, Córas Iompair Éireann, and it became necessary to set up a tribunal to inquire into it.  So menacing and so full of implication was the situation that nothing short of that inquiry would have satisfied the public.  We saw these shares go up to £1 and 22/&mdash; the ordinary shares of Córas Iompair Éireann.  What is their value to-day? The State undertook to guarantee the <Col N="1195" /> debenture stock.  How many millions is the State responsible for and will the Minister say if the State still stands over that guarantee to the debenture stockholders in Córas Iompair Éireann? It is necessary that we should have information on this point because otherwise the public will have no inducement to invest under any guarantee in a public undertaking in future. The whole fabric of the State's credit is close to rack and ruin as a result of the policy pursued by Córas Iompair Éireann, due either to abnormal conditions or to inefficiency&mdash;I will not say which.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of tourists, and I believe that the more people that we can encourage into this country, the better.  I am afraid, however, that we have been fooled and mislead by the easy flow of so many tourists into this country in the past four or five years. Our real attraction was the fact that we had more food to offer them than they could get elsewhere.  The availability of luxury hotels in itself may be an attraction for those who wish to come here for that type of entertainment, but, if our food conditions had not been much superior to those of any other country in Europe in recent years, would these luxury hotels, in competition with the luxury hotels in continental countries which are accustomed to provide for tourists, have attracted them?</P>
    <P>If we propose to continue to spend money for the development of tourism, we must make proper provision immediately, before it is too late.  We must offer in the future special attractions to these people to come in here, after we have passed the stage at which we can offer food in more plentiful quantities than they can get elsewhere, and I suggest that we should build along our coast and through the country luxury roads so that we can offer these people of wealth a wider range of facilities for travel by motor car than is provided in any other country.  In that way, when conditions become more competitive so far as food supplies are concerned, we will have something more attractive to offer than other countries have.  Some form of development <Col N="1196" /> on those lines is what those who seek to develop tourism should bend their minds to, because I am afraid that we have become palsied in our ideas as a result of the abnormal conditions which forced tourists on us in the past five years in numbers far greater than we were entitled to get and for whom we made very little provision indeed.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister will give full consideration to the many points I have raised and to the various points raised generally in the debate.  I suggest to him that he has a duty to preserve the industries established in this country and should not stand idly by and watch these being destroyed.  Since he came into office, he has remained very silent and quiet.  He has accepted that the development of turf production by private producers is not possible and has accordingly destroyed a very big industry of great importance in the poorest parts of the country.</P>
    <P>He sat silently by and watched the exodus from this country of upwards of 200 miners who had to leave homes and families and seek employment in England and Scotland.  He should have ensured that our railways and our industries, which are protected by the users of the products of these industries who often had to pay more for these products because they were protected, would use their native coal and peat, rather than purchase an inferior quality of English, Scottish or South African coal.  He has not lived up to the reputation I had hoped he would live up to, but perhaps he will awaken to his responsibility now and will give some indication that our industries, whether peat, coal or manufacture, will, so far as he is concerned, be assured of a fair market and fair prospects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago, we heard a great deal about the cost of living and it was alleged that the high cost of living was mainly due to the inefficient price control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce then in office. Since the change of Government, I have not seen any great change in that system of control.  I am sure the Miniter was very anxious to try to justify the propaganda that was carried out in <Col N="1197" /> that respect but apparently he has found the system something on which he could not improve.  The prices of a number of controlled articles have gone up and that was justified probably by the circumstances.  I shall not say to the Minister that it is all due to his inefficient control, as was said before, but the system has not been altered in any respect, which is the greatest justification of the past Minister.</P>
      <P>I wanted to ask the Minister to explain his attitude about the bread strike in Dublin.  As far as I am aware of the facts, the Minister had all the facts relating to costs and all the necessary data before him before the strike took place.  He took a decision that he would not allow an increased price or give a further subsidy.  The strike took place and, after three weeks of suffering on the part of the people of Dublin, on the same facts and figures, the Minister decided that he could allow an increase in price and, on that basis, the strike was settled.  I want to know how the Minister justifies putting the people of Dublin in the position that they were without bread for three weeks.  Surely he should have been able to make up his mind and to stand over his decision.  It looks as if he and nobody else was responsible for the bread strike.</P>
      <P>Speaking from these Benches this time last year, the Minister referred to the unemployment figures and commented on how stationary they had been every year, around 70,000.  Unfortunately that is not so just now.  There are 7,000 added.  The Minister also said&mdash;column 847, Vol. 105, Dail Debates 17th April, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I said here twelve months ago, and I want to repeat it now, that without the slightest trouble every able-bodied man and woman in this country could be put into useful work to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister said 12 months ago.  He has been in office, not one day, but five months and the total effect on the unemployment figure is that there are 7,000 extra.  People are being disemployed every day due to the fact that there is no certainty as to the Government's policy in industrial matters. <Col N="1198" /> In view of what was said in the past, very few business people are prepared to risk money on what is being said nowadays.  They are not prepared to put their money into industry which the Government of the day, in order to justify previous statements, may turn around and destroy.  There is certainly no incentive to progress and the result is that men are being gradually disemployed. Industry has to go back or to go forward.  It cannot stand still.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said last year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does not the Minister know that whether our industries are to survive and flourish or to decay and perish depends very largely, if not entirely, on circumstances outside our control?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me a most pessimistic outlook for a Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I wonder if that is still the Minister's outlook.  If so, it may explain in great measure why no progress is being made.  That phrase would convey that it is useless for us to try to do anything, that somebody outside will settle whether we go ahead or go back or completely fail.  Surely that is not a type of man for the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce in a young State like this that is trying to build up its way of life.  I do not think that is the type of man that would be picked for such a position by any of the selection boards we hear about.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the butchers.  The butchers' attitude all during the emergency in relation to the Department of Industry and Commerce was so correct that no control order was necessary up to last year.  There was simply a gentleman's agreement between the Department and the butchers' association, which was honourably kept.  Circumstances altered and, due to some of the members of the organisation breaking the arrangement, the butchers agreed that a control order should be made.  An arrangement was arrived at with the last Minister about varying the price according to the price of cattle in the market.  One increase on the basis of that arrangement was given by the present Minister but, when further <Col N="1199" /> increases took place, the butchers were treated as if they were a most dishonourable body.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to receive them, although he received much lesser bodies, and they were driven in selfdefence to resort to certain action.  It is not at all the fault of the Minister that we did not have a meat strike in Dublin as well as a bread strike.  These men could see no other way of bringing their case forward, owing to the attitude of the Minister.  There was no way of bringing their case forward, owing to the attitude of the Minister, except the strike; and, were it not for the intervention of His Grace the Archbishop, we probably would have had it in addition to the bread strike.</P>
    <P>In conference with the Department, those men stated, they were told that their remedy was not to pay more than the price on which the controlled price was based.  When they set out to do that, the Minister for Agriculture accuses them&mdash;just to list a few of them&mdash;as bluffers, slanderers, racketeers and profiteers.  I consider that that was most insulting and irresponsible language to use to any decent body of traders.</P>

      <P>At any rate, they were accused in this House of being <Col N="1200" /> profiteers.  They have published a statement of their profits, which were calculated by the Department on the books of a large number of traders in Dublin, which were got in and of which a number were taken as a cross-section and profits taken out.  For the year ending March, 1940, the nett profit was 1.9 per cent.; for 1941, it was 4.1 per cent.; for 1942, it was 4.8 per cent.; for 1943, it was 3.7; for 1944, it was 6.5; for 1945, it was 1.7; for 1946, it was 1.8; for 1947, there was a loss of 1.5 per cent.; and for 1948 there was a loss of 2.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>These are the men who have been charged with being profiteers.  The other day the present price worked out at 1/10½d. a pound to the butchers.  To the army, as given in a figure quoted here the other day, it is costing 1/10¾d.</P>

I do not see why, in a land such as this, where cattle are so plentiful, people in Dublin should be forced to pay the price that foreigners who are suffering from a famine in meat should be forced to pay.  That is what is happening.  I do not see why very nearly one-fifth of the population of the country in Dublin should be forced into that position.  It should not be beyond the wit of the Minister to devise a scheme by which we in Dublin should be able to pay a reasonable price without the farmer suffering in the price he gets from the foreigner.</P>

      <P>The butcher can get a reasonable price.  I have no connection whatever with the butchers.  I am not authorised in any way to speak for them.  I am giving my view as an ordinary Deputy and as an ordinary citizen of Dublin on the facts as we got them.  I have tried to follow all that has been issued both by the butchers and by the Minister in this matter&mdash;and I must say the Minister issued very little.  He took the attitude of ignoring them, which was not the correct attitude for him to take. It should not be beyond the Minister's wit to find a way out of the difficulty. I do not see why the home market should not be provided for first at a reasonable price.  At the moment, the people in Dublin are paying these high prices for inferior meat, while the foreigner is getting the best of it.  That is what is happening, under the way the Minister is dealing with it. Apparently we will soon be back to the days when&mdash;as in my young days&mdash;we used to export all our best bacon and buy in the fat Canadian bacon.  We will be doing something like that, under the way the Minister is going on.  I do not want the Minister to interfere with the price the farmer is getting or the price the butcher is getting.  I do not want to increase the price and do not see why the butchers should want an increase.  An increase would not help them in the slightest, because of the lesser trade.  It should be possible to devise a scheme.</P>

      <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister say that the repair factory in connection with Aer Lingus had been abandoned. I think that was one of the finest things which had been established in the last few years.  It would have created a whole new trade.  It would have trained men in something which we never had before in this country and made complete new openings.  It was stated, I do not know with what truth, that it would have given employment to about 300 men.  It would also have been most important from the defence point of view in time of emergency for our own air service, because I understand the position is that only minor repairs can be carried out here, either by the Army or the air service, and that anything big has to be sent away.  It is, I think, a necessary adjunct if we are to run an air service at all and, as I have said, it would have provided new openings for employment.  After saying so much let me congratulate the Minister on his statement that he is reconsidering the question of the expenditure on mineral exploration.  I am sure that the results will justify any expenditure undertaken.</P>

      <P>With Deputies both on the opposition side and on this side of the House who have made suggestions to the Minister with regard to the fuel dumps, I should like to ask him to consider the position immediately. I do not want to say anything of a controversial nature as to what brought about this surplus of fuel.  But as it is there and there is no way out except to cut our losses, I think the Minister should consider the proposal put to him by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Larkin.  The longer that timber and turf are left in these dumps all over the country the more they will deteriorate, as any Deputy who knows anything about turf or timber will tell <Col N="1203" /> you.  I am sure the Minister himself knows a good deal about both types of fuel.  If the timber is left in the dumps for any lengthy period it will have reduced both in value and in bulk and, in the long run, the expense and the loss will be much greater than if it was sold now at a reduced price.</P>
      <P>Apart from the financial aspect, I should also like to make an appeal to the Minister from the social side of the question.  Many people in Dublin and other cities have gone through difficult times.  This is now something like a windfall, as Deputy Lemass described it, and there is no reason in the world why these people should not be allowed to take advantage of an opportunity like this which has been brought about as the result of a mistake on the part of certain individuals.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with the policy of the Government, inasmuch as I think a position should not be allowed to occur under which imported fuel would pour into our dumps.  It was never the intention or the belief of our Party that our own fuel resources in the line of coal or turf should be neglected.  I hope the Minister will consider investigating our fuel resources with regard to turf and coal.  The production of turf for domestic and industrial purposes does not seem to be sound economically at the moment.  Hand-won turf cannot be produced at an economic price to compete with other types of fuel.  But, with the introduction of machinery that is now available for Bord na Móna, plus the expansion by way of electrification of our peat industry, all these matters should be investigated by the Minister so as to make the fullest possible use of our peat resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the development of industry in this country, as Deputy Maguire said, agriculture is our main industry.  The other industries should be based as far as possible on the natural resources of the country and on the materials available here.  I do not see any great advantage in starting tin-pot factories which are dependent for their existence on machinery and raw materials which have to be imported.  That type of industry is not a sound one.  What we <Col N="1204" /> want, as I said, is industry based on our natural resources.  Afforestation, fisheries and such things as these should be developed.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Maguire in calling attention to the position of our coal industry.  When we talk about developing our natural resources and our industries we should be really genuine about the matter. When we have an industry such as the coal industry we should take every step possible to develop it.  I am not an expert on the coal industry, but I have yet to be convinced that our coal areas are as bad as we are led to believe.  During the war they supplied our railways with coal.  We were glad to have the coal from Arigna and other areas to keep us going during that period.  The minute the foreign coal was available, however, it was a question of good-bye to the coal which came from Arigna and other sources.  In my opinion that is wrong.  There seems to be a general distaste amongst our industrialists for Irish coal.  As I mentioned before, in the Tuam beet factory Arigna coal is not being used although the boilers there are suitable for its use.  One of the excuses given by the railway company for not using it is that they had not the wagons available to take away the coal. Another was that coal was not being produced in sufficient quantities to make it a paying proposition to take it away from the mines.  I do not know whether these excuses are genuine, but I heard both put up by people who should know better.  If up-to-date machinery were provided and our coal mines were developed on the most modern lines possible, then we could see whether the coal industry can be made an economic proposition.  Money spent in that way would be well spent. It is much better to spend money on the development of our coal industry and other mineral resources than to spend it, as Deputy Lemass wants it spent, on a transatlantic air service.</P>
    <P>I will make just one observation in that regard and that is that it is my belief that Deputy Lemass tried to convey in respect of the air services that we would have run to America at a future date that we could hope to <Col N="1205" /> make them a paying service.  I may be wrong but I am informed that the transatlantic air services that are run by other countries can be run at a cheaper rate than ever Ireland can hope to run such services.  The reason for that is that the inland cross-country air services in America will more than balance the losses incurred by the transatlantic air services.  No matter how we may develop our inland air services here the country is too small ever to hope to balance or nearly balance our transatlantic air services.  I am speaking on behalf of the Clann na Poblachta Party when I say that we are in full agreement with the discontinuance of this scheme of transatlantic air services.  We are fully aware that air services are necessary and that we must keep up with modern advancement. The air services to Britain should certainly be kept up and they will, of course, be a source of income to this country.  They are a source of income to us at the moment and, apart altogether from being a source of income, we can never be accused, as Deputy Lemass tries to make out, of being retrogressive or of falling down on national advancement.  I do not think anyone in his senses could ever hope to put up a strong case for the running of air services to America by this country at the present time considering the bad financial state of the country and the fact that our main industry, agriculture, needs to be developed.  Until we make conditions more suitable for our own people we cannot hope to cater for those foreigners who wish to travel on our airways.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister stands for private enterprise. That being so, he admits, I take it, the right of the butchers to a reasonable profit.  He has not, however, dealt with this question fairly.  The price for meat was fixed when 88/10 or 88/11 was the price for prime beef on the Dublin market.  The Butchers' Association have placed before the Minister's Department their costings&mdash;the cost of their labour, their killings and so forth &mdash;and they have proved to him that they cannot at the present price make a profit and that they are working at <Col N="1206" /> a loss.  The Minister should face up to this issue and solve it in the same way as other problems in connection with other industries in the State have had to be faced up to and settled.  I contend, with a knowledge of the subject, that no butcher can pay to-day's maximum price of 97/- a cwt. for heifers and bullocks in the Dublin market and kill them and have a profit. They must resort to cow beef or to cow heifer beef.  As Deputy Colley has said, the result will be second-class beef for the citizens of Dublin and our prime quality heifers and bullocks will be for export.  The Dublin consumer will not know after a short while, if the present prices continue, what good beef is.  I understand that there was a gentleman's agreement between the association and the Department to the effect that when there would be considerable rises in the price of prime beef and bullock and heifer beef the Department would re-examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister, if he goes into the subject, will note that since his settlement in March last the prices in the Dublin market soared to a height they never reached before.  They soared to 120/- a cwt.  These losses have had to be borne by the butchers in Dublin over a very considerable period.  It was admitted here in answer to a question that the price to the Army, which buys direct and does its own killing, was 1/10¾d.  I submit that even at the present price there is not a drop of more than ¾d. a lb. and that butchers cannot continue.  It is up to the Minister to meet the Dublin Victuallers' Association and settle this problem either by giving them their profits by way of increased prices or by way of subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent all this talk about &ldquo;tin-pot industries&rdquo; in this country.  If the number of people employed in a district or in a parish is only five or ten it is five or ten people off the emigration roll; it is five or ten individual incomes going into a district or parish, and five or ten people off the unemployment roll.  This habit of belittling them and imagining something great in the line of reafforestation and so forth is ridiculous.  I have seen a forestry belt of up to 1,000 acres operated in my district, <Col N="1207" /> and I have seen the employment drop to five or six at this time of the year.  We appreciated the employment of these five or six individuals at this time of the year.  This habit of deprecating what are called &ldquo;tin-pot industries&rdquo; is ridiculous.  If we had such an industry in every parish in the country it would be all to the good.  It would improve agriculture and the farmers would benefit by it. Instead of having five or six families depending on the dole they would have some kind of a decent wage.  They would then be potential consumers of the farmers' goods.  I hope Deputies will realise that and face the problem.</P>
    <P>We cannot talk about decentralisation of industry and at the same time deprecate what is called the &ldquo;tin-pot industry.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass has ably dealt with the two industries in my constituency.  However, I want to add my voice to his in asking the Minister to give every consideration to these industries.  One is the cotton industry and the other is the woollen industry. The cotton industry in Athlone is a thriving industry which employs 400 or 500 people.  They have good rates of wages, good conditions of labour, and they are very happy.  That industry is expanding and we would be very pleased if the Minister would do everything in his power to help it.  The woollen industry was one of the best industries in the Midlands but, unfortunately, it has been burned down.  It is, however, being slowly reconstructed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has pleaded for the establishment of what I might call a national wool combing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not describe the woollen mills as a &ldquo;tin-pot industry&rdquo; and I do not assume that the Deputy would either.  I would like to see a proper wool industry established here so that the necessity for sending our raw material to Bradford and Leeds to have it turned into yarn would be obviated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with water power I <Col N="1208" /> would like if the Minister would examine into the possibility of having a hydro-electric scheme on either the Inny or the Brosna.  Both those rivers are in my constituency.  There is ample water.  Whether the necessary fall could be created in order to carry out a scheme similar to that on the Liffey I do not know.  Such a scheme would be an advantage in rural electrification.</P>
    <P>A good deal of discussion has taken place with regard to the air services. I was rather amused to hear Deputy Davin state that it was the wealthy people who travelled by air.  I am sure in the days of the stage coach there was large scale opposition to the development of the railways and I am equally sure that the argument was then advanced that it was only the rich people who could afford to travel on the railways.  Air services will definitely be a development of the future in every country and we should not lag behind.  Deputy Davin also dealt with the expert who has come over to advise the Government with regard to the rehabilitation of our railways. I am wholeheartedly in favour of our rail services and I would prefer to have rail services even to the extent of sacrificing private lorry owners.  If all the goods and services carried by the railways now were diverted on to the roads we would require roads three times the width of the ones we have at present.  I think it would be a bad thing to do away with our railways.  On advice, before, the line from Broadstone to Galway was removed.  That subsequently proved to be a detrimental step.  The railway to the West is not anything like as effective as it was.  I trust that this present expert, who was born in Dublin and educated in England, will have a broader approach to the subject when he comes to advise the present Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass dealt at some length with supplies and the position in which we found ourselves during the last war. If there is danger of another conflict I think it would be advisable to lay in stocks now.  I am thinking of things like bicycles, accessories, tyres and so forth.  The Minister should bear these things in mind.  I think it would be no harm to encourage the building up of <Col N="1209" /> stocks.  I would remind the House of the scarcity of iron for horseshoes during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister at some time to examine into the prices paid for pelts.  The price is as low as it was during 1914 to 1918.  This week the fellmongers were paying ? for sheep skins.  I do not know what justification there can be for that. Whether it is related to the type of article manufactured from it I do not know, but I do not think that it can be. The price is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I should like to say at the opening of a short statement, that I was very much impressed by the very comprehensive survey that was made here this evening by Deputy Lemass.  Without endeavouring in any way to make what might be called Party capital out of his contribution, he did, I think, make a statesmanlike contribution to this discussion.  It is, unfortunately, one of the defects of our Party system of government that this particular Government at the moment is deprived of the very valuable assistance that might be given to it by Deputy Lemass if he were a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> I agree with Deputy Larkin that industry and commerce, so far as our national economy are concerned, are as important as food and that they must be approached in the same way. I think we must take a broad view of the problem&mdash;not a near view of it.  We must look at it in a comprehensive way and we must endeavour to plan industry so that it will contribute its share to our national well-being.  One of the problems which confronts us so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned is that of employment&mdash;not temporary employment but permanent and well-paid employment. I think we should be quite clear in our minds that whatever can be produced in this country it is essential for the welfare of the country that all our efforts ought to be directed towards such production under decent conditions as to pay-and service for the people engaged in it.</P>
