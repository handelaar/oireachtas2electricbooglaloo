    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he can state whether the British Government claims to apply conscription to any Irishmen resident in England or to Irishmen resident in the Six Counties; and, if so, does the Government propose to raise an effective protest not alone with England but with America and the Commonwealth nations, and if this is not effective whether he will use other legitimate means to protect our nationals in all Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the British Government has hitherto regarded Irish citizens as British subjects, and Irishmen in Great Britain have been liable to conscription as British subjects since 1939.  The position at the moment is that, under the National Service Act, 1947, Irishmen between 18 and 26 years of age, who have been ordinarily resident in Britain for not less than two years for other than educational or similar temporary purposes, may be called up for service in the British armed forces.  Any Irishman so called up who does not wish to serve in the British forces may, however, return to Ireland.  There is no compulsory military service in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application to Irish citizens of British Acts imposing military obligations on British subjects has been the subject of protests by the Irish Government. A new situation will, however, be created when the British Nationality Act, 1948, enters into force on the 1st January next.  Under this Act, Irish citizens will no longer be British <Col N="1520" /> subjects under the law of Great Britain. No doubt that change will, in due course, be reflected in British legislation dealing with service in the British armed forces, and I do not suppose that, in future, the British Government would seek to impose compulsory military obligations on Irish citizens resident in Great Britain other than those who, of their own volition, have chosen the status of British subject or United Kingdom citizen under the provision of the new Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state when unemployment benefit will be paid to workers who have returned from England to this country, with British unemployment stamps to their credit, or what is the present position in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to indicate the date from which unemployment benefit in respect of contributions paid in Great Britain will become payable to workers who have returned from employment there.  The position is that a basis for reciprocity in unemployment insurance has been agreed between my Department and the British Ministry of National Insurance, and a draft of a formal agreement is at present being prepared.</P>
      <P>I hope that the agreement will shortly be signed, and the Deputy may rest assured that it will be implemented as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when he will sanction the creation of full-time posts for home assistance officers in Ferns and Enniscorthy area, as the present posts have been filled temporarily by the county manager, for some months, and have caused a lot of dissatisfaction amongst ex-servicemen and others in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that by the expression &ldquo;full-time posts&rdquo; the Deputy means permanent posts.  My Department is at present engaged in <Col N="1521" /> a review of salaries, duties and conditions of employment of all assistance officers and pending the completion of this review it is not considered desirable to have any new permanent appointments made to the assistance officer grade.  The review is being pressed forward as expeditiously as possible and when it is completed I will be in a position to deal with the question of permanent appointments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will make an authoritative statement setting out their exact legal position in all its bearings for the guidance of Irish citizens resident in England under the British Nationality Act, 1948, which comes into force on the 1st January, 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot make authoritative legal statements about the law of another country.  That is a matter for the courts and other competent authorities of the country concerned.  The principal provisions of the British Nationality Act dealing with the position of Irish citizens are, however, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Irish citizens, irrespective of their place of residence, will no longer be British subjects under the law of Great Britain.</P>
      <P>(2)  Existing laws in force in Britain continue to have effect in relation to Irish citizens who are not British subjects in the same manner as they have effect in relation to British subjects, until provision is made to the contrary; but</P>
      <P>(3)  Specific provision is made whereby this will not operate to make Irish citizens resident in Great Britain or the British Colonies liable to prosecution for acts done outside Great Britain which would not be offences if committed by an alien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Irish citizens who have existing associations with Great Britain&mdash;as, for example, by service under the Crown, or the holding of a British <Col N="1522" /> passport, or descent, or residence in Britain or any British colony&mdash;may continue to be regarded as British subjects under the law in force in Great Britain, if they claim by notice in writing to the British Home Secretary that that is their desire.</P>
    <P>(5)  Irish citizens who have been ordinarily resident in Great Britain for 12 months may become citizens of the United Kingdom by registering in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>(6)  An Irish citizen who is also a citizen of the United Kingdom under the provisions of the new Act may, if he so desires, renounce his United Kingdom citizenship.</P>
    <P>(7)  Finally, the word &ldquo;alien&rdquo; is defined in the Act as meaning a person who is not a British subject, a British-protected person or an Irish citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that labourers who occupy labourers' cottages and plots are not eligible for the allocation of cheap seed potatoes under the schemes operated by his Department in County Kerry; and, if so, whether he will introduce proposals for <Col N="1524" /> amending legislation to remedy the position at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the seed distribution scheme under the terms of which seed is supplied at reduced rates in certain areas in the congested districts.  The object of the scheme is to maintain the quality of the stocks of seeds in these areas and is not in the nature of a relief measure.  The scheme is confined strictly to smallholders who earn their living solely or mainly by farming on their own holdings.  Labourers who are occupiers of county board of health cottages and plots cannot be regarded as coming within this category.  If, however, they are also the rated occupiers of, and are cultivating, small holdings in addition to their cottage plots they are not debarred from participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I regret it would not be feasible to change the scope of the scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is in general terms, but obviously I can reply only in relation to this country and to the initial loan agreement entered into by this country.  The <Col N="1526" /> terms of any later loan agreements will not necessarily be the same.</P>
      <P>As shown by the documents presented to the House.  I, on behalf of the Government, have entered into an obligation to repay the line of credit of $60,000,000 (or so much of it as is actually drawn) in lawful money of the United States of America, unless both lender and borrower mutually agree otherwise.  Article 4 of the Loan Agreement, which is in very wide terms, makes provision for a situation in which the borrower might find difficulty in meeting the loan obligations as they fall due.</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question, as applied to this country's first loan, is, therefore, in the negative.  As regards the second part of the question, having regard to the fact that the repayment period stretches from 1956 to 1983, and to the terms of Article 4, a reply could be given only on the basis of a variety of assumptions as to the course of future events, which I naturally hesitate to make.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware <Col N="1529" /> that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the system of inspection and grading of hotels, and if he is aware that the standards fixed by the Tourist Board are far too high, particularly for hotels in small provincial towns, and if he will have such regulations modified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not aware that there is any widespread dissatisfaction with the system of inspection and grading of hotels by the Irish Tourist Board some complaints have been received but on investigation I am satisfied that the board is exercising its functions in a satisfactory way. The Deputy will, no doubt, realise that if the tourist traffic is to be developed on sound lines our accommodation for tourists must be maintained at a high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in small provincial towns there are hotels which do not normally cater for the tourist trade but rather for a passing trade such as commercial travellers, cattle traders, etc.?  Is it not unfair to expect that these hotels should conform to the high standards required for tourists hotels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is no attempt to catapult provincial hotels, as the Deputy terms it, to the highest possible grade but I do not think anybody will dispute the fact that there was a necessity for improvement. Nobody likes to be told or at least very few people like to be told how to do their business but I am satisfied that in all the circumstances the Tourist Board officials are doing this very necessary work in a fairly satisfactory manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate everything the Minister has said but at the same time I am sure he is aware that there are a number of old family hotels in villages and small towns which have been in existence for 50 years or more <Col N="1530" /> and they are actually being asked to take down the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; from outside their premises, a request which, I think, the Minister will agree is unfair considering that they are catering for the same type of people for which they have always catered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in this country we have a number of high-grade hotels but I also know, and so does every Deputy, that we have a large number of establishments purporting to cater for home people as well as for visitors that are not a credit to this country.  What the Tourist Board have been trying to do since it was established and what they are still trying to do, as far as I know, in no harsh way or without putting any very heavy burden on the owners of these establishments, is to improve the standards. Deputies and hotel proprietors will have to realise that from this onwards there will be far greater competition for the tourist trade than there has been in the last two or three years.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister stated and he links that statement with an allegation that I then took the lime for my own personal use.  Inasmuch as I was chairman of the Beet Growers' Association for a period during those years, that statement by the Minister <Col N="1534" /> was intended as a charge that I abused my position as chairman of the association to the advantage of myself at the expense of the Galway farmers. Last night I demanded a withdrawal of this charge of corruption against me but the Minister evaded the issue by purporting to think that I was merely asking for a withdrawal of the statement that I bought the lime.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill, the Minister more or less agreed to look into the case of certain categories of persons who would come within the scope of this section.  Last evening, however, when he was concluding his speech, he created the impression in my mind that he was not prepared to give any consideration to the suggestions which I made in the course of my remarks.  I would like to point out to the Minister that, to my mind, this decision is a rather serious one, inasmuch as it is creating for the <Col N="1539" /> future a position of immunity for any person who is a member of the Defence Forces, and who, in like circumstances, decides to get out of the Army of which he is a member, leave the county and join the forces of some foreign State. I think it would be a rather serious state of affairs if we create a position of immunity for such individuals.  It may be that in normal times we have all the machinery necessary for dealing with a person who deserts from the Army.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister, however, that at the end of the recent emergency Deputies of every Party were receiving communications similar to that received by me. Certainly, to my own knowledge members of my own Party did receive such communications.  These letters came from wives and mothers asking for assurances that their husbands or their sons could return to this country, and be assured on their return that no action would be taken against them by the responsible authorities.  I discussed this matter with the military authorities at the time, and they assured me that if these individuals came back, as far as the Army was concerned, they would be prosecuted with the full rigour of the law.  No assurance such as was being sought by these people could be given.  The position reached such a stage that in further discussions it was decided that some measure of this kind would be necessary. If an assurance was given which would allow these people to come back in large numbers, the Army authorities felt that they would be engaged in courts-martial for a year or two years in dealing with these cases; it was also suggested that the penalties which would be inflicted, because of the temper of mind and the ideas held in respect of the recent past, would be of a very severe nature.  It was eventually decided, therefore, that some method, such as that contained in the measure which we brought in, would be the best means of dealing with this particular aspect of Army life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what I have said, I appeal, even at this late stage, to the Minister <Col N="1540" /> to give some consideration to the suggestions which I have made.  I am not asking him to go after everybody who deserted from the Army.  There are certain categories, such as he has mentioned himself; there are, for instance, the people to whom calling-up notices were forwarded and who claimed they did not receive them.  I think myself that that excuse is a thin one, because it must be remembered that in order to get a calling-up notice the individual has to be at one time or another a member of the Defence Forces.  I will go further and point out to the Minister that the person so receiving such a notice would be a person who had over a long period of time been receiving from the State what I describe as a &ldquo;retaining fee&rdquo;. He would, in other words, be in receipt of a reservist grant&mdash;a grant of anything from £9 to £16 per annum.  The fact that an individual was receiving this sum of money annually and that at the vital moment of call up he refused to obey the summons is, in my opinion, tantamount to receiving money under false pretences.  That is another aspect of the matter to which I would like the Minister to give some consideration.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister quoted 756 as the number of regular soldiers who deserted.  I am sure that only a very, very small number of those did in fact return but, whatever the number was, they should not now be permitted to avail of vacancies which might be created in any of these sections of State employment, such as county councils, borough councils or corporations. I do not agree with the notional or hypothetical case which the Minister made here yesterday in regard to some individual who may or may not have existed; if that individual comes within the category to which I have referred, in reply to the Minister's challenge, when he asked us was there any Deputy over here who would in such circumstances demand that this penalty should be inflicted, I would say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I stand over that because I feel that any man who enters into a contract with the State and at a moment of stress or danger decides to clear out is not worthy of consideration. I would ask the Minister at least <Col N="1541" /> to go as far as he undertook to go in his statement on the Second Reading of this Bill; that is, to consider some ways or means of dealing with the categories to which I have referred.  I do not ask him to go after these in any punitive way.  I merely ask him to ensure that future Governments and Army authorities charged with the task of enforcing discipline will not find the situation made too easy for any person who makes up his mind to desert the ranks of his own Army in a time of danger.</P>

      <P>I wish to say something on this matter as I had a question addressed to Deputy Traynor when he was Minister for Defence on behalf of those men.  A number of those men left the Army because of the better separation allowances that were offered to men in other armies.  Some joined up because they wanted to be in the fight.  I think it is very bad policy, now in the year 1948, when men want to return to their own country to have them penalised.  We have deserters from some other armies here and enjoying jobs outside public bodies.  I would ask the Minister to wipe out those penalties now that the emergency is over.  Making provision for their families was the cause of a lot of them going away.  I appeal to the ex-Minister to allow those men back to their wives and families.  He did allow their return on condition that they got no employment under local authorities. That was the penalty the ex-Minister put on these people.  I would ask the present Minister to withdraw the regulation and allow those men to get employment in the country and live with their wives and families.  I do not think that they should be looked upon now as real deserters.  They are as good Irishmen as people who remained at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it was said somewhere that only providence can measure humans and I certainly am not going to step in between the two Deputies to measure up their relevant values as humans with all their strengths and all their weaknesses.  In connection with this particular section, Section 8 and the removal of continuing disabilities, I want Deputy Traynor, in particular, to accept this from me, that on the introduction of this Bill I myself suggested to the Deputy that it might be possible to segregate these people into classes, regulars and others and I gave an assurance to the Deputy that I would have that looked into.  Judging by the Deputy's observations just now it would appear to me that he assumes that I have not had that looked into. I want the Deputy now to accept a clear assurance from me that before I left the premises that night I made arrangements to have all that gone into very fully and very comprehensively the following morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as keeping the assurance to have the whole thing gone into as thoroughly and as completely as a Department is capable of doing it, I had that done.  I had it done without undue delay, and the advice I got and the material made available to me&mdash;I think the Deputy is peculiarly knowledgeable on that aspect of it&mdash;was to <Col N="1544" /> the effect that there were so many various categories and classifications that the administrative task of deciding into what particular class or category or grade any particular deserter would fall would make the administration of the thing so impossible that the person sitting in judgment on every individual case would be the Minister in person.  The Deputy held that responsibility for a great number of years, and I think he will agree with me that whatever has to be done should be done through Parliament and discretion in matters so important as this should not be vested on the shoulders of any particular individual to take a decision on each case when and if it arose.  I want to assure the Deputy that I share his view that the offence of desertion is a particularly serious one.  It is one of the most serious offences that could be committed by anybody in uniform.  If he thinks that in this proposal of mine, this particular section, there is any intention, either directly or by implication, to grant any sense of immunity to soldiers who may contemplate such a course in future, then I would be the last to put down such a section.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputy, however, to remember that the original Defence Forces Act is still there carrying all the penalties for desertion that are common to all or most armies.  There is not a comma in that particular Act altered.  But I am in the same position as the Deputy was two years ago when he told us in the course of his remarks that he was standing over the Defence Forces Act with all the penalties, imprisonment and all the rest; that he got letters from mothers, from wives, from sisters and from his colleagues in his Party and other Deputies asking him not to inflict the full pound of flesh; that if those men came home he should waive the threat of imprisonment. Like a good Christian and a person with a human heart, he listened to all those representations and he agreed to waive the ordinary, normal military penalties.  I would not accuse him, or did not accuse him, of granting immunity to soldiers in future to <Col N="1545" /> desert or encouraging the really serious crime of soldiers deserting from the colours.  He did a natural human act and he did it when the war was passed and in the spirit of a man saying: &ldquo;Let the dead past bury its dead; let us not carry on this for ever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Deputy's action in 1946. He was merely faced then with putting a man, say, for a month or six weeks into jail, where the man would get his bed and his three meals a day.  But he remitted all the normal military penalties and he substituted other impositions of a continuing kind.  Do not let the Deputy, however, having taken that action, turn round to me and say: &ldquo;You are granting immunity to deserters of the future; you are encouraging them.&rdquo;  The first step was taken there and that first step was a right step, a step which I would have taken if I were in the Deputy's position then, and a step that I respect him for taking.</P>
    <P>The particular penalties, however, that were imposed instead of the normal military penalties were passing over a military responsibility to a number of civilian bodies, asking the civilian corporations and other bodies throughout the country to deal with military offenders for military offences and to continue to deal with military offenders for military offences over a period of seven years.  That particular solution or step was, in my opinion, a mistake.  But, at the time that step was taken and in the circumstances of the times in which it was taken, I can understand and appreciate the Deputy's position and the reason why such action was proposed then.  He did not want to meet every fellow at the boat and clap him into jail.  At the same time, he did not want to say to each of them: &ldquo;Come back and you are welcome; nothing will happen to you.&rdquo; But, during and over a period, he had, as it were, instead of taking the full step, the intermediate step.  It was justifiable at the time and it has continued in operation for three years.</P>
    <P>I am now in the same position as the Deputy was two years ago, with appeals on behalf of people who have reached destitution level.  Do not let <Col N="1546" /> the Deputy ride away with the idea that this is a kind of notional idea of my own.  I have had men who were recently of good physique knocking at my hall door, with the clothes hanging off them.  Even judging them with the medical eye, I could see all the appearance, not of threatened, but actual starvation.  These were people who had left their families behind and came up here to the city to try to get work.  They were under the ban of being unemployables, untouchables, for another five years.  If the Deputy had the same experience as I had, the feelings of humanity and Christianity that urged him two years ago to remove the normal military penalties from the lives of these men would similarly stimulate him to-day to remove the abnormal civilian penalties which are imposed upon them by the original emergency Order.  The fact that that Order was passed, that it was approved, that it continued in existence and in full force for a matter of four years, should satisfy any soldier of to-day or any soldier of the future that there is nobody in this Dáil, no matter what position he occupies or what side of the House he sits upon, who views lightly the crime, the military offence of desertion, and that in future the full military penalties which are still carried there in the Act will operate.</P>
    <P>I urge the Deputy to place himself mentally in my position and to think back to the impulses that stimulated him two years ago when he remitted, or failed to exercise, certain penalties. Even though he has the very strongest convictions and feelings with regard to the gravity of the offence committed and the danger of an example being set to future generations of Irish soldiers, nevertheless he held his hand, nevertheless he softened in his attitude and listened to the appeals.  He was motivated by charitable, Christian motives.  I ask him to think of that period when he had to take a decision and to ask himself if, in the light of changing circumstances, with years having rolled by, if he were back in the old position whether he would not come forward to the Dáil with exactly the same proposals I am coming forward <Col N="1547" /> with, namely, we have inflicted enough punishment; we have made it clear to everybody in this generation and in the future that the crime committed by these men is a serious crime and that we will do our utmost to prevent its repetition; but that we will not, in addition to penalising the soldier, continue to penalise the soldier's family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my objections to this section is that, if it passes this House, it is an indication that the House stands by Deputy O'Leary's attitude that one is as good as the other, that the man who deserted the Irish Army during the war was as good as the man who stood by his oath, and who, during all that period, was ready to defend the nation against any attack. I do not believe that one was as good as the other.  This nation has a right to be thankful that there were a number of men who took the Army oath and who stood loyally by this country during the war period.  It may be that this nation will again find itself in similar circumstances.  This Dáil should indicate its belief that the man who stands by his country in the circumstances in which our soldiers stood by it during the last war, is deserving of respect and every help the nation can give him, and the man who deserts is deserving of some mark of disrespect, and of some punishment.</P>
      <P>Everything looks very rosy to Deputy O'Leary and others.  He can sneer at the people who were prepared to fight for this country, who stayed in the Army, and he can say that they did not want to fight.  But even an ordinary second-grade schoolboy who can read can see by the disclosures that were made since the war that the men who undertook to defend this country were undertaking a dangerous and difficult job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should this section pass, what will be the situation at the employment exchange where there is a 1916 man, a Black and Tan war medallist, and a deserter, lining up for some employment? Are we going to compel the employment exchange officer to put the deserter at the head of the list for employment if, as we know at the present <Col N="1548" /> time, a 1916 man or a man with a small income is a little bit better off than the civilian who gave no service? He is not given priority over them in the list for employment when relief works are being undertaken in a district, but are we going to compel the employment exchange officer to put a group of deserters at the top of the list and say that they must be employed first, before the 1916 men or the Black and Tan war people or the men who served in the Army during the war are considered?</P>
    <P>I would object very strongly to that and I urge the Minister to accept Deputy Traynor's amendment to delete this section and thereby mark the determination of the Dáil that we will keep in respect the men who stood by the nation during the war and that we will inflict some punishment on the people who deserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in the main with the remarks of the Deputy and I would be sorry if he thought or read anything into my remarks that would imply that there was equality in our estimation between the soldier who carried on, who stood by his own country and its flag, and the man who did not do so.  I do not think amongst most of us there are two opinions on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am suggesting to Deputy Traynor, Deputy Aiken and Deputy Colley is that as between the original Act, the steps taken by Deputy Traynor and the opinions given expression to here, there is no difference of opinion with regard to the gravity of the offence and its seriousness in the past and in the future and the determination of the Dáil to put it down if ever it shows its head again.  But Deputy Traynor, in view of the fact that war had passed and that we wanted to settle our minds to organisation for the future, and hopeful that we would be organising in the direction of peace, deliberately and, I believe, correctly, took a certain decision which meant, in effect, remitting all the military penalties normally imposed on deserters and substituting certain civilian penalties.  Those certain civilian penalties have remained in being for a <Col N="1549" /> couple of years and, I take it, have had a very beneficial effect.  But now we are coming to the time when we should consider, in a spirit of charity, remitting those continuing penalties.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can read into that request any gesture of encouragement to deserters or to soldiers to desert in future.  I think clemency, when it is exercised in the right spirit and at the right time, often has a greater preventive effect than continuing the imposition of hardships. What I am asking the Dáil to accept from me in connection with this Bill is not any cleaning of the slate.  I am asking them to engage in an act of clemency and, while exercising that clemency, to make it very clear how much each and all of us deplore and condemn the act of desertion.  It could very well lead to the death of a nation and I do not think there is any of us in full possession of his senses who at any time or from any position in the House would, by word or action, do anything that might encourage soldiers to engage in such activities in future. In that spirit I ask the Deputy to accept the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>There was not so much sympathy in his answer a couple of weeks ago when he made the announcement with regard to the 51 people who had been disemployed from the Dublin barracks.  When Deputy Burke commented on that action, the Minister had not such a lot of sympathy in his tones.  In these circumstances we are being asked now to put those deserters in line for employment with these other men, and if Deputy Aiken's statement is correct, possibly to put them before these men, putting employment clerks in the position that they must put those men first.  I, for one, am not prepared to accept that proposal.  In the circumstances of the time at which it was <Col N="1550" /> passed, the proposal that this disqualification should stand for seven years did not seem excessive.  The Minister has made reference to the right time. What is there to show that this is the right time, while the circumstances that I have enumerated exist?  I think the time is all wrong and I cannot find any sympathy in my heart for these men, while the position exists, as it undoubtedly does, that I.R.A. men, while the position exists, as it undoubtedly does, that I.R.A. men, particularly 1916 men, and the men who served loyally during the emergency are left without employment.  We have unfortunately too many of them looking for work.  So far as Deputy O'Leary's plea is concerned, he is overlooking the fact that this disqualification applied only to what one might call public employment but the same men with whom his sympathy lies have unfortunately a much better chance of getting employment than the men in whom I am interested.</P>

Now it is proposed that we should put a further barrier in the way of our own men.  I must say that I cannot see the argument for that at all. In spite of all the Minister has said, there is no question that any future Minister for Defence who might have to face an emergency or worse, would be placed in a very difficult position, as any man who wanted to desert would have only to point to what happened the deserters in the last emergency. It would be said: &ldquo;Oh, they did nothing to us.  They prevented us from getting corporation work for a couple of years, and then they took off the ban and we were able to walk into the best jobs.  At the same time all the poor fools who had to submit to Army discipline all through the emergency were left walking the streets.&rdquo;  Would that not be a nice position for us to be placed in?  We have the statement of Deputy O'Leary that one was as good as another.  I think it is outrageous that one should have to listen to statements of that kind in this <Col N="1551" /> House, that the men who went forward to defend their country and who, in many cases, gave up their jobs, took risks and served to the end loyally, should be to-day told that they were no better than the men who deserted and went off to get better money.  We would surely have a nice country if all our young men were of that calibre.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the military punishments that could have been inflicted on these men were taken away and that this provision was put in lieu of them.  I do not think that anybody can say that the existing regulation is excessive.  I am quite sure that if any of these men had come back and had gone through the ordinary course of facing a courtmartial, they would not have been let down very lightly.  It is quite natural to expect that the temper of Army officers towards these men would not have been in any way friendly.  I think the punishment that was abolished in that respect was much more severe than any of them could suffer under the existing regulation. This regulation does not prevent them from getting work.  It only prevents them from getting public employment. Statements have been made here which would suggest that those men had no earthly chance of getting any work except public work.  As I have already stated, they have a much better chance of getting work with some firms than our own people.  The Minister apparently was not able to meet the plea put up to him to deal with the worst cases, but in any event if I have to choose between the law as it is and the Bill here, I most certainly will vote in favour of keeping the ban there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a few questions of the Minister in connection with this matter.  First of all, is this provision designed to legalise the existing position?  In other words, are there people already in employment which they are debarred from holding because of these regulations? Secondly, is this provision designed to make way for people in these categories for the future?  Are <Col N="1552" /> there any definite appointments of that nature envisaged?  Otherwise, as I said yesterday, this amendment, brought specifically into the Bill, would seem to be purposeless.  I hardly think the Minister would bring in a matter of this sort as a question of general grace.  If we have somebody illegally in these appointments, then, as I said yesterday, the question of how they got them is a matter to be looked into, and the people responsible for putting them there should be asked to account.  If these people are waiting to get into appointments, the Minister should have regard to the fact that there are a large number of ex-soldiers who are capable of filling these appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is public appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Appointments covered by the section.  Frankly, I personally would not oppose the Minister too strongly on this, even though I think it is unwise to relax restrictions that have been imposed in order to secure discipline in the Army. I would not oppose the Minister so strongly were it not that I know there are numbers of ex-soldiers who served during the whole of the emergency who have not yet been able to find suitable employment.  One of the big problems on demobilisation was to try to get employment for these men.  One possibility is that the position is that there are appointments vacant for which these men would be eligible and could secure, and to which they have a prior claim over the class of person considered in this section.  The other possibility is that these men in the past have been deprived of appointments which should have been open to them and which they should have secured&mdash;and that they have been deprived of them for the benefit of people who defaulted in their national duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel personally vindictive towards these people who are considered in this amendment.  I think that there may even be some cases, perhaps cases of hardship, with which <Col N="1553" /> one might sympathise.  The overriding fact, however, is that the man who served from the beginning and who honoured his engagement to the end, has a claim in all priority to such posts. While there are men in that category as yet unplaced it must be remembered that they have a prior claim.  Whether the Minister secures passage of this amendment or not, it is the duty of the Government to see that such appointments continue to be filled by ex-soldiers who discharged their duty.  If, in the future, there are appointments available which could be filled by the class of men considered in this amendment then the preference should go to the men who served&mdash;and while men who served without a breach of their contract to the nation are available there should be no filling of State appointments or appointments in which the State is interested until the last man of that category is exhausted. Then by all means remove your disability and let others in.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have no difficulty in getting personnel.  I think his Department has already recognised more than one association that caters for these people.  Even in the case of the organised Army Benevolent Fund, which is a completely regularised organisation, well recognised by the State from the beginning, the Minister has only to consult it or the officers' associations to get the names of people eligible for these appointments.  It is our duty to see that these ex-soldiers get these appointments.  It is on that point, as far as I am personally concerned, more than on any other point that I would join issue with the Minister. I know that he is as anxious as anybody else to help the ex-soldiers and I would urge him, therefore, to have particular regard to my remarks. Whether the section goes through or not I would urge him to ensure that in practice the man who fulfilled his contract, who obtained an honourable discharge at the end, and who is still awaiting employment, will get preference over any man in this particular category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to understand the purpose of this.  I can scarcely think that the Minister would introduce a full section like this on an amending Bill, on general grounds, without some specific problems in view.  I may be wrong and if I am I should like the Minister to tell me so.  I think, however, that some specific instances of some specific problem must have prompted him to introduce this section &mdash;either the fact that already some people have illegally secured employment at the expense of ex-servicemen or else that it is contemplated in the immediate future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to give this type of employment to that type of person.  In either case there is something wrong.  The previous Government, I think with the approval of the whole House, did make this provision to try to provide for ex-servicemen who had honoured their engagement. If anything has gone wrong in the past then the people responsible for the breach of that should at least be held accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter of principle which is involved.  One of the great difficulties in maintaining the morale of the Defence Forces and in providing for the ex-soldier arises from the fact that his term of useful service in the Army&mdash;be he in the commissioned or in the non-commissioned ranks&mdash;terminates at a relatively early age.  He must go out on a small pension while he is still a relatively fit man with quite a number of working days, in the civilian sense of the word, available to him.  The problem, therefore, is to find employment for him.  I know myself that when this problem was being looked into in the Department of Defence with a view to post-war <Col N="1555" /> reorganisation it loomed large both for the emergency Army then going out and for the Army of a future date.</P>
    <P>Only a very limited number of appointments are open to ex-officers and ex-soldiers&mdash;certain appointments in the prison service and so forth.  The State is put to the pin of its collar to provide for these men.  After the emergency the situation unfortunately became more acute because a large number of public spirited young men volunteered in 1940.  Many of them had families and many of them left good jobs to do so.  That is not merely a general statement.  I personally know of some young men who left good jobs in Dublin in 1940 and accepted soldiers' pay.  Sometimes their employers made up the difference.  However, these men served until the end of the emergency and they then found that there were changes which virtually threw them on to the street.  It is a very difficult problem for the State to solve.  Neither the Minister nor the Government has unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>All that can be done is to try to reserve the appointments which are directly under the State for men in such categories and then to try and get the co-operation of employers generally. Many complaints have been made that some employers in this State have given preference in the matter of employment to people who were out of the country at that period rather than to people who stayed at home.  In these circumstances, is it wise for us to make provision for the category of person who went away?  They have been very well looked after in other respects and unfortunately our own men are only all too badly looked after.  It is incumbent on us to try and fight for them as far as we can.  Fighting all out, we will still be at a disadvantage in trying to do the best we possibly can for them&mdash;whether as members of the Government, as Deputies or as private individuals.  They will still be handicapped. I would, therefore, renew my plea that the Minister will ensure that in the case of all such appointments a rule will definitely be carried out that the person who served honourably during <Col N="1556" /> the emergency will get priority and that steps will be taken to see that if such a bar is legally removed it will not operate in practice to deprive ex-servicemen of an opportunity of getting employment.  It raises a very thorny question as to whether those people who have got there illegally should not be removed and the option given to those men who served faithfully. Having regard to all the circumstances, if there is a man who should get a job and a deserter, whether technically or in fact, has already got it, I am not so sure that even at this late date we should not remedy that situation and put in the ex-serviceman.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and the Deputy's colleagues can have as clear an assurance as it is possible for any Minister to give speaking on his own behalf and, speaking, as far as he knows, on behalf of the whole Government. The policy of our predecessors, as far as they could direct, control, or influence local services&mdash;that is, local authorities&mdash;was to give priority to ex-Army men with a clean discharge. Moreover, they went beyond that, and asked the independent employing authorities to co-operate with the Government in their particular outlook with regard to priority in employment. There has been no departure whatsoever from that outlook with the change of Government.  That will continue to be our outlook.  If that assurance meets the Deputies, I give it freely.</P>

      <P>It is not.  The Deputy was not here when I was speaking.  I do not know at the moment of any individual who is illegally or irregularly in employment in defiance of the Act, as it stands.  In the course of my <Col N="1558" /> remarks I mentioned that individuals on the destitution and on the beggar line had knocked at my hall-door, and I had seen in them physical evidence of starvation.  They were under this particular ban.  I think it is fair to give them the race even though they are at the end of the queue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as they take their places in the queue I do not think one can have a very serious objection. Will the Minister, however, give the necessary directions to ensure that when such appointments are going, the organisation is consulted so that ex-servicemen will have an opportunity of entering?  Difficulty very often arises from lack of knowledge on the part of people who would be entitled to apply, but who do not get an opportunity of applying in time.</P>

They had to take the boat to Britain, many of them to join the British forces and many to find employment in British coal mines. Now, members of the Fianna Fáil Party talk about making provision for ex-soldiers.  It nauseates me to listen to them.  There was no proper arrangement made for the men who served during the emergency.  Admittedly, when there was some turf to be cut or some minor relief schemes to be carried out those who served in the Army were given a preference.  There were other employments in which the Government had an influence and in which the fact of having served in the Defence Forces was of no help at all to prospective applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Major de Valera knows it as well as I do. Recently he spoke to a federation of ex-servicemen.  He has spoken on many occasions to that federation.  That federation of ex-servicemen was pressing for employment under the Fianna Fáil Government just as strongly as it is pressing for it under the present Government.  Let me say that I am not taking the line that this present Government is doing all that they could for the ex-serviceman.  They are not doing all they could for the ex-serviceman but I say that it is a sham for a member of the last Government to come in here and pretend that the last <Col N="1560" /> Government did everything that they possibly could for the ex-soldier.  I object to the nonsense and to all this humbug of trying to make political capital, of trying to fool the fellows outside by saying: &ldquo;I will put up your case in the Dáil for employment for you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this to do with Section 8?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has all to do with Section 8.  It is because it has to do with Section 8 that I am dealing with it now.  The Minister brought in this Section 8, which is a very simple section, and he asks this Dáil a couple of years after the war is over to mitigate to some extent the penalties that were imposed on those 4,000 soldiers who had deserted from the Regular Army, or from the Reserve, or from some of the volunteer services during the emergency. I do not know how many of those 4,000 are still in the country, how many have left the country or how many are finding employment in Britain or in the British armed forces.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many have left their bones in the desert of North Africa, or in the plains of Italy.  All I know is that, according to the Minister, there are 4,000 deserters and that now, some years after the war is over, the Minister says to this House there are penalties and restrictions on these men that will prevent them getting relief work which would enable them to give a bite to eat to their children. Many of them might have seven, eight, nine or ten children, and I am prevented by the prevailing conditions from giving relief work to those individuals in order that they may feed their children.  That was an appeal that could have evoked sympathy in the breasts of the people who are charitably disposed.  We are told about the qualities of mercy, humanity and charity.  However, in place of all those ideas we have Deputies getting up in this House and saying, enforce the last letter of the law on these people.  Let their wives starve, let their children starve, but enforce the law on them.  In my view, that attitude is neither charitable nor is it Christian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> What happened during the emergency? Young boys, many of them only 17 or 18 years&mdash;a great many of them only 18&mdash;in the flush of enthusiasm rushed to get into the Army.  There was no proper time to train them except in matters of drill, musketry, use of arms or what I might call the military elements.  They were trained in the military elements.  Many of those had not the foggiest idea what desertion was or what it meant.  They were called in to sign an attestation paper, and they were asked certain questions. They were in a complete fog, as anybody is, in a strange situation.  They were asked to sign their name on the dotted line and they signed it.  After a while, for one reason or another&mdash; maybe a row with a superior officer, maybe a domestic row with the wife, maybe a falling out with a girl, or a whole lot of these things, it may have been some small offence that was committed of which they were ashamed&mdash; they ran across the Border and joined up in the British forces.  Many of them might have done that under the influence of drink.  They might have wakened up the following morning, and found that they were soldiers in the British Army on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>That is what happened in a lot of cases and there was no such thing as this deliberate intention with the full knowledge of the consequences and the obligations.  There was none of that leaving with the full knowledge that that fact creates the offence of desertion at all.  The Minister asks us to be a little humane, a bit charitable, to be as we all profess to be&mdash;particularly at election times we shout very strongly about it&mdash;and show our spirit of Christianity and then we have the answer, no.  No charity in this, no mitigation, no matter who it affects. Let them suffer all the penalties that they incur by the desertion.  Let us make that case for no other reason than that we may make a case against the Minister and the Government that they are taking that line to deprive Old I.R.A. men, 1916 men from the chance of getting a job at the Labour Exchanges.  The Deputies who talk in that way ought to be ashamed of themselves. <Col N="1562" /> If we had the regard for the sacrifices that we have for the services of the men of 1916 and of the men of the Black and Tan period we would not have them on the Labour Exchange queues to-day.  We would have ensured in the quarter of a century during which we have had some control over our own affairs that those honoured soldiers of the State would now be in the position where they would not have to join an unemployment queue at the Labour Exchange for work.  Apparently that is the normal thing.</P>
    <P>We talk about the men who served in the emergency.  Those men deserve everything that we can give them.  I say they have been let down badly by the previous Administration and that the present Administration has not done all that it should for them.  I think of some of these men who served the State in 1916 dying in James's Street.  I think that not so long ago one of them died and his employer had to provide the coffin for him.  Then we have humbugs here who had the chance over years to look after these people talking about what we should do for the soldiers.  I always like to take the line of being lenient and charitable.  I never like to see the full punishment imposed on anybody for any offence.  My own profession has shown me that there are many different grades of guilt and, therefore, there should be many different grades of punishment.  The wisest and the most just judge is the man who tries to deal in a charitable, humane manner with the person who comes before him and who has committed an offence.  What sort of law have we in this country?  If every judge had the mentality of these Deputies opposite, he would say: &ldquo;You must suffer the full penalty of the law, no mitigation, no reduction whatever&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to do a very small thing, to leave these people eligible for relief work.  In a Christian country in the twentieth century of our civilisation, it is not very much to leave them available for that small thing. But the position is used by humbugs in this House, I repeat, for the purpose <Col N="1563" /> of making political capital out of it.  I myself have been a comrade of the men who served this country over a long period.  I am proud of these men, and I would be anxious to do everything I could for them.  Everything that I have been able to do at any stage, I have done.  I think it is hypocritical for people who had a chance of looking after them to talk here in the sanctimonious, humbugging way in which they have spoken about them in this debate.</P>

      <P>There is one point which must not be forgotten in all this. Nobody is going to be in the least worried about relieving a number of persons of penalties.  It is very often a very good thing to do.  The only difficulty, of course, is the matter of principle.  If you think of the morale of your own forces for the future&mdash;and that I will maintain against anybody&mdash;there is a serious problem for us to consider objectively there: whether in the interests of your own Defence Forces and the discipline in these forces of a particular group of people who will only be tested under emergency conditions rigorous discipline is necessary?  Whether the preservation of that discipline demands that you have these sanctions and must maintain them is a matter of principle which we cannot lightly pass over here.  On that ground alone, I find serious cause for thought in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of pardoning individuals or forgiving past offences, we can all very readily agree that it is a noble and proper thing to do.  So you might say about all people who have transgressed.  Surely we are all of opinion that the one thing for all people who have transgressed is to forgive them.  Yes, but, unfortunately, society being society, we must insist on sanctions, because the sad experience of the human race is that if sanctions are not insisted upon, the order of society will not be maintained. So much for the principle.  Now with regard to ex-soldiers.  People have accused us of being hypocritical in this matter.  What was the actual position? <Col N="1564" /> The position was that, at the end of the war, a section of the Army General Staff directly charged with the purpose was actively engaged, on the Minister's direction on resettlement plans.  A White Paper was produced.  It was the best that could be done within the financial resources of this State.  It was not what anybody would have been satisfied with.  But one of the big problems we were up against was this problem of employment.  It was of particular interest to the General Staff and to the Department of Defence officials in regard to two things&mdash;both the demobilisation after the emergency and the provision of future suitable employment for retiring Army personnel. The survey there showed that, within the actual control of any Government here, the number of appointments was very limited.  The very small number of appointments which a Government could make or un-make was extremely limited, and hardly counted in the picture.  A direction was given to the Civil Service authorities and special concessions were made with regard to Civil Service examinations, and, so far as I know, these provisions were carried out.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment outside that, the only thing that any Government could do was to try to get co-operation, because there was no legal machinery by which you could compel employers to employ particular people. It was not feasible to design such legislation. There was legislation with regard to reinstatement.  It was the best ingenuity could evolve.  But that in itself and of its very nature was necessarily ineffective.  You were also up against trade union rules and there you had a conflict between two different opinions, for which two sides could be argued.  It was all right to say from the point of view of the overriding right of the soldier: &ldquo;Put him in anyway and sweep everything else aside.&rdquo; The trade unions had other problems to face in this regard and could not accept the proposition just as simply as that.</P>
    <P>I give these examples to show the difficulties that were there and the fact that this Government or their predecessors could do very little more where <Col N="1565" /> numbers are concerned than try to give a lead and make recommendations and, by providing for the type of employment where they had a direct interest, to try to lead others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, I think, was coming back to something I said.  One matter in which ex-soldiers had a complaint was the number of firms in this country employing ex-soldiers of other armies in preference to ex-soldiers of our own. What could be done about that, except passing a whole set of penal legislation which would probably bring greater evils in its train, the type of legislation which it is desirable to avoid?  The Government themselves were limited in anything they could do.  Some Deputies will say: &ldquo;Let the Government do this and that.  The Government must do everything.  You did not employ them when you were the Government.&rdquo;  The fact is that the only resources the Government have are the resources of the people.  The only money they have to spend is the money of the people.  It ultimately resolves itself back in such matters to what you can get in the line of co-operation from the people.  In the particular circumstances of the ex-servicemen, the dice to a certain extent were loaded against them, in that certain employers had sympathies otherwise, and were giving preferences that were not fair preferences from the point of view of the general interest of this State.  Preferences were given to people who had served abroad in other armies.  You had the bulk of the people relatively indifferent, in spite of propaganda and what Government Departments could do in the matter.</P>
    <P>My case is simply this&mdash;no vindictiveness to anyone.  I would not even question this matter if it were not for the matter of principle and the discipline of the Army.  But the dice were so loaded against these emergency soldiers and regular soldiers and reservists, who had served right through and honourably discharged their obligations, that everything that we can do, whether big or small, should be done on their behalf.  For my part, my only objection to this section is that I feel it possibly puts them at a further disadvantage.  But, if one could <Col N="1566" /> be certain that no person in the already barred category would obtain a priority against a person entitled by having served right through, I would not be anxious to press my objection very much further; always, of course, subject to a matter which we have not discussed in great detail, the question of how far it is necessary to maintain such sanctions once imposed in order to preserve the discipline of the Defence Forces for the future.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to Deputy de Valera, as a member of a public body in connection with which jobs did arise, that the chairman, who is a member of the Deputy's Party and other people representing Fianna Fáil on the county council, would not give a preference to an ex-soldier.  Is that right?  They would not give an ex-soldier a preference.  We had cases of two officers and a private who applied for a job.  They got two votes &mdash;myself and a colleague.  Is that the right treatment for the ex-soldiers for whom Deputy de Valera is appealing? Do you not think the local authority should have given the preference there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened if it were not for the vehement manner in which Deputy Cowan indicted the previous Administration for completely disregarding ex-members of the Army.  I know, and I am sure that if Deputy Cowan is honest with himself, he also knows, that in many instances they had particular concern for these men.  I was a member of the Civil Service at a time when ex-members of the Army were getting preferential treatment in the matter of Civil Service appointments.  Deputy Cowan and others must have seen for a number of years advertisements where the upper age limit was extended in Civil Service <Col N="1567" /> appointments in favour of members of the Defence Forces, and I am sure that many persons will remember that preference marks were given for service in the Army.  I might instance the case where there was a special examination held in order to fill Civil Service posts, and they were confined exclusively to members of the Defence Forces.  As a member of the Civil Service, I knew there was a certain amount of uneasiness and unrest, even though it was not publicly voiced, in the Civil Service, as a result of the preferential treatment for ex-soldiers.</P>
      <P>It is grossly unfair that Deputy Cowan, with a flagrant disregard for the facts, should allege that Fianna Fáil, when they were the Government, told those men to go to the place that he wanted them to go to.  I will not use the phrase the Deputy used.  If I do not do so it is not that I am being hypocritical in any sense, but I consider it is not a proper phrase to be used here; it may be used outside, but certainly not here.  There are instances of men who were appointed to Civil Service posts out of the Army.  Take the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as one example.  Linesmen and maintenance men were frequently appointed.  There are many ex-soldiers serving in the maintenance section of the Department.</P>
      <P>As regards men who probably would not be qualified to sit for Civil Service examinations, I know in my own county where local authorities inserted advertisements indicating a definite preference for ex-Army men.  If the term humbug can be aptly used, it could be used in reference to people who make flagrant and unsubstantiated charges against the Fianna Fáil Administration because of disregard, as the Deputy described it, for ex-members of the Defence Forces.  What the Deputy suggested is a complete falsehood.  When he examined the situation he was putting the microscope, as it were, to the blind eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general principle of the section, there is a lot in what he said about men joining the Army probably in a rush or in a moment of indiscretion. <Col N="1568" /> Nevertheless, we must always look to the next emergency and if people get the impression that they can desert from an army and nobody will think the worse of them, then what kind of personnel can we expect for the composition of an army?  I suggest there is merit in Deputy Cowan's argument, but there is equal merit in the amendment that Deputy Traynor has tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that in my area a large number of volunteers answered the call on the outbreak of the emergency. It was an area in which the Volunteer force was fairly strong and I am glad to be able to say that they acquitted themselves well.  I think the number of desertions was very small indeed.  I have not heard much talk about desertions among those who were in the Regular Army or among the Volunteer force.  Any opinions I did hear expressed were all in favour of the disqualification that the Army authorities recommended to the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Cowan, but I think the other viewpoint must take precedence.  After all, the common good should be our principal concern and I think the period of seven years inserted in the previous Bill was not too harsh.  I think the Minister ought to consider the position well before he changes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other facets of our defence system that have not got so much attention as the soldier.  We had, for instance, the people who produced the bread and those who produced the fuel.  I am more concerned with those who produced the fuel.  They were practically conscripted.  They were not allowed to leave the country.  Many of them could have deserted.  Probably they had better opportunities of deserting than had the soldier.  My experience in my area was that they did not do so.  If we had a conscript Army here, possibly what the Minister is doing might have more merit in it, but seeing that our forces were voluntary I think those who remained <Col N="1569" /> loyal have a claim and, in any event, some recognisable distinction ought to be made between those who continued to serve to the end and those who deserted for the lure of high pay.  That lure, I know, was very strong.</P>
    <P>If another emergency occurs, although the last one is not yet over, my own personal view is that when we are building up an Army we ought to adopt some form of selective conscription. The reason I say that is that a great many men were called up who were members of the Volunteer force, and who had very useful work to perform for the nation at home.  There were others who had not similar duties to carry out as private citizens.  They confined themselves to joining the auxiliary force.  I think that was quite wrong, and the nation lost as a result. If you had some form of selective conscription that anomaly would not have arisen.  The Minister should consider that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Dáil that practically every aspect of this has been examined and re-examined. I think I have given every reasonable assurance asked for, and I have asked the Dáil not to continue these penalties.  As far as there was any immunity or encouragement given in the past, then I think Deputy Traynor and myself share the guilt; so far as deciding upon whom the greater guilt rests is concerned, he remedied the penalties of imprisonment and that kind of thing, and I am proposing to remit after three years the last four years of legal imprisonment.  Every Deputy has expressed his view, and I ask that this matter should not be put to a division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one simple assurance which the Minister can give us without giving us every assurance. That simple assurance is merely to delete this section which in my opinion should not have been inserted in the Bill.  So far as immunity is concerned, I suggested to the Minister that the action which he has taken in inserting this section in the Bill amounts to a grant of immunity to all future potential deserters.  The Minister <Col N="1570" /> seemed to take exception to that remark.  He seems to me to be rather sensitive about the suggestion that this section was so granting immunity. Then he went on to suggest that I had already granted immunity by reason of the fact that I brought in the measure which he is now repealing.  He suggested that the penalties which would accrue from a court-martial would have been very much more severe than the penalties incorporated in the Bill which he is repealing.  Then he went on further to suggest that the penalties which in fact existed in that legislation are very severe and he went on to describe some individual whom he interviewed and referred to the state of that individual.  The whole moral of the story appeared to be that this man was suffering as a result of that particular legislation.  I rather imagine that the Minister was arguing against himself in taking that line of argument. All I can say is that there is a principle involved in this section.</P>

      <P>Other Deputies have discussed the details of this measure, and I do not want to go over them again.  I have discussed them already, but I should like to say that Deputy Cowan, in discussing the matters which he did discuss, showed his abysmal ignorance when he asked the question: &ldquo;What did the former Government do for these men?&rdquo; If he had the interest <Col N="1571" /> which he suggests himself he has in these men, he would have had some knowledge of the fact that we produced a White Paper which gave all the necessary details of what would be done for these men.</P>

If the Deputy has any doubts about that he should consult the Ex-Service Men's Association, and I am sure that these men will be honest enough to give him information as to what was, in fact, secured as a result of Government co-operation with these organisations.</P>

He is showing his ignorance of the fact also that the former Government made provision whereby these men would secure allowances which would at least guarantee them frugal comfort and prevent them dying in institutions such as the Deputy has suggested.  The Deputy gave himself a very gracious recommendation&mdash;I have not heard anyone else giving him the same recommendation&mdash;in respect of his interest and his desire to help these men.</P>

      <P>During the time I have been a member of the House I have not taken much part in discussions concerning the Defence Forces but on this <Col N="1572" /> occasion I take the liberty of saying that I think on the whole, the Minister made a very strong case for the retention of this section in the Bill. I thought the reasons given would be sufficient to convince members on the opposite benches that there was no necessity for a division on this section. Deputy Traynor referred to the serious crime which desertion was.  I agree that desertion is a very serious crime and one that should be punished, especially when it occurs in a time of emergency.  I am, however, of the opinion that one must take into consideration the peculiar set of circumstances that existed at the time these young men deserted from the Army here.  It is because I have given a little attention to that aspect that I was so interested in the observations of Deputy Cowan.  Candidly I must say, as an Irishman, that I do not believe the term &ldquo;deserter&rdquo; should be applied in the case of many of the young men who left the Irish Army and went to fight in the British Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, and I say it without fear of contradiction or without any qualification, that during that war democracy was fighting for its life against the evil of Nazism and every other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; seeking to destroy the liberties of the people belonging to the democratic nations and those young men were fighting as much for Ireland as they were fighting for the countries whose armies they went to join.  I do not think it is right to say that they were deserters in the real sense of the word&mdash;taking all the conditions into consideration and the ease with which they could cross the Border, as I myself know well, and join the British Army. All the Minister is asking at the moment is that the seven years' disqualification be reduced by four.  That does not mean that the safeguard in relation to the giving of preference in employment to ex-members of the Defence Forces will not continue.  I think Deputy Major de Valera, to his credit, was prepared to accept the very clear reply which the Minister gave him, not once but on two occasions, in this connection.  Deputy Traynor, the ex-Minister for Defence, is not now accepting it.  As the Minister says, he <Col N="1573" /> must have his pound of flesh and put this section to a division.</P>
    <P>As one who is looked upon as an Imperialist, I have always maintained outside this House as well as inside it that it takes as good a man to live for his country as to die for it.  I have the greatest respect for the man who was a member of the Army, but, on the question of giving preference in employment to ex-members of the Defence Forces, it must be remembered, too, that the married man with five or six children is fighting the battle of life. He is doing so, not for a week or a month or a year, but every year.  I say that that man deserves equal consideration with the ex-member of the Defence Forces, and I would say that from any public platform in the country.  I would go as far to look for work for the ex-member of the Army as I would for any other man, but at the same time I honestly think that the agricultural labourer and the artisan who is rearing a family, is the backbone of the country.  They are fighting the real battle in so far as the <Col N="1574" /> preservation of this nation or of any other nation on the earth is concerned. I say to the Deputies opposite, in all sincerity, to forget politics for once in a while, and to look at this question from the Minister's point of view.  I would ask them not to be too anxious to penalise those men who, they say, deserted&mdash;but who I say could not, in many cases, be described as deserters&mdash; and give them the right to live in their own country.  God knows it is questionable whether it is worth while talking about the few vacancies that occur. I really am amused when I hear all this talk about preference&mdash;preference for the work that does not exist.  Is it worth while having this long discussion as to whether you will penalise these men?  Surely the ex-Army man would be the last in the world to say to his comrade standing beside him at the Labour Exchange: &ldquo;You will not get work because you deserted the Army.&rdquo;  No, he would die before he would say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Sundry Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, including Grants.</P>
      <P>This is merely a token Vote, and the purpose of the Vote is to provide for the recoupment of 50 per cent. of the supplementary expenditure in cash made by local authorities in substitution for the previous schemes of supplementary assistance in kind.  The matter has already been discussed in the House&mdash;firstly, by being raised on the adjournment; and, secondly, during the Estimate.  This Estimate, in effect, involves merely the switching of expenditure incurred in the rendering of assistance by local authorities in kind for assistance in cash on the basis of recouping the local authority for 50 per cent. of their expenditure in that supplementary assistance in the form of cash supplements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can pass this without protesting at the grant not being higher than it is.  We cannot move an amendment to increase it. The Minister will recollect that the Minister for Finance, together with other Ministers of the Government, complained daily and hourly of the size of the Budget prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government.  That Budget was £70,000,000 odd.  The inter-Party Government set out to reduce the Estimates.  One way in which the <Col N="1577" /> Minister for Social Welfare has lent his hand to reducing the Estimates is by cutting the grant formerly made by the State to the recipients of home assistance by 50 per cent., and by notifying local authorities that in the coming year it will be cut by the whole 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>You were not three weeks in office when you cut that grant which was provided for in the Book of Estimates. The Minister for Social Welfare told us on very many occasions that something must be done to stop the squandermania of Fianna Fáil.  The Minister's contribution to the stopping of that squandermania was to cut the grant given by the previous Government over a number of years for the purpose of giving increased assistance to the persons in receipt of home assistance.  I want to protest that the Minister gave no reason whatever for the cutting of that grant when he moved this Estimate.  He said we would discuss it on the motion for the adjournment.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned in the Estimate.  It is open for full discussion now on this Vote.  He gave no reason whatever except the one that it is the policy of the Government that he sits in as Minister for Social Welfare.  We had indications from him before, on the Bill he introduced some time ago in the Dáil, where he increased insurance contributions, that he is lending himself towards every effort to unload the burden on to the backs of the workers and the backs of the employers and the small farmers and everybody else throughout the country.  Every possible device has been resorted to by this Government in order to justify themselves to the people outside that they are the people who will reduce taxation. It is quite easy to reduce taxation if you unload it on to somebody else.  They cried and wept so much about the agricultural workers about whom we heard so much from the Minister and they now load their backs with increased contributions.</P>

      <P>Yes, a Supplementary Estimate that provides for 50 per cent. of last year's contribution, or 50 per cent. of the extra that the local authorities pay to home assistance recipients this year.  In the coming year the Minister has already notified the local authorities that he is going to give none whatever and that the local authorities may, if they wish and if they consider it right, give the extra amount at the expense of the rate-payers or they need not give it as far as the Minister is concerned, so long as he can get rid of it and can help the Minister for Finance to do away with, as he said, the squandermania of the Fianna Fáil.  Coming from a Labour Minister of a Government, that was a most extraordinary statement to make.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that at a festive season like this Deputy Allen is so grim and sombre as he appears to be this evening.  He has been engaging in a lot of shadow boxing with all kinds of spectres, which in fact do not exist at all except in Deputy Allen's imagination. Deputy Allen owes a big debt of gratitude to his imagination for the facts are the converse of what he has produced this evening.  All that Deputy Allen said on this Estimate is complete and unadulterated nonsense so far as the local authorities are concerned, and so far as the applicants for home assistance are concerned.  Let us look at the facts.  During the emergency, it was decided that unusual emergency measures would have to be taken to deal with certain problems.  One of the devices resorted to in order to try and keep people above poverty and destitution standards of living was to give them assistance at the expense of the State in the form of food vouchers. But have we now, after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government, reached a condition of affairs in which the maintenance of the food vouchers, with all <Col N="1580" /> the odium and all the taint of the poor law system that goes hand in hand with that odious system, represents the objective of Fianna Fáil as an explanation of Deputy Allen's speech and Deputy Little's fears expressed in a few short sentences?</P>
      <P>Everybody with any conception of a decent outlook on life knows that the food voucher is the equivalent of the soup kitchen.  Do we not know well that it is a degrading practice?  Do we not know well that only the poor, the lonely, and the destitute are compelled to look for food vouchers?  What is Deputy Allen's concept of his sense of independence, honour and pride, and what is Deputy Little's concept of his independence and pride that they now weep over the departure of the food voucher?  Does any Deputy think it is a right and proper method of satisfying the human demands of people for decent standards of living to offer them paltry food vouchers which they could change in shops, labelled that they are people with food vouchers, that they are getting free food vouchers?  I should have thought that a person like Deputy Little, especially, would be standing beside me, that he would think this food voucher scheme is a detestable scheme only justified in the direst emergency, that it is not a scheme that ought to be a permanent feature either of social services or welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal which we introduced early in the year was to get rid of the detestable food vouchers so as to make sure that people were not going into grocery shops with food vouchers pasted over them, so that the rest of the community, the wealthy section of the community or those who are able to earn a modest competence, will be able to gaze at those recipients of food vouchers and extend to them the sympathy which ought rightfully to go to people placed in such a degrading and humilating position.  The food voucher is gone, and I do not know any decent man or woman in this House or in the country who wants to recall that odious, detestable method of pasting on the poor people of this country labels which indicate that they <Col N="1581" /> are in impecunious circumstances.  If Deputy Little wants to shed tears over the departure of the food voucher, let him do it, but he will have very little sympathy from decent-minded men and women at the departure of that contemptible device, justified only in the direst emergency, but certainly no longer justifiable in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let me recall for Deputy Little's edification, because he seems to have a mental black-out on this business, that even his own Government in 1947 abolished some of the food vouchers and substituted for them cash payments. I did the very same thing in respect of home assistance recipients, because I thought that the maintenance of that scheme had nothing whatever to commend it to the House or to the country and was completely unjustified in present circumstances.  Under the 1939 Public Assistance Act the responsibility is put on local authorities for the relief of destitution.  That Act was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government and definitely put on the local authorities the responsibility of relieving destitution and acute need so far as applicants for home assistance are concerned.  We said to the local authorities: In future, therefore, you have got to bear the responsibility which is properly and lawfully yours under the 1939 Public Assistance Act. This year, however, we will pay half the cost of the food vouchers, but next year you will take the responsibility which properly has been put on you under the 1939 Act, and you will relieve, as you are statutorily obliged to do, those who are compelled through economic necessity to seek the assistance of the local authorities to the extent that the local authorities have power under this Act to provide the necessary relief.  That is all that is being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen says we are taking these food vouchers away from the recipients of home assistance.  We told the local authorities that, with the abolition of the detestable food voucher and the badge of the poor law with which it was extensively impregnated, they should give to applicants for home assistance and outdoor relief at least a cash equivalent of the food <Col N="1582" /> voucher.  Therefore, so far as the local applicant for relief is concerned, he was told, through the mouthpiece of this Government and from the platform of this Dáil, that the food voucher will go and all the odium with it, but that instead the local authority will be required, by a direction from the Government, to give to applicants for outdoor relief or home assistance at least the cash equivalent of the food vouchers.  Therefore, the applicant in future could buy with cash out of his own pocket whatever commodities he liked and when he went to a shop to buy these commodities he would not be festooned with food vouchers, as he was up to the abolition of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Does not everybody realise that it is very much better to give a man or woman cash so that when they go to a grocery shop they can buy in the way Deputy Little or Deputy Allen buys? Is there any special reason why people should be put in a special, untouchable category and say:&mdash;&ldquo;These are folk who cannot buy as the rest of the citizens buy; they have to buy through the medium of the food voucher and all that that implies&rdquo;?  I will debate this with Deputy Little in Waterford or Deputy Allen in Wexford.  I think that everybody that wants to preserve the independence of our people and to give them a pride in their right to be independent will express nothing but gratification at the passing of the food voucher, because we have substituted cash for the food voucher which is now gone.</P>
    <P>Now look at it from another point of view.  Deputy Allen wailed about the effect of this on local authorities. So far as local authorities are concerned, it means about 1¼d. in the rates, on an average.  That is what they have to face up to, but not this year, because they have only to face up to half that this year.  What are we doing for the local authorities instead of that?  The last Government would not raise old age pensions except by a miserable 2/6, and they said to the local authorities: &ldquo;But you can give them something more, if you are satisfied that they are absolutely destitute.&rdquo; Some of the responsibility for giving that something more fell on the local <Col N="1583" /> authorities.  That is now coming off the local authorities, because, as from 7th January next, the old age pensioner will not have his old age pension made up of two components, (1) the State's ald-age pension; (2) the trifle which the old-age pensioner receives from the local authority through the medium of the home assistance officer.  In future the State will accept full responsibility for the old-age pension, and not full responsibility for an old-age pension at the rate payable in the past, but full responsibility for an old-age pension which is higher now than it ever was since the old-age pension was introduced in 1908.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen, in his sombre-like speech, wanted to generate a cold war on the local authorities and to work them into a state of nerves by saying that this was going to mean financial disaster for them.  It is a trifle so far as the local authorities are concerned and, for the trifle which they are now going to bear as a result of what we have done, they will get back very substantial remissions of expenditure which they were formerly required to bear.  For instance, local authorities in the past had to give those in receipt of widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, supplementary benefits; they had to give the same to blind persons and also to old age pensioners. The fact that these people will get much more money now will relieve the local authority of the responsibility in a great many cases of having to expend money trying to make up for the inadequate rates of benefit paid under these three schemes&mdash;old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and blind pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the local authorities are concerned this, taken in conjunction with what is being done under other aspects of social welfare, makes the whole thing a good bargain, a good thing for the local authorities. Deputy Little can cheer up, because the future is bright for the local authorities, and the forebodings of Deputy Allen will not be realised.  A brighter and more cheerful future is being opened up for the local authorities by what is being done here, and more will be done in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a wonderful capacity for drawing red herrings across the trail.  I never mentioned food vouchers, and I did not mention pensions.  I did mention that the Government are merely handing on the baby to another authority which will pay the bill.  There was a great deal to be said for the food vouchers.  I do not take up a brass-hat, bourgeoisie, labour point of view in regard to food vouchers at all.  They were a magnificent arrangement.  With the fluctuating prices at the time, you were giving more realistic and better value than if you were giving them cash.  The prices of things were fluctuating to such an extent that you never knew where you were, and it was considered very desirable to give food vouchers.</P>
      <P>As between the vouchers and the money I cannot see that there was any great difference.  You were giving them the vouchers because these people happened to be the more unfortunate in the community.  But there is no disgrace about being poor, and it is a great honour to be able to help them.  I have to admire the Minister for the manner in which he dragged in other things besides the point at issue.  He is merely handing on the baby to the local authority where our Government paid the money before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the previous Government changed the food voucher system into one of cash, and his remarks seemed to indicate that he is now changing the food <Col N="1585" /> voucher system for the first time.  I would like to point out to the Minister that the food vouchers that were issued during the war were mainly for unrationed goods and gave the recipients a first claim on a share of those unrationed food items, such as bread, milk and butter&mdash;I think butter for a good part of the time was unrationed.  If you had a cash system of assistance those people would have been unable to get these foods, because they would be in competition with people far better off.  The system was changed by the last Government when it was deemed that it could be safely changed without any great hardship on the recipients.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees with the Minister that it is better to give people money, but in the special circumstances of the time far better service was rendered to these people for the reason I have stated.  I think the cash equivalent in those circumstances would not have got them any appreciable quantity of those commodities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the changing of the emergency cash supplements given to various types of people that the Minister mentioned and that I understand a reference to whom is not quite in order, would the Minister say whether this addition in the amount now given will be counted as means in certain circumstances? For instance, take the case of a husband and wife, one of whom is a recipient of benefit under the national health insurance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that we agree with the Minister that it is better to give cash than to give any system of food vouchers, but I repeat that in the circumstances in which the vouchers were given the Minister himself&mdash;and he has used a <Col N="1586" /> great many adjectives in his remarks against the voucher system&mdash;would, if he were the Minister in charge of that service during the war, when there was a scarcity of the foods covered by the food vouchers, have felt constrained to issue vouchers if he were to give the benefits that were intended for those people.  He would have had no other alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is the vicious practice of piling on to local authorities financial burdens that should be borne by the Exchequer.  The Minister has admitted that half the cost of this is to be borne by the local authorities this year and the entire cost next year.  The Minister referred to food vouchers and one would imagine by the way he spoke that there was a stigma attaching to them.  Everybody knows that they were as useful to the recipients in their time as cash.  As Deputy Bartley pointed out, these food vouchers gave the recipients a first claim on rationed goods and rationed fuel.  What I have to cavil at is the principle involved in this, asking the local authorities to bear what should be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is a grand thing, of course, to be generous with other people's money. That is exactly what the Minister for Social Welfare is doing.  He is making a grand display here of his alleged generosity, when we all know that that generosity will come out of the pockets of the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Central Fund, from the Exchequer.  That half-crown was recouped to the local authorities by the Exchequer.  If the Deputy will look it up he will find that I am right. There is one thing to be said about the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; any schemes they initiated were carried out. They financed them themselves without any show of pretence whatsoever, and <Col N="1587" /> without passing on the burden to the local authorities.  As I have said it is a fine thing to be generous with other people's money.  The Minister has mentioned that this will not cost any more than a 1¼d. in the £, but let it be no more than 1¼d. in the £ for local authorities, if this system is once adopted, where will it end?  It will be a 1¼d. for this to-day and 2d. for something else to-morrow, for another scheme initiated and carried out by the Government. In my opinion, the local authorities are already overburdened in places such as Kerry, where the rates are nearly 40/- in the £.  I think we should hesitate before piling further burdens on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £500,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for increases in remuneration of civil servants.</P>
      <P>The increase in Civil Service pay for which provision in regard to the financial year is being made in this Estimate, resulted in the first place from the increase of 11/- a week for men and a <i>pro rata</i> increase for women awarded by the Labour Court in respect of employees in various undertakings early this year.  The Labour Court award was based on an agreement which was previously negotiated between employers and workers.  The Government's first approach to the problem of applying the Labour Court's award to the Civil Service was to limit the concession to civil servants whose pay amounted to £350 or less.  When that decision was taken, I entered into negotiations with the Civil Service Association.  We found considerable difficulty in reaching an agreement that was acceptable to all parties concerned and the negotiations became very prolonged indeed.  The result was that I found myself coming nearer to the pivotal date, namely the 1st November.  That date had been fixed by my predecessor as being the date upon which a general revision of Civil Service salaries would be entered upon.  That arrangement had been made when the pay consolidation agreement was concluded in 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the conditions laid down in that agreement for an upward revision showed every likelihood of being fulfilled, I decided that the wisest course was to try to merge in any settlement which could be arrived at under that head, the weekly increases that had already been accorded on the Labour Court pattern.  The settlement ultimately made effected this merger. I think some publicity has been given to it.  Under its terms, whole time civil servants whose pay does not exceed £350 a year&mdash;subject to certain <Col N="1590" /> adjustments at marginal points&mdash; receive as from the 29th May, 1948, increases at the rate of 11/- per week for married men and single men on rates of pay not differentiated on the basis of marriage and 5/6d. a week for other single men, women and juveniles.  Part-time civil servants receive <i>pro rata</i> increases.</P>
    <P>As from 1st November these increases will operate as minima for the Civil Service as a whole, the £350 ceiling disappearing, but every civil servant to whom it is more favourable will receive instead an increase calculated on a 20 points increase on the cost-of-living figure on which the consolidation agreement was based.  In addition, I have decided to reduce by one third the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo;, which under the bonus system, and with slight modification under the consolidation agreement, has hitherto applied to remuneration related to a basic of £500 a year.  As the Estimate shows the cost of these concessions in the present financial year is expected to be £500,000.  In a full year it will be in the neighbourhood of £700,000.</P>
    <P>The new agreement will run for two years from the 1st November and will be subject to re-examination at the end of that time or at any time during the two-year period if the cost of living rises to or above 330 or falls to or below 250.  I have, however, made it clear to the staff that any re-examination must be governed by these overriding considerations, viz., the economic conditions existing at the time of the re-examination, the then Exchequer position and the trend of remuneration outside the Civil Service in so far as that trend is affected by the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I am acutely conscious that this heavy addition to the cost of the Civil Service requires strong justification.  In the main, that justification is to be found in the undertaking given in the consolidation agreement that the terms of that agreement would be revised if at the end of two years the cost-of-living index number&mdash;the old series number&mdash;was as high as 300.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court award was another important factor.  The additions granted on these grounds, but <Col N="1591" /> especially the consideration of the cost-of-living index number, led to the decision to reduce the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo;, because under the consolidation agreement, under the bonus system, an increase in the cost-of-living number to which salaries are related worsens the relative position of the grades to which the super cut applies and the grant of minimum increases has the same effect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I should give some explanation of the effects of the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo;.  Under the bonus system there was a gradual scaling down of the percentage of compensation given for increases in the cost of living.  On these reductions there was superimposed on salaries above £500 a year this &ldquo;cut&rdquo; rising from 10 per cent. between £500 and £700 basic to 55 per cent. at £1,500 basic.</P>
    <P>As a result of these drastic operations the percentage of bonus to basic pay immediately before the consolidation agreement ranged from 110 per cent. on the lowest salaries to 19 per cent. on the highest, thus causing a degree of &ldquo;compression&rdquo; of rates of pay which seriously reduced the incentives to ambition and effort in the Civil Service.  My predecessor, recognising this ill-effect, made provision in the consolidation agreement for a minimum increase of 25 per cent. on total remuneration as obtaining in 1939, and indicated in doing so, that he was giving an earnest of his view that it would not be in the public interest to allow the salary compression to proceed further.  The reduction in the &ldquo;super-cut&rdquo; now introduced will, in my opinion, remove any remaining reasonable ground for dissatisfaction on the part of the higher officers and provide the stimulus to zeal and energy which is so necessary in a large organisation like the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Although I have been compelled by circumstances and especially by the commitments accepted at the time of the consolidation agreement and the rise in the cost of living since 1946, to grant these big increases in Civil Service pay, I cannot profess to feel at all happy about the effects that they and the increases given in private employment <Col N="1592" /> and in the public utility services must have on the national economy. There is a certain element of danger in them.  It is quite certain that, unless they are followed by corresponding increases in output&mdash;and I am afraid there is so far no indication of this&mdash;they will be a serious reinforcement of the inflationary agencies which are at work and that by raising costs of production they will lessen our already very limited ability to meet competition in the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>These things have been said over and over again, and they have been confirmed by experience, but unfortunately they do not seem to be grasped by various sections of the public.  Yet it is an elementary truth that increases in money income without corresponding increases in output can in the long run bring no advantage to anybody and must on the contrary, if not checked in time, bring disaster to the entire community. We are taking a risk but in doing so we believe that the incentives that would be provided in the way of increased pay ought to lead to increased production.  I am able to say, however, that the present Estimate will not necessitate any increase in taxation in the current year.  We have already raised a series of Post Office charges which will give us an additional £200,000 and the release of sugar for jam making should provide a sum of £150,000.  In addition, we may rely on savings being effected in various Departments sufficient to bring the total up to the £500,000 required.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in the Estimate raise Civil Service pay generally to levels which, in my view, can be fairly described as very generous having regard to the general economic position of the country.  In many grades they are substantially higher than the pay of corresponding grades in Northern Ireland and even higher than that of similar grades in the British Civil Service.  In fairness to our people, we must now call a halt to the upward movement.  For my part, I trust that this will be the last occasion on which I shall have to present a Bill of this kind to Dáil Eireann or to agree to any general increases in Civil Service <Col N="1593" /> pay which are not fully compensated by a reduction otherwise in the cost of administering the public services.</P>
    <P>I have thought it desirable to make provision for the increases in this single Estimate, but each Department will be responsible for the detailed accounting for whatever money it gets out of the Vote in the same manner as if it were money from its own Vote or Votes.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of questions to ask and perhaps the Minister would reply to them and make the matter clear.  It is the first time that we have heard of any reduction in the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo; and I would like if the Minister could give a few samples of how this is going to operate.  Could he give the House any idea as to what increases on the present salary it means in the case of a Civil Servant with a basic of £1,000.  What immediate increase does it mean and also what increase will it mean for the civil servant with a basic of £1,500?</P>

      <P>The super cut on a salary of not less than £1,000 but less than £1,100 was 30 per cent.  I am reducing that by one-third.  Therefore, it will hereafter be a cut of 20 per cent. On the £1,500 the super cut, that is the bonus, was reduced by 55 per cent.  I am taking off one-third of that.  The bonus on the £1,500 salary will be reduced by 36? per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to discover the motives underlying the introduction of this particular Supplementary Estimate from the public announcements of the negotiations between the Minister for Finance and the civil servants.  As the Minister pointed out, around November, 1946, an agreement was entered into with the civil servants which consolidated their salaries on the basis of 270, which called for a revision in November, 1948 if, at that time, the figure stood at 300, and which called for a revision before November, 1948, if the cost of living rose to 310.  From the various Government statements made, as far as I can make out, the Government claims that the cost of living has fallen since they took office.  When the cost of living tended to rise above the revision point in November, 1947, the then Government introduced a Supplementary Budget for the purpose of subsidising various items in the cost of living in order to bring the figure down below the revision point.  When we left office in February the cost of living then stood below the revision point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Upon my soul, that is very remarkable in view of the answer the Minister gave to a question put by Deputy McGrath the other day. Deputy McGrath asked about the reduction made in the pension of an ex-postman and called the attention of the Minister to a circular that was sent out which informed the ex-postman that his pension was being cut because the cost of living was down to 205 on the 1st July.  That question is at <Col N="1595" /> column 1161, volume 113, of the 9th December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to the 1st July. I saw the circular myself.  Deputy McGrath showed it to me.  The circular stated that the pension was being reduced because the cost of living had fallen and was stated to be 210 up to the 1st July, and 205 thereafter.  The pension was cut by 23/- because the postman had been overpayed and that overpayment was being taken off him at the rate of 11/8d. per month.  What leg is the Government standing on in regard to this?  The circular shows that the cost of living fell below the revision point and was not up to the revision point prior to the 1st November.  What it is at this date is a mystery to me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the 311 figure I want. That does not tally with this circular which states that the cost of living was 205.  Neither does it tally with what the Minister for External Affairs said on the 27th November&mdash;that the Coalition Government had held down the cost of living.  Nor does it tally with what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said at Creeslough as reported in the Press on the 29th November last.  He spoke about the difficulties the Government had in wrestling with the cost of living and claimed that they had been successful. He said, despite all the difficulties they had, &ldquo;the reduction in the cost of living was an achievement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living has either gone up or it has gone down since the Coalition Government took office.  If it did not go above the figure at which it then stood no commitment rested upon <Col N="1596" /> the Government to revise upwards Civil Service salaries or to review them before the 1st November of this year. If the cost of living was 311 on the 1st November, in the agreement of 1946 there was a clause which stipulated that the cost of living should then be reviewed.  If the cost of living was not up to the revision point indicated in November, 1946, I would like to know from the Minister why it was that in September, 1948, he took steps to revise it upwards retrospectively to the 28th May.  On the 28th May, according to a communication which the Secretary of Finance issued to the Civil Service Alliance and published in the June number of the &ldquo;Civil Servant&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Government authorised the grant to whole-time members of departmental grades in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, whose total remuneration does not exceed £350 a year, of increases in pay amounting to 11/- per week for men and 5/6d. for women and juveniles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increases are temporary and non-pensionable and were granted in anticipation of the review of remuneration which, under the consolidation agreement, was due to take place two years after 1st November, 1946.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from that that this decision was taken in anticipation of the cost of living reaching the review point. This decision was taken on Friday, 28th May, 1948, after the Minister had solemnly declared here in the Dáil in his Budget statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services have gone as far as is possible in present circumstances to meet the claims of social justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What were the exceptional circumstances which, within a week or two of that pronouncement by the Minister, first of all led the Government to give an increase to the departmental grades of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs? What were the considerations that led them some weeks later to <Col N="1597" /> apply the increases given to the departmental grades in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to other grades in the Civil Service?  There is some light thrown on the workings behind the scenes by a statement which was issued by the Civil Service Alliance and published in the papers of the 1st June.  That statement says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Eighteen months ago the Civil Service voted on a scheme of consolidation which was negotiated between Mr. F. Aiken, Minister for Finance, and representatives of the C. S. Alliance, the P. O. Workers' Union and the higher civil servants. Of these three bodies the Alliance is the largest and most representative, and was partly, if not mainly, instrumental in having the General Secretary of the P.O. Workers' union, Mr. Norton, received in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>For many years previously, Mr. Norton had tried vainly to gain access, but had been refused, as he was not a serving civil servant.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government was formed each of the above C.S. groups applied to have the 1946 scale ratified, as provided in the agreement. The representatives of the P.O. Workers' Union were received by the present Minister for Finance separately, although the Alliance protested against this on the grounds that it invalidated the 1946 joint agreement, and also because it lent itself to the interpretation that the Minister for Finance was being unduly influenced by the political pressure which the P.O.  Workers' Union was able to exert.</P>
    <P>When the Alliance was subsequently received, the Minister for Finance stated that it was &lsquo;through inadvertence&rsquo; he had met the P.O. Workers' Union representatives separately, and despite this the C.S. claim would be considered as a whole.  He also stated that he would endeavour to remedy the unfortunate position which had been brought about by his action in receiving the union separately.</P>
    <P>Despite these facts, a Cabinet decision <Col N="1598" /> was conveyed on Saturday through the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the P.O.  Workers' Union notifying them of the grant of 11/- per week to male workers (5/6d. to women and juveniles) as from May 29th, subject to a maximum of £350 per annum.  No official intimation has yet been received by the alliance.</P>
    <P>At the annual council meeting of the alliance last night, when these facts were made known to the members, great indignation was expressed, firstly, with the highly improper fashion in which the negotiations were conducted; secondly, at the notification of a decision to the P.O.  Workers' Union, while leaving the alliance to hear it from the evening papers, and finally, at the setting up of a dangerous precedent by which, apparently, civil servants can expect to have their claims determined by relation to the amount of political pressure which each group can exert.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the council recorded its dismay at the utter inadequacy of the reported award, and in particular at the vicious principle of a salary ceiling which has no outside counterpart.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i>, the most reliable newspaper of them all.  There was no denial, as far as I could see, that political pressure was responsible for the award to the Post Office Workers' Union on the 28th May. Seeing that political pressure, as was alleged, worked in regard to the Post Office Workers' Union it looks as if the civil servants resident in the Minister's constituency thought they would put a little bit of political pressure on, too.  The result is this bill <Col N="1599" /> for £500,000 this year and for £750,000 next year.  The bill for the Civil Service, as the Minister shows in his Supplementary Estimate, stands under the existing provisions at £9,754,000.  The revised Estimate for this year is over £10¼ million&mdash; £10,254,000.</P>
      <P>Next year there will be, according to the Minister, an additional £250,000 on to that because he estimates that the implementation of this award in a full year will cost £750,000.  It is necessary, for many reasons, that a Government dealing with the various State employees should act, as far as it is humanly possible, for motives other than surrender to political pressure. We have had the various Ministers during the year claiming that they cannot go on with this, that and the other scheme because of a shortage of money.  The fact is that for some time before the coalition came together to form a Government its many components had been slinging promises like snow flakes over every class and section of the community.  They promised the ex-teachers an increase in their pensions.  They complained very bitterly against the increased award to the teachers and by implication&mdash; indeed if I go to the trouble I can get the actual words&mdash;they advocated very strongly that the teachers' salaries should be very much increased.  They made similar criticism of the awards to Army officers.  The Minister for Finance himself thought that when we gave £350,000 additional pay to the Civic Guard it should be three or four times the amount.  However, all these sections of the community, not to speak of the farmers and others, were made specific and pretty definite promises of increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can judge the matter the group which had not been promised, as far as we know, and which had no legal entitlement to an increase were the only people who got the increase. Certainly, if the plea is right that the cost of living had fallen or had been even held, as the Minister for External Affairs says, under the agreement of 1946 the review point had not been reached prior to 1st November.  On <Col N="1600" /> the figures given by the Minister, on 1st November the review point had been reached.  It was clearly indicated and set out in the agreement of 1946 that if the cost-of-living figure stood at 300 points or above, a review was called for.  The Minister says that on that date it stood at 311.  A review, therefore, was called for.</P>
    <P>Taking the minimum figures here which the Minister has indicated, ignoring the effect of the 11/- increase for the lower grades, and taking the middle ranges, it appears to me that the figure has been about 7 or 8 per cent. on the bonus.  In other words, it can be put in this way.  With the increase in the bonus figure, the figure was raised from 270 to 290, or 20 points and the cost-of-living figure on 1st November stood at 11 points above the review point.  Therefore, the civil servants in these grades got an upward swing of twice the figure by which the cost of living exceeded 300.  It was, as I said, 7 or 8 per cent. on the cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>The other section of civil servants, those who regard themselves as having been subject to a super-cut, seem to have got a very much greater increase than the others.  A civil servant with a salary of say £2,250 or thereabouts at present has got, according to the Minister's calculations, about £100 a year or £2 a week increase.  There may be something in the case of the higher-grade civil servants that, owing to the operation of the cost-of-living bonus over a number of years and, particularly, of the emergency bonus system, their salaries had been unduly compressed in relation to the lower salaried grades.</P>
    <P>I discussed the matter at great length with a number of those civil servants and the Government, in a review of their case agreed that, although in the first proposition it was agreed between myself and the civil servants that the higher people would get 19 per cent. increase above 1939, that they would get 25 per cent. as a minimum.  This proposal gives a still further exceptional increase to civil servants with a basic of £500 and over, and that basic salary of £500 and over would, of course mean, on present salary scale, I suppose somewhere <Col N="1601" /> about £900 and over.  Certainly, the £2 a week on these salaries has to be explained in a little bit more detail and justified by the Minister a little bit more extensively than he has done.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there is an element of danger in this increase and that he hopes it will be the last.  We all hope the cost of living will fall.  If we have no great hope that it will fall by the 30 per cent. which certain sections of the Coalition promised they would make it fall, we hope it will fall at least substantially during the next two years, during the currency of this agreement.  Certainly, the figure of £10½ million which this will mean for civil servants' salaries next year is a pretty staggering figure.  If there is anything in the suggestion that it was not done on a pure judgment of the merits of the case and, if it was not done by the Civil Service holding the Minister to the letter of the agreement, it is going to be very damaging for this country. The Coalition, one can understand, is subject to great political pressure from the various sections that comprise it. It is rather like a three-legged horse on stilts who gets a push one way and a pull the other and cannot resist any of them.  If this increase of £500,000 is the result, not of some straightforward calculation, but of the political pull of the Minister for Social Welfare and his union and the push of the constituents of the Minister for Finance, then we are in for a lot more pushing and pulling in the same direction.</P>

      <P>I would have held this. If the cost of living had not exceeded the review point before 1st November, I would have given nothing in present circumstances before that date.  That is clear, because that was the commitment. As I have indicated, if the cost of living on 1st November was 11 points, as the Minister says, above the review point, then we would have had to meet and deal with the civil servants.  I do not think, however, that they could have claimed, in equity, in view of the general circumstances of the community, and in view of the fact that <Col N="1602" /> the Government are cutting down all round, a £2 increase per week, or £100 a year on £2,250.  I should like to see civil servants paid as well as the country can afford.  I hope the Minister will be able to make a case on the basis of justice for this, because I think it is disastrous if he leaves himself open to the allegation that it is a result of a bit of push and pull.</P>
      <P>The Minister pushed aside one aspect of this question rather lightly, and that is how he is going to meet the bill this year.  I would like to hear from him what are the Estimates he has that would enable him to say that this can be met without borrowing.</P>
      <P>We heard the other day, in relation to one class of people to whom great promises were made, that their case would have to wait a review of the budgetary situation.  I refer to the pensioned teachers.  Does the Minister calculate that, with the various savings he has made and with the various increases in concealed taxation that he has made, he can bridge this £500,000 gap?  He claims that he will get out of the additional price of sugar something like £150,000 and out of stamps, £200,000.  Has he taken any other calculations into account?  Can he assure us that he will not spend some of this borrowed money in paying this particular bill, or that he is not paying it unnecessarily in view of the agreement entered into with the Civil Service?</P>
      <P>There are a lot of people in this country who could do with £500,000 at the present time.  I do not want to deal with that aspect, but I will say that the Minister for Agriculture postponed one of the best schemes there was in this country; he put it on the long finger in order to save very much less than £350,000.</P>

I hope the Minister, for the sake of good government, will be able to prove that the terms of this fresh agreement were necessitated by the agreement made in 1946 and that it was not simply because of pressure from the Minister for Social Welfare's union and from certain constituents of the Minister for Finance in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also deal with the super cut in some more detail.  It is the first we have heard of this and it would take a long time to look up all the papers affecting it.  No one could have any opportunity of doing it now, having heard of it for the first time in the House to-day.

      <P>Deputy Aiken skirted carefully around the whole question and I was not clear whether he was opposed to or in favour of the adjustment of Civil Service salaries&mdash;but that is by the way.  One point that Deputy Aiken seems to overlook when he speaks of the reasons inspiring this adjustment is that whatever aloofness the Government may have about Civil Service salaries&mdash;and we know they generally have got that peculiar attitude&mdash;they cannot disregard wage and salary movements in the country. Deputy Aiken will recall that as far back as October, 1947, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, initiated a series of discussions with the unions and these ultimately resolved themselves into direct discussions between employers and the trade union organisations.  Out of all this came certain recommendations under the auspices of the Labour Court.  Right through until July, when the first adjustment in Civil Service salaries was made, that agreement was put into effect in respect of wide sections of workers engaged in trade <Col N="1604" /> and industry.  It was inevitable that a discussion of that kind between most representative bodies on behalf of the employers and the workers would have to be given certain attention, and regard would have to be paid to it by the Government as well as by private employers.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, the initial push in bringing about this adjustment is to be found in a statement that was issued in March of this year.  That statement was not directly related to the rise in the cost of living as between October and March.  It was based on the change in the cost of living which took place between 1939 and 1947, and more particularly the rise in the cost of living between September, 1946, and October, 1947.  That type of situation is still not completely resolved&mdash;with all due respect to the Minister for Finance. I suggest that we have to look at more than figures when we are dealing with this problem.  I was interested to hear the Minister mention the figure of 311 in relation to the cost of living in November.  So far as the trade unions are concerned, we are confused as to the official cost-of-living figure to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Mid-August of this year? My point is still the same.  I do not blame the present Minister for that situation, because it was something inherited, but the continuance of our present interim figure and the basis on which that figure is arrived at is giving rise to complete confusion as to where exactly we stand in relation to the cost of living.  The official index figure does apparently indicate a drop, but if you speak to the people outside they express a certain amount of dubiety.  I think it is correct to say that along certain lines there has been a drop in prices, but it is opposite to nature when we face great masses of people who, since 1939, have gone through, in many ways, a purgatory because of the cost of living, and when they still find the pressure of living is exceptionally heavy, to satisfy them merely with figures, and what I am satisfied was a juggling of figures, with reference to the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> When I use the word &ldquo;juggling&rdquo; I do not suggest there was any dishonesty on the part of those who calculated the figure.  What I have in mind is the changing of the basis, the fact that we changed from 319 at one period and that only certain of the previous items were brought into the new figure.  All that may be quite understandable to persons acquainted with the process of arriving at an index figure, but to the ordinary worker, the average person outside this House, it gives very little comfort or satisfaction. Meeting ordinary people outside, and mentioning to them the figure of 290 as against 100 in August, 1914, conveys nothing of real material value.</P>
    <P>I feel that probably one of the biggest steps that could be taken in trying to get a somewhat better understanding and stability in relation to wages and prices would be to get back to the old figure and let us have a correct basis of comparison and relationship with pre-war wages.  So long as we have what I can only regard as this completely artificial figure, it is all the time open to criticism and misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>There is only one comment I should like to make on the Estimate and the explanatory statement which the Minister gave.  That is, that while undoubtedly there was need to make this adjustment and while I would be the last to suggest that civil servants have not got equal rights to any other section of workers, I do feel it necessary to express the point of view that so far as certain sections of the lower-paid employees of the Government are concerned, we have got to go a great deal further along the road in order to give these men and women even their most elementary rights.  It is an outrageous thing that the Government of this country should in certain instances be the payers of the lowest rates of wages.  That is indefensible.  I do not want to go into any particular case but everyone is aware that we have got groups of employees in the State service, even under the authority of this House, who are trying to eke out an existence on wages of £4 a week and live under conditions of city life.  That in my opinion is indefensible.  There <Col N="1606" /> have been some attempts to bring about some adjustment but I do not think they have been sufficient.</P>
    <P>Another factor which requires attention is that the machinery under which we try to deal with these particular claims is far too cumbersome and too slow.  I have no objection to higher paid civil servants receiving adjustments in their salaries but I do suggest in all earnestness that when we provide for men already in receipt of anything from £1,500 to £2,000 a year, an increase amounting to £200 a year, we have got to be particularly careful not to reject the very limited claim of the ordinary worker in Government employment who is trying to exist on that same figure of £200 a year.  I feel that this Estimate would commend itself much more to the House if we could feel that in regard to the lower-paid ranks, we had discharged our liabilities a little better than we have done so far.</P>
    <P>I would particularly urge on the Minister that he might find ways and means of speeding up the machinery dealing with these particular types of cases.  These remarks are not only applicable to the cases covered by this Estimate but to numerous classes of workers engaged in all sorts of ambiguous employment whose salaries and conditions are regulated by Civil Service conditions.  I believe that we have got a primary duty to the men and women whose salaries are such as to place them week after week in the utmost difficulty in their efforts to meet their commitments.  I think they have got first claim and that we must give greater attention to them in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his closing remarks briefly referred to the question of wages, prices and increased production. I do not want to enter at this stage on a discussion of these matters but it does seem to me that we are still going round in the old circle we have had in the past&mdash;feeling that whenever we do adjust what are undoubtedly rightful salary and wage claims we have got to make some apology and to express grave doubts as to whether we are not following courses which will give another push to inflation.  It seems to me that until we tackle the problem <Col N="1607" /> facing those whose conditions have been so much worsened during the emergency, we ought not to proffer so much advice to them but rather look in the other direction and address our remarks to those who profited out of the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin said he could not understand whether Deputy Aiken was in favour of this Estimate or not.  I understood Deputy Aiken to be quite precise on that matter.  He said that civil servants were getting twice as much as they were entitled to.  I understood that to mean that if he had control of this Estimate it would be £250,000 instead of £500,000.  That was the gist of the Deputy's remarks, and it is not denied apparently.  Civil servants have not got away with twice as much as they were entitled to.  When the consolidation agreement was made the fixed figure was 290.  The fixed figure is now 310 so there has been a 20 points increase. At the time the consolidation agreement was made it was related to a figure of 270 and this is related to a figure of 290, so exactly the same proportion has been preserved.</P>
      <P>So far as the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo; is concerned, I have nothing to add to what has been already said.  The special cut that was made under the bonus system on the higher salaries, it was recognised, had a very unfair result and the unfairness of that result became more pronounced the higher the cost of living went.</P>
      <P>I decided the time had come to make some change.  I think these people can complain that not very much has been done for them because this scaling down of their bonus has been relieved only to the extent of one-third.  I felt that they were entitled to that, seeing that a good deal of attention has been paid to the lower-paid groups.</P>
      <P>The situation under this agreement is that the increase is related to a 20-points increase in the cost of living. Should it suit any civil servant to take the 11/- rather than the 20 points increase, he has that option.  If he prefers to take the 20 points increase rather than the 11/- he can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> There may be some people in the lower grades who feel that if the scheme were related to a 20 points increase, they would not get as much as if they settled at the 11/-.  In any event the choice is theirs.  At the same time, this arrangement has made some, though not a very, substantial contribution to an improvement of the conditions of those whose conditions were worsened by the &ldquo;super cut&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get all these figures for the Deputy if he puts down a question.  I do not pretend to have all the details before me now.  The average increase on the 1946 settlement is one of 6 per cent.  I do not think that that can be counted a very heavy increase at this time.  I do not know what meaning has been read by Deputy Aiken into the words quoted about the announcement in regard to Post Office workers.  There has been no anticipation of the revision that took place.  I intended that it was not to be taken by these people that we were going to give them an increase on the 29th May and that in addition they were going to get a further upper revision once November came.  It is pointing out that this is part of the November revision they are getting ahead of time, and I intended no other meaning than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;because as Deputy Larkin said, the 11/- arrangement was come to between the employers generally in the country and the employees' associations.  That had been accepted by the Labour Court and it was making awards on the basis of the 11/-.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is revealing his hand more and more.  I met the Post Office workers and some 24 or 48 hours later, I met the Civil Service Alliance.  I suppose I should not, according to the conventions of the Civil Service, have done so, but I do not think that much harm was done and before the negotiations were finally completed I had them all in the room together.  The Deputy referred to my speech and to the fact that I said that I thought wage increases had gone far enough and that no increase should be looked for except in exceptional circumstances. We recognise exceptional circumstances in regard to these lower groups in the Civil Service.  I have no apology to offer for what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked about a lot of promises that were made in regard to teachers and pensionable people generally.  Promises were made and some of these days they will be fulfilled.  There was no promise that everything would be met in the same year.  We gave priority to the old age pensioners, to the widows and orphans and to the blind persons.  The second section was the civil servants and we approached the representative groups on the 29th May. Their case was a pressing one.  There had been an agreement and I felt that it had to be honoured.  The other cases will be met in due course but I want Deputies to realise the difficulties. It is not too easy to find all these moneys right away.  I could do a great deal more if I had not, as Minister for Finance, some very desperate heritages. My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has announced that the accumulation of turf in the Phoenix Park will have to be got rid of one of these days at a loss of possibly three million pounds.  What we will lose on coal will have to be added <Col N="1610" /> to that.  If the Deputies opposite want a monument to their activities they can take a walk through the Park any day.

      <P>No.  It is proposed to <Col N="1612" /> continue to-morrow.  I was saying that notice had been given of the desire of Deputies on this side of the House to discuss on the motion for the adjournment of the Dáil for the Christmas recess certain matters of considerable importance and urgency. The principal of these matters, one which is giving Deputies here considerable concern&mdash;and which, we assume, is giving concern to the Government also&mdash;is the serious position which has persisted throughout the whole year in regard to unemployment and the still more threatening position which appears likely to develop in the coming year.  It is our view that before the Dáil should adjourn for a period of two months, as is proposed, Deputies should endeavour to secure from the Government some classification of its attitude and its intentions with regard to this urgent and critical problem of unemployment. In fact, we propose to press upon the Dáil that if the Government do not see fit to make a statement of that kind&mdash;a statement which the House could accept as satisfactory&mdash; that it should refuse to adjourn.  I am sorry that there appears at the present time to be no Labour Deputy in the House.  I hope that they will see fit to attend and participate in this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to exercise my inalienable right to help them if I can.  I do not want to start this debate on controversial lines.  There is a problem that must be of concern to everybody. In relation to that problem the Government have got obvious responsibilities. It is by no means clear from the public statements made by Ministers what the Government proposes to do in order to discharge its responsibilities.  I am hoping that the Government's intentions will be made clear before the House adjourns.  If the Labour Deputies are sincere, as they profess to be, in their concern for the unemployed I propose to them that they should agree with us in refusing to adjourn the Dáil unless we get from the Government a clear statement of the manner in which they propose to discharge their responsibilities in this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many Deputies in the House are fully aware of the growing public anxiety about the position in regard to unemployment.  I would like to urge upon the Government that they should not underestimate in the least the depth of public anxiety in this connection. Not merely is it growing, but it is becoming vocal, as is evident from discussions which have taken place at meetings of public authorities and organisations which have a special concern with the consequences of unemployment.  That anxiety to which I have referred, that vocal and growing concern, is by no means confined to those who have the misfortune to be out of work or that other undefined number of people who are coming to feel that events are developing in a manner which will jeopardise their present livelihoods in the course of the coming year.  That anxiety is felt by everybody who is interested in trade. It is true that in the pre-Christmas season there is no evidence of any trade depression at the moment; but persons engaged in commerce have spoken freely to me, and I know they have spoken to other Deputies, about the evidence of a lessening in the public demand for goods and the indications that in the near future something in the nature of a business slump may develop.  That anxiety is also, of <Col N="1614" /> course, felt and felt acutely by people who are interested in the country's economic development.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this problem that I want to bring particularly to the notice of the Government.  Whether it is justified or not, a substantial part of that public anxiety to which I have referred arises from the belief that there are some members of the Government who are not as perturbed about the incidence of growth of unemployment as they might be; that they at least see in it the compensating factor that it does tend to discourage the upward movement of wage rates and, particularly, to dishearten efforts to reduce the output of workers in industry by proposals for the reduction of working hours, or other changes of that kind.  That belief&mdash;the belief that some Ministers see as the silver lining to this dark cloud of unemployment and the possibility of these consequences ensuing&mdash;has been created by the interpretation put by members of the public upon some Ministerial statements.  Possibly it is a misinterpretation.</P>
    <P>If there is however no foundation for that interpretation, if the misunderstanding which has arisen from these statements can be removed, then it is obviously desirable that it should be removed during the course of this debate.  May I say that public anxiety is also enhanced by the fact that other members of the Government and members of this House who support the Government, and I refer particularly to members of the Labour Party, have not shown in this matter the concern which might have been expected of them.  It might be an exaggeration to describe their attitude as one of indifference but it does appear that anxiety not to embarrass the Government is at least weighing as heavily with them as any concern they may have about the persistence and growth of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that if the Labour Party were in opposition to a Government with a majority they would have been very vocal during the course of this session on this subject of unemployment and that their silence on it is to be attributed not to any lack of <Col N="1615" /> sincerity or to any lack of concern but to the purely political desire of avoiding creating complications for the Government.  Every Deputy knows that this problem is there.  I may anticipate the argument that it was there also last year.  It was.  But the indications are that unemployment is tending to increase.  The official figures published during the course of the year seem to establish that fact.  The belief is that unemployment is going to become much more severe next year by reason of causes which can be indicated now.  It is probably true to say that the increase shown in the official figures was due this year more to developments in rural areas than to developments in urban areas.  The changes which took place in rural areas this year, and particularly the abandonment of the hand-won turf scheme, undoubtedly accentuated rural unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to make a very long speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a satisfactory speech nobody will object to the length of it.  I say, however, that the indications are that next year the unemployment which developed in rural areas this year is likely to be reproduced in urban areas.  I propose to give here the reasons I think that is likely to be so.  May I say in advance that I propose <Col N="1616" /> to state also my views as to what the Government can do in order to arrest any such development.  I am by no means anxious to appear merely as a destructive critic.  I think I know what I would do if I had personal responsibility in the matter.  I am sure I know what a Fianna Fáil Government would do in this matter.  There are not such wide divergencies of policies between Parties that it is not possible for the Government to take advice from this side of the House and to act upon it.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, however, as a preliminary that during the period of the war when various plans for economic development and particularly industrial development were impeded by the conditions created by the war, we all looked forward to the years when the war was over and when the difficulties affecting industry due to shortages of supplies of fuels and materials would be ended.  We confidently hoped and expected that in that post-war period we would not merely resume our industrial progress but that we would resume it so effectively that we would make good a lot of the lost time of the war years.  It was to this year we were looking.  It is in this year that the more serious of the war-time shortages ended and that we could have expected to have begun that post-war industrial expansion to which, right through the whole of that war period, we looked forward.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we have to record that '48 instead of being a year of expansion and progress has been a year of stagnation, if not of retrogression. Certainly so far as unemployment statistics reveal the whole picture of employment, movement has been in the wrong direction.  It is not merely however that we failed in this year to avail of the opportunities which this year gave but there appears at the present time no prospect that we are going to use these opportunities next year either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances of this year were abnormal.  A new Government of rather unusual composition came into office.  Admittedly it had for a time to become accustomed to the machinery of administration and, so far as the <Col N="1617" /> members of it were concerned, accustomed to working with one another.  I admit that they could not have been expected to have directed economic expansion or the industrial drive with the same precision and the same effectiveness as another Government might but at the end of this year they should have run in the bearings of their administrative machine.  They should have become accustomed to working together sufficiently to enable them to give the House, now before we adjourn for Christmas, an indication that some more effective work, some more definite policy will be evident in 1949.  I do not believe, and, refuse to accept the experience of this year as demonstrating, that the hopes we held during the war years of post-war industrial expansion and industrial recovery were unjustified.</P>
    <P>I think that given different political conditions we could have used this year to make good in a large measure the losses of the war-time period.  I still think that we could, despite unexpected and unforeseen difficulties in the international position, make in the immediate future the progress which in the past five years we thought would be possible now.  It is going to require, however, a far more definite effort on behalf of the Government&mdash; and I am thinking of the combined efforts of all Ministers and not spasmodic efforts of individuals&mdash;than we have any indication of to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Parliamentary Secretary will deny that in the industrial sphere there has been no significant development this year. I do not deny that many industrial projects that were initiated in the past, some perhaps considered for the first time before the war, came to maturity within the past twelve months but nothing of any significant size was started.  In fact it is true to say that very few new industrial enterprises were even mooted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's information bureau must be slipping.  It is not as accurate as it used to be in the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend that <Col N="1618" /> I have any information whatever as to what is going on in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  However, a large number of people interested in industry and the development of it come to me for advice.  They come to tell me about their plans and what is happening to their plans.  I suppose that is inevitable because of my long period of office as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As an individual, I have obviously no means of carrying out any investigations, or even checking the accuracy of the reports they make to me.  I am going on the basis of what is public knowledge as revealed in the columns of the newspapers as to what has happened in industrial affairs during the past nine or ten months.  Let me say at once that whatever has happened has not been due to any wrong policy pronounced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Parliamentary Secretary or the Taoiseach.  I think that all three Ministers whom I have named realised when they came to office that, because of past political controversies about free trade and protection, past opposition, if I might say so, to the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil, their position and general attitude in relation to industry might be misunderstood by the public and by those concerned directly and personally in industrial matters.</P>
      <P>Very early in the life of the Government, if not in fact in the very first speech made by the Taoiseach after being nominated by the Dáil, it was asserted that the Government were concerned to convince the people that there was going to be no change in industrial policy.  They knew that such an assertion was required and, knowing that, they made it.  I think it was an effort on their part genuinely intended to remove any anxiety or fear that their attitude to industrial development would be one of discouragement, or even that they might carry into the administration of the Government any feeling of hostility or prejudice to industries which had been initiated during the Fianna Fáil régime and the establishment of which might have redounded to the credit of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit at once that they set out to <Col N="1619" /> remove any such anxieties and fears and to create the idea amongst the public that, so far as industrial policy is concerned, they were going to take over the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil and carry it on.  It was good that they did that.  Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mere assertion of that attitude was insufficient to inspire confidence in the public, and that lack of confidence was apparently justified when these assertions made from time to time by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not appear to be followed up by the necessary administrative action.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view&mdash;I argued it as an opposition Deputy 20 years ago, I endeavoured to apply it as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I will argue it now&mdash;that in the special circumstances of this country industrial development is possible only with Government stimulus and help. We may have the idea that it is better to develop our national economy through private enterprise.  I certainly have argued in the past that, in our circumstances, private enterprise was likely to be much more efficient and much speedier in producing results than any system of State-directed or State-controlled industrial development. There are very special circumstances existing here, circumstances which have their origin in our history, which are directly attributable to the close economic conditions which existed in the past between this country and Great Britain, why it is necessary for the Government here to do more than was required from other Governments if the industrial drive is to be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The whole trading organisation of this country, if I may so describe it, was built up to distribute British goods, and to turn it round to handle the products of Irish industry was a difficult task.  Inevitably, it will slip back into its old method of working if the Government relax their viligance for a moment.  That is why it is necessary now, and always will be necessary so long as this generation lasts, for the Government to take in relation to industrial development a positive <Col N="1620" /> attitude.  It is not good enough to stand back and say: &ldquo;We will not interfere&rdquo;, or merely to say: &ldquo;We will give help, if the case for help is demonstrated to us.&rdquo;  They must exercise the function of leadership or else they will get no results at all.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, to criticise the Government because all these speeches made by Ministers are themselves of no use and have in fact produced no results, because they have not been, in my opinion, supported by evidence of administrative goodwill and administrative activity which was likely to convince those whom we may expect to supply the private enterprise and individual initiative in getting industry going.  It is a common complaint in business circles, whether justified or not, that it is difficult to get decisions out of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I know that even in my time, although the commonest accusation made against me was that I made decisions hastily, some people voiced that counter criticism as well.</P>

      <P>In fact, I think that if the Deputy made that statement outside, the persons concerned would think it was libellous.  Let me get back to the basis on which I started.  I believe &mdash;perhaps some of my colleagues will not completely share this belief&mdash;that the Minister for Industry and Commerce desires to be helpful.  I have certainly decided to take these public statements concerning his anxiety to help forward sound industrial undertakings at their face value.  I think his difficulty is that all his Cabinet colleagues do not share his viewpoint.  He was at one time, no doubt, an advocate of the more or less free trade policy of Fine Gael; but if the Minister says he was not, I shall accept his word.  I am taking his statements at their face value.  I am assuming that the difficulties business people are experiencing <Col N="1622" /> in getting decisions from him are due to the fact that he is finding difficulty in getting the assent of some of his colleagues to the proposals he is putting to them.  May I say that the name of the Minister for Finance is frequently mentioned in that connection? It may be an injustice to the Minister for Finance but, if it is, it is one the Minister for Finance can remedy by his own effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was formerly Minister for Industry and Commerce, was the first to introduce protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that is an argument against my point of view &mdash;what the present Minister for Finance did when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Let me stick to known published facts.  The Minister for Agriculture did publicly propose, in a statement made at Washington, the establishment of what he called a customs union between Britain, Ireland and America, and he explained that as meaning an arrangement under which there would be unrestricted movement of goods and persons between these three countries over a period of ten years.  I questioned the Taoiseach on that matter and the Taoiseach informed me and the Dáil that the Minister for Agriculture was expressing a personal viewpoint and not Government policy.  I accepted that, but I urge the Minister for Industry and Commerce not to underestimate in the least the effect, upon the minds of persons who are thinking of engaging in industrial activity or expanding present industrial activities, of that statement by the Minister for Agriculture.  He is a Minister, and whatever the present practice may be as regards collective responsibility, it is assumed that in making that proposal in Washington, if he was not indicating Government policy he was speaking the mind of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, at any rate, following from it, a reinforcement of the conviction which exists in many business circles, that underlying the pronouncements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1623" /> and similar pronouncements of the Taoiseach, there is a free trade opposition in the Government which is by its refusal to co-operate making these pronouncements meaningless.</P>
    <P>Not all new industries need protection. I think that is true in present circumstances.  It may not have been true before the war; in that period immediately before the war there was a trade slump in the world and many countries were endeavouring to export their unemployment by subsidising industrial exports and there was flowing into this country a stream of cheap goods, often highly subsidised and often carried free of charge in State subsidised ships.  The effect of that abnormal international situation was to establish a false standard of values by which the efficiency of Irish industries was frequently judged and condemned.</P>
    <P>The post-war situation has changed all that.  There is now no real evidence of subsidised trading or even of a desire to maintain a market here against a possible trade slump in the future.  There is a possibility of an international agreement which will eliminate unfair trading methods.  So far as many new industries are concerned, the establishment of which here was proposed to me when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, it was conceded that there was no present need for protection.  But every industry will need not merely an assurance from the Government, but a conviction in the minds of its shareholders and directors that protection will be given if the occasion arises.  It is the uncertainty as to the attitude of the Government, that feeling that, even though an industry can be established here now and maintained for a period in competition with the world, at some future stage an attack will be made upon it, some competing firm will dump goods to undersell, or some special advantages in another country will jeopardise its continuance and that it will need at that time protection and cannot be sure that it will get it, that will prevent an enterprise starting now because those who invest their savings in industrial development of that kind are planning to get a return upon their <Col N="1624" /> capital not in the immediate future, but over a considerable period of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture may not have understood exactly the consequences that the announcement of his free trade plan may have upon the work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and its immediate reaction upon the plans of many people who are contemplating entering into industrial activities or expanding existing activities, and how urgent it is that that reaction should be countered by some more authoritative and formal pronouncement of the policy of the Government as a whole.</P>
    <P>We want more than a pronouncement, however, because, in view of developments during the course of the year, the previous pronouncements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach, the apparent lack of relationship between these pronouncements and the administrative acts of the Department and the later statements of the Minister for Agriculture, no public reliance will be placed upon mere verbal assurances now. Public confidence in the intention and capacity of the Government to assist industrial development will not be restored unless verbal assurances are supported by evidence of action taken when required.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not necessary to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the desirability of giving evidence of his capacity and intention to help industries in difficulty exists at the present time.  There was published only in this morning's papers an announcement concerning the Swiftbrook Paper Mills.  That is merely an indication.  Similar things are happening in branches of the textile industry, the farm machinery industry and certain other industries of which the Minister probably knows more than I do, where assistance from the Government is required now if these industries are to be kept in production and if the workers are to be kept from emigrating.</P>
    <P>So much for the position as regards industry.  I said the unemployment that developed this year was, in the main, rural unemployment.  It was, perhaps, inevitable that the ending of <Col N="1625" /> the emergency fuel position would have necessitated some revision of plans for turf production.  I think that the Government might have been more concerned to have eased the shock in the areas where large numbers of men were employed in the production of hand-won turf and where over a number of years the prosperity of the areas concerned depended upon the existence of that industry.</P>

      <P>I just want to say in that connection that the fuel scarcity developed in 1941 and ended in 1948. We tried to minimise the effect of that scarcity by a variety of devices.  I certainly never contemplated that I could build up reserve stocks of turf and timber fuel and so taper them off that on the date when coal rationing was ended, nothing would be left in the dumps.  Perhaps a genius, a wizard or a prophet could have done it.  I do not purport to be anything of the kind.  If I am going to be criticised now because there are stocks of timber fuel in the Park, I have sitting opposite me here as Ministers, two men, who, in this Dáil in 1947, urged on me&mdash;I want to confess that their urging had an effect on me&mdash; that in addition to the efforts which I was making to accumulate stocks of turf fuel against last winter, I should also accumulate stocks of timber.  These Deputies are the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Minister for Lands, and what they said is on record. It might have been that all these stocks' would be required last winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already told the Dáil that when I saw the British Minister for Fuel in 1947, despite all the pressure I could put on him, the earliest possible date he would fix for expansion <Col N="1626" /> of coal supplies was the 1st of April, 1948.  In fact, coal came in here in December, 1947, when the stocks in the dumps had reached considerable proportions.  Let us note that and pass away from it.  It was an insurance premium we paid against the possibility of a repetition in 1947 of the experiences of the winter of 1946 and the financial cost is the least part of it.</P>
    <P>However I want to assert that the Government cannot just treat the unemployment which developed in the rural areas by reason of the curtailment of hand-won turf production as a legacy of Fianna Fáil for which they have no responsibility.  The people affected are human beings.  They are men and women who were eating meals purchased out of their earnings on turf production.  If they cannot be employed on turf production, if it is not Government policy to employ them on turf production, surely it ought to be the Government's policy to do something else to help them in their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Every member of the House knows, whether the Government wants it or not, that there is developing now a movement back to grass.  Perhaps I am not competent to discuss the Government's agricultural policy but in every part of the country, I am told, land is going back to grass.  Where that happens, whether it is a good agricultural policy or good for the development of an export trade, it is going to mean more rural unemployment. Again, I say that the Government have a responsibility to the men and women who lose their livelihood as a result to do something that will provide alternative means of livelihood for them.  If we get an accentuation of rural unemployment next year by reason of the diminution in turf production, by reason of the effect of the Government's agricultural policy, or the public understanding of what is Government policy, we can expect to face not merely depression in rural areas but depression creeping into areas but depression creeping into towns, the prosperity of which depends on flourishing rural conditions.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to bear in mind also that the reduction in tillage, whether the Government wants a reduction or not, which is now taking place, is <Col N="1627" /> having a reaction on industrial activity. It is a fact that a substantial number of workers formerly employed in the production of farm machinery are now out of work.  It is inevitable that the diminution in the area under tillage will mean a diminution in the numbers employed on the production of farm machinery and also a diminution in the demand for other tillage requirements which are produced here or processed here, and which give employment in one form or another.  All that hesitation concerning industrial expansion due to lack of confidence in the Government's future intentions, all that slowing up of industrial activity this year, the decline in rural employment due to the stoppage of the turf scheme, and the decline in the acreage under tillage, adds up to unemployment and unemployment means emigration.  I assume that every Deputy in this House is as concerned as I am to check emigration and will agree with me that whatever other causes may occasionally operate, the primary factor occasioning emigration is unemployment.  If that is so, I forecast that unless something is done &mdash;and if it is to be done it must be planned soon&mdash;to provide employment in rural areas next year, we are going to have unprecedented emigration from many parts of the country.  Only the Government can take measures that will stop that development and I am urging on the Government that they should inform the House what they are going to do.  If they cannot tell the House now, then I think the House ought to remain in session until we extract that information from them.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite may argue that Fianna Fáil, despite its industrial drive, despite its encouragement of tillage, despite the number of people put into employment during its term of office, did not end unemployment.  I concede that.  It is quite true that, although in 1947 there were more people in employment than in any previous year in the history of this country for which there are statistics, there was still some unemployment.  I concede that.  I am not pleading in extenuation or justification for our inability to establish conditions of full <Col N="1628" /> employment, the difficulties of the economic war or of the world war, but one thing I say in justification of the whole policy of Fianna Fáil is that we agreed to make its effect on unemployment the test of their policy.  From the very beginning we undertook to provide to the public and to the Dáil the fullest information concerning unemployment and to accept as a test of the effectiveness of our policy, the diminution of the number out of work. The Government which preceded us had discontinued the publication of weekly unemployment figures.  We restored that and we did more than restore it.  We urged by public advertisement that all the unemployed should register so that the register would be a real compilation of all the unemployed people in the country.  Then we made a mistake.  We decided that we would allocate unemployment relief grants upon the basis of the number of registered unemployed in particular areas.  Some of the &ldquo;bright boys&rdquo; immediately realised that the more names they had on the register, the more money would come into the area and names went on the register in such a number as to make it an unreliable guide.  That situation remedied itself in time.</P>
    <P>Although I concede now to the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he questions the significance of the unemployment figures published this year, that the live register is not necessarily an accurate indication of the state of unemployment in the country.  There are occasionally local factors which tend to inflate or deflate the number on the register without representing any real alteration in the unemployment situation.  It is the only indication we have.  Further than that, we initiated the publication of this official White Paper every year entitled &ldquo;The Trend of Employment and Unemployment.&rdquo; A committee of officials was set up to examine all the available statistics relating to employment and unemployment and to analyse them and to publish the conclusions which they had reached.  That White Paper has been published every year.  I presume that the White Paper for 1947 is due for publication in the near future.  I had <Col N="1629" /> hoped myself that it would have been found possible to have speeded up the publication of these reports.  The report relating to 1947 is not very valuable when available at the end of 1948.  I hope that it may be found practicable to make the report for 1948 available towards the middle of 1949.  The publication of these figures, the setting up of that committee, and the periodic circulation of the White Paper on the trend of employment and unemployment were all designed to ensure that everybody would have the fullest information on the subject.  I think that the Minister for Social Welfare, who has spoken on a few occasions in this connection, apparently with the intention of cloaking the position, is doing both the Government and the country a real disservice.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there was an increase in the number of persons in insurable employment this year judging by the number of insurance stamps sold.  I am not going to question the Minister's statement&mdash;I am assuming that it was correct.  There could be different explanations for an increase in the number of stamps sold other than an increase in total employment &mdash;such as, for instance, transfer of turf workers from private employment to road work&mdash;but I shall not refer to these possible explanations.  I say that if it is true that there has been an increase, on the scale which the Minister indicated, in the number of persons in employment insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act and if, at the same time, there has been an increase in emigration and an increase in unemployment then a much more serious position is revealed.  If all these three things have happened simultaneously there must have been an exodus from the non-insurable employment of agriculture of almost catastrophic dimensions.  There can be no other possible explanation except that a number of people that we did not know about at all came into the country through a hole in the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the explanation must be the very explanation you gave me when you were quoting the <Col N="1630" /> same thing in exactly the same circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only occasion I know of when that happened was in 1946&mdash;when there was an increase in the number of people in employment and unemployment at the same time&mdash; and that was due to the demobilisation of 40,000 soldiers in that year.  It has happened again this year.  Another 40,000 have come from somewhere and, so far as the statistical picture has revealed the explanation, the only place they can have come from was agricultural employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to emigration.  We are told that the number of exit permits given to people who are going abroad to obtain employment was substantially greater than last year.  I was interested to hear the explanation advanced that not all of these travel permits were availed of.  In the past, that explanation was rather discounted.  We know the precise number of people who have emigrated to the United States.  We know that this year the number was double that of last year. There may be the explanation that more ships were sailing this year than last year but whatever the explanation may be the fact of the matter is that the figure was double that of last year.  With the evidence of the United States statistics, the evidence from travel permits and the common knowledge of Deputies, particularly those representing western counties, that emigration is proceeding upon a larger scale than ever; it is I think completely misleading for the Minister for Social Welfare to quote in a public speech the figures for the movement of passengers in and out of this country as on the 1st September this year.  On that date there must have been 30,000 or 40,000 tourists in Ireland or visitors from abroad of one kind or another&mdash;mainly, no doubt, Irish workers in Great Britain coming home to see their relatives&mdash;and the inference to be drawn from these figures, affected by that inward movement of tourists from abroad which was then at its height, was that emigration was coming down.  The Minister for Social Welfare cannot <Col N="1631" /> have misunderstood the significance of the figures.</P>
    <P>For a member of the Commission on Emigration, which the Government set up to take these same figures and to write an article on the subject of emigration in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> to prove from these same figures that emigration was not a serious situation at all indicates a mentality I cannot understand.  Surely it will be agreed that emigration this year is higher than it was last year.  Last year every Deputy opposite urged upon the Government then in office, and upon the public, that emigration was one of the most serious, if not the most serious, of all our national problems. If that were so last year, and we do not deny it, it is doubly so this year and it is serving no purpose whatever to have Ministers or members of a Government commission quoting misleading figures in order to blind the public to the realities of the position. I think that these are wrong tactics. If the Government is anxious to carry into effect a policy which will reduce unemployment and end emigration they have got to get on their side, fully understanding the gravity and difficulty of the problems, not merely the members of the Dáil but also the members of trade unions, the members of employers' organisations and the public as a whole.  It is only by letting it be known generally that there is here an emergency which justifies an emergency mentality and an emergency approach that we will be able to get acceptance in the House and in the country of measures adequate to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>What must these measures be? First of all, and I put it first because I think it is the most important, there must be a restoration of public confidence in the future economic development of the country.  Every Deputy opposite has heard somebody talk about depressed conditions prevailing in industrial and agricultural circles&mdash; of the appearance of a dead hand over the country&mdash;and probably dismissed such talk as the propaganda of political opponents.  They cannot be blind to the fact that there is a lack of confidence, perhaps due to uncertainty, <Col N="1632" /> perhaps due to lack of trust in the capacity of the Government, but a lack of confidence none the less in our future economic development.  The confidence which the people one time had in the continuance of our industrial expansion, in the soundness of our economic plans, must be restored.  It has been shaken&mdash;it may have been broken&mdash;but it must be restored.  So long as the present political situation exists, only the Government can do that.  It cannot be restored merely by a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or merely by a statement by the Taoiseach.  If there is to be a conviction carried to the public mind that the Government has a plan on which all members are agreed&mdash;in the fulfilment of which all members will co-operate&mdash;it must be stated to be a Government plan and an indication must be given that the various members of the Government&mdash; even the suspect members whom I have named&mdash;have accepted it and proposed to work for its fulfilment.</P>
    <P>I admit that may be a matter of some difficulty for the Government but, until they have overcome that difficulty, they cannot hope to restore that confidence which is an essential condition of progress. Secondly, we must have it understood that full employment in the sense in which that term is ordinarily used is a primary aim of financial policy.  I am not one of those who believe that the creation of full employment is solely or even primarily a financial matter.  I think that whatever may be the circumstances in other countries, much more than the financial plans proposed by Sir William Beveridge, or Lord Keynes, or others, is required before we can have full employment here.  If their theories are sound and if the Government is right in its belief that there are inflationary forces at work at the moment we should have full employment now.  We know we have not.  But even though it is not true, in the circumstances of this country, that full employment can be secured by financial arrangements alone, it is true that financial policy alone can stop it; and we must have it made clear that there is no financial aim worth having if it has to be secured <Col N="1633" /> at the cost of continuing in unemployment the 60,000 or 70,000 potential workers who are now upon the live register.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether one has regard to the desirability of restoring the stability of money values&mdash;and I concede always the importance of that financial aim to the workers of the country, the workers who always lose, and lose most heavily in periods of monetary instability, or whether one has in mind the desirability of rehabilitating the value of our external assets &mdash;and I realise how much our future standard of living depends upon that. I say these things can be done otherwise; perhaps by a harder road and by harsher methods, but they can be done otherwise in a manner which will not necessitate any limitation in our efforts to expand employment now.</P>
    <P>If industrial expansion is to proceed, and industrial expansion is essential to the ending of chronic unemployment in this country, there must be evidence that the Government is prepared to support it, evidence which will take the form of acts rather than words.  The faith I have had&mdash;and it is a faith which was shared by my colleagues&mdash;is that, if we are to build up here a country with sufficient economic strength to preserve its freedom and protect the well-being of its people in all international circumstances, we must develop manufacturing industry.  It is bad national policy to argue, much less to endeavour to get people to believe, that there is any inevitable conflict between a policy of industrial expansion and agricultural interests.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The security of our agriculture and the prosperity of our industry are inter-linked and it is foolish to think that we can develop here a sound economy based entirely upon agriculture. We have not here all the conditions of other highly industrialised countries but we can get them in time. There is no reason why we cannot put into industry here all that other small countries in Europe have done&mdash;for instance, Holland, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland.  It only requires a concerted effort on behalf of all those who have responsibility for directing our national development <Col N="1634" /> and, in the course of time, the accumulation amongst our people of the knowledge of how to do it.</P>
    <P>The Government must endeavour to prepare a definite programme for sustaining rural employment.  I am not now going to discuss agricultural policy.  It would not perhaps be relevant on this debate, and, in any event, we have had a rather long discussion on it during this session of the Dáil.  But if we are to have a diminution in the unemployment now existing in the rural areas, if there is to be what is desirable and must be achieved at some time&mdash;an elimination of the seasonality of work in rural areas&mdash;we must endeavour to promote those forms of agriculture which mean employment for men on the land.  We must do that by making these forms the most profitable for the farmer.  That is going to take time.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile we have this turf development issue.  I was delighted to read in the Press that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Social Welfare and other members of the Government had visited the Turf Development Board's works at Clonsast.  I take no exception whatever to anything they said when there. I hope they were impressed by what they saw.  I believe they were.  I do not think it is possible for any intelligent man to go there and see what the Turf Development Board is doing without being impressed.  But what they are doing is only part of the programme that was planned for them and, realizing that they could complete that part of the programme earlier than was originally anticipated, a decision had been taken to expand the programme. That decision cannot be implemented without legislation.  I would urge upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he should get ahead with that enlarged programme; that he should tell the Minister for Finance to go to the devil.  This is a matter of men and women who want work, who are prepared to work and who can be given work in the production of wealth upon our bogs if they are organised and directed in accordance with the plans of the Turf Development Board.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precisely is holding <Col N="1635" /> up the expansion of housing activities.  I was rather astonished to hear the Minister for Local Government inform the Dáil that the number of houses completed in Dublin this year was slightly less than the number of houses completed last year.  It is true that the number of additional houses started this year was somewhat larger than the number started last year but I cannot understand why there has not been a much greater expansion in housing activity.  There is, so far as I know, no longer any real problem of scarcity of materials.  No doubt some of the less important materials are still not in ample supply but, in the main, the difficulties about supplies of materials, which restricted housing activities during the war, have ended. Nevertheless, we have got all this machinery of control still in operation. It is still necessary to get your building licence and your authority from the Department of Industry and Commerce before you can start building.</P>
    <P>Why is that necessary?  If there is one limiting factor it must be scarcity of skilled workers.  If that is that limiting factor what is the Government doing about it?  Something must be done about it.  It may be an awkward problem to face.  It may be politically dangerous.  But some day, sooner or later, some Government will have to face it and I for one refuse to believe that there are in charge of the building craft unions men who, for any selfish reason peculiar to their own members, will condemn tens of thousands of Irish families to live in slums for years longer than is necessary and for years after the full development and organisation of the building industry could have produced homes for them.</P>
    <P>In any event that labour problem is by no means as acute in rural areas. We should have had evidence in the rural areas of that spread of housing activities over all the countryside which we saw in the years 1937 and 1938 when, after the guidance and inspiration of our present President, that great effort was made to wipe out the rural slums, an effort which admittedly left only a small part of the total task to be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the problem, then tell us.  I have no anxiety to create conditions under which contractors or anybody else can make undue profits.  Let me say this, the evidence from all countries shows that the more houses that are built the higher the contractors' prices go up, and the fewer houses built the lower the prices fall.  The present Minister for Education, Deputy General Mulcahy, when he was Minister for Local Government became obsessed with the idea of reducing the cost of houses built by local authorities.  In order to get down the cost he decided to limit the number of contracts issued, and he reduced the cost of houses in an extraordinary fashion.  Contractors began to slash their prices in order to get the available business, but few houses were built.  As soon as the emphasis came on getting the houses built, of course, inevitably the element of competition became less and prices began to rise. That is an administrative problem which every Government will have to face.  You can solve the problem of high prices by neglecting the job or you can go on with the job and tackle the problem of high prices otherwise. We look after these contractors' profits fairly well through taxation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and I will not disagree on that.  If the Deputy has a practical plan by which we can get down the cost and at the same time get the house up I will be very glad to support it.  The same applies to these various farm building and farm development schemes.  It maybe that the Minister for Agriculture has 30,000 applications for farm development grants in his office.  Well, during the war years when I was Minister for Supplies and we began to ration tea and sugar and other things we got not 30,000 but 300,000 applications for rations of one thing and another and we had to deal with them. We brought in staffs from the street. We employed the Hospitals' Trust Organisation in order to handle the <Col N="1637" /> problem.  Let the Minister for Agriculture, instead of leaving these 30,000 applications lying in the cupboard, get in the additional staff to enable them to be tackled.  The problem of unemployment is there in the rural areas and I hope he will not try to tackle it by humdrum administrative methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And you never made an effort to deal with them.  Let me refer to one very urgent matter.  I agree that any plan for the permanent easement of our unemployment problem, whether urban or rural, must necessarily be a long term one.  We cannot, by the development of industry or the reorientation of agricultural production, solve unemployment in the towns or countryside overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an immediate problem of men idle now, men who are this week out of work.  There will be many thousands more out of work after Christmas.  There always is a seasonal expansion in the number unemployed after the Christmas business is finished. Something has to be done about these. This year there were £1,225,000 voted for the financing of work schemes to provide periods of employment for those workers.  The amount provided this year was the same as last year. Now, we were frequently told during the debates on the Estimates that they were our Estimates, that we had decided the amounts to be provided under the various heads.  That is true and when we were deciding to provide a sum for employment schemes in 1948 equivalent to the amount provided in 1947 we did not foresee the special problem that would be caused in the turf production areas by the ending of the hand-won turf schemes.  A large part of that sum has already been spent, I understand, on the operation of special employment schemes confined to former turf workers.  Because of that, the amount available for winter <Col N="1638" /> work projects is less than ever although the problem is larger than ever.  If that is so there is still time for this Dáil to pass a Supplementary Estimate providing £500,000 for the provision of work at some reasonable rate of wages to those who are unemployed. We can do it as rapidly as we passed £500,000 to increase the salaries of civil servants here to-day.  I am not objecting to the civil servants getting what they are entitled to, but these people in the country who are unemployed and who are likely to continue to be unemployed have at least as strong a claim on public funds as the civil servants and as strong a claim on the sympathies of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is the case in brief that the Government has to meet.  It is possible to try to dispose of that case by wisecracks. It is possible to dispute the accuracy of some of the statements I have made but you will not convince the public that that is the answer to it.  The unemployment problem is there.  The Government has the responsibility for dealing with it and the Dáil is entitled to get from the Government a clear statement of what they are proposing to do.  I am suggesting to the Dáil, to the Deputies of the Labour Party and the Clann na Poblachta Party and all those Deputies opposite who are concerned with this matter that they should agree with us to refuse to adjourn until we get that statement from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass opened this debate by assuring the House that he was not going to deliver a destructive speech, that he would be constructive, that he did not want to be controversial and that he was not speaking from a Party political point of view.  I want to say&mdash;and I have listened to Deputy Lemass in this House for over 20 years&mdash;that that speech is no credit to Deputy Lemass and it is no credit to the Party that sits behind him.  I would like if the Deputy would listen to me for a moment.  The Deputy dwelt at considerable length and became quite eloquent at times on his concern for the extension and development of industry in this country.  He told us that there was a lack of confidence <Col N="1639" /> amongst industrialists, amongst traders generally and in commercial circles.  He proceeded to tell us that it was essential if we were to make any advance in industry that that lack of confidence should be dispelled and that confidence should be built up in this country and that would-be promoters of industry should get the feeling that it was safe to invest their money and to give their time to build up an industry in this country.  The man who gave expression to those sentiments has been for over an hour here doing his damnedest to tell the people that it is dangerous to invest money in this country, that it is dangerous to invest money in industry, doing his damnedest to break down the confidence that is there.  The whole trend of the Deputy's speech, from beginning to end, was devoted to that purpose and, knowing Deputy Lemass as long as I know him and never having made the mistake of taking him for a fool, I can only come to the conclusion that the speech was deliberately made with that intent.</P>
      <P>I invite Deputy Lemass to read the speech that he has just delivered here and to ask himself the question is that the sort of speech that would be made by a man who is concerned about the development of industry, about the development of agriculture and about the reduction of unemployment or the wiping out of unemployment in this country.  Is that the sort of speech that would be delivered in this House by a man who was genuinely and gravely concerned about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass knows as well as I do, perhaps even better, that since the change of Government there has not been one step backward so far as the encouragement of industry is concerned. There have been very material steps forward. When the Deputy talks about regression rather than advance or expansion, let me say that I had to take steps as Minister to undo the harm to Irish industry which the Deputy did by measures which he passed last year through this House, and I had to take measures to open factories that were closed down by Deputy Lemass's activities of last year. <Col N="1640" /> I had to take measures that put factories on full-time that were on half-time as a result of the Deputy's opening the flood-gates last year to let stuff in here and the Deputy knows that. The Deputy may have fooled some of his followers that his Party was the only Party concerned in building up industry in this country, but they are not.</P>
    <P>The Deputy taunted me and the Government with the fact that no new venture or factories for which we could claim any credit have been opened already, while, at the same time, saying that any of the factories which have been opened since the change of Government were factories for which the initial steps were taken any time within the last five years.  So that the factories which were initiated, or steps towards the opening of which were initiated five years ago under Fianna Fáil are now opening.  But I am supposed to be able to get people interested, to get them started, to get the factories working and the men employed within ten months.  I am very glad to be able to say that there are at least as many proposals for industry before the Department as there were during the Deputy's time.  Let me go further and say that I honestly believe that most of them, and those certainly which are getting deep and detailed consideration, are sounder proposals than many of those which went before the Department during the Fianna Fáil Government's time.</P>
    <P>I am not able to claim, I will not be able to claim, and I do not want to claim, as the Deputy claimed on more than one occasion, that I have opened in one year or five years 979 factories. I know the type of some of the factories which were included in the 979. I make the Deputy a present of this&mdash; that proposals for the opening of so-called industries were submitted to me and I turned them down.  I am not concerned with opening factories to put exorbitant profits into the pockets of an individual or group of individuals. My test is: is the opening of the industry going to be to the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to give all Parties in this House the assurance that any worthwhile, <Col N="1641" /> genuine proposal for the starting or development or expansion of an industry put before me or the Government will get the fullest possible consideration and if, in our opinion, it is a sound proposition it will get whatever measure of protection it needs and for as long as we feel it needs it.  I want to make it clear, however, as I have stated outside&mdash;I think Deputy Lemass will subscribe to this if he has not already said it&mdash;that industries cannot expect that we are going to keep them in the nursery and on the feeding bottle in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the speech which the Deputy has made here, I believe that he is concerned with the welfare of industry in this country.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Deputy, during the time he was Minister, made a very big contribution to the building up of industries in this country.  I am not going to suggest for a moment that the Deputy did not leave good industries behind him&mdash;he did&mdash;any more than I think he would claim himself that every industry to which he gave protection ultimately proved to have been worthy of the protection he gave it.  I am not blaming the Deputy for that, because he could not know beforehand in every case.  But I do say that he is not helping industry or helping the Government or helping to put more people into employment by making the type of speech he delivered this evening.  I appeal to Deputy Lemass, either in his speeches here or in the articles, the very mischievous and damaging and untrue articles, which he is not only publishing, but writing in the <i>Irish Press</i>, to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>I want to give this assurance to the House and, through the House, to the country, that there has been no undue or avoidable delay in dealing with any application for protection by way of tariff or quota which came before the Department since I became Minister. On the other hand, I am bound to say that, in the interests of the community, of the purchasing public and of the consumers, those proposals must be closely examined and, not only in the interests of the community as a whole <Col N="1642" /> or the purchasing public, but in the interests of Irish nationals, who will be asked to put their capital into these factories.  The Deputy knows that in very many cases the initial steps are taken by non-nationals.  I feel I have this duty to those people who are approached by non-nationals to form a company and comply with the Control of Manufactures Act, that before they put their capital into it, to sift the proposal and make the closest and the most minute inquiries as to the standing, status and antecedents of the people who propose to start here.  For that I make no apology.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest easy and have a perfectly easy mind so far as this Government is concerned, that industry will get more than a fair break and the policy of this Government will be weighted heavily in favour of the development of Irish industry, but we are not going to prop up inefficiency. We will have regard to the fact that they are in their infancy, and make full allowance for that, but we will not ignore the question of quality and price.  So far as protection is concerned, so far as finance is concerned, there will be at least as much while this Government remains in office as there was before it came into office&mdash; probably more and probably it will be better and more intelligently directed. I do not want to go any further than that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy really touched me with the sob in his voice when he came to deal with the unemployed and their rights and the fact that he was reminding us that they were men and women, flesh and blood, that they were entitled to a living in their own land and to earn their bread by the sweat of their brows.  The Deputy was sobbing over the miserable hovels that we have. Does the Deputy realise that his whole speech was the greatest condemnation of his 16 years in office that has ever been uttered inside or outside this House?  If we have, immediately following on the heels of 16 years of a oneParty Government and, according to the Deputy, a one-minded Government &mdash;if the result of that 16 years is that we have, according to the Deputy, emigration on an unprecedented scale, <Col N="1643" /> that we have greater unemployment than we ever had before, that there is a flight from the land, what conclusions can we draw?</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy got eloquent about rural unemployment and the effect of it and I began to wonder did the Deputy think of throwing his mind back and asking himself how many people were driven out of rural Ireland and off the land of Ireland during the 16 years his Party was in office.  I am not confining my remarks in this regard to the war period, or the period since the war.  The Deputy, of course, wants to hang all that on what he calls this Government's abandonment of the hand-won turf scheme.  I wish we could get this matter dealt with once and for all.  The Deputy himself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, took the first step in putting an end to the hand-won turf scheme when he decided to discontinue hand-won turf in the camps in County Kildare.  He was informed by the officials of his Department on 12th February that if they continued to produce hand-won turf as formerly produced by the county council, there would be no room for it in the dumps, that they could not find a place for it, and if it was produced it would have to be built along the sides of the public roads.</P>
    <P>Why did he not take a decision to continue the production of county council turf?  The Deputy did not do so.  He was asked for a decision, but he refused to give it; he refused to say that the production of county council turf should proceed. The Deputy, mindful of the fact that within six days of that date there might me a change of Government, deferred a decision until after the fateful day.  With the respect that I have for Deputy Lemass's intelligence, whatever about his political sagacity, I am as sure as I am standing here that if Deputy Lemass was straight and speaking truthfully, he would admit that if he were returned as Minister, at the next conference held after 12th February he would have taken a decision to discontinue the production of hand-won turf.  He could have taken no other decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> The Deputy tried to give the impression, when he talked about the scarcity of fuel from 1939 onwards that the immense stocks of fuel we now have in the dumps was built up over a period of six or seven years.  That is not so. It was built up over a period of eight or nine months.  When this country was struck with the most bitter and severe winter and spring that it has been our lot to experience&mdash;the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947&mdash;there was nothing in the park or in any dump at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not, and that statement is absolutely and completely untrue.  Deputy Lemass talked about timber.  As a result of the experience we had in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947, I urged the Minister, as he then was, to go out not only on turf but on timber.  I certainly did not urge him, and neither did anybody else, seeing we had 1,500,000 tons of coal from the British, 500,000 tons from Africa and five to ten years' supply of firewood, to continue bringing in fuel at the rate of 10,000 tons a week as he was doing up to the date he left office.</P>
      <P>What was the position as regards fuel on the 18th February?  The Deputy on that date said that we had ten years supply at the then rate of consumption. Let us say we had five years' supply of firewood.  I know something about firewood.  I know it can deteriorate and shrink much more rapidly than turf, but let us assume we had five years' supply of firewood and three years' supply of turf, if we did not cut a single sod of turf in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense; we had not a ton per household per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We had three years' supply of it and we also had the coal. I do not want to make any capital out of that fact.  It might have happened myself or anybody else in the Minister's position at the time.  What I object to is the downright, dishonest campaign that was sought to be conducted all over the country and the feelings of the unemployed men played upon as to <Col N="1645" /> who was or was not responsible for stopping the hand-won turf scheme.</P>
      <P>The dumps are there, and let me give this picture.  There is a very valuable site at the North Wall, known as the refinery site.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board are threatening to take this Government into court for possesion of it, because the oil companies want to build tanks for additional storage.  I am asked to give them possession of that site and to shift the fuel to another site. Between coal and firewood there are 200,000 tons of fuel on that site alone. I have said I will not transfer it to another site.  I cannot, because it would cost me more to transfer it than I could sell it for.  We have over 1,000,000 tons of fuel between turf and timber, and, let me so put it, non-British coal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Brennan has been making representations to me to get the park at Dun Laoghaire, which is being used as a dump, cleared.  I cannot do it.  There are large quantities of firewood there, and it would cost more to transfer it to another dump than I could sell it for. There are 330,000 tons of firewood&mdash; that is the quantity that was weighed in and paid for&mdash;but anybody who knows anything about firewood, and particularly anybody who adverts to the fact that in those immense heaps of firewood you have every conceivable quality and variety of tree, hard wood, soft wood, brushwood and everything else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally it weighed 330,000 tons.  Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister, was trying to get £4 a ton for it.  On the advice I got from every part of the House, I reduced the price.  Acting on my own opinion of what would happen if we did not get rid of it, I reduced the price from £4 to 35/- a ton, and made it clear that we were prepared to sell it in ton lots.  At the rate at which it is being sold, cut in blocks, at 35/- a ton, if it lasted it would not be gone in 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am concerned with is what it cost the taxpayer of the country and what it will be sold at. The losses are there and will have to be met.  I do not want to flog that matter any further.  I do not want to make any capital out of the dumps but I want to tell Deputy Lemass or any other Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, who goes around completely misrepresenting the situation and playing on the feelings of people who lost employment arising out of the stoppage of turf production, that every time they start a dishonest campaign of that kind I am going to put the facts before the people.  I challenge Deputy Lemass now whether he can say conscientiously that if he had been returned as Minister, he would not have to stop, in the circumstances, the production of hand-won turf.  I leave it at that.  I shall try and get rid of it as quickly as I can.  Maybe the price will have to be cut still further to get rid of it but the longer it is there the more ultimately it is going to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the turf scheme or Bord na Mona is concerned, I want to make this perfectly clear.  There was a proposal by the previous Government that 200,000 tons of machine-won turf should be produced this year.  Although we had these surplus stocks and did not <Col N="1647" /> really require the turf we went on with that scheme, and over 200,000 tons of machine-won turf is being produced and sold.  I want to say that the machine-won turf that is being produced in this country is a first class fuel, and is good buying for anybody who wants it.  I want to repeat also a statement that some gentleman opposite tried to twist and make capital out of before. I am going to repeat it again so that they can make more capital out of it&mdash; that the people of this country can make up their minds that to try to produce hand-won turf as a commercial proposition in this country is madness, and there is no Deputy over there who will not subscribe to that. Of course we produced hand-won turf for years long before Fianna Fáil came into office.  The farmers and farm labourers will continue to produce it, as they always did for their own use, but do not get this question of turf production out of proportion.</P>
    <P>Before ever Fianna Fáil ever sat over there, people in rural Ireland produced 3,500,000 tons for their own use.  After all the incentives, after all the drive to produce more turf during the war, the highest peak that was ever reached was 5,000,000 tons.  Remember that before ever Bord na Móna or before ever a county council produced one ton of hand-won turf, the ordinary people of the country produced, year in, year out, 3,500,000 tons for their own use.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talks very loosely about a reduction in tillage.  What reduction is he talking about?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is hoping it will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reduction in the acreage under tillage, but I think it is insignificant compared with the reduction next year, if the reports which are coming in from rural areas indicate what is going to happen or unless there is a change in Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1648" />
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make this clear.  So far as this Government is concerned, it is doing nothing that is going in any way to reduce tillage or to give any reason to any farmer to reduce tillage.  Let me remind Deputies opposite that they announced three years ago that as from this year there would be no compulsory wheat growing.  This Government has also announced that there will not be any compulsory wheat growing but it has further announced that there will be a guaranteed price of 62/6 for every barrel of millable wheat produced and it has guaranteed that price, not for one year, but for five years.  That is 5/- a barrel more than was ever paid by the Fianna Fáil Government.  That is one cereal.</P>
      <P>So far as barley is concerned&mdash;and again let me say that I know something about this&mdash;I am perfectly satisfied that there will be a very considerable expansion in the production of barley next year.  With additional superphosphates, additional supplies of lime, the development of ground limestone, a guaranteed market and guaranteed prices for live stock and poultry, I see no reason whatever why there should not be an expansion in tillage and an expansion in the production of live stock at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent in that at all.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I want to see in this country good mixed farming, so far as our land is suitable for it. There is no reason why the Deputy should say that there is going to be a reduction in tillage.  Instead of saying that, the Deputy ought to help us to see that it is not reduced.  I want to say, and again I speak from some experience, that people were trying to grow wheat in counties in this country and on land in this country in the last seven or eight years that were never intended to grow, or never could grow, wheat.  I do not think that anybody who is in favour of the production of the maximum amount of cereals and the maximum amount of tillage should be so foolish as to want anything other than that the best of our land, which is best suited for tillage and from which we will get the best return, is the land that should be tilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Deputy said that we were going back to a grass policy.  Surely the Deputy knows that agriculture could not survive unless we get back to grass to a very considerable extent and get better grass.  Surely the Deputy knows that the dairying industry is the foundation of agriculture.  What is the use of talking about expanding the production of milk, butter and cheese, and everything that flows from that, unless we have better grass, infinitely better grass than we have had heretofore? The Deputy ought to know or his colleagues ought to tell him that you cannot have successful tillage unless you have cattle.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy that this country is not going to provide for its people by relying entirely on agricultural production. Neither will it do so by relying entirely on industrial production.  There is unquestionably room here for a well-balanced economy.  Unquestionably not only is there room for industrial production, but there is greater need for more up-to-date and modern methods in agricultural production as well as in industrial production.  Let me mention Bord na Móna schemes for turf production in this country. These schemes, both the original plan and the amended scheme, are under very active consideration.  Every aspect is being considered.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no need for me to tell the Minister for Finance to go to blazes.  The Minister for Finance is not interfering with me in any way. If I am satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

On this question of unemployed and unemployment I want to say to Deputy Lemass, and I probably know a little about it&mdash;the Deputy had to listen to me more often on that matter than I have had so far to listen to him&mdash;that I am not going to give the Deputy the answers he gave me every year for 16 years in the matter.  I am not trying to minimise the number of unemployed in this country.  I am not trying in any way to minimise what a social evil it is.  I am not suggesting for one moment, and never did I suggest, that it was a problem easy of solution. However, I say to the Deputy that it is hardly fair of him to blame us for not being able to do in ten months what he was not able to do in 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Lemass that when we take the week with the last published figures of unemployed, not-withstanding all we have heard about the great increase in unemployment in rural areas and the reduction in the number of houses being built, and the uneasiness caused in industry&mdash;if we take all these points made by him into consideration&mdash;I think it is something to be able to say that the position is not worse.  The difference between the figures for, I think, the first week <Col N="1651" /> in December of this year as compared with the first week in December of last year, was less than 500-400 odd. The previous week &mdash; actually the second in this year&mdash;the figures were lower than the figures for the corresponding week of last year.</P>

Deputy Lemass knows that better than anybody else on his side of the House or on this side of the House knows it&mdash;or, at least, he ought to know it after 16 years' experience of these figures.  I want to say that on the very day that that lying statement <Col N="1652" /> of an 80 per cent. increase in unemployment was published there were actually 219 fewer unemployed in the County Donegal than on the corresponding day of the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no insinuations against Deputy Lemass. If I ever want to make a personal statement against Deputy Lemass, or a personal accusation against him, I shall not do it by insinuation.  It will be stated so bluntly, so frankly and so flatly that even Deputy Burke will recognise it.</P>
      <P>I want to go further now and say that there are people who are telling the unemployed that the only reason why they are unemployed and the only reason why they are being dismissed from work is because of the change of Government.  There is one high official in one semi-State company who no later than yesterday told an unemployed man who went to him for a job: &ldquo;We have no job for you; we are letting men go; we are letting men go because this Government are doing a particular thing,&rdquo; and he named the particular thing.  That was an utterly malicious lying statement.  We have a job to do.  It is a big job.  If we have not got on as quickly and as rapidly with the constructive side of it about which Deputy Lemass is so concerned it is because there were so many barriers that we had to clear out of our way first.  As far as I am concerned I regret the amount of time that I have had to devote in the last nine or ten months to trying to clear up something for which I was not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy and the House, if the Deputy wants assurance <Col N="1655" /> and if my words can carry assurance or carry confidence, either to the people who are engaged in industry in this country or the people who proposed to engage in it, that they can carry on with perfect security and perfect safety.  To those who are thinking of taking, or who may have taken, the initial steps to start in industry or to expand existing industry, I say to them that they can go ahead with absolute safety as far as this Government is concerned.  I am as anxious as any member of this House&mdash;I do not care on which side he sits&mdash;to see the growth and development and expansion of industry.  I know that that is sound national policy.  I know it is good for the country.  I know it is the only alternative to the emigrant ship for our people.</P>
    <P>If I can state my policy, or the policy of the Government, more clearly or more plainly than that, perhaps somebody would give me the words I ought to use.  That is as clearly as I can state it.  The only qualification to that &mdash;if anyone thinks there is a qualification&mdash;is that we are not going to continue supporting for ever inefficiency. I believe&mdash;and I repeat now what I have said elsewhere&mdash;that Irish industrialists have done a good job taken by and large.  I know they had serious difficulties with which to contend in the initial stages and in the earlier years of industrial development. I know that some of them have successfully overcome those difficulties and are to-day efficient.  I know they are producing first-class articles.  But I am not blind to the fact that there are still some of them who are inefficient; that they are producing goods that are not as high a quality as I would like to see this country produce either for home or foreign consumption.  I know that there is great room for further improvement in management, in technical skill and in the proper direction of labour.  I know that there is definitely room for improvement in output in the factory, on the land, on the bogs and on the roads.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat once again what I have said on every occasion on which I have spoken in public since <Col N="1656" /> I took office as Minister.  We cannot go on living in a fool's paradise.  We cannot go on living beyond our income. We cannot go on spending far more than we are earning.  We cannot go on in the belief that we cannot merely maintain a present standard of living but can improve it unless we are prepared to work harder and to give more output.  The most important factor, whether we are talking about industrial produce, agricultural produce, the making of roads or the building of houses, in the cost of any article ultimately to the consumer or user is the amount of output that goes into its production.</P>
    <P>We have been taunted that every member of this Government does not speak with one voice&mdash;the voice of a Government with no change or no inflection, good, bad or indifferent. This Government does not claim to be other than a Government representative of every section of the community. It is a Government fully representative of farmers, labourers, professional men, industrialists and so on.  We are not concerned with giving privilege to any one class or section.  We are concerned only with giving justice to everybody in the community.  I have a serious responsibility.  I make no secret of that fact.  Nobody knows it better than Deputy Lemass.  I have a heavy task.  I do not claim to be a genius.  I have never claimed that. But I do claim that I am doing my best and I am doing it in accordance with the principles I have stated here to-night.  I am concerned with only one object; that is, that the policy laid down for my Department and for every other Department of State by this Government will be carried out in such a way that we shall leave the country and its people when we lay down the chains of office in a better condition than they were when we entered office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very anxious that there should have been a debate in regard to the Adjournment of the Dáil for the Christmas Recess.  I understand that we are adjourning until the 16th of February next.  By the time we return to this House this Government will have been one year in office.  I <Col N="1657" /> think it is reasonable that there should have been an opportunity on this Adjournment for a clear, specific and factual statement by the Government as to the actual progress they have made in the past 12 months and an indication of their plans for the coming 12 months.</P>
      <P>What I want to say, and say quickly, is that I have been disappointed with the speech that has just been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have listened to this turf, coal, timber in several debates in this House and I did not come into this House for the purpose of listening to this comparison month after month as to what could be done in ten months and what could be done in 16 years.  I think that our constituents, the people who are unemployed, the people who are unable to make ends meet at home, the unfortunate people who are living in single rooms in insanitary basements expect more from this Parliament than this cross-talk from the front benches of the House.  Let me say that the speech that was made by Deputy Lemass, in my view, was a very able one.  It was the sort of speech one would expect from a Deputy of the experience of Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass put his finger on all the problems that are worrying the people of the country.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass is anxious to make as much political capital as he can out of the situation.  That is perfectly natural.  It would be perfectly natural and right for the Government to make as much political capital as they could out of the reply to Deputy Lemass. But in my view that political capital could be made if there was a factual statement showing the work that had been done during the last ten months, the work that is planned and in preparation for the next 12 months. I say that would have been a statesmanlike reply, and would be calculated to appeal to the intelligent people of the country who are looking to us to do something to better the conditions that oppress them.  Those matters that have been mentioned of <Col N="1658" /> employment, housing, industry and, if I might add, the cost of living, are serious matters.  They are very serious in so far as Deputies like myself are concerned.  There are many Deputies on these benches who generally support the Government, who generally vote for the Government.  We have our reasons for that.  We can explain them and justify our action in so doing, but we are not taken into the confidence of the Government.</P>
    <P>We do not know what is proposed, what is planned or what we are to expect next.  Even as far as the ordinary business of this House is concerned, we hear what it is on the day we arrive in the Dáil at 3 o'clock. Consequently, as one Deputy who has a responsibility to my constituents, who is bound in the peculiar circumstances of politics in this country at the moment to give reasonable and fair opportunity to the Government, it is my duty to express in public and in the Dáil my criticism of the Government's failure to do the things we set out to do on the 18th February last. I am afraid that, for reasons peculiar to the construction of the Government, the Ministers of the Government are not so much part of a team as individuals working in water-tight compartments, interfering not at all with the work of the other Departments or Ministers.  To that extent each individual Minister has his own ideas as to how his own Department should be run and there is not that co-ordination of effort, co-ordination of policy, co-ordination of programme that is essential if we are to solve all those very serious problems which confront us.  The problems that confront the Government are serious ones requiring every possible co-ordination between the Ministers, requiring long and arduous planning.  I think that unless those problems are tackled in that way we are not going to see in any reasonable time the solution of the problems.</P>
    <P>By the time we come back here this Government will have been a year in office.  The normal lifetime of this Parliament is five years, and if the other four years go as quickly and in the same way as this present year has gone I am afraid that we will have <Col N="1659" /> very little to show for our efforts in the five years.  When I approach the problem in that way I am approaching it with the intention of being helpful to the Government.  I think I am more helpful to the Government by public criticism, and by expressing my own thoughts in public than I would be if I were to sit silent and pretend that everything the Government does is good, and that it is a hundred times better than anything the Fianna Fáil Party could do if they were in office. I want the Government and this House to accept my criticism in that spirit. I think it would be a good thing for our Parliamentary institutions if we would all face the problem in that way.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the serious conditions of housing.  I am one of the Deputies for the constituency of North-East Dublin in which housing conditions are appalling.  Deputy A. Byrne, if he participates in this debate, as I am sure he will, will bear me out in that, that housing conditions are appalling in the constituency of North-East Dublin.  Not only are they appalling in that constituency, but they are appalling in every other Dublin constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister certain questions yesterday based on a situation of which I was made aware only last week.  The week before last we met the sugar company to discuss the price of beet for the coming year. When we asked the sugar company for an increased price based on increased costs of production during the past 12 <Col N="1660" /> months, they stated that they could not give it for two reasons.  The first was that they would not be allowed to increase the price of sugar, and the second that raids had been made on their funds and the money taken from them which could be used for this purpose.</P>
      <P>One of my questions to the Minister asked if he would state the number of cwts. of sugar sold for jam-making to private applicants, for harvesting operations, to the condensed milk company, to caterers, hoteliers, etc. He answered two portions of that.  He told me that 215,584 cwts. of sugar were sold for jam-making to private individuals and 4,374 cwts. to farmers for harvesting, all at 7½d. per lb.  The other question I asked the Minister was if he would state the authority under which he collected from the sugar company the difference between the economic price of sugar and the price charged to manufacturers and other citizens for jam-making, harvesting, etc.</P>

      <P>No. 37 is not included.  The Deputy gave notice to raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 38 and 39 and the Ceann Comhairle allowed him to raise the subject matter of these two questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, if that is the line he is taking.  The Minister extracted 12/10 a cwt. from the sugar company for every cwt. of that sugar.  In plain words, he raided the funds of the sugar company, and for the sugar for jam-making and harvesting he took £144,000.  He stated that he was prepared to give me information as to the amount of sugar purchased by the Condensed Milk Company, which hit the farmers in two ways. The Condensed Milk Company were charged 7½d. per lb. for the sugar, which meant that the farmer had to get a smaller price for his milk.  Then the Minister came in and took the difference between 6¼d. and 7½d. per lb. and put it into the Exchequer.  That was <Col N="1661" /> a double crack at the agricultural community who are sending milk to the Condensed Milk Company.  I have not been given in these figures the amount of sugar sold to jam manufacturers, sweet manufacturers, and others.  I am certain, however, that the total collected by the Minister from the sugar company must have been in or around £500,000.  I asked him under what authority from this House he had collected this money.  He had no authority whatever.</P>
      <P>That is the condition of affairs under which we had to face the sugar company this year and endeavour to get from them the 14/6 increase in agricultural wages put on since the last contract, which amounts to 9/6 per ton on beet, the 5/- in the £ extra charged on our rates and probably 10/- in the £ more that will come, owing to the activities of various Ministers during the past five or six months. With all that burden we are faced with a blank wall, an empty cupboard and an order from the Minister that you cannot increase the price of sugar, or you will increase the cost of living on those poor fellows who got the £500,000 some time ago to help them to carry on with the increased cost of living. That is the position which between 60,000 and 70,000 farmers in the Beet Growers' Association have to face this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is in the Minister's mind in regard to this matter. Knowing him for a number of years, I would be very slow to think that he would prefer to see our sugar produced by niggers abroad and brought in here in the shape of sugar cane, rather than to see the beet produced here by Irish farmers at a fair price, and an insurance and protection for this country in case of war or emergency.  The people of this country were very glad to have four factories producing sugar during the last six or seven years, and the enormous amount of employment that beet growing gives.  Now we are told that we must grow it at last year's price.  We got so much money last year, according to the Government, that we can live on the fat until the good conditions and the new Government <Col N="1662" /> come back again to us.  I hope it will not be too long.</P>
    <P>Those are the conditions we are faced with, and I should like to know from the Minister his intentions with regard to this matter; what steps he is going to take to prevent the widespread unemployment that is going to ensue if we have only 20 or 25 per cent. of our beet contracts this year.  It is a serious problem.  The Minister has one of these factories in his constituency, and he knows the value of the employment given in this factory and the employment given by way of transport and everything else just as well as I do, and perhaps better.  I would be very slow to think that the Minister would deliberately endanger this great industry.  Any industry for which you get the raw material here from the land and which could produce sugar enough for our people right through the emergency is a great industry and a big industry.  The people of County Meath are thanking God they have gone back again to grass.  Stick to it and you are all right.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I raised this matter to-night on the Adjournment.  I do not agree for one moment with any Government, whether it was the previous Government or any other Government.  I question the right of any Government to step in and take money without the authority of this House.  That has been done.  Close on £500,000 was got out of the beet growers' pockets, the pockets of the unfortunate farmers.  It is time that ended.  At this moment agents are going around the country looking for beet contracts, asking people to grow it.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's attitude towards the beet industry?  What is his attitude towards those factories? Does he want them worked with Irish beet or worked with cane sugar produced by the niggers?  Does he realise that increased costings in labour alone would amount to 14/6 a week?  That is the burden that has been placed on the farmers.  They have also to bear increased rates to the amount of 4/- this year, and an extra 10/- will probably be imposed next March.  As regards freight charges, we do not <Col N="1663" /> know what these will be next year. Under these conditions, does the Minister consider it fair and just that farmers should be asked to produce beet at last year's price?  On the one hand, he will allow no increase in the price of sugar, and on the other hand he has left the cupboards bare.</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances in which I face this problem.  I face it as the representative of about 70,000 ordinary working farmers, the Minister's constituents as well as my own.  I want to see fair play for them.  I want fair play for every man working to produce beet, for that man has a horrible job, a nasty job, a job coming at the worst time of the year.  Surely in a position like that we are entitled, if this industry is to carry on, at least to the cost of production?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to be considered. Something like 18 months ago we entered into an agreement with the sugar company as regards costings. They agreed with the Beet Growers' Association to give a fair price&mdash;the cost of production plus a fair profit.  Unfortunately, we have from 350 to 400 farmers engaged in those costings and we will not know the result before the middle of next February. It will then be too late to fix a price.  But the sugar company are definitely bound by that agreement and they cannot get behind it.  When that claim is laid before the sugar company, as soon as the costings are found, then we are bound to get our price. But how can we get our price if we go to a bare cupboard and meet with a refusal to increase the price of sugar?</P>
    <P>I am not approaching this in any bitter spirit.  I appeal to the Minister not to wreck this industry, or allow it to be wrecked.  This industry has one of its principal factories in the Minister's constituency.  He knows what the result will be if there is a practical closing down of the signing of contracts and a reduction in the acreage&mdash;nobody knows it better.  I am concerned with the factory in Mallow and the workers in Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Kerry and Waterford who supply beet to the Mallow factory.  I know what the result will <Col N="1664" /> be if the Government persist in their attitude towards the industry.</P>
    <P>The last idea in my head would be to take an unfair advantage of anybody. I am faced here with a grave problem; I am faced with the problem of four factories which have given employment to thousands during past years.  You need not go abroad for your raw material.  These are factories producing an essential commodity, and I hope the Minister will not stand up here and tell us that last year's price should be good enough.  I am sure he is not going to do that.  We have had an increased cost of production between one year and another.  We are faced now with an increase of 9/6 in labour alone, with another 1/6 added to that for freight, and possibly a couple of shillings extra for increased freight charges when this man of all trades from England tells us what is wrong with our transport system.</P>
    <P>When we come down to bedrock on this matter, we are faced with this attitude: &ldquo;Take last year's price; you are not going to get any more.&rdquo; You will find there are only two outlets by which the increased price could be paid.  The first is a rise in the price of sugar, and the second is the amount that went to the Exchequer through the increased charge on sugar to a lot of people, namely, the people who got sugar for jam, and the farmers who got sugar for harvesting.  These people were charged 7½d. per lb. for the sugar.  That 7½d. in the shape of 12s. 10d. a cwt. was taken out of the sugar company's fund by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was, of course, setting up skittles for the pleasure of knocking them down.  He said he was told by the sugar company that we raided their funds and took them away.  I do not believe that statement was made by the sugar company to the Deputy or anybody else and, even if it were, it is not true.  The Deputy appeals to me not to wreck this industry.  There is no fear of my wrecking this industry.  There is no fear of the Government wrecking this industry, but it may be wrecked by <Col N="1665" /> people who are trying to sow dissatisfaction in the minds of the beet growers, who are trying to dissuade them not to sign contracts by twisting and distorting the facts.  These are the people and the only people who will wreck the industry.</P>
      <P>As for the Deputy's cheap jibe about freight, and his very unworthy references to a very distinguished Irishman who gladly undertook this very important work for the people of this country, I shall say nothing at the moment.  There will be another day for dealing with that, but I may tell the Deputy that if something had not been done there would be no question of freight, there would be no way of carrying the crop when it was ready for transport.  I may tell the Deputy further that if this Government within the past fortnight had not made money available out of the Exchequer to the transport company there would not be a lorry, a wagon or a train running to-day.  I do not blame the Deputy for fighting for the best price he can get for the beet growers.  He is perfectly entitled to do that.  Not only is he perfectly entitled, but as chairman of the Beet Growers' Association, it is his duty to do it.  I should be the last person in the world to blame the Deputy for doing that, but the Deputy is not going to be allowed to get up in this House and make a completely false case about the whole situation. The Deputy knows quite well that we did not take any money away from the sugar company.  He knows also that whatever money was realised by the sale of sugar at 7½d. a lb. that money is going into the Exchequer to the relief of the very heavy subsidy which the State and the taxpayer are paying to keep this industry alive.  The fact of the matter is that every lb. of sugar manufactured in this country is subsidised out of State funds to the tune of 2¼d. a lb.</P>

      <P>I am stating the facts and the Deputy will get his opportunity later.  I want to say further that the people and the farmers who wanted to get sugar for home jam-making <Col N="1666" /> were clamouring for it and were very glad to get it at 7½d. a lb. Whatever money was made on the sale of that sugar went to the relief of the enormous subsidy that has been and is being paid on sugar.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not done too badly, mind you.  I make a present of this to the Deputy and to his colleagues to make any political capital they like out of it.  I say that 88/- on the present percentage basis is not a bad price.  I say that publicly and I know the statement will be used and distorted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by me.  You know that costs of production in wages have gone up since the price was fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer in this country does not depend entirely and exclusively on the production of beet and when a demand is made for an increase in the price of beet to meet an increase in the price of wages, it is almost inevitable that on the following day if that demand be granted there will be a demand by the farmer for an increase in the price of wheat and the next day for an increase in the price of something else.  I know farmers' costs have gone up.  I know also&mdash;and far be it from me to grudge it to him; it is about time he got a break&mdash;that the farmer is doing pretty well at the moment, at least as well, if not better, than any other section of the community.  I am not saying that farmers are not entitled to that but let us remember that in this instance we are dealing with an essential commodity and let us not try to force the farmers of the country not to do their duty.  I believe that the farmers if they are not discouraged, if they are encouraged, will sign the contracts and I would appeal to every decent farmer to sign his contract and to produce beet.  I believe farmers will do that. I believe that the vast bulk of farmers are not dissatisfied with the prices. Naturally they would like to get more. I never met an individual yet selling <Col N="1667" /> any commodity or any kind of merchandise who would not like to get more for it than he was getting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that if the result of the costings shows that the farmer is not getting the cost of production plus a fair profit, he will step in and allow the farmer a price which will give him these costs?  If the Minister does that it will help the farmers to sign their contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no power or authority to give any such undertaking.  I know the Deputy is interested in the industry.  If he were not he would not be chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That probably does not reduce the Deputy's interest in it. I am also interested in this industry, and I believe every member of the House is.  Nobody wants the farmer to be forced into the position of producing beet or anything at a loss.  I believe the farmer is entitled to a reasonable return for his labour and on the investment of his capital, but in times like these we have to try to meet people fairly and evenly, and Deputies know as well as I do that there are enormous subsidies not only on sugar, but on tea, bread and other items.  For a long period during the harvest I provided additional flour and <Col N="1668" /> additional bread for the agricultural community, and the consumption went up by no less than 8,000 sacks per week, every sack of which cost the taxpayer £3 in subsidy.  That meant a total of £24,000.</P>

      <P>If the farmer's family did not eat it or if they preferred to give it to the dogs or pigs, that is something which I cannot check but I am telling the Deputy that, at the request of farmers' organisations and of the Department of Agriculture, I made that additional flour available. The consumption went up by 8,000 sacks per week at a cost of £3 per sack to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state what are the average percentages of petrol allocated to (1) agriculture, including tillage and threshing contractors; (2) private motoring, including tourism; (3) business and industrial purposes (a) affecting production and <Col N="1532" /> distribution of foodstuffs, (b) hackneys, taxis, private lorries, (c) airway companies, (d) other business and industrial uses, and (4) other purposes, falling under none of these headings, e.g., public transport; Government; Diplomatic Corps; local authorities, Garda Síochána and military.</P>

      <P>I regret that it is not possible to furnish the information under the headings mentioned in the Deputy's question as the statistics are not kept under such headings and the time and expense involved in extracting the information would not be justified. The records available show that petrol supplies are allocated on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Agricultural tractors and machinery, 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>(b)  Basic allowances for private motor cars and tourists' allowances, 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in order to avoid any interruption in farm work during the busy season, he will take steps to ensure that owners of tractors used for agricultural purposes can store supplies of petrol and tractor fuel against any temporary stoppage of distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Petrol licences are issued on application to the owners of tractors which require petrol for operation. As regards tractors operating on vaporising oil, arrangements have been made for the issue of open permits authorising the purchase of such oil as and when required by tractor owners who may, if they wish, use the permit for the purchase of supplies for storage purposes.  Owing to the limitation on supplies of petrol and the consequent necessity to maintain strict control over its user, it has not been the practice to issue petrol to be kept as reserve by any person.  As I do not anticipate any hold-up in supplies I see no reason for altering this practice.</P>
