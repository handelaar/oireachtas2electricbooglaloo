      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given in this House to a similar question addressed to my predecessor on the 18th October, 1944, to the effect that this matter had been considered on more than one occasion by the then Government and that it had been decided to adhere to the arrangement which has been followed in the past of commemorating the Rising of 1916 at Easter each year.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to depart from the decision of the last Government on this matter.</P>

      <P>Figures which would enable the proportion to be calculated in the <Col N="1666" /> form in which the Deputy seeks the information are not available.  A comparison, however, of the total weekly payments of unemployment assistance made in each of the years 1945, 1946 and 1947 with the total number of weeks for which payment of unemployment assistance was refused on the ground that applicants were not genuinely seeking work, shows that the percentage of weeks for which unemployment assistance was refused was .65 of 1 per cent. in 1945; .75 of 1 per cent. in 1946, and .74 of 1 per cent. in 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that some persons entitled to receive children's allowances have not received certain of the allowances by reason of their failure to make application within the prescribed time, and, if so, whether he will have such of these cases as are brought to his notice examined and have legislation introduced to enable such persons to receive payment of the allowances which they would have received if they had made application within the prescribed time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to act as the Deputy suggests it would mean that a person who fulfilled the conditions laid down in the Children's Allowances Acts and in the regulations made thereunder, but who failed to make any claim for an allowance for a considerable period after he had first become qualified to do so, would be paid the allowance from the date on which he fulfilled the conditions.  I think it will be agreed that it is not an unreasonable condition for the receipt of an allowance that a claim for the allowance should first be made and that some time limit should be imposed.  My Department gives every help to enable claims to be made at the earliest date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add, however, that <Col N="1668" /> the existing provisions in regard to time limits are now under review, but I am not in a position at this stage to state what legislative changes, if any, will be considered desirable.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made into this matter and on consideration I can find no reason to alter the decision communicated to the National Film Institute on February 9th last.</P>
      <P>The Department is fully alive to the importance of films in education as is evidenced by the fact that the National Film Institute's Summer Courses for 1946 and 1947 were approved and that the Summer Course for 1948 is also being accepted.  Special leave with pay is accorded to all teachers who attend regularly at approved courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday night I said that the Budget does not show any sign of an attempt to solve unemployment, to stem emigration or to expand the agricultural or manufacturing industries and that the economies effected were hitting the poorer sections of the people hardest.  Immediately before the adjournment of the debate, I was referring to a statement by Deputy Dunne.  Deputy Dunne in the course of the debate referred to a statement by the Minister for Finance regarding standstill Orders and said that he believes the Minister did not mean standstill Orders as far as employees were concerned, that they were meant for people who were charging excessive prices.  As far as the workers of rural Ireland are concerned, Deputy Dunne need have no fear that it will be necessary for the Minister for Finance to impose any standstill Orders because that has been very effectively done by the Minister for Agriculture.  He is achieving the same purpose without any statutory Orders or enactments. The Minister for Agriculture is a man of modern ideas, who does not believe <Col N="1692" /> in having six men to do the job that one man and a machine are capable of doing.  That policy will solve many of the problems that affect the people for whom Deputy Dunne speaks.  As far as the agriculturists are concerned, the statement of the Minister for Agriculture is very ominous because it means that they will get no guarantee that the home market will be reserved for their produce.  If within the next year or two they are not capable of producing the same volume as is produced in other countries where agriculture is mechanised, they need not expect any further protection or guarantee.  As far as I can judge from the pronouncements of the Minister for Agriculture of late, the policy seems to be to go back to grass land as speedily as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>His idea is that our agriculture should be based on the production of store cattle for Britain.  If we revert to that policy, as I have said, it will solve many of the problems which I am sure Deputy Dunne had in mind.  There has been a statement to the effect that compulsory tillage will not apply after this year.  I admit that it was proposed, if Fianna Fáil were returned, to have a modfication, but, even from a grass management point of view, I do not think it is good policy, without going any further, because a number of farmers who at all times were opposed to tillage, will now procure their requirements of grass seed from the seed merchant and have it sown and have their land laid down.  In my opinion such laying down is not a good method.  It would be much better if they were required to till at least a quarter, instead of three-eighths, of their land.  In that way they would be almost compelled&mdash;and it might be no harm&mdash;to sow a root crop or a green crop the next year, so as to have their land in a fit condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that I am <Col N="1693" /> dealing with the Budget as it relates to the policy of the Government, and I assure you that I do not intend to digress.  As far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, I do not see any signs of this great expansion in industry we were told about. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes a statement, I am sure that he is inclined to put it into operation.  When it was decided to discontinue the hand-won turf industry the Minister stated that those persons engaged in producing hand-won turf, provided they produced it of a good quality and at a competitive price, would be assured of a market.  That has not happened.  Some people did follow his advice and produced turf of good quality and secured a market for it; but when they made application to his Department&mdash;some of them had private lorries of their own&mdash;for a supplementary allowance of petrol to deliver the turf, they were refused. That was a great mistake.  It is one thing to abolish the hand-won turf industry, but to have that kind of thing going on as well makes the matter much worse.</P>
      <P>All these things show that, instead of this Budget indicating a progressive policy, it is in the main a &ldquo;take it easy and do nothing&rdquo; policy.  In that case, I do not see why we on this side of the House should let it pass without division, and I intend to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been discussed already in all its aspects and I do not want to repeat what has been said.  I think the Budget is a good one and one which the people did not think possible&mdash; having regard to the legacy of commitments <Col N="1694" /> that were passed on to the present Administration by their predecessors. The Budget has increased taxation and at the same time it has increased social services.  Because it has done that, I regard it as a good Budget.  Several suggestions have been made by the Deputies who were in the Government in the past, that you can avoid this taxation and that there is one small section of the community that you can tax to give that money.  In the year 1948 there is no such section and if you apply taxation everybody in the country will have to provide it.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism about asking the hotels to pay the economic price for tea, sugar and butter.  Anyone who likes to go into a hotel and see them charging 15/- or 25/- for bed and breakfast, or 14 guineas a week or something higher in the peak of the season, will have absolutely no sympathy with such criticism.  Neither can they ask the ordinary consumer that they are weeping about to subsidise those people who are charging fairly economic prices, at any rate&mdash;I put it mildly&mdash; for the services they are giving.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of tears about the shortwave station.  Personally, I am delighted that we have not a shortwave station to broadcast our programmes throughout the world.  I am probably a bit of a radio fan myself and I have listened to the programmes from Radio Éireann and I would hate that those atrocious programmes should be broadcast to the ends of the earth. I can understand the annoyance of the Deputies opposite in not having this shortwave station.  They probably wanted it for a propaganda purpose&mdash; whether it was an Irish propaganda purpose or a Party propaganda purpose I do not know, but I know that, not so long ago, the literary editor of the political organ of the Party opposite was able to go to the B.B.C. Third Programme and broadcast a eulogy of one political leader and make innuendoes about other Parties and the Leaders of other Parties in the Dáil. If that is what the shortwave station was required for, I am very glad it did not materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the tax on petrol as it applies to the Ferguson tractors.  There are about 15,000 of these Ferguson tractors in the country and they are operated on petrol.  There is now a tax of 1/2 on every gallon they use. The Minister for Agriculture has assured us that he is not going to do anything which would hamper agricultural production.  This tax of 1/2 a gallon on petrol for these very efficient machines is a definite tax on production and will hamper production.</P>
    <P>In regard to entertainment duties, I note that there are certain theatres in Dublin known as patent theatres which are getting relief in taxation if they have certain live shows.  In Cork we have a theatre in which it is intended to produce a very real and genuine variety show.  Already they have advertised. They are prepared to appoint a permanent orchestra of from ten to 12 members in addition to employing various acts from week to week.  If these people should not be allowed to have the benefit of the concession which the patent theatres in Dublin will enjoy it will mean that we will not have that live show in Cork.  The fact of having a permanent orchestra of about 12 musicians would be a definite advantage to the City and County of Cork. I do not understand the legalities of this matter.  I do not know whether a theatre that is not at the moment a patent theatre can become one and I do not know if it is a very expensive process to become a patent theatre.  I think, however, that the Minister should have a little regard to this particular theatre in Cork which is really genuine and which would give considerable employment.  It would also be of assistance in various ways in advancing culture and music by having about 12 musicians permanently employed.  These people would be able to give tuitions, and so forth, in their spare time.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk on the subject of farmers' butter.  I do not intend to say anything in that regard except to point out to the Minister that in certain areas attempts have been made by certain individuals to buy butter at less than its value and to <Col N="1696" /> sell it at its actual value.  I would like to ask the appropriate authorities to ensure that the producer is not exploited.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Minister and to say that I believe, from my observations throughout the country, that the country is behind him in his Budget and that it is something better than they expected.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has many gifts and among them that of a biting wit.  I have no doubt that those who came to hear this first Budget speech thought they were going to listen to an oration of sparkling brilliancy such as sometimes characterised utterances from the Opposition Bench and which, while they may have hurt, very often amused those against whom they were directed.  If these people came with that idea in their minds on that occasion they must have been bitterly <Col N="1697" /> disappointed, because the wit was missing: the fluency was missing, and we had a shameful Budget introduced in a most shameful way.  Perhaps they had something to admire about the Minister for Finance in that he was ashamed of this Budget, which is a concrete expression of the fundamental dishonesties upon which the present popular front Government is based.  I notice Deputy Davin perking up and taking notice.  That expression has been deliberately chosen.  This is a popular front Government of which the keystone that holds the whole edifice together is a Party which is led by a man who is an avowed Communist and who has in his Party associated with him others who have been trained as he has been trained and who have adopted as he has adopted the Marxian philosophy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that this Budget is a complete expression of the fundamental dishonesties upon which this popular front Government is based, and the Government which has produced this Budget is like all governments so constituted&mdash;highly lacking, wholly lacking one might say, in that spirit of loyalty and acceptance of principle which will hold a government composed of men who have the same ideas and opinions together despite political vicissitude.  The members of the Party opposite, and I make no distinction between any one component of this popular front Administration than another, when they became aware of the fact that certain proposals in this Budget would be subject to searching criticism&mdash;particularly from those deluded voters who had voted, say, for Deputy Davin and Deputy Hickey in the expectation that if they were returned to Dáil Éireann they would make the interests of the poor their concern&mdash;when it dawned upon them that one of the things which this Budget is going to do is to increase the cost of the staple food to the poor and to impose additional taxation upon the 600,000 workers in this country, immediately began to say, &ldquo;Oh, if we had our way this Budget, in many respects, would be substantially different.&rdquo; They are having their way now. This is as much the Budget of Deputy Davin, Deputy Larkin, Deputy Connolly, Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Hickey and Deputy Dan Spring as it is of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, and of any one member of the Party which was formerly known as the Fine Gael Party.  It is yours as much as theirs and everything in it, whether it appeals to your former supporters or not, is something for which you carry responsibility.  Your groups or your sections are represented in that Government.  Clann na Poblachta is represented there by the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health.  The International Labour Party is represented there by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Local Government.  The Party that used to be in existence in this country under the title of the National Labour Party, now disowned by the <Col N="1699" /> men who brought it into existence, is represented in that Cabinet by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>This Budget is an expression and a manifestation of the collective policy of the Government.  It is not the Budget only of the Taoiseach, or of the Minister for Finance, or of the Minister for Justice, or of the egregious Minister for Agriculture.  It is the Budget of the group which was once called Clann na Poblachta.  It is the Budget of the group which was once known as the International Labour Party.  It is the Budget of the group which was once known as the National Labour Party.  It is the Budget of the group which was once known as Clann na Talmhan.  There is not a thing in that Budget which, if your representatives in the Government had objected to it, would be in it to-day.  If, for instance, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Deputy Everett) had objected to the proposal to stop the mineral exploration in East and West Wicklow, in East and West Avoca, to be precise, that would not be in it; that proposal would not be accepted in the Government and the Minister for Finance would not have been able to terminate that policy and to abolish the employment which the carrying out of that policy would have given.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget speech, said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>he must have said it with the full assent, authority and endorsement of the Minister for Social Welfare, of the Minister for Local Government, of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, of the Minister for External Affairs, and of the Minister for Health.  If that were not their opinion as well as his, they would surely have dissented from that statement; they would have made <Col N="1700" /> it clear, when the lines of the Budget speech were being discussed, that they would not stand over that statement and would not back it, and therefore the statement would not have been made.</P>
    <P>In the light of what is happening to-day, let me recite again that significant passage from the speech of the Minister for Finance to the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House can take pride in some of the reasons enumerated by the Minister for Finance for now telling the House that they can go no further, because every one of the measures of social amelioration, every one of the measures of social progress to which the Minister for Finance referred was a measure introduced and passed by a Fianna Fáil Government when it had an over-all majority in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Acts securing to the workers paid holidays were passed between 1933 and 1937.  The measure giving them children's allowances was passed in Dáil Éireann in 1944.  The Widows and Orphans Act was introduced in 1935.  The Unemployment Assistance Acts were passed in 1933.  There is not a social advance that has been made during the past 12 years that was not made under a Fianna Fáil Government and, let me repeat it again, a Government which had an over-all majority in this House and was independent of the International Labour Party, completely independent of them.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the position in which we are to-day.  Here we have a group which forms part of what was called the Labour Party.  Here we have a group in which there are no less than two Labour Parties, each of which used to be up against the other competing high for popular support from the workers.  They are now sitting around <Col N="1701" /> the one Cabinet table and they are discussing the future attitude of the Government towards the workers of the country.  What have they decided is going to be their attitude?  It was expressed by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice...&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Clann na Poblachta was the Party which, of all others, laid the greatest emphasis upon the need to develop our natural resources.  They had a vast far-reaching programme including, I think, no less than the planting of 3,000,000 acres or more per annum.  These schemes were to include the planting of from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 acres of non-arable land under trees.  This was to the electors of Dublin South-East, if you please.  They proposed, as I have said, to utilise our natural resources to the fullest in order to provide employment here for the people whose emigration they were bemoaning and bewailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this Budget propose to do, and what does this Government propose to do?  This Government, with no less than two representatives of what was once the Clann na Poblachta Party as powerful Ministers sitting in the Cabinet, the first thing that it proposes to do is to terminate the programme of mineral exploration which had been drawn up and to carry out which provision was made in the Estimates which were prepared by the last Government for submission to Dáil Éireann.  I do not know whether the members of Clann na Poblachta are sufficiently interested to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give them a copy of the report which was prepared and submitted to the Government in November of 1947 in relation to the mineral wealth of the district east and west of Avoca.  That report was prepared by the president of the <Col N="1704" /> Mining Metallurgic Institution, by a man who is most eminent in his profession as a mining geologist, and, having made a thorough survey of the district, he pointed out that there was a vast mineralised delta there, constituting a vast mass of ore east to west of Avoca which he definitely stated in his belief might prove to be one of the richest mineral deposits in Western Europe, and urged that it should be systematically and scientifically explored.</P>
    <P>Provision had been made to initiate and start that work this year.  The Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;this extravagant Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;had proposed to start that programme this year.  The greater part of the money which was going to be spent this year would have been spent in providing employment.  Some part of it, undoubtedly, would have to be expended in procuring capital equipment.  A programme of exploration which would ultimately, perhaps, cost a couple of hundred thousand pounds was to be embarked upon.  No person could say, naturally, whether the results of that exploration would fulfil our expectations, but a man whose word and opinion should carry great weight, because of his eminence in his profession, had given it as his opinion that the undertaking was well worth while, and that he would be grievously surprised and disappointed if the results did not come up to his expectations and did not show that we have here in Wicklow one of the most extensive ore bodies in Western Europe.  Undoubtedly, the ore would not have been of a highgrade order, but it would be an ore which could be profitably exploited and profitably utilised by modern methods of mining and extraction.  If the results of this exploration were to be as favourable as this expert stated in his opinion they would be, employment would have been provided in West Wicklow not for 200 or 300 men but for 2,000 or 3,000 men.</P>
    <P>That programme has been abandoned, and it has been abandoned with the consent and with the authority of that Deputy for Wicklow who is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and with the support of that other Deputy <Col N="1705" /> for Wicklow who professes to be an Independent but who has always voted for Fine Gael in the past and who is voting for them and supporting them to-day.  That is the first failure on the part of Clann na Poblachta and of the Labour Party to give effect to their election pledges.  Let the House remember this, that they could quite easily have said to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;We are not going to stand for this throttling of national development; we are not going to permit you, because you want to save £30,000 or £50,000 in this year and to brag and boast of your economies: we are not going to allow you to shut down on this great mining venture; we insist that, whatever else you may do, this scheme must go ahead&rdquo;, and if it is suspended to-day and is not going ahead, let there be no doubt about it it is due to the fact that two out of the three Deputies for Wicklow have accepted the suspension and, indeed, are recommending it here to the House and are prepared to support it by their votes when a vote is taken on this General Resolution.</P>
    <P>Another area due for exploration was the Slievardagh area in Tipperary.  We had been told all during the emergency that if the people had not coal it was because of the indolence or want of enterprise of the Fianna Fáil Government. We had secured a report on the Slievardagh mining field in 1937 or 1938, and if it had not been for the outbreak of the war the exploration of that mining field would have been immediately undertaken.  It would have been a costly and expensive business perhaps but it would have been undertaken because plant would have been available.  It was always the aim of Fianna Fáil, whenever they had to provide money for employment schemes, to try to utilise that money in the initiation and execution of reproductive works.  Well, during the war, we had to do the best we could with the equipment which was available to us and with the mining skill which was at our disposal.  We had to start in during the war and try to open up Slievardagh without equipment, without mining plant and indeed without mining advice or mining skill, but when the war was over we had <Col N="1706" /> promised ourselves that one of the first things we were going to do was to have a thorough investigation of the Slievardagh coalfield.  The money for that investigation had been provided in this year's Estimates, and if it were not for the fact that the present Government have decided to close down on that exploration, the Slievardagh exploration would have gone ahead and a great deal of employment would have been given in the Slievardagh district. Many people, who now possibly will have to emigrate, would have been kept at home.  They are going out; they are going out now because the Minister for Finance wants economies to the tune of £85,000 in a Budget which covers £75,000,000 or £76,000,000. For the sake of saving £85,000, the exploration scheme is to be shut down; the works at Slievardagh are to be discontinued; the mining skill which we had built up is to be dissipated.  All that is to be done with the support in this House of two Tipperary Deputies who were returned on the Clann na Poblachta ticket; of course, with the support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who sits for Tipperary as well, and with the support&mdash;I almost forgot it but let me not leave him out &mdash;the support of the Minister for Education, who is also a Tipperary Deputy.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very poor return to the voters who supported the elements which constitute this popular front Government, the voters of Tipperary who returned no less than four members here to help to keep in office the Minister for Finance, who refuses in a Budget of £77,000,000 to provide £50,000 to continue and carry on the Slievardagh exploration work.  And, mind you&mdash;let the Deputies in this House not forget it because the electors in Tipperary are not going to be allowed to forget it&mdash;he could not do that without the votes of Deputy Kinane and Deputy Timoney or without the support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Education, both of whom hold seats in Tipperary.  So much for mineral exploration.</P>
    <P>Let me then direct the attention of the House to a transaction which has taken place recently with a great <Col N="1707" /> flourish of trumpets on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I refer to the sabotage of the transatlantic air service.  Clann na Poblachta, let me remind the House again, put in the forefront of its programme the policy of developing our national resources.  The big natural resource we have, although it has not yet dawned upon Deputies who are supporting the popular front Government, happens to be, in this age of aerial development, our geographical situation.  As the American air lines were advertising up and down America and throughout the cities of Europe, Rineanna and the Shannon represent the aerial crossroads of the world.  We were there at that crossroads, to which air liners from practically every European country and from the United States of America were flying.  We represented the first landfall that the aerial navigator would make after he had flown the broad Atlantic.  Our position was unique in that regard.  We set out to develop it, not concealing from ourselves nor from the public the difficulties and, if you like, the commercial risks which that attempt to establish ourselves as a country owning its own air lines and maintaining an air service across the Atlantic would involve.  We knew that the initial outlay was going to be great.  We knew that for the first year or two we might have to submit to heavy losses, as the American companies who are now flying the Atlantic and making a profit, in the development stages of their operations had to face losses.</P>

      <P>As I say, we did not attempt to conceal the difficulties or the risks involved from the people and least of all from ourselves.  We knew it would be misrepresented just as our attempt to develop the turf industry had been misrepresented.  We knew that it would be misrepresented just as was our desire to establish a position whereby we could greet our neighbours and fellow-countrymen on the other side of the Border, if they decided to throw their lot in with us without asking them to forgo any of their traditional attachments and without asking us to forgo our traditional policy in regard to our Constitutional position.  There were a considerable number of enterprises which Fianna Fáil had undertaken in which difficulties of a similar character were involved and which we hid neither from the public nor from ourselves.  Most of all that was so in the case of the transatlantic air service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts that have emerged about that air service in the course of the past week or ten days?  We were told that this was a wantonly extravagant enterprise initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government.  In reply to a series of questions put down by Deputy Lehane, to whom the members of this Party and the general public owe a certain gratitude for eliciting answers which he did not expect, we were told that the total expenditure on Aer Línte, including the purchase of aircraft, the acquisition of premises, the training of staff, preliminary advertising and preliminary organisation expenses, amounted to £1,598,000 &mdash;not a very heavy expenditure when you relate it to the cost of developing the Shannon scheme in its initial stages, a scheme which did not even pay interest on the money advanced until the year 1933.  The sum of £1,598,000 was less than one-third of the capital cost of the Shannon scheme in its initial stages, again, let me <Col N="1709" /> repeat, a scheme which did not pay from the year 1926 until the year 1933 not one penny piece in interest on the advances made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What emerged?  Of this expenditure of £1,598,000, £504,000 was spent on the training of staff and preliminary expenses, leaving assets, including aircraft, premises, auxiliary craft and equipment, of £1,094,000. After all, all the assets were not realisable, very much to the disappointment of the Minister.  This then was the condition of the undertaking: capital investment, £1,598,000, which included an expenditure of £504,000 upon the training of staff, on the training, I assume, of pilots, navigators, members of crews, members of the ground staffs and members of the various technical staffs.  That sum of £504,000 was spent on giving Irishmen new skill, new technique, new ability to earn money for themselves and for their country.</P>
      <P>The amount which was expended in tangible assets was £1,094,000.  What was the estimated net loss on the first year's working of this concern, with a capital of £1,600,000, in round figures? The estimated net loss on the first year's working was £163,000&mdash;less than ten per cent. of the total capital invested, of which £504,000 represented expenditure upon the training and equipment of Irishmen to earn a living for themselves and an income for their country.  These Irishmen are now told to get to hell out of this.  They are not even given the option of going to Connaught.  They can go to Pakistan, to South Africa, to Great Britain.  They can fly the Constellations, which were to carry the Irish flag across the Atlantic, across the Pacific carrying the Union Jack, and convert a deficit for the British air lines working the Pacific routes into a profit.</P>

      <P>But this country, with a Budget of £77,000,000, could not afford to risk&mdash;because that is all it was&mdash;£163,000 in giving that undertaking a fair trial.  We had to come in here and sabotage it&mdash;at least, the Minister for Finance in the popular front Government had to sabotage it. The only reason for its sabotage was that it was a standing exemplification to the people of this country of the fact that they had been governed from 1932 until February, 1948, by a Government composed of men of vision and enterprise, of energy and courage.  Our successors were afraid to let that stand as a tribute to us, so they decided, as I have told the House, to sabotage it.</P>
      <P>But what has now emerged with regard to this undertaking which they told the people was rashly initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government?  The Constellations which were bought at a cost of something less than £1,094,000 have now been sold and for no less a sum than £1,575,000.  A surplus has been realised on the sale of these aircraft, on a portion only of the realisable assets of this concern, which, let me repeat, has been sabotaged by this popular front Government, perhaps because some of these gentlemen do not want to have a trained corps of aviators in this country in face of possible eventualities.  In respect of this airline which has been sabotaged, a surplus of £481,000 has been realised on the sale of the Constellations, so that the mere appreciation in the value of some of the assets of Aer Línte, the company which is now being wound-up, would have met the estimated net loss on the first year's working no less than three times over.  And they call themselves a business Government and that decision is being supported here by Deputies who would profess to be business men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come now to what I think is the most shameful proposal in this Budget.  The Minister for Finance has two proposals affecting the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme in his Budget.  I will only glance at one of them in passing and will devote more attention to the other.  The House is well aware that every year during the emergency cash supplements were provided to augment the benefits drawn by beneficiaries under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts. There are about 600,000 people covered by these various social services.  The Minister proposes to save, he has told the House, £900,000 in respect of these cash supplements, an economy consisting in this, in transferring from the Exchequer to the backs of the contributors to the scheme the cost of these cash supplements&mdash;and the Minister calls that an economy! Undoubtedly, it is an economy for the Exchequer, but is it an economy for the persons who are members of these various insurance schemes who will have to meet out of their own pockets the cost of these cash supplements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been very chary about telling the House exactly what this will mean in the way of an increased contribution, but, as he proposes in a full year to save £900,000, and as there are, in very round figures, about 600,000 people covered by these schemes in one form or another, it is easy to see that henceforward the contributors to these schemes will have to pay on an average 30/- per annum per head for the benefits they formerly received free, gratis and for nothing, out of the general fund of the Exchequer, and&mdash;let me remind the House again&mdash;Deputy Davin, Deputy Keyes, Deputy McAuliffe and a number of other Deputies who are getting a <Col N="1712" /> little frayed about this, as well as afraid, are going to vote for that when they vote for the General Resolution in connection with the Budget.  Make no mistake about it, they are voting for an increase in the contribution of the average person covered by these social insurance schemes of not less than 30/- per year.</P>
    <P>A person might vote for that if he were going to get something for it, but what will the people get in exchange for this 30/-?  They will not get a penny piece more.  The cash supplements are being provided out of the general pool of taxation and all that is being done is transferring from the community as a whole to the particular class or section compelled by law to be in these schemes&mdash;they do not contribute voluntarily; they are compelled to make these contributions, which are in the nature of a tax&mdash;this sum of £900,000&mdash;transferring it from the general taxpayer to the particular section, the workers, for whom Deputy Davin and the members of the International and National Labour Party, as it used to be called, profess to speak in this House.  What will these people get in exchange?  Let me ask that question again.  They will get in exchange the doubtful pleasure of licking an additional stamp.  That is not the way in which those who are contributing to the widows' and orphans' pension scheme will be affected by this Budget.  There is an even more shameful proposal than that.  Deputies, no doubt, are aware that the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme consists of two parts.  There is a contributory and there is a non-contributory scheme. Those who secure non-contributory pensions secure them on the ground that they are in such necessitous circumstances that the State must make some provision for them.  Those who are qualified for contributory pensions secure them as a matter of right in virtue of the contributions which their deceased husbands paid during their working lives into the pensions investment fund.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the position in relation to non-contributory pensions?  I will give the House some figures.  I shall give those figures rather rapidly, <Col N="1713" /> because I am anxious to pass on to something else.  On the 31st March, 1948, the first year in which the non-contributory pensions scheme may be said to have got properly under way, the total cost of the non-contributory pensions amounted to £387,670.  If we add for the administration of that scheme a sum of £50,000 we see that the total cost of the non-contributory pensions and of administering the non-contributory pensions scheme&mdash;which is the more expensive one to administer&mdash;was £437,000.  To meet that cost the Exchequer contributed the £450,000.  The Fianna Fáil Government, without the support of Deputy Davin, independent of the support of the present Minister for Social Welfare, independent of the support of the present Minister for Local Government, independent of the support of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and, of course, independent of the support of the present Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health, who were not in the House at all, contributed towards the cost of this non-contributory scheme and bound itself by law to contribute £450,000 every year for at least eight years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 31st March, 1943, the cost of the non-contributory pensions was £419,000 and the cost of the administration may be taken to be about £55,000. In that year, therefore, the total cost of the non-contributory side of the scheme was £474,000 so that there was a deficit of £24,000 in that particular year.  But that deficit was going to even itself out.  In the earlier years there had been a surplus and, as the number of contributory pensions mounted so to speak to a maximum and <Col N="1715" /> then began to decline, a deficit accrued on the non-contributory side of the scheme; but, as the non-contributory pensions began to decline, then a surplus would again begin to manifest itself upon the non-contributory side of the scheme.  Both surpluses and deficits would ultimately even themselves out without any cost to the contributory side of the scheme.</P>
    <P>For the year ending 31st March, 1946 &mdash;I can only take the actuary's estimate here&mdash;the cost of the pensions was £402,000 and the cost of administration £55,000.  For the year ending 31st March, 1956, however the actuary estimated that the cost of the scheme would be £374,000 and the cost of administration was taken at £60,000. There would in that year be a surplus because the subvention to the Exchequer would exceed the total cost of the scheme in that year by £16,000.  In the year 1961 the figures would be, estimated cost of pensions £337,000 and estimated cost of administration £60,000 leaving a substantial surplus of about £53,000 on the subvention which would go&mdash;mark this!&mdash;and would only go to wipe out the deficits on the non-contributory scheme accruing in the years 1943 to 1948.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the position in relation to the contributories&mdash;the people who are compelled by law, the people who are taxed, the workers who are taxed in order to provide pensions for their widows and for their children?  For the year ending 31st March, 1938, the total cost of the contributory pensions was only £76,000, but the contribution income was £582,000.  A surplus was left for investment in the pensions investment fund of £505,000.  For the year ending 31st March, 1943, the total cost of the contributory pensions was £297,000 and the contribution income £606,000, leaving a surplus for investment&mdash;which belonged to the contributories to the scheme&mdash;of £308,203.  For the year ending 31st March, 1946, the cost of the contributory pensions had gone up to £408,000 and the contribution income was £615,000; the surplus for investment had declined to £207,000.</P>
    <P>We have now to talk about the future.  The actuary estimated that, <Col N="1716" /> on the 31st March, 1951, the total cost of the contributory pensions would be £550,000; the income from contributions would remain fairly constant at £610,000; and the surplus for investment would have fallen to £60,000. What was going to be the position in the year ending 31st March, 1956?  The cost of the contributory pensions would have gone up to £646,000.  The contribution income would have declined to £605,000 and the surplus for investment would have disappeared.  Instead of a surplus there would be a net draw on the pensions investment fund of £42,000.  For the year ending 31st March, 1961, the actuary estimated that the total cost of the contributory pensions would be £707,000, that the contribution income would remain at £605,000, and there would be a net draw on the fund of £102,000.</P>
    <P>What is the position in which the contributors to the pension fund find themselves?  In the earlier years they were paying a very much larger contribution than would meet the cost of the contributory pensions.  That is because it is an insurance scheme in which deficiencies at the initiation of the scheme are evened out by the accumulation and investment of surplus income which will yield an investment income when the heavy obligations begin to mature on the fund.  We find this position, that in the year 1946, with a contribution income of £615,000 and interest on investments of £150,000, the total cost of the contributory pensions, excluding administration, is £408,000. But, in 1961, when the cost of the pensions has mounted to £707,000&mdash;to which we must add, in fairness, the cost of administering the scheme, which will not be less than £30,000, making the total cost of the contributory scheme £737,000&mdash;we will find the contribution income is only £605,000.</P>
    <P>The actuary, looking at the pensions investment fund, in which no less than £4,641,000 had been accumulated by the extravagant and spendthrift Fianna Fáil Government for the benefit of the widows and orphans of those who were compelled to be members of the contributory scheme, was going to purchase an investment income of £150,000, which would cover the total cost of the <Col N="1717" /> pensions, plus administration, and leave a small surplus of about £28,000 or £30,000 to provide for unforeseen contingencies.</P>
    <P>What will happen?  The Minister for Finance, representing this popular front Government, proposes this year not to pay the cost of the non-contributory scheme, but to make those bound by the law to contribute to the scheme pay the £450,000 which is properly the obligation of the Exchequer.  He can only do it by raiding the widows' and orphans' pensions fund and realising some part of these investments totalling £4,641,000, which amount was built up by the Fianna Fáil Government in order to ensure that the present contributors to the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme will be in this position, that when they die their widows and children will get what they are entitled by law to get under legislation passed by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance proposes to raid that fund.  The moneys are not his; they belong to the workers of this country, and because Deputy Con Lehane would strongly object to the pint being taxed in order to bear the cost of the widows' and orphans' pensions, because the Minister will not tax the pint in order to meet the obligations of the Exchequer, he will raid the widows' and orphans' pensions fund and take £450,000 belonging to the workers to meet the obligations of the Exchequer.  He will do it with the support of Deputies Hickey, O'Leary, Davin, Keane, Connolly, Cowan and Lehane.  He cannot do it and he will not do it if they stop him.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for what the Minister proposes to do under this Budget in relation to widows' and orphans' pensions does not rest with the Minister or the Taoiseach or any member of the Fine Gael Government. It rests with those who were returned to the House to make the interests of the workers their first concern.  It rests upon those who went to the people proclaiming that they stood to protect the interests of the workers. The funds now belonging to the workers are being raided.  The Minister for Finance calls for economy.  He <Col N="1718" /> is in the position of trustee in relation to this fund.  With the support of those members to whom I refer, and with the support of the one-time Labour Party, he will be guilty of the malversation of the trust fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the decent Deputies, the younger Deputies who are obliged to sit behind this ex-Ministerial mud-slinger, will not follow the bad example he gave.  It is only in keeping with his conduct inside and outside the House, particularly outside the House.  Deputy MacEntee is an ex-member of the Belfast branch of the British Socialist Party and he is the last man who should talk about the international or other outlook of the members sitting in this group.  He should put up somebody else to make these slanderous allegations.  I hope the allegations he made inside the House under cover of the privilege of the House will be made outside, so far as Deputy Larkin is concerned, and we will give Deputy MacEntee an opportunity of proving his charges before some of his own fellow-countrymen in a court.</P>
      <P>I say to members sitting on this side of the House that the younger members on the Opposition Benches are entitled to reasonable consideration. They will find that the make-up of this Government represents a revolutionary change compared with what we experienced over the past 16 years.  Time will prove that.  During the period when Fianna Fáil were in power this House could properly be described as a parliamentary talking shop.  No matter what a Deputy in the Opposition suggested, the Fianna Fáil Government ignored him.  You could stay here until you passed away from this world and no notice would be taken of your suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has been described by Deputy MacEntee as a popular front Government.  I accept that title.  What is known to us as the inter-Party Government is quite prepared to listen to all who sit here when they submit practical suggestions that will help to make the laws conform with the wishes of the people who sent us here.  That is a healthy change <Col N="1719" /> compared with our experiences over the past 16 years.  Not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party during that time dared to criticise Deputy de Valera.  If any Fianna Fáil Deputy did, he was faced with the certainty of being brought before the next Party meeting to explain his conduct.  I do not mind what is said by the younger members of this House because they are entitled to consideration.  The Fianna Fáil Government was swept out of office without giving any reasonable notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps in the next Budget if there is not enough money for all that is necessary he will take the excess profits which these people admit that they have made during the emergency and since the emergency at the expense of the plain people of Ireland.  The £276,000,000 increase in the deposits in our banks does not belong to the working-class people; it does not belong to the widows or to the old age pensioners and it does not belong to the small working farmers.</P>

He is a man who has had the responsibility of holding office with the goodwill of the people for 16 years and he knew perfectly well that he was trying to mislead the people and to misrepresent to them the Budget position.  I am quoting from the <i>Leinster Express</i> in a report of a meeting of a Fianna Fáil Cumann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nobody was spending, nobody was investing.  The warehouses were full.  The factories were on short time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of Saturday, May 15th, a good Fianna Fáil paper.  I am not making very much complaint about the words used by Deputy Lemass because that is the kind of stuff which he has to trot out in a constituency like this if he wants to keep the Fianna Fáil Party alive.  He knows that better than anybody because he is a man who has built up the Fianna Fáil Party and he has unlimited energy both in language and in physical force if he likes to use it.  He knows that if he does not keep the Fianna Fáil Party alive for six months that the Fianna Fáil Party will smash to smithereens. I will leave the decent Deputies of this House who do not wish to play politics in regard to the Budget or to the international outlook to think about the statement made by Deputy MacEntee in Portlaoighise.  I am sorry that my constituents, the decent people of my native county, had to listen to such a speech, because he knew that he was not speaking the truth and that he was misrepresenting the position with regard to the Budget.</P>
      <P>I am certainly behind the Minister for Finance with regard to this Budget as everything could not be done at once.

      <P>I believe this country should have an Army.  It should have an Army within its means, competent to defend us against attack.  If we are to build up a Defence Force on modern lines we should concentrate on building up a better Air Force than even the one we have.  That small Air Force has a very competent body of young officers, but it is far too small to defend this country against attack by any of the big Powers.  I think we can all agree on that.  But why we should go on to develop on the lines along which we have been developing is beyond me. In any case, the saving effected has not cost the Army one good soldier or officer or non-commissioned officer. Every one of the Deputies on the opposite benches knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to Aer Lingus and the other companies associated with it.  I <Col N="1724" /> want to say quite definitely to anybody who wants to hear it that I am not prepared to ask the taxpayers to pay heavy taxation for the purpose of providing a subsidised international air service.  Why should not we make Maximoe and all his friends pay their full fare when they want to come to and go from this country?  Why should not the wealthy people pay the full economic fare for the use of this luxury service and why should we in one year, without the proper authority of this House, have to find a loss amounting to £1,150,000?  If we have that money to spare or, if the taxpayers can afford to provide it, let us do something for those on the bottom rung of the ladder, for the widows, orphans, old age pensioners and those who have to live on low subsistence allowances, and give them sufficient to buy the necessaries of life for themselves and their dependents instead of subsidising this luxury service to the tune of 11d. out of every 1/- so that the international crooks can be carried by us to or from this country, whenever it pleases them.</P>
    <P>Are the Deputies on the Opposition Benches standing for the subsidisation of the service on the same lines as they stood for it for the last year?  I will defend this in any part of my constituency &mdash;I will defend it anywhere commonsense people can be got to listen&mdash;I am whole-heartedly behind the Minister for Finance in effecting these economies. There was no proper authority given by this House to subsidise Aer Lingus or any of these international air services out of tax revenue.  If there was, let me know when it was given and by what vote?  I see from a reply given by the Minister for Finance to a Deputy of the Opposition that the losses incurred in the training of staff, in the purchase of equipment and other essentials, previous to the inauguration of the transatlantic service, amounted to £504,000.</P>
    <P>Another thing I want to know from the people who sit on the Opposition Benches is, who was really in charge of Aer Lingus?  I ask them, through you, Sir, are they aware that out of 22 senior officers with very big salaries, employed by the international air service, 13 were non-nationals?  Who put <Col N="1725" /> them there?  Are they the people with authority to sack the ex-national Army men, the members of our Air Corps, who went in on their merits to these jobs when Aer Lingus was first established? I understand that British ex-servicemen or R.A.F. men have more than their fair share of the higher executive positions there and, in addition, they have more than their fair share of the power, apparently, that is exercised when redundancy has to be created and people have to be told to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that in this Budget, as in every previous Budget, a very high percentage of the tax revenue has to be allocated for the provision of food subsidies.  Perhaps the question is unfair&mdash;if the Minister has the approximate figures I would like to get them from him&mdash;what percentage of the many millions raised by way of tax revenue goes back to middlemen as subsidies?  I do not know how a flour miller can become a millionaire in the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil Government unless he is getting more than his fair share out of the money we provide for food subsidies.  I have heard it publicly stated, and I believe it is a fact, that a well-known flour miller in this country has made himself a millionaire, presumably at the expense of the taxpayers, since Fianna Fáil came into office and power.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to subscribe to a policy that will give most of the money raised for food subsidies to the middlemen. If subsidies are justified at all, they are justified to those who provide the raw material.  We have too much of that in the turf industry.  I have the authority of a very prominent Fianna Fáil spokesman in my constituency for saying&mdash;I believe it is quite true, but I will read it if necessary; I have it here unchallenged&mdash;that not one penny of the subsidy provided for fuel went to the producer.  I believe there is a good deal of truth in that.  I believe the whole of it went to the turf hauliers. There were only two or three of them in that ramp and we know they are the people, in Leix-Offaly at any rate, who are providing the money for the propaganda that is being carried on, misrepresenting the Government and its whole attitude and outlook in connection with the hand-won turf industry.</P>

      <P>A good deal of representation has been made in my constituency and outside it, and even here, in connection with the attitude and responsibility, whoever is responsible, for suspending the hand-won turf industry. I can quote from a speech delivered by Deputy Lemass in Birr on that matter a couple of nights ago.  He, apparently, was feeling the breeze there.  He went down to Birr and addressed a special meeting of the Fianna Fáil henchmen from the whole county.  I am now reading again from the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of the 15th May, and I have good reason to believe that this is an accurate report, because the editor of the paper himself was listening and seconded the vote of thanks to the Deputy when he had finished his speech.  The Deputy went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By legislation in 1946, Bord na Móna replaced the latter&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the Turf Development Board.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After examining the economics of its use for industrial and electric generation purposes, they found that mechanical won turf was most satisfactory for this purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This will be information to the Minister.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The 1946 plan set forth a £3,870,000 plan for the production of 1,000,000 tons of turf per year. Towards the end of 1947&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;listen to this; this is information for me, at any rate&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;when Bord na Móna was making more rapid progress, Fianna Fáil decided to double the board's scope and encourage the production of 2,000,000 tons per year, and it was planned also to include the financial aid for this work.  So far they did not know whether that project would be followed or not.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> Then Deputy Lemass goes on and points out that, in the Estimates which were sent to the printer before the Fianna Fáil Party was pushed out of office, they had made provision for £1,900,000, presumably&mdash;that is the inference in his speech&mdash;for the provision of hand-won turf.  We know and all agree&mdash;and the Minister in particular knows it&mdash;that the Estimates were prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government before they went out of office and that that figure appears in the Estimates&mdash;but I also know, and a good many of us on this side of the House know, that there was a meeting held, over which Deputy Lemass presided, on the 12th February of this year, that is, six days before his Government went out office, and this is the instruction he gave to his officials:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No provision should be made in the 1948-49 Estimates for the Bord na Móna hand-won turf scheme.  The question of discontinuance of hand-won turf production on the county council bogs should be further examined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was an instruction given by Deputy Lemass when Minister for Industry and Commerce, six days before he was pushed out of office but at a time when he was almost certain he was coming back again.</P>

      <P>In order to dispose of the doubt that appears to be in the minds only of the Fianna Fáil members, I invite the Minister in his concluding <Col N="1733" /> remarks to remove that doubt.  I want to raise a serious matter and Deputies on every side of the House will surely know this from the way in which they have been approached by all sections of the transport workers all over the country.  I would like to get from the Minister and from this Government at the earliest possible date some policy pronouncement in regard to the future of the transport industry.  I can assure the Minister for Finance that there is a good deal of demoralisation and discontent amongst the workers employed generally in the transport industry. Many commissions are being set up to find out where redundancy exists and, of course, someone must go, unless the powerful hand of the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes down and says that this kind of thing may not be done until the Government has had time to make up its own mind in regard to its future policy.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told members of the House, in reply to Parliamentary Questions on more than one occasion, that he proposes to set up an inquiry into the future of the transport industry.  I suggest with all respect to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The one outstanding thing every member of this House, and the Minister in particular, has to face is the question of the cost of living. The average wage-earner in this country has not received by way of increased rates of wages compensation to enable him to meet the increase in the cost of living.  I think the Minister will not challenge the accuracy of that statement generally.  What all sections of workers in this country want is that some effective steps will be taken at the earliest possible date to stabilise the purchasing power of the £.  The average person knows, and is prepared to admit, that there is little use in his or in his trade union seeking further increases in the wages because, immediately after the grant of, say, an increase of 5/-, the cost of living is going to go up to the equivalent of 7/6. Therefore it is a question of wages chasing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a dangerous kind of activity which will come to an end probably to the disadvantage of the whole community at some early date.  I hope the Minister will tackle the question of the increased cost of living and will find out for himself where the profiteering is going on, because it must be going on in the distributive trades.  Deputy Lemass came before the House shortly before the last general election and he was challenged regarding his willingness to accord to the butchers of Dublin an increase in the price of fresh meat.  He held up in his hand a report from some chartered accountant and asserted that, according to that report, there was justification for the increase in the price of fresh meat which he <Col N="1735" /> then agreed to as a result of that report or recommendation.  I say, without any disrespect to the chartered accountants of this country, that they can prove or disprove anything by figures. I am not prepared to accept that there has not been profiteering going on in the victualling business in Dublin. Most of the Deputies of this House have had the same experience as I.  I know dozens of fellows who were working for butchers only 15 or 20 years ago.  Some of them now own many establishments and private houses and the best motor cars in the country.  I am very well sure that they did not pick that money up from the bookmakers at race meetings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not buy houses with an overdraft.  In my opinion, it is a healthy draft.  There is a good deal of profiteering going on in the distributing trades.  What is really lacking in this country, if we make an open confession, is that too many people per head of the population are engaged in the distributing trade.  The producer is getting too little and the distributor is getting the whole of the whack.  In the case of the subsidised industries&mdash; flour, turf, etc.&mdash;the middleman is getting the taxpayers' money and not the producer who, I am sure, was always intended by the Deputies of this House.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the question of the cost of living.  It is a terrible job which would baffle anybody.  In trying to face up to that, on the basis of stabilising the purchasing power of the £, he will have the support not alone of his supporters in the inter-Party Government but also the silent support of the members of the Opposition Benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather shattering in a sense to listen to Deputy Davin meandering from one accusation to another and then coming to his summing up.  He started off by abusing members of this Party for suggesting that things were not as comfortable for certain people as they had been some <Col N="1736" /> months ago.  He called that &ldquo;starting a slump&rdquo; but he wound up himself in trying to create a slump in transport. The workers, he said, are facing disemployment and some economy commissions are being set up to question the numbers of people employed and to create redundancy.  I listened with great interest to a number of speakers from all sides of this House on this Budget.  I want to approach it from the point of view of trying to get some understanding of what the policy is to be within this coming financial year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in introducing his Budget, apart from the ordinary explanation of the figures which go with the introduction of a Budget, wound up by expressing the pious hope that wages would not now tend to go any higher.  As against that, not only did I listen to, but I actually read in great detail, the speeches made by Deputies Larkin and Connolly. From their speeches it is clear that their interpretation of the policy of the Budget is quite the reverse and that there has to be a continual increase in wages in order to bring the workers up to better conditions than those they enjoyed in the past.  Deputy Davin, in his concluding remarks, had to think something up which could be construed as a point of view of a Labour Deputy. He talked about the cost of living and he brought in the subject of profiteering by the distributing trades.  I wonder if Deputy Davin ever sits down and examines the composition of the people, the industries and the distributing trades of this country.  We hear people talking about producers and consumers and the middlemen in between who gain the lion's and the giant's share.  Deputy Davin is himself a middleman.  He is not a producer. All the transport workers are not producers.  They, too, are middlemen. The shopkeeper is also a middleman and he gives considerable employment. Deputy Davin makes an attack on the butchers.  He concludes that it is this profiteering by them that has driven the price of meat up to the consumer. Can he explain then why, since the change of Government, a further 1d. per lb. was accorded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the butchers who sell retail?</P>

      <P>One Deputy O'Higgins has made his speech.  I do not know which, because I was not here when he made it and I did not read it, but I am sure he made all his points.  I say that Deputy Davin has stated just now in this House that he believes that the high price of meat is directly attributable to profiteering on the part of the Dublin butchers.  If that is the case he should have brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, instead of allowing the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increase the price of meat by 1d. per lb., he should have got him to reduce it.  I think he will find that that is not true.  I think he will find that part of the butcher's expenses which increased in the last eight or ten years has been to a certain extent due also to the increase of wages he had to give to his trade union workers.  We had in the City of Dublin strikes on the part of butchers' employees.  Does Deputy Davin think that they are not getting their fair share of being middle men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose the Minister for Finance will honour me with answering <Col N="1738" /> any questions I will ask, but I want to put on record that there is a great difference of opinion between the different sections of the community as to what the policy is to be.  There is even a quite noticeable difference of opinion amongst the members of what is now accepted by Deputy Davin as being the Popular Front Party.</P>

      <P>I am not calling you anything.  Deputy Dockrell, in his approach to the Budget, sums it up and says that we are living within a capitalist system, that we are developing in this country along the line of private enterprise.  He uses these words as reported in the Official Report of 13th May, Columns 1578, 1579, etc.  Deputy Dockrell made a suggestion to the Minister for Finance.  He said it was quite unfair to the ordinary business community that co-operative organisations and institutions should be free from the payment of income-tax.  As against that, Deputy Larkin says we have reached a stage when the workers must take a share in the management of everybody's private enterprise.  As reported in the Official Report of 12th May, Column 1413, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have reached a period, both in this country and other countries, when the workers have shown by their capacity that they are as capable as any section of the community of undertaking supervising and managerial rôles in industry.  If they are to be required to accept responsibility as part of the community, then they must have the same rights in regard to industry that they enjoy to-day with regard to the political control of the country&mdash; the right to participate and take an active part in the higher councils of supervision and management in so far as industry and commerce are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have an expression of opinion by Deputy Larkin which tends to convey, <Col N="1739" /> at least to the section of the community which he represents, that we have reached the stage now when organised labour is in control politically and, having reached that stage, must be in control also of the management of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The other is Deputy Dockrell's point.  Deputy Dockrell says we are living within a capitalist system where industry and commerce are within the control of private enterprise. He points out that the Minister for Finance should take note of the unfair position which exists as between private enterprise and co-operative institutions because of the fact that these institutions are free from the payment of income-tax on their business transactions.

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my own point.  If the Labour section of the conglomeration over there thinks that industry under the management of private enterprise is in fact robbing the community and living on the fat of the land, what is to stop the labour organisations, with hundreds of thousands of pounds in trade union funds which are invested in corporation and Government securities, going into businesses and running them in competition with private enterprise? What is to stop them from starting additional co-operative institutions and giving the community the benefit of their wisdom, their good organisation, and their capabilities in the management of business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do they want to do it the other way, by taking control of existing organisations which were built up by private enterprise?  I am asking a question which, if you like, the capitalist side of the community, the people who believe in private property and private enterprise, are asking, namely, what is the policy to be?  Is it to be the policy enunciated and argued by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Connolly? Deputy Connolly went a step further and said they were supporting this Government as long as they could continue to get advantages for the people they represent and that they will continue to support the Government so long as those advantages are continued.  I say that there will be a certain amount of doubt in the minds of the supporters of the group for whom Deputies Larkin and Connolly speak when they read the point of view expressed by Deputy Dockrell, and that the people who support the view of Deputy Dockrell will have some doubt when they examine the speeches made by the Deputies on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am not going to answer any questions.  Deputy Larkin comes to his conclusions by reading certain statistics.  I should like the House to listen to one of the arguments he adduces from his interpretation of these statistics.  He said, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 110, column 1414:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The other day, having listened to Deputy Lemass, I looked through the Report of the Revenue Commissioners and discovered that, so far as the payment of death duties is concerned, it is only related to estates which exceed £100 in value.  I found that the total number who come within the purview of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter is less than 100,000 out of a total population of 3,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does Deputy Larkin glean from the statistics of the Revenue Commissioners? On the one hand, he gleans that there is a population of 3,500,000 in this country.  Of course there is not. We have been accused of keeping up the flow of emigration so long that the population does not exceed the 3,000,000 figure.  What does he mean by the 100,000?  Does he mean that in one year 100,000 people with estates of £100 or over died, or does he mean that the 100,000 estates which he is talking about have been dealt with since the inception of this State out of a total of 3,500,000 people who have died?  I should like if some people would study that and explain it.</P>

    <P>The Deputy took a family to consist of so many persons and then took the average death rate at so many per 1,000 of the population, but that conveys <Col N="1742" /> nothing when considered in relation to the real situation.  I do not know what it was intended to convey. Maybe it was that he wanted to convey that there are a few people with too much money while the vast bulk of the people have nothing at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to get a clear statement from the Minister for Finance as to where he stands and what is his policy for this financial year.  I will admit quite frankly that the Minister found himself in office without expectation. I believe that his accession to office was just as big a surprise to him as it was to me.  I admit that he did not get very much time to examine and put into operation a policy which would be nearer to his heart than this particular Budget is.  I would like, as I have said, to get a clear statement from him as to whether we are going to continue on as before or whether we are to prepare for a new era.  Are we going to abandon the fundamentals to which the life of this country has been anchored in the Constitution?  The Minister made some little suggestion that if he thought there was not going to be a reduction in prices, and if he felt that was due to too much profit-making on the part of industrialists he would introduce the excess profits tax.  It should be said that that tax was paid by all individuals or concerns making certain profits over a particular figure during the war years.  It was not applicable to manufacturers only.  I know there are certain colleagues of the Minister, in particular there is the Minister for Agriculture who seems to have nightmares every day with regard to Irish industrialists.  For years he has been describing them here as racketeers.</P>

Deputy Davin has referred to the pound as being worth 10/- That was the figure the Minister assumed the pound was now worth.  These are the theories that were previously discussed.

      <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate much has been said concerning the language question and the methods adopted up to now to save the language.  I agree that this matter is one of considerable importance for the Department of Education.  The policy of attempting to save the language by Government backing was initiated when this State was formed.  That policy was carried on by the subsequent Government and it now has a history of 26 years behind it.  Looking back on those 26 years, anybody speaking on the subject of the Irish language speaks not in a vacuum but in possession of the actual facts concerning the progress or lack of progress made.  Realising that, I think <Col N="1747" /> that every sensible person must agree that the progress made has not been satisfactory.  We have spent a considerable sum of money in propaganda throughout those years, propaganda aimed at getting the people to speak Irish and to advocate the language in all spheres of life.  We have spent large sums of money in educating a teaching staff to teach the language.  We have spent large sums in encouraging people to go to the very source of the language itself.  We have also spent considerable sums in encouraging people in their own interests, for their own material prosperity, to learn Irish and to become proficient in it.  Despite all that, as one year succeeds another, the fact remains that there is less and less Irish spoken as the ordinary tongue in this country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may speak if he wishes and express his own views but I am in possession now and I am speaking with due consideration. I am not speaking as an opponent of the language.  I am speaking of a fact which, in my opinion, exists and which I think is regrettable. I would blame the existence of that fact on the mentality which I mentioned on the last occasion on which I spoke in this House&mdash;the intense touchiness of everybody advocating the Irish language on hearing a single criticism as to the methods adopted to save it.  It is about time, if we are serious in our efforts to save the language, that we should take stock of what we have been doing and decide what our aim is going to be in the future.  I do not suggest that this Government or the present Minister should make any radical change in what has been agreed policy since 1922, as to the method of saving the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy speaking in this debate on the last occasion suggested a change in what is known as compulsory Irish. I do not know what people mean either by the policy of compulsory Irish or the suggestion of changing it.  So far as the school curriculum is concerned it would be an extraordinary thing if Irish was not an obligatory subject in <Col N="1748" /> this country for children attending school and doing examinations.  I am certain that nobody would advocate such a change; but I suggest very seriously to the Minister, who is one of the greatest friends of the language in this country and a man who will bring to this task all the enthusiasm which he possesses, that this whole matter should be considered very carefully.  I am glad that, in this connection, he proposes to take the advice of the teachers and of the parents on the present policy in connection with the language.</P>
    <P>I am sure that, by methods like those, we will get back eventually to the only way in which the language can be saved, that is, through the ordinary enthusiasm of the people, an enthusiasm springing from their love of the language and not enthusiasm driven into them by the big stick of the Department of Education, because, if we have a continuation of the big stick policy in a matter such as this, the language will become something to be hated by every schoolboy from the moment he goes into school until the day he leaves it.  It may be that it is now too late, that too much damage has been done by a bigoted outlook on this matter. I sincerely hope that that is not so, but I urge on the Minister that a stocktaking should now be made of the entire question.</P>
    <P>It would be possible for a speaker on this subject to talk at length about the Irish language, but I propose to avoid the temptation, and, in conclusion, would like to express my appreciation of the manner in which this debate has been conducted up to this. I am glad that Deputies on the opposite side are prepared to approach this important Estimate in a deliberative way, and on the basis of considering what is best for the country generally, apart altogether from Party affiliations. If that spirit is carried through to the teachers, progress will be made in the entire question of education.</P>

'Se ad theastaíonn uamn: teanga na Gaeilge a thabhairt thar nais athuair sa tír seo.  Fé mar is eol domsa, tá dhá dhream sa tír seo atá i bfhábhar na Gaeilge.  Tá dream a cheapann gur ceart na hábhar scoile a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge nuair a bhíonn na múinteoirí oilte chun é sin a dhéanamh agus nuair a bhíonn eolas a ndóithin ag na leanaí óga chun leas a bhaint as an teagasc a tugtar dóibh.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis sin, is baolach go bhfuil a lán daoine, agus fiú amháin daoine sa Teach seo, nách dtuigeann an cheist seo i gceart, nách dtuigeann an rial a bhaineann leis&mdash;nach bhfuil sé d'oblagáid ná d'éigeantas ar aon mhúinteoir na hábhair scoile a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge, muna bhfuil an múinteor sin oilte chun a dhéanta agus muna bhfuil go leor eolais ag na leanaí chun an teagasc do chur chun tairbhe dhóibh féin.  Sin riail a cuireadh ar bun chomh fada siar leis an mbliain 1931 agus rinneadh tagairt don rial sin ó shoin.  Is ait liomsa go labhrann daoine annso, agus lasmuich leis, gan aon aitheantas a thabhairt don riail sin, agus, fé mar is eol dom, nuair a bhíonn na cigirí ag dul timpeall go dtí na scoileanna, cuireann siad ina luí ar na muinteoirí gan na habhair scoile do mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge muna bhfuil siad oilte chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Cad is oiliúnt ann maidir an leis gceist seo?  An teastas dhá-theangach a bheith acu, nó teastas níos airde ná sin, an t-árd-teastas, a bheith acu.  Dá bhrí sin, tá súil agam ná gclosfimid a thuile mar gheall ar an rud seo ar a dtugtar &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; mar tá an rud céana le rá i dtaobh gach abhar scoile a múintear do na leanaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois, ní aontaím leis na daoine seo adeir ná fuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh.  Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil, ach obair chruaidh is ea teanga d'aithbheochaint tar éis roint blianta, go mór mór nuair atá an oiread seo constaicí sa tslí.  Tá na pictiúrlanna an radio agus na páipéirí nuaíochta go léir sa tslí sin maidir leis an troid ar son na Gaeilge, ach na daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis na scoileanna, leis na bunscoileanna féin, chíonn siad, ó bheith ag labhairt leis na leanaí, go mbíonn cuid mhór Gaeilge acu san ag fágaint <Col N="1750" /> na scoile dhóibh.  Is é an deacracht atá sa scéal ná nuair théas siad amach sa saol ina dhiaidh sin, ná bíonn an chaoi acu chun an t-eolas a fuaireadar sa scoil do chur i dtairbhe agus chun cinn.  Ní bhíonn sé de chaoi acu an Ghaeilge ná comhrá na Gaeilge a leathnú mór-thimpeall orthu agus sin é an laige atá sa slabhradh.  Sin é an laige atá ag baint leis an scéal ar fad, agus, dá bhféadfaimis an laige sin a leigheas, bheadh rud mór déanta againn.</P>
    <P>Ach ba mhaith liom a rá arís go bhfuilim sásta go mbíonn roint mhaith Gaeilge ag na leanaí ag fágaint na scoile dhóibh.  Gí go gcloisaimíd a lán mar gheall ar an éigeantas atá ag baint leis an nGaeilge, ní mór a chloisaimíd in aon chor ar an éigeantas atá ag baint leis an mBéurla.  Fé mar is eol dúinn go léir, caithfidh, fiú amháin na daoine atá sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht, an Béurla d'fhoghlaim, agus má bhíonn aon scrudú le déanamh acu, bíonn Béurla ann mar ábhar éigeantach, agus is minic go deimhin a theipeann orthu mar gheall ar an rud céana.  Dá gcuireadh duine ceist ormsa, ar cheart an Béurla a scrios amach ar fad as na scrúduithe sin, déarfainnse gur cheart, ach is dócha go mbeadh a lán daoine eile ná haontódh liom.  Tá daoine ann adeir nach ndéanann sin aon díobháil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ach geallaimse dhuit gur lua go leor a gheobhaidh siad eolas ar an mBéurla sa nGaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go dtuigfidh na daoine sin a bhíos ag fáil locht ar an gcóras oideachais annso mar gheall ar an éigeantas atá ag baint le múineadh na Gaeilge go bhfuil éigeantas eile ag baint le múineadh an Béurla sa nGaeltacht agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil cúis ghearán annsin.</P>
    <P>Thosnaíos agus rinneas tagairt do dhá dhream atá sa tír seo&mdash;dream go dteastaíonn uatha go muinfí na hábhair scoile trí Ghaeilge agus a cheapann gurb é an tslí is fearr é chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú sa scoil mar go mbeidh an méid sin aimsire á chaitheamh in úsáid na Gaeilge nuair a bheas na hábhar scoile á mhuinéadh tríthi agus dream eile, agus daoine, is dócha, atá dílis don Ghaeilge, leis, gur dóigh leo nár cheart in aon chor na hábhar scoile a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge, ach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge fhéin mar <Col N="1751" /> ábhar scoile sna scoileanna agus go dtabharfar spás áirithe do mhúineadh na Gaeilge féin sna scoileanna.  Fé mar adúirt ní cheana, nuair bhí an cheist seo fé dhíospóireacht sa Teach seo cheana, nílimse ar thaobh na ndaoine sin, ach, bíodh is nach bhfuilim, ní deirim nach bhfuilid dílis do chuspóir na Gaeilge.  Ceapaimse, má tá leanaí óga ag dul ar scoil ar dtús agus gan mórán colais acu ar an mBéurla, bheadh sé chomh maith tosnú le Gaeilge&mdash;pictiúirí a thaispeáint dóibh agus cainteanna beaga a thabhairt dóibh mar gheall ar na rudaí atá timpeall na scoile.  Dá luaithe a tosnófar leis na rudaí seo, is ea is fearr é.

    <P>Dúirt an tAire, nuair a bhí sé ag cur an Mheastacháin seó os cóir an Tí go bhfuil sé ar aigne aige Comhairle Oideachais a chur ar bun.  Níorbh é sin an chéad uair a rinne an tAire tagairt do chomhairle oideachais.  Nuair a bhí sé ar an dtaobh seo, agus taobh amuigh, den Teach seo, rinne sé tagairt dó, mar gur dhóigh leis, agus gur dóigh leis fós, is dócha, gur rud maith é. Caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuilim ar aon aigne leis agus nach rabhas ríamh, mar ní fheicimse cad é an tairbhe a dhéanfadh sé comhairle oideachais a chur ar bun.  Cé hiad na daoine a cuirfí ar choiste mar seo; conas a toghfaí tuistí, conas a toghfaí bainisteoirí, conas a toghfaí múinteoirí de gach saghas, conas a toghfaí cigirí mar is dócha gur cheart focal aibidh do bheith ag na cigirí?  Nílimse ar thaobh comhairle oideachais a chur ar bun, mar tuigtear dom go bhfuil máistrí a ndóthain ar na múinteoirí, gan a thuille trioblóide a <Col N="1752" /> chur anuas sa mullach orthu.  Má tá aon eolas ag teastáil ón Aire i dtaobh conas atá cúrsaí na tuaithe ag dul chun chinn maidir le ceist an oideachais, gheobhaidh sé an t-eolas ó na bainisteoirí gan mhoill.  Má theastaíonn uaidh a fháil amach conas tá an córas oideachais ag obair, gheobhaidh sé an t-eolas ó na cigirí agus daoine oilte eile.</P>

      <P>I would like now to say a few words in English, having spoken so long in Irish.  First of all, I express my astonishment that the Minister, during the whole of his speech in his presentation of the Estimate to the House, did not mention anything about teachers' salaries.  Everybody knows that that has been a burning question for some years back.  One would imagine, having regard to the attitude that the Minister and his colleagues and those who now substantially form the Coalition Government took up in connection with the teachers' strike, that one of the first things which they would do when they came into office would be to raise the teachers' salaries.  As far as I can see, no advance is being made beyond what the previous Government thought fit and proper to do, namely, to raise the teachers' salaries by £1,250,000, minus the cost-of-living bonus.  That was regarded by many politicians at the time as outrageously low so far as the teachers were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> Since then a general election has taken place.  Some of those very teachers played a rather important part in that general election against the Fianna Fáil Government, expecting a better deal from the Coalition. I am afraid that those of them who believed that their case would be reviewed after the change of Government took place are sadly disillusioned.  It is a question of &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; so far as they are concerned.  They can see now that there was no sincerity behind the clamour of those politicians.</P>
    <P>With regard to the council of education to which the Minister has referred, I know very well that that is a pet subject with the Minister.  It has been so for many years.  It comes as no surprise to me to find that one of his first steps as Minister for Education is to announce to the House the setting up of such a council of education.  Reference has been made from time to time to the way in which such a council of education works in other countries.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is better when dealing with such an important question as education&mdash;and everybody will admit that it is one of the most important questions coming before this House for discussion&mdash;that responsibility should be fixed upon one individual. We all know that it is through our educational system, as formulated and carried out by the Minister and his Department, that the lives, habits and characters of our people are moulded.  I do not believe in relegating responsibility for our education to a number of people.  I believe in fixing responsibility on one individual provided that that individual has access to all the channels of information that should be available to him.  I submit that those channels of information are available.  The Minister has his managers who can inform him as to how the system operates throughout the country.  He has his inspectorial staff who can inform him as to what progress the educational system is making throughout the country.  He has many methods by which he can keep in touch with the parents in order to find out from their point of view how the land lies as regards education.  I cannot see what useful purpose will be <Col N="1755" /> served by setting up a council of education in this country.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in Irish to the heating and cleaning of the schools.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister should now see fit to reduce the Estimate from £90,000 to £65,000.  This involves the health of the children and a reduction in the Estimate is unjustifiable even in the interests of economy.</P>

I am, however, willing to abide by the ruling of the House in that regard.  I want to say a few words about teaching through the medium of Irish.  I have already referred to it in my speech in Irish, but I merely touched upon the fringe of the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to speeches made here about teaching through the medium of Irish.  I think Deputy Collins and one or two other Deputies said that the children were leaving the schools &ldquo;illiterate in both languages&rdquo;&mdash;that is, illiterate in Irish and illiterate in English.  That is a grand phrase but a threadbare one. But, of course, no evidence has been forthcoming to prove that that is so. On the contrary, the evidence is all the other way.  There is now an examination in the primary schools for the primary certificate.  I remember coming across a reference to that examination in the <i>Leader</i> some time ago.  A teacher of long experience said that this examination imposed an undue burden upon the children; he said it was too difficult for children of <Col N="1756" /> that age.  The fact remains, however, that from 70 to 75 per cent. of the children who sat for that examination each year from its inception successfully passed it.  You have, on the one hand, a statement by an experienced teacher that the examination is too difficult and too burdensome; on the other hand, you have the results to prove that from 70 to 75 per cent. of the children passed the examination. I think that is proof, if proof is needed, that children leaving school nowadays are not the illiterate people they are represented by some people to be.  I have not the figures with me, but it would be easy to get them.</P>
      <P>When this statement was made, that children were leaving school illiterate in both languages, the implication was that the teaching of Irish in the schools was responsible.  From figures which I have come across out of 5,009 schools, ordinary subjects are being taught through the medium of Irish in 611, and of these there are 174 in the Fior-Ghaeltacht, 83 in the Gaeltacht, 106 in the Breac-Gaeltacht and 248 in the Galltacht.  If you subtract 611 from 5,009 it leaves you 4,398 schools where teachers, exercising their own intelligence and common sense, teach the amount they think it is proper to teach through Irish and the rest through the medium of English.  So this thing that is called compulsory Irish is not compulsory in the sense that the Deputies who have spoken would have us believe.</P>
      <P>On another occasion I referred to a circular issued to the schools some years ago in which an instruction was given to the teachers to the effect that the &ldquo;ordinary school subjects are to be taught through the medium of Irish only where a teacher is competent to teach through the medium of Irish and, where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, where these two conditions exist teachers should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; are used.  &ldquo;When these conditions do not exist, such teaching through the medium of Irish is not obligatory.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in 1936, instructions were sent <Col N="1757" /> out to teachers as follows: &ldquo;In regard to the question of teaching through the medium of Irish, it is considered necessary to draw the attention of inspectors to the circular, a copy of which is issued herewith, dealing with this question, and particularly to the warning it contains against using Irish as a teaching medium in schools or classes where the conditions set out in the circular as necessary for the success of such teaching are not present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It can be seen from these instructions that not alone are teachers not compelled to teach school subjects through the medium of Irish where the two conditions referred to are not in existence, but the teachers are definitely discouraged from doing so.  I hope we have heard the last of this thing they call compulsory Irish.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to school buildings. There are some school buildings in my constituency that urgently need attention.  However, I do not think this is the appropriate time to refer to these things.  I shall be able to supply details to the Minister later on about these schools.</P>
    <P>Is suimiuil an rud é le tabhairt fé ndeara nach gcloistear an oiread Gaeilge sa Teach aon tráth is a cloistear nuair a cuirtear Meastachán Roinne an Oideachais faoi bhráid na Dála.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that this is one of the most important questions that we could discuss and I am surprised that more interest is not taken by members of the House in a matter of such importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of our educational system is designed along class lines; the very fact that we have divided our educational system into primary, secondary and higher forms reveals that.  Broadly speaking, the primary school child is given the amount of education that prepares him for the factory, the workshop <Col N="1758" /> or the field.  It is very restricted and it makes it impossible for that child to understand and appreciate the place of men and women in society. Secondary education, on the other hand, prepares the child for supervisory positions and as teachers. The fee-paying child has prospects of reaching the university and even the scholarship child, although to a lesser degree, has such a possibility ahead. As far as I can see, the type of education that is given to the secondary school child is different even in scope from that given to the primary school child.</P>
    <P>Here I want to say to the Minister &mdash;and I am inclined to think that I am dealing with a Minister who would be sympathetic&mdash;that we have to deal with the talented child who has no chance whatever of reaching the university.  I know of cases where parents are begged to leave their children at school but they have to be taken from school at the age of 15 years because of lack of means.  Those children have no chance of receiving a higher education and I feel that our educational system is at fault.  I feel that it is at fault where children of talent are lost to the country because the system of education makes it impossible for them to go to the university on their talents.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is very little value in a system of education that launches young people into life, class conscious and burdened with social wrongs.  I would like to bring the Minister's attention to changing all that with a view to giving a talented child a chance of going to the university and getting the education which he is entitled to get.</P>
    <P>Listening to the various speakers, I feel that educationists in this country and the Deputies who have spoken here this evening are more preoccupied with means and methods than with ends.  I feel that education must be considered from a social point of view and must have a definite objective. I feel that it is our duty to try to achieve the ideal of giving to our young people an education which will not merely help them to get on in life but which will help them to understand what life is.  I also feel that the first and most important dividing line is the <Col N="1759" /> line between those who believe, and passionately believe, that there is an urgent need for social change and those who, having vested interests either intellectual or material, want to preserve things as they are and I believe that education will have to stand on one side or the other of that dividing line.  We must prepare and educate our people for the changes which are taking place in society and if we are to have a better Ireland we must get people who believe that a better Ireland is possible.</P>
    <P>I will now come to the question of the school leaving age and I hope that every Deputy in this House will agree with me that the time has come when the school leaving age should be raised. Young people are thrown out of our schools year after year who are quite improperly prepared for the contact with life, and at this stage education is specially needed in order to develop children personally and morally.  I think that the Minister and educationists throughout the country should concentrate on the problem of adult education.  I know a couple of young men who were able to secure a silver medal and a gold medal for speaking Irish at the age of 16.  The parents of one of them had died and the other man was in very poor circumstances. These chaps did everything possible to equip themselves to be teachers but they had not the means to do so.  One of them offered to work in a certain college with a view to becoming a vocational teacher.  It is a sad thing that young men with talent and desire to educate themselves are denied the means to do so because of our educational system.</P>
    <P>I have also in mind a number of young boys who get the chance of employment at the age of 16 and 17 and who are not able to finish their course for matriculation.  There should be some means for them to go to night classes in order to qualify themselves for matriculation with a view to getting ultimately a B. Comm. or whatever else they want to get at the university.  I think that this is a very important matter as far as boys and girls of the working classes are concerned. Are we getting the type of <Col N="1760" /> citizens at the moment that we should be getting?  Something is wrong with our educational system because young men and women grow up who have not got the social sense or the sense of responsibility which we would wish to have in our growing boys and girls.  I would suggest that adult education particularly should have its place and I would urge the Minister for Education to give more consideration to the question of adult education for young people who are between the school-leaving age and the age of 19 or 20. Young people who have talent should have a right to receive the university education which their talent entitles them to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very great deal of sympathy with the remarks of the last speaker with regard to giving talented boys and girls the opportunity of carrying their studies through to university age.  I believe that it is a matter of great interest to this country that the best brains of the country should be capable of being trained and used here.  To a great extent, the difficulty stated by Deputy Hickey is got over in other countries, in Canada and the United States of America, by whatever way they work their system in certain provinces and States so that young men and women can follow their university career and at the same time earn the means to do so by having some form of livelihood outside.  If we could arrange something of that sort here, this difficulty could be overcome and I think it should be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only natural that on the question of the Education Estimate the problem of the Irish language as a living language should be discussed.  It is treated and I hope it always will be treated, from a non-Party point of view.  I would divide Deputies in this House into three categories: those who have a genuine knowledge and enthusiasm of the language; those who, like myself, have no knowledge of the language whatever but who are enthusiastic for other people to acquire it; and the Deputies who are between those classes.  If we were to pool our brains and our experience here we might evolve a system which would <Col N="1761" /> produce a victory for the Irish language. Persons like myself who do not know any Irish are in a very fair position to judge what progress the language has made.  Those who know the language are inclined to be slightly prejudiced&mdash;and I do not mean this in any offensive sense&mdash;but they are inclined to be slightly touchy about it. One thing that has convinced me that there must be something wrong with our methods at the present time is the results that they have shown.  I have made a perusal of the statistical abstract of the population of this country and I think a very fair analysis can be made from the figures.  The population of this country at the present time, leaving out those persons who reside in totally Irish-speaking portions of the Gaeltacht, who are over the age of nine is roughly 2,000,000 in round figures.  I have taken these figures from the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  I arrived at the figure in this way: the total population was 2,992,000 in 1941&mdash; the latest figures available. The population under nine years of age is 546,000, leaving 2,445,000 over the age of nine.  I find from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> dated 1936&mdash;the latest figure available&mdash;that the population residing in totally Irish-speaking districts was 426,000.  If one takes 426,000 from 2,992,000 one gets roughly 2,500,000 and, allowing 500,000 to bring the figure up to date, one gets 2,000,000.</P>
    <P>As far as I can obtain from the same analysis of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, in 1941, the total population between the ages of nine and 24 was 779,000.  That means that that population, in 1941, was going through or had been through a course of Irish, compulsory or otherwise. I start with the year 1925 for that purpose.  Taking the figure given in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for persons under nine years of age, that is, 546,000, it is only fair to add for the seven years since 1941, at least 250,000 to the figure of 779,000.  That leaves the incontrovertible figure of 1,000,000 for the figure of population that is going through or has gone through a course of compulsory Irish in our schools. That means that one out of every two people in this country has had the advantage of a course of compulsory <Col N="1762" /> Irish.  I leave it to the House to decide on the figures which I have given, and which are accurate to the extent of thousands or 1,500 here and there, whether or not the system has been a success in the object it was set out to attain.  It must be a great disappointment to all who would like to see the system a success that although one in two of our population has had the advantage of a course of Irish under our own Government and under our own institutions, the number of those who use the language is nowhere near that figure.</P>
    <P>There is a branch of teaching which should be extended and emphasised in our schools.  I refer to cookery.  This country produces a variety of very valuable vegetables.  These vegetables can be grown from inexpensive seed. They are not properly appreciated in the majority of Irish homes because the women have not received proper instruction in the cooking and preparation of these foods.  The Department should make a special effort, by instruction and propaganda, to increase practical knowledge of cookery.  It is very important for a number of reasons.  First of all it is important economically.  By producing vegetables we would increase the supply of home produced food to take the place of imported food.  It stands to reason that if our people eat more vegetables the amount of wheat and other grain we will have to import can be reduced. Secondly, it is important from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who is connected with a health organisation or with the medical profession realises that I am talking common sense in this matter.  Vegetables have a very high food value. The reason they are not more generally used is the lack of proper facilities for teaching cookery in our schools and the lack of interest in the matter.  The proper Department to sponsor an effort of that kind is the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Tinned vegetables that have been imported from America, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and other places are purchased by people in Irish country towns although the same food could have been grown in their own gardens. <Col N="1763" /> Deputies will realise that fresh food is preferable to tinned food.  The Almighty gave us an indifferent climate for some purposes but an admirable climate for growing vegetables and I would press upon the Minister's Department the necessity, in the interests of economy and health, of considering the matter I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like the Minister to consider.  At the moment, I am afraid, all the component parts of education are disjointed. Until there is proper coordination, education will remain in its present stage of development which, unfortunately, is not a very satisfactory state.  I have often wondered at the number of students who have had a long academic career, up to leaving certificate standard, who, through no fault of their own, have to discontinue their education and enter blind-alley employment.  I have often wondered why some effort has not been made by the educational authorities to evolve a plan so that the brains of these people would be utilised to the very best advantage to the State.  If these people could be trained for a certain trade or profession it would be of benefit to themselves and to the State.  Unfortunately, year after year, lists of brilliant examination students appear in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These lists are published by the colleges or schools in which these students studied.  After that they seem to fade out of the life of the country. Nobody seems to hear anything about them except in exceptional cases where, by virtue probably of their parents' financial position, they are able to continue their studies.  I have no hesitation in saying that, without financial backing, the majority of those brilliant boys and girls are casualties and are led into blind-alley employment. Since I have come to the House I have not heard anything said with regard to teachers.  Personally, I have the greatest admiration for the national teacher&mdash;that man or woman to whose care is given the child of tender years and who brings that child to an educational standard where it can be transferred to secondary education.  In my <Col N="1764" /> opinion, those people&mdash;I hope that at this time I am not striking any discordant note in the proceedings&mdash; should be paid commensurate with the services they are giving to the nation. I am afraid, however, they are not.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the present Minister that he should introduce into his primary schools some system which would inculcate in the youth of our country the respect that is due to our national flag.  I believe that the only way of inculcating that is to have those children brought out on a morning of a week or a month or a term and made stand to attention while the flag is being raised.  I believe that in their subsequent careers as men and women that training would be of benefit to them and give them a public spirit which all the preaching that might be given to them after a certain age would not achieve.  I am sure a lot of people here realise that as well as I do.  A lot of children are more or less haphazard about the way the national flag of the country is raised or lowered except those coming from the very few schools where it is flown.  With the co-operation of the national teachers that difficulty could very easily be surmounted and the training would pay in value in the subsequent lives of the pupils.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the lack of co-ordination in the different educational elements in this country at the moment.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde referred to cooking.  We have, in this country, domestic economy classes; the ordinary vocational commercial classes; language classes such as Irish and so forth, and needlework classes. In addition we have agricultural education. All these elements of education seem to be disjointed.  Some of them, I understand, do not come under the scope of the Department of Education at all.  Agricultural education is different. All these elements of education should be brought under one control and from that control the different systems and curricula should radiate so as to co-ordinate the educational life of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the school-leaving age, I am afraid that before we can hope to get any results we will have to do something to improve the wages of <Col N="1765" /> the parents.  Everybody knows that at the moment, in places where there is only the ordinary basic industry of the country, £2 15s. Od. per week is the sum of money on which a man has to rear a family of probably five or seven children.  It follows that when the eldest child reaches the age of 14 he or she, as the case may be, must try and earn a living for himself.  If we want to arrive at any satisfactory solution for the raising of the school-leaving age we must first seriously relate ourselves to the raising of the wages so that the father need not worry about what is going to happen to his eldest child on reaching the age of 14 years.  The father will then be in a position to maintain that child at school for a further educational period which will be of benefit to the child in later years. I hope that in the very near future the school-leaving age will be raised from 14 years to 16 years and that no illeffects will accrue from that measure as far as the parents of the child are concerned.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar cheist na Gaeilge agus ceist an oideachais go ginearálta.  Sa gcéad dul síos ní aontaím le héinne adeir nach bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta sa tír seo maidir le Gaeilge mar tá mé cinnte go mbíonn mórán Gaeilge ag na páistí nuair a fhágann siad an scoil ach go bhfágtar ansin é.  Ní labhrann siad an Ghaeilge tar éis fagaint na scoile doibh.  Ní fheadar cé tá ciontach leis sin.  Sé mo thuairim gurb é an t-aon locht atá orainn ná go ndearnadh faillí sa cheist náisiúnta le roint blianta anuas, cur i gcas, ón lá a rinneadh an Conradh le Sasana agus an tír seo agus gur bhuaidh an chumhacht orthu.  On lá sin amach rinneamar faillí i gceist na náisiúntachta agus anois tá na daoine óga faillíoch mar nach bhfuaireadar an sompla uainne.  Fiú amháin sa Teach seo tá sé le feiceál.  Chomh fada is atáimse anseo ní dóigh liom go bhfuil deá-shompla dá thabhairt do na daoine óga mar tá an iomarca Béarla le cloisint anseo.  Bíonn daoine ag caint ar cheist na Gaeilge tríd an mBéarla agus, dar ndóigh, is ait an rud é sin. Tá fir óga, cuid acu ar múinteoirí scoile iad, sa Tigh seo agus is beag Gaeilge a <Col N="1766" /> bhíos ar siúl acu anseo.  Ba choir níos mó Gaeilge a bheith le cloisint sa Tigh seo agus ba chóir, freisin, go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge le léamh sna páipéir nuaíochta.  Rinne an Teachta O Ciosáin tagairt do na pictiúirlanna. Is mithid dúinn athrú éigin a dhéanamh orthu sin.  Go deimhin, tá an iomarca Béarla le cloisint ins na pictiúirlanna&mdash;agus Béarla ná déanann aon mhaitheas do na daoine óga.  Ba choir dúinn aire a thabhairt don taobh sin den cheist agus na pictiúirlanna a Ghaelú beagáinín.</P>

      <P>Tá fhios againn go léir nach mbíonn eolas ag paiste, nuair a théas sé ar scoil ar a 4 no a 5 bliana d'aois, ar theanga ar bith.  Is cuma leis an bpáiste cén teanga in a múintear é.  Is cuma cé acu Béarla, Gaeilge, Laidin nó Greigis é.  Mar sin fhéin táimid ag síor-chaint mar gheall ar &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;.  Sé mo thuairim gur mór an chontúirt é anois, go mór-mhór, aon athrú a dhéanamh ar an modh atá againn fé láthair mar tá Galldachas agus gach rud mar sin atá i gcoinne na tíre seo ag teacht isteach níos láidre na riamh. Tá sé sin le feiscint, i ngach tír sa domhan agus muna dtugtar aire do cheist na Gaeilge is eagal liom ná beidh sí beo againn i bhfad.  Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ann agus go mairfidh sí ins na hollscoileanna agus ag na daoine léanta.  'Sé atá uainn sa tír seo ná an Ghaeilge a chur i mbéal na ndaoine.  Níl slí ar bith chun é sin a dhéanamh ach an náisiúntacht d'athbhunú sna daoine i dtreo is go mbeadh meas acu ar gach ní Gaelach. Ba chóir dúinn, freisin, a chur in a luí ortha na rudaí a rinneadh ar son na Gaeilge agus na daoine a throid ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son saoirse na tíre. Tá cuid mhaith d'aos óg na tíre gan an t-eolas sin anois agus, dá bhrí sin, níl meas acu ar aon rud Gaelach.  Go dtí go ndéantar sin ní bheidh aon dul chun cinn déanta againn.  Ba chóir go gcuirfí scéim éigin ar siúl i dtreo is go mbeadh <Col N="1767" /> caoi ag na páistí a fhágann an scoil leanúint dá gcuid oideachais leasmuigh den scoil.  Tá áiteanna ann ina ndéantar sin fé láthair&mdash;áiteanna a mbíonn ranganna Gaeilge faoi Choistí Gairme Oideachais, agus mar sin.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá a lán áiteanna nach ndéantar é sin ós rud é nach bhfuil múinteoir le fáil ionntu. Chomh fadh is atá an Ghaeilge ag na páistí déarfainn gur chóir deire a chur leis na focla &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; agus tréan-obair a dhéanamh i dtreo is go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga na scoile agus a chur d'iachall ar na páistí an Béarla d'fhoghlaim. B'fhéidir go n-éireodh linn 'na dhiaidh sin.</P>

      <P>Before reporting progress I was referring to the statement of the Minister for Finance to this House, not on the Budget as I stated, but on the Vote on Account.  I want to correct that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I said it was in the Budget speech and to that extent I was incorrect.  It was on the Vote on Account that the Minister made the particular statement which I am quoting from now, as reported in the Official Report of 11th March, Volume 110, No. 5, Column 610.  The Minister stated then:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I have had to make any speeches over these years and have been criticised for them, it is because I am always to be classed with the money cranks, perhaps with Deputies like Deputy Cowan and Deputy Hickey.  I know very well that a lot of theories people have, have to be abandoned when theory is brought up against the facts of life.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I know very well that a lot of theories people have, have to be abandoned when theory is brought up against the facts of life.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the facts of the Minister's life is that he moved from here over to a <Col N="1769" /> Ministerial position and as a result of that fact many of the theories which the Minister had pronounced from here have had to be abandoned.  Now, the Minister, in order to take the harm out of the withdrawal, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am quite certain that a lot of the theories I have developed in my years of Opposition will not stand against facts, but they will be pursued, as far as I can pursue them with the help of my colleagues, so that we shall get a new view of things.&rdquo;</P>

If Deputy Cowan likes, I shall quote him.  I do not want to give a wrong interpretation of what he said.  He said: &ldquo;We are only a Party of ten.  We are quite helpless.  We can do nothing.

That might be a very long time.  I remember reading literature issued by Clann na Poblachta during the election period. I remember listening to speeches by some of the Deputy's fellow-candidates. They had a great many schemes about how the country should employ its people; how they were going to stop emigration; how they were going to plant millions of acres of trees.  I suppose these will also have to remain in abeyance.  In the meanwhile, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that forestry workers have not got £3 a week.</P>

      <P>The members of the Labour Party, and particularly Deputy Larkin, seemed to think that the reimposition of excess profits tax would solve all the problems in regard to the distribution of wealth from the millionaires down.  He gave a description of going to the Spring Show and of seeing evidence there of people of untold wealth going around.  Deputy Larkin ought to know that one can see people driving motor cars around which they probably have not even paid for.  The fact of seeing a person driving about in a grand sports car means nothing. The Minister for Finance knows very well the extent of the income of people in this country.  The Revenue Commissioners make sure that they get every penny that is due to them, and they have a fair idea of where it can be got. The reimposition of excess profits tax is one attraction, but then there are other Deputies in the House who think that excess profits tax will come from industrialists only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every member of the House knows that the poor industrialist to-day suffers the most extreme examination, sometimes twice in the year with regard to the profit that he is allowed to make.  These profits are cut up and down according to the percentage allowed.  There are many business houses which, because of excess profits tax were not able to make provision for the new capital expenditure necessary to meet the abnormal wastage <Col N="1773" /> caused by putting machinery during the war years to greater output than it was really built for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was Deputy Larkin's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking about general prices as between manufacturers, distributors and shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement does not exclude manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, but I am trying to come to the point that, as regards distribution and retail shops, because of the peculiar situation we have in the country the margin of profit which is accorded to retailers tends to make prices very much higher than they would be if there was a direct sale from the producer to the consumer.  That is why I suggest to the Labour people that, rather than be putting their eyes in the direction of taking over private enterprise and <Col N="1774" /> thinking they are going to make a better job of it than the people who have created it, that under the Constitution they are at liberty to start their own co-operatives and their own retail shops.  Let them work at a smaller margin of profit and they will soon be forced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not get any quotas.  That is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Quotas were only introduced as a result of the war.  The emergency is fast disappearing and materials are becoming more readily available.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is bothered stiff by Deputy Connolly telling him to clamp down on the importation of boots&mdash; that so many are coming in that manufacturers here have to close down.  I am sure that the question of according quotas to legitimately started co-operatives would not be a difficulty. That should be the long-term view of the Labour people if that is what they mean.  If Labour really means a development towards that it might be called socialism as distinct from extreme socialism or communism.  My interpretation of taking over control as distinct from nationalisation and demanding the right to manage industries which are really private enterprise is quite different.  Go ahead and open up shops to compete against private enterprise.  The worst that can happen is that the co-operatives will have the advantage of not having to pay income-tax, at any rate to the same extent as private enterprise has to pay.  But they may find that it is not so easy because to-day we have a very serious situation confronting all industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of the local authorities. We have there the problem of meeting the demands of labour for increased wages, together with altered conditions of employment which affect output very considerably.  We on the Dublin Corporation had put before us recently a statement showing that, while wages had gone up 65 per cent. as compared with pre-war rates, the output of the very same workers had gone down 35 per cent.  Add these figures together and make a comparison with the 1939 position.  The cost of production has <Col N="1775" /> gone up not because of extravagant profits made by the contractors who contracted for these particular schemes but because of altered conditions.  The cost of production goes up because the workers have to have their position met now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy advocate the establishment by the Labour Party of co-operatives in his constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to co-operatives.  I think it would be a very good thing if workers became better acquainted with the ways of life in business and in trade by being joint owners in a co-operative.  I would have no objection whatever to a co-operative in the very heart of my constituency.  As a matter of fact I am trying to advocate it now.  The Labour people, who have considerable funds, could very easily get going on that line and so bring some relief to the classes they represent in their being able to get a great many commodities at much cheaper prices than they are getting them now.  We here in Dublin have started a consumer-to-producer market in the hope that ways will be found to bring down the cost of certain classes of produce.  At present the cost of them is found to be too high under the system under which they are being sold.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I have been trying very hard to make the Minister understand.  It is one on which there is a division of opinion outside. Some people want to know in what direction is the Government going to move?  Is it going to move in the direction announced and accepted by the Deputies of the Labour Party and of Clann na Poblachta, or is it going to remain in the position it is in as enunciated by Deputy Dockrell?  I think the Minister ought to make clear, at least for this financial year, what the policy is going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter about which it is imperative at the moment&mdash;but very hard&mdash;to get a statement of policy on.  One hears, on the one hand, a great deal of talk to the effect that the cost of living will be brought down and that, in this new trade agreement <Col N="1776" /> which has been so much spoken of recently, greater facilities will be given for the import into this country of manufactured goods.  That, of course, would have serious adverse effects on domestic industries.</P>

I heard people very much concerned about this matter.  I saw it in a paper which somebody took me to task for reading&mdash;the <i>Daily Mail.</i>  I think it was Deputy Cowan who took me to task.  I saw in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on Tuesday of this week a forecast as to the visit of six of our Ministers to <Col N="1779" /> London with a view to bringing about a new trade treaty.  They envisaged in that article that there would be a change of policy, an abandonment or a cancellation of the old trade treaty and that there would be included in the new trade treaty for a long period of years extra facilities for the importation into this country of manufactured goods.  In any event, over a large range of items, even to giving a preference to England over other countries.</P>

I would suggest that the Minister might consider reintroducing the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, even, if necessary, introducing the two separate parts into which it was divided, as two distinct Bills because there was envisaged in that Bill an effort to keep industries going, to try to improve the industrial outlook of the country and at the same time control prices, not only of the manufacturers but also of middle-men such as those who forced the Minister for Industry and Commerce to put an extra penny on beef.</P>

      <P>If I disagree with Deputies because of their particular approach to problems that does not mean that I believe that they are deliberately misinforming the House.  It occurs in relation to industry, to agriculture, to the cost of living and to taxation generally.  One Deputy wants more taxation.  Another Deputy wants less taxation.  One Deputy says taxation <Col N="1783" /> has been decreased; another Deputy says taxation has been increased.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee dealt with the abandonment of Aerlinte.  I think that that is a tragedy myself.  I wonder is the report I read in yesterday's evening paper of a statement made by the Minister for External Affairs an accurate and fair report of the Government's view with regard to the Marshall Aid Plan.  If the statement is accurate then we are not going to get considerable quantities of goods from America under this plan.  If we had the Aerlinte service in operation we would have a considerable income in dollars.</P>

It provides current for the people and current is a very important and essential item. From the economic and commercial point of view it can never be held out to be a success.  Every time the Electricity Supply Board accounts showed a deficiency, due to one cause or another beyond their control, the price went up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of this city are bound to take Electricity Supply Board current.  They are not permitted to say that they will have Shannon current as distinct from Pigeon House current.  Consequently they do not know how much of the current they get is Pigeon House and how much is Shannon.  Their total bill does not show it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>But the bill to the consumer does not show it and the bill to the consumer has been an increasing bill over all these years.  I raised in the House here the iniquity of some people having to pay as much as 1/6 per unit on the basis of their allocation when electricity was rationed.  I raised that matter from those benches over there.  Despite all these criticisms, however, admittedly the Shannon Scheme is of national importance.  So also could Aerlinte have developed in time into something of national importance. It was giving extremely good employment.  It would have given us a group of highly technically-developed citizens who would have been a considerable asset to us both in times of peace and in times of danger.  In addition to that I believe it would have helped to bring in much needed dollars. I do not know to what extent we are to take the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs as meaning what it says.  I do not know to what extent that new situation is going to affect us with regard to bringing in capital items in order to improve agriculture and production generally.  It does, however, seem to be somewhat in conflict with the views expressed by <Col N="1786" /> the Minister for Finance when introducing his Budget here.  It will have some repercussions, if we are not going to participate, other than what might have been expected.  If we are not going to participate to that extent, we will be cutting off what would likely be a source of supply of dollars over and above what we would be entitled to receive from the dollar pool.  I think the abandonment of Aerlinte is indeed a tragedy.  I feel it might have been considered over a longer period and a decision should have been arrived at only after the most careful consideration. I recollect the Minister coming here before he had fully considered the matter and saying quite openly: &ldquo;If stopping Aerlinte rests with me, it will be stopped.&rdquo;  There was no reference to whether it was going to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I am not a scrap merchant.  As regards the short-wave station, I do not know whether the Minister was given advice by technical officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I know something about broadcasting, although I do not pose as an expert.  I am, perhaps, like a Deputy in Clann na Talmhan who described himself as a radio fan.  Medium wave-bands to-day are so confusing that it is, in many cases, in certain parts of this country and of other countries, almost impossible to get a continuous good reception.  As regards the short waves, there is ample opportunity for new wave-lengths; there is no great interference; practically every radio set is equipped for short-wave reception, and one can get a better reception on the short waves.  A great number of people in this country would listen to the short-wave station in preference to the medium wave, provided the programmes were somewhat similar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This international committee is representative of all nations. Its object is to bring about harmony, to eliminate discord in connection with broadcasting.  The members try to bring about an understanding whereby all stations will broadcast on the wave-lengths accorded them.  The procedure is to give a wave-length to any country that applies.</P>
      <P>The idea of building a short-wave station here was thought of many years ago, but it was postponed during the war years.  During all that time if there was any danger of not getting a short-wave length our officials would have been made aware of it.  I think it was a rather short-sighted policy to make that saving out of something that would probably further have increased our revenue.  Radio sets and radio parts have to pay duty and the increased use of receiving sets would considerably augment the income of the State.  If you cut out the means whereby people could make use of a State service of that kind, you are cutting off a big source of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something about the saving on turf.  There was a statement made in the House to-day by Deputy Davin.  First of all, he read what appeared to be a document purporting to give some remarks made by Deputy Lemass.  When he was questioned by the Chair to give the reference, the Deputy indicated that it was a note of his own of a conversation between Deputy Lemass, when he was a Minister, and his officials, in connection with the abolition of hand-won turf.  Deputy Lemass has denied that. There was a statement made, and reported in the Press, by the Minister for <Col N="1789" /> Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Lemass raised the question and he denied the statement that was later made by Deputy Davin.  I do not know why there should be such confusion about it.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil started turf development long before the war commenced.  It was started almost immediately after Fianna Fáil took up office 16 years ago.  I well remember the talk in this House about the wired cars going round.  The late Deputy Hugo Flinn, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, was responsible for turf development. He was jeered and jibed at.  I remember the Minister, then a Deputy, laughing at the Minister for Finance and referring to &ldquo;Aiken's sacks&rdquo; in which the turf was packed.</P>

      <P>That is something, I believe, which Deputy Collins ought to know something about.  I remember the discussion in this House, the idea behind the development of turf and how true the views of those who sponsored it turned out to be when this country was left entirely and absolutely without fuel.  If in the war years and the years immediately after it we had not had this fuel to fall back on we would have had a nice state of affairs.  The idea was to start the rural electrification <Col N="1790" /> scheme with turf as fuel.  Mr. McGilligan denies that and casts a doubt upon when the scheme was discussed but I have a recollection that that scheme was envisaged a considerable time ago but that it could not be put into effect until after the emergency.</P>

      <P>The Government decided upon this scheme.  They adopted it and had discussions with the Electricity Supply Board about it before the war and the Electricity Supply Board were charged with going ahead with it before the war was over. The Minister will find that if he looks up the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Electricity Supply Board records.</P>
      <P>With coal becoming more readily available and being used in preference by industries, institutions and private houses, the State would have kept turf development going and hand-won turf as well, though there might have been a change such as its being handed over from the direct control of the Department to another institution, but there was no suggestion of cutting it out completely.  We will probably have discussion on that question on the Industry and Commerce Estimate.  I suppose that that would be one big item on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> In conclusion, I would like to ask the Minister to make a clear statement in his conclusion, first, that there will be no change in the tariff policy although there may be greater control in the standard of production and the standard of goods produced and that is all right.  Secondly I would like him to state if there is to be a move towards the left as envisaged by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Connolly.  We are going to be in a position here where we will have either to do that or more or less to take the line that existed immediately before the change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the many days that we have discussed this Budget there has been a quite clear attempt to lead us away, and I have no doubt that the Deputies on the other side of the House were quite deliberate in their attempt to fog the issue.  On the 4th May when the Minister for Finance arose in the House to introduce his Budget there was one clear inescapable fact that afternoon which was that every Deputy in the House knew that as a result of the baby that was handed to him by the previous Administration the present Minister for Finance had to find the sum of £77,000,000.  Not one Deputy no matter upon what side of the House he sat felt that it was possible for the Minister for Finance to find that sum much less to find any additional sum for the provision of extra social services without increasing taxation to a very considerable degree indeed, by £2,000,000 or £3,000,000. The whole theme running through the debate on the other side of the House is, unfortunately for the Deputies on that side, that the Minister for Finance has made a good job of the very difficult task confronting him in this his first Budget.  He had before him at this stage a bill for £77,000,000, a bill of such gigantic proportions that many of us who are not accustomed to dealing with finance did not know how it would be possible for him to get the money and to effect the necessary adjustments in the account without imposing considerable hardships on the people.  The view which is held, not merely in the House but from one end <Col N="1792" /> of the country to the other, regardless of the political affiliations of the persons with whom you may be discussing the Budget, is that in introducing it the Minister for Finance has achieved success and that he has been able to meet, what is not the baby, but the grown-up child, without any additional impositions on the people except those impositions on the people who use petrol.  We all know quite well that it might have been, perhaps, more spectacular in one way if, instead of taking the decision in March to reduce the tax on beer, tobacco and entertainments imposed by the Supplementary Budget, the Minister had waited to do so until this Budget.  That would have looked more spectacular; it would have been a bigger gesture and it would have meant a bigger slice off the Estimate, but it was much better for the country as it was done and it must not be forgotten in discussing the Budget that by that decision made in March the Minister for Finance gave away £6,000,000.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt in the world that if the Deputies on those benches opposite were in power they would have left it on and left the burden on the unfortunate people of the country, particularly those in the rural areas who have nothing whatsoever to look forward to but an occasional cigarette and a bottle of stout when their work on the land is finished.  It is accepted that this is a good Budget under the circumstances which we have, and the Minister for Finance has not for a moment suggested that it is anything but that&mdash;a good Budget under the circumstances, the circumsances left to him by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few things which were mentioned in the debate to which I want to refer for a moment.  The whole framework of the Budget is based on certain proposals, for example on the proposal that an additional sixpence should be imposed on income-tax as the Minister's predecessor indicated last October.  The Minister informed us that he was going to hold to that; actually the Minister for Finance decided to make available that sixpence in the £ in order to increase the old age pensions and alleviate the condition <Col N="1793" /> of the pensioners.  On the first Resolution the first thing that the Deputies on the other side of the House decided was to vote against this increase in the income-tax.  Unless that additional sixpence were put on the income-tax it would not be possible to give additional old age pensions, so in effect what the Fianna Fáil Deputies did was to announce that they would prefer to let off the income-taxpayer rather than the old age pensioners because the two things balance each other and you could not have one without the other.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lemass started to inaugurate the discussion on behalf of the Opposition he showed quite clearly that he was lacking in enthusiasm and that he had no real liking for the job which he had to face.  Whether that was because he knew people outside were saying it was indeed peculiar and strange that the Leader of the Opposition and the last Minister for Finance were not in the House when the first Budget of the new Government was being introduced and knowing that put him at a disadvantage in starting, or not, I cannot tell but his first line on the evening of the Budget was that the Minister was wrong in not imposing addition, heavier taxation.  Then we came to the next day and, apparently, wiser counsels in his own Party had prevailed and he changed his tune and he went away from the discussion of inflationary trends and the suggestion that there should be more taxation and came back to the suggestion that the Minister should have made greater concessions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made in this Budget concessions which will be welcomed. The concession by virtue of which the ration of tea will be increased, at a cost of £155,000 to the Exchequer, will be welcomed in every household.  The concession that he has made in regard to pensions will be welcomed. The concession he has made in regard to small depositors in respect of the increased rate on Post Office Savings Bank deposits will be greatly welcomed by the smaller people.</P>
    <P>There have been a couple of criticisms of certain aspects of the Budget to <Col N="1794" /> which I want to refer.  Certain people have suggested that it was unfortunate that the Minister did not reintroduce the excess profits tax that was there while Fianna Fáil were in power.  The Minister has been in power only three months and in three months, with the problems with which he had to grapple, it would be unfair to expect him to introduce a new system of excess profits taxation and I think anybody will agree that the existing system, which was imposed by Fianna Fáil, would be now entirely out of date and entirely inadequate to the circumstances.  I, candidly, would like to see introduced a new form of excess profits taxation and I think that is what the Minister indicated in the last paragraph of his Budget statement, that he had in mind the consideration of a new form of excess profits taxation, one which would be based, not on standards so much as on a proper return being given to the people on the value of the capital that was employed in a particular undertaking.  If there is any continuance of excess profits, I think it will be possible for the Minister to enact new legislation, not merely to repeat and reintroduce the old legislation, which would be unsatisfactory and, possibly, would not allow for additional capital development but which would mean that the excess profit, using that term in the general sense, would be caught by the State and not merely would be caught to a proportion, as it was caught under the previous Administration, but would be caught to the whole extent; that where there is a real profiteer's profit the whole of the profiteer's profit would be taken away.  That would require an entirely new scheme, which it would not be possible or reasonable to expect any Minister for Finance to introduce in a mere matter of three months, when he had to take the whole budgetary position into account.</P>
    <P>I want to make one plea to the Minister.  It is in regard to the petrol situation.  We are all agreed that the one essential thing that must be done is to increase production.  Everything that can be done to assist that increase must be done.  Unless we are able to assist and increase agricultural production <Col N="1795" /> we will not be able to go forward. I want to plead with the Minister to make some arrangements by virtue of which the tax on petrol will not affect those who are using petrol-driven tractors for agricultural purposes. I believe there are some 1,500 Ferguson tractors running entirely on petrol.  I happen to know that there are 91 such tractors in the constituency of Kildare.  In addition, I understand that there are some 750 other tractors which are run on petrol.  I would urge the Minister, in the interests of increased agricultural production, to make arrangements by virtue of which, by taxing and properly taxing the people who are using motor cars for pleasure, he would be in a position to ensure that there would not be anything which might be a drag on increased agricultural production.  If the cost of fuel for tractors is excessive there is always a danger that the work may be scamped.  I know the difficulties that there would be in regard to the prevention of misuse, and so forth, but it ought to be possible to deal with a scheme without the necessity of the Minister abandoning his plan.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will introduce some mitigating provision in that respect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We heard a certain amount from Deputy Briscoe in regard to various matters which had come under review by the Government since they took office.  He told us at one stage that the air lines running transatlantic flights for other countries were all making a profit.  I do not know where he can have got that information because every report I read of an air line shows that there are more and more losses.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that large countries run their air lines and subsidise their air lines for the purpose of having a reserve available to use in time of war.  That is a cheaper method for them than maintaining larger air forces.  That is the only reason they subsidise their air lines.  It is peculiar if, as Deputy Briscoe says, some of the American air lines are putting on additional machines to the Atlantic flight that the advertisements for these American air lines indicate that they can guarantee you a passage straightaway <Col N="1796" /> without a waiting list.  If, as Deputy Briscoe would like us to believe, business is so easily available, then there would be a waiting list to some extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also wept tears in regard to factories and the outlook in regard to tariffs.  The fears that have been expressed by him and others on that side of the House have been quite deliberately engineered by them for the purpose of creating uneasiness.  It is well known what the policy of the present Government and the people on this side of the House will be in regard to industry.  So far as every Deputy on this side of the House is concerned, he is more than anxious to ensure that our native industries are pushed ahead, pushed ahead on a sound basis, not on an unsound basis, that there will be a sound basis to meet the difficult times that may lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of the previous Government's decision on turf.  I find it rather difficult to reconcile his views with one of the items I find in the Estimates.  We were led to believe by his Party that they were interested in burning only turf in Government offices, for example, but I see in the Estimate an item of £45,000 for converting the heating apparatus in Government offices from turf to oil burning.  If the Deputy's Party were sincere, I do not think that item would have arisen in the Estimates.  The plain fact of the matter is that the decisions taken in that regard were taken by the previous Minister before this Government assumed office, and everybody knows that is the position, just as everybody knows that the position in regard to the short-wave station is that an application was made earlier this year for a wave-length and has not been granted for the simple reason that there is such congestion that it is doubtful if another wave-length can be inserted.  We were going ahead quite gaily since 1945 incurring the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person in the country is perfectly satisfied with this Budget. He is perfectly satisfied that it marks the beginning of the end of the squandermania and the beginning of the course towards a sound constructive <Col N="1797" /> build-up of real industries, real achievements, such as the Minister for Finance referred to at one stage during this debate when he was challenged on the question of the Shannon scheme.  It is such constructive work that we must get the proper foundation to start and until we do get the proper foundation we cannot start on the constructive work.  The country as a whole is entirely glad that the Minister has started on the road to that construcive work with this Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the abandonment of mineral development is the constructive work about which Deputy Sweetman is so anxious, the country will not be satisfied.  One matter that received least attention in the debate and which, to my mind, is one of the most important that arises from the Budget, is the abandonment of the taxes imposed in the Supplementary Budget on beer, tobacco, wines, cinemas, dog racing, amounting, roughly, to £6,000,000 a year.  Under our Constitution, the fundamental law, it is laid down that the Government elected by the people alone have the right to impose taxation.  They alone and this Parliament have the right to remit taxation.  Something happened in this country within the last five or six months that probably never happened here in the last 25 years or that never happened in any country.  I want to stress what happened prior to the general election, when the deputy-leader of a political Party met a number of merchants of this State and agreed, on certain terms, to reduce the taxation then in operation, under certain conditions.  I refer to the meeting which Deputy O'Higgins, now Minister for Defence, attended, a meeting of the licensed trade, some place in the city, where he promised that if he were a Minister and his Party were returned or had any part in the future Government, they would abandon that taxation. That is the most damnable thing that ever happened in this country and I hope it will never happen again. Whether that taxation was right or wrong or whether the country agreed or did not agree with the taxation imposed in the Supplementary Budget, this House and the Government elected <Col N="1798" /> by the people alone had the right to determine the rate of taxation in any single direction.  I say it did more damage to this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no reason in the world why that same group should not demand in the next 12 months a further reduction in taxation on those commodities and the Minister will not be in a position to stand up to them.  He must surrender all the way.  This House will be brought into absolute contempt by such a policy.  There is no doubt about that.  I challenge the Minister to say that it has not damaged the interests of this country.  I could imagine what would have happened if the Minister were over here and the previous Government had done anything like that.  He would have made the welkin ring.  He would have made the rafters of this House shake if anything like that had happened under the previous Government, but it never did.</P>
      <P>The Minister abandoned taxation to the extent of £6,000,000, because there was a demand in the country for it. When he was elected Minister, the Press in the country which supported him told us what a financial wizard the Minister was.  They assured the people that the Minister was capable of producing a Budget that would reduce taxation and bring down the cost of living.  But some weeks before the Budget was introduced the Press which supports the Minister changed its tune. When the Minister came here with his Budget, it was obvious to everyone that there would be no excitement about it.  Word had gone out, and the Gallery was almost empty.  The Minister, with an apologetic air, proceeded to read his Budget statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told us, in effect, that he had gone from Department to Department seeking economies here and there, small and large, in every possible way he could get them.  Every economy from sixpence upwards was welcome. Every Department had to contribute. We do not know to what extent, but we do know that they were all forced to contribute, even the Department of Social Welfare under the charge of his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Norton.  The very first contribution the Minister for Social Welfare made was at the expense of <Col N="1801" /> those who draw home assistance, and the local authorities were forced by the Minister for Social Welfare to increase the rates on the already overburdened ratepayers.  He got rid of a liability of £300,000 or £400,000.</P>

Next year it will cost double that, because the Minister is providing half of the amount this year. That was the first economy and it was made at the expense of the poorest section of the community.  During the election campaign, the Minister and his colleagues were at great pains to tell the country that they had a plan to reduce taxation and bring down the cost of living.  This Budget has neither reduced taxation nor brought about a reduction in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>No credit is due to the Minister or to the Government for reducing taxation by £6,000,000 on nonessentials. The Minister reduced taxation on commodities which the people have full control over.  They can reduce their expenditure on them or they can do without them.  It is not com-pulsory on them to use them.  It is compulsory on them to provide themselves <Col N="1802" /> and their families with food, clothing and shelter.  They have no control whatever over what they must expend on these items.  The people themselves have absolute control over their expenditure on these commodities. The people were fairly well catered for in the matter of these commodities.  It may be interesting for the House to know&mdash;I am sure the Minister is well aware of the figures&mdash; that in the year 1939, 671,000 odd standard barrels of beer were retained for consumption in this country, and, in the year 1947, 771,000 odd standard barrels, an increase of 100,000 standard barrels.</P>

In other words, in 1947 the people had provided for them and consumed 100,000 barrels of beer over 1939. I understand there are 50 gallons in a <Col N="1803" /> standard barrel.

I suggest to the House and to the Minister for Finance that there was no justification for reducing the taxation put on in the Supplementary Budget on beer, wine or tobacco.  All the figures go to prove that there was an increased demand and a big increase in consumption on these taxable commodities in 1947 over 1939 and that there was no necessity for the change.  The increase was going on, if anything were needed to show that there was a tendency towards inflation and that those commodities could bear well that taxation.  In taking off those taxes, the Minister and his Government have said to the consumer of beer and wine: &ldquo;The more you drink, the more money you will make.&rdquo;</P>

They were abandoned to placate certain interests to whom promises had been made and who had shown consideration to those different political Parties before the General Election.  That was the only reason those taxes were abandoned. <Col N="1805" /> Then the Minister for Finance found himself in a very difficult position and had to come in here and admit that he was not in a position to reduce taxation or to reduce the cost of living to the ordinary man in the street by one halfpenny. The cost of all commodities, food, clothing and shelter is as high, if not higher, than it was last year.</P>

It will give more staple government, whether it is the people on this side or on the other side who are the future Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few figures here that might enlighten the back benchers of the new combination opposite, in regard to the abandoned taxes.</P>
      <P>In 1946-47 the Minister for Finance received about £11,500,000 in customs duty on tobacco while the figure for 1938-39 was £4,500,000.  I quote these figures as proof, if further proof were necessary, of the prosperity of the country in 1947, and of the wisdom and sound judgment of the previous Government in putting on the taxes they did in the Supplementary Budget.  In the case of wines, the Minister for Finance in 1946-47 received £700,000, and in 1938-39 he received £183,000.  These figures, I may say, are taken from the returns prepared by the Revenue Commissioners. In 1946-47 excise duties on beer amounted to £4,800,000, and the figure for 1938-39 was £3,000,000, showing an extra sum of £1,800,000.  Those figures indicate that there was no reason whatever why the Minister or the Government should have abandoned those taxes.  They did so purely on grounds of political expediency and for no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sum of £6,000,000 could have gone a great distance in reducing the price of food for the workers.  It could have been used in very many ways. The Minister for Agriculture promised a group of farmers from my constituency the full derating of agricultural land.  The Minister for Lands, who is sitting beside the Minister for Finance, was very interested in derating a few years ago.  He might now use his good offices with his colleagues in the Cabinet about derating of agricultural land if he is still as interested in it as the Minister for Agriculture is.  He could have agricultural land derated fully out of those taxes which have been abandoned.  I am sure Deputy Larkin would be interested in having the cost of food reduced for the workers.  I was very surprised at Deputy Larkin and other people who sit beside him agreeing to the abandonment of those <Col N="1808" /> taxes.  I am sure that Deputy Larkin, if only we knew his mind, is not in agreement or was not in agreement at the time about this, but had to swallow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to be told.  In order to balance his Budget the Minister had to resort to all kinds of tactics. He had first and foremost to rob the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund of £450,000.  In addition, he proposes to increase the contributions payable by people to national health insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment <Col N="1810" /> insurance.  That will mean additional taxation for both employers and workers.  Under his Budget proposals indirect taxation is being increased by £1,000,000.  He is also compelling the people who use petrol to pay £1,000,000 extra under the Budget.</P>
      <P>That is additional taxation.  I am sure that will be reflected in the cost of transport and the poorer sections of the community in increased fares and otherwise will pay a fair share of it. There is not the least doubt about that.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to give £600,000 extra in the present year to old age pensioners and to widows and orphans. That is to be given by way of increases ranging from 2/6 to 5/- in pensions but it looks as if the Minister is going to give them these increases only for two months.  He is really going to make money for the Exchequer by granting that £600,000 to the old age pensioners and to the widows and orphans because he is saving £450,000 at the expense of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund and he is saving £500,000 by compelling employers and workers to pay additional contributions in the form of national health stamps.  He is going to make £350,000 in that way.  He is really making a bit of money although, by the way, he is giving more to old age pensioners and widows and orphans. There was nothing to prevent his giving that 2/6 or 5/- extra within three weeks after the increases were announced.  The Labour Party are aware of the fact that last year, a month after the Department of Social Welfare was set up, Deputy Ryan brought in a proposal to provide £2,000,000 extra for old age pensions. It came into operation within a month after the setting up of the Department. A similar method could have been adopted by the Minister for Finance this year, if he wished to provide this money.  I want to point that out to Deputy Larkin and his friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also saved a little by sacrificing the proposal to provide £25,000 for the provision of a cinder track to promote athletics.  If ever there was a mean saving, that is one and there was no necessity for it.  It is a well-known fact, of course, that <Col N="1811" /> the Minister was not himself interested in cutting out this provision for athletics but some of his colleagues or one of his satellite groups were opposed to it and even if the Minister had approved of it, he would have to cut it out.</P>

      <P>The Minister has also decided to abandon the proposal to expend £85,000 on mineral development. There are many people living in the constituency adjoining mine, in County Wicklow, who are very interested in that.  I am sure the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will tell his colleagues in the Cabinet that he cannot continue to be a member of the Cabinet any longer unless the Minister decides to restore that £85,000 provided for mineral exploration in County Wicklow.  If he is doing his duty by the people who sent him here, he will certainly force the hand of the Minister for Finance to restore that £85,000.  He is in a position to do it and he should not let down his old constituents.</P>
      <P>The Minister also proposes to save about £250,000 on the Department of Education, the Board of Works, the Department of External Affairs and the Tourist Board.  There is £28,500 of that £250,000 to be saved at the expense of the Department of Education by abandoning the building of some schools.</P>

I understand that certain development work was urgently needed in the matter of providing new circuits in different centres throughout the rural areas and that is being abandoned.  I want to know from the Minister if that is true.  I want to know if the provision of new circuits, urgently needed in the development of the telephone in rural areas, is being abandoned.  I suggest to Deputies sitting behind the Minister that they should inquire from him whether he is proposing to save £185,000 at the expense of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;in other words, at the expense of additional services for the rural community.</P>

      <P>The Minister also proposes to abandon the erection of the short-wave station.  I have a recollection of sitting on the benches opposite during debates on the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and of hearing Deputies who are sitting over there now, applauding the Fianna Fáil Government for making provision for the erection of the shortwave station.  Why it is being abandoned now nobody can tell.  There has been no explanation.  It is doubtful if it is a question of saving the cost of the station.  From what we can gather, it is quite possible that the revenue from the station would be greater than the cost of running it.  I am sure there must have been some sort of difference in the Cabinet about that matter.  The less said about the amount saved to the taxpayers in abandoning the proposal the better.  It certainly does not redound to the credit of the people who sit opposite in any single way.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1813" /> We have also abandoned the transatlantic air service.  I happened to meet recently a man from another country who was visiting this country for a short time.  He said he knew nothing about the set-up of the country but there was one thing he thought was national sabotage and that was the abandonment of the transatlantic air service.  He was a businessman here from South Africa.  He was no friend of mine but I met him casually.  He had been here three or four months and that was one of his conclusions. He said this country had a chance of getting in on the ground floor to develop a transatlantic air service and that it was in a better position than most other countries in the world to make that, in time, an economic proposition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and his Party told us that they proposed to develop all the resources of the country and that money was no object in developing those resources.  They were going to plant with trees something like 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 acres per year. There is not one shilling other than what was provided in the Estimates by the Fianna Fáil Government, for the planting of an extra acre of land this year in the Minister's proposals.  I wonder why Deputy Cowan and his colleagues in the Clann na Poblachta <Col N="1814" /> group did not force the hand of the Minister for Finance and insist on extra money being provided this year for the development of forestry.</P>

      <P>To balance his Budget the Minister adopted another very extraordinary proposal.  A very large subsidy was provided by the previous Government in respect of wheat and wheaten flour imported into this country to enable bread to be sold at a certain price.  The subsidy was increased in the Supplementary Budget and the Minister found himself in an awkward position.  He could not justify increasing the price of bread and could not justify decreasing the subsidy, but he found that he could not balance his Budget and pay the full subsidy on the wheat imported this year out of the finances he proposed to raise in the Budget, and he had to resort to the expedience of borrowing £2,500,000 this year to pay for the bread which we will eat.  In other words, for the first time in the history of this State, we are not going to pay for the bread we eat this year, but we are going to ask future generations, the people living in this country in future years, to pay for the bread we will eat this year.</P>

You will borrow the money, anyhow, and we will eat the bread this year and, at the end of the financial year, we will owe £2,500,000 in respect of the bread we have consumed.

    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> We have gathered, even since the Government was formed, that the Minister had ideas about breaking the link with sterling.  I am sure that would gladden the hearts of some of his friends, especially in the Clann na Poblachta Party, because they believed during the election and, I am sure, still believe, though their policy in this respect has had to be put into abeyance, that this country is in financial bondage.  The Minister himself was flirting with the idea at one time, but he has never yet committed himself all the way in either direction. During the emergency years, he was a strong advocate of breaking the link with sterling.</P>

      <P>I am glad that there is a farmer in Westmeath who milks a cow. I thought there was not even one.  The Minister for Finance and his Government decided to throw the farmers on the scrap-heap under this Budget. Fifty per cent. of the cows in this country are owned by small farmers who have a surplus of butter to sell in the months of May and June.  The subsidy <Col N="1818" /> of £150,000 last year enabled them to get a price of 2/11 per lb. for their butter.  They are selling the same butter at the present time at 2/3 a lb. and even as low as 1/10 a lb.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is interested in the small farmers of this country.  I am sure there are many of them in his own constituency.  I am sure that many other Deputies from various parts of the country are also interested in the farmers.  I want to know how those Deputies can justify to the farmers of this country the cut in the price of their produce in the two months of the year when they have a surplus.  I do not know how that can be justified.</P>

      <P>This Budget has been a disappointing one.  It is disappointing because many of the national schemes initiated by the previous Government have been abandoned.  Those schemes were initiated for the betterment of the people and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>A country is like an individual.  If a man is an industrialist or a businessman he must either progress or go back.  The policy of this Government is a retrograde policy; it is travelling the back road.  We want to see progress in this country.  I do not mind who forms the Government provided there is development and provided there is progress and provided the standard of living of the people improves. I am sure the Deputies opposite are just as genuine as I am in that respect. Possibly they believe that what they are doing is in the best interests of the country.  But their hands are tied. They are tied because of political expediency. They can make no progress. The Government started off on the wrong foot when it abandoned these taxes on beer, tobacco and entertainment and still kept up the high cost of living.  That was a bad policy.  You did nothing to reduce the cost of living.</P>

      <P>There is no greater proof that the Fianna Fáil Government were a good Government, a sound Government, and that they planned the development of the country on good and sound lines than the concluding remarks of the Minister in his Budget statement.  Those remarks prove conclusively that the country made progress. Customs and excise returns were buoyant and the receipts from duties on spirits and wines were increasing year by year.  It proves also that under Fianna Fáil&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Larkin agrees with the Minister on this&mdash;that the wages of workers in this country had reached such a height that they could not bear any further increase.  Such reliefs were given under social services that the workers of the country could not look for any further increases because of the benevolent and sound national policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of sound planning by the Fianna Fáil Government during their years of office, the finances of this country are in a sound and healthy condition.  The Minister has admitted that.  He found them in such a healthy <Col N="1821" /> condition that he was able to go to the country and ask for a substantial loan &mdash;a loan that was over-subscribed within a few hours.  He found the finances of the country and of all Departments of State well managed and in good, proper condition.  I have yet to hear from any Minister of the discoveries that we were told during the election campaign would be found in Government Departments.  We were told that there were discoveries to be made in every Department of corruption and fraud.  The Minister for Social Welfare, three days after he became a Minister, told his constituents that exposures would be made that would raise the hairs on people's heads. We are waiting patiently on this side of the House for a single exposure.  It is up to the Minister and other members of the Government to apologise for the statements they made.  They know quite well that what helped them into office was the campaign of slander and calumny that they carried on against the last Government.  They know quite well that during the years when Fine Gael were out of office they did not help this country.</P>

I wonder if the increase in the interest on Post Office investments is in the best interests of the country. Deputy Hickey does not happen to be here now, but his one-time colleague, also a bit of a financier&mdash;Deputy Davin &mdash;is.  Deputy Davin, on several occasions here, strongly advocated that interest on local loans should not be more than ½ or 1 per cent., and that local authorities should get money at that figure.  He suggested that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be provided with money at ½ or 1 per cent.</P>

I suggest that raising the interest on Post Office deposits may not be to the advantage of future developments here. The cost of housing would go up and the cost of all undertakings by local authorities, financed out of loans, would be increased.  We would have reactions in many directions.  We would like to know whether the Minister is trying to force the bank rate of interest up by increasing the interest on Post Office savings.  If he succeeds in making money dearer, will that be in the interest of future developments in this country?  I would like him to give some thought to that.  It would certainly put up the cost of housing, and the workers who occupy the houses, unless the Minister makes it up out of taxation, will have to pay more in rent.</P>

      <P>The Government have succeeded in presenting a Budget which will not encroach unduly upon the ordinary citizen.  It is a poor man's Budget.  In fact, the interests of the poor man have been jealously guarded <Col N="1823" /> by the Minister.  It is easy to understand the destructive criticism of Opposition Deputies.  The Minister has brought about a saving of £7,000,000 on the proposals that would have been presented to the House if the Fianna Fáil Party were still in power.  During the election campaign all the Parties forming the Coalition aimed at economy and later they co-operated with the Minister in his efforts to reduce the cost of living. He was then in a position to present a Budget that indicated a substantial decrease.</P>
      <P>I know the Fianna Fáil Party are disappointed because the Budget is a popular one amongst the people.  It does not interfere with the poor man's limited pleasures.  I have only to remind Deputies opposite of the Supplementary Budget which encroached upon the pleasures of the poor man.  The last Government advocated the imposition of higher taxation, but the people gave a very definite answer in the recent general election.  They voted for a reduction in taxation and they have got it.  This Budget aims at giving the people an independent social and economic outlook. The policy of Fianna Fáil was inclined to make the population dependent on one Order after another.  The aim of this Government is to make the individual realise his independence and his right to live his life in his own way.</P>
      <P>One has only to recall the threats to the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and others which were issued before the election that if there was a change of Government they would lose their benefits.  Instead the coalition Government has succeeded in giving higher benefits to those particular people.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to know why the Leader of the Opposition could not be here to deliberate and debate a matter of national importance like the present Budget.  Then again the Minister for Finance is also globetrotting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have noticed the consternation among members of the Opposition at the fact that wines have become cheaper.  Perhaps they had begun to fear that there would be a wave of insobriety in this country, but the Minister for Finance in his wisdom, in his efforts to bring down the cost of living and to impose a smaller burden on the people, has found from experience that a lowering of the duty on wines would increase their sale.  Deputies opposite will agree with me that if diners and winers and those who can afford to do so, contribute duties that will enable the cost of living to be reduced and that will not operate to the detriment of the poorer classes, it is an admirable reduction. We hear the Fianna Fáil Deputies crying out in the name of the poor.  They cried out in the names of the poor a score of years ago but not many years after they took office they departed from the poor man and became what was called recently a rich man's Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidies were debated at length in the House.  Subsidies are only desirable if they are used towards the enlargement of production.  The subsidies that were abandoned only amounted to one penny per head per day.  One must remember that though the rich man and the poor man benefited by that subsidy, in effect, only a quarter of the population, if that, would feel the benefit of that penny per head per day, while the poor man as well as the rich man contributed to the fund which enabled that subsidy to be available. That subsidy was introduced as an <Col N="1825" /> election weapon, but it certainly proved to be ineffective, especially when the extra duty was put on the poor man's smoke and pint and entertainment. This silly Supplementary Budget was abandoned by the Minister for Finance as soon as he possibly could after the election, and the Fianna Fáil Party will never convince the poor that he was incorrect in doing so.  The cost of living could not be instantly reduced; it will take some time but I have the utmost confidence in the Minister for Finance in being the man who will succeed in doing this.  We remember that the effect of the standstill wages Orders was intensified by the price increases by the last Government although there again they cried out in the name of the working man.  They blamed the recent international conflict for all the evils during the last few years, but since the change of Government came about the coalition Government was the cause of it all, and the war had no part in it.  The expected deficit was reduced by something like £7,000,000 and Deputies opposite complained that the Government did not succeed in reducing it by £10,000,000 as they promised, but they went a long way towards that when they reduced it by £7,000,000.  Widows' allowances and the means test were modified and we find that although the Minister for Finance succeeded in reducing the Budget by approximately £7,000,000, he succeeded at the same time in increasing these benefits.</P>
    <P>Increased social services depend on a higher standard of production and in the Budget we find that provision has been made to encourage the development of our main industry in this country, agriculture.  The poultry industry has declined since 1932 and needs encouragement.  Recently we had to go to Britain to ask them to come back here and assist us in developing our poultry trade, a trade which can go into production sooner than any other of the industries which we desire to put on their feet again. The live-stock industry, sheep and pigs, all the things that were the wealth of the nation have been depleted and we find that it is now necessary to encourage an increase in these <Col N="1826" /> things.  We must make up our minds that agricultural products are the only items of which we can produce a substantial exportable surplus, and it is on this that we should concentrate because we need finances in this country in order to import goods which we cannot produce.  The prospects of the poultry industry at this moment are bright, especially with the grants which are now available.  We saw that Britain had to go as far away as Hungary in order to complete an agreement with regard to the purchase of eggs and poultry, and I have no doubt that in the years to come there will be a demand for them in Britain and also for every type of live stock, while there is in our own country a strong demand for pigs.  Farmers and cottiers will be encouraged in the development of these two industries&mdash;poultry and pigs.  The poultry population has declined by 50,000 head in the past year alone but I have confidence that in the coming years the Minister for Agriculture will succeed in restoring this industry to the place which it formerly occupied.  We must remember that if the price which prevailed before the Fianna Fáil Government took office had any relation to the price now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to bring out the position in connection with our national income and the cost of living and to point out that if the price obtaining for eggs at the present time was related to the price obtaining in 1929-30 our national income would now be increased to the extent of £25,000,000, having regard to the fact that eggs at that time were sold at something like 6d. and 7d. a dozen. Now we have an extra duty of 5d. per gallon imposed on petrol.  Imports appear to be the same or somewhat similar to what they were in 1938-39 whereas the imports of petrol and hydro-carbon oils combined are four times as great as they were in that particular year.  Unfortunately this 5d. duty will cause considerable hardship amongst the farming community.  The petrol tractors engaged in the cultivation of the land on a very long working <Col N="1827" /> day use as much as 16 gallons, but on the ordinary they use anything between ten and 12 gallons.  Many farmers will have to leave the tractor in the yard and bring out horses again to do the tillage.  They will be unable to sell these tractors, and they have gone down considerably in value as a result of the increased duty.  I would respectfully ask the Minister for Finance to consider any possible means of relieving this hardship on the farmers, as it is a tax on production. It will tend to step down production rather than encourage it and any economies which the farmers might aim at would operate unfavourably against the drive for food production.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider the introduction of a Supplementary Budget, not the type of one we had last autumn but one which would increase the course betting tax from 2½ per cent. to 7½ per cent. as it is in the ordinary starting price offices in this city.  That would be taxing something that is not productive, instead of taxing productive effort. Petrol used for agricultural tractors should be rebated, if at all possible, in the same way as hydro-carbon oil, which is used in the same kind of article only run on a different fuel.  I understand these tractors cannot be adapted to the use of kerosene and that the farmers will be left with little alternative but to economise or try to sell the tractors and I am confident they will not succeed in selling at a remunerative price.</P>
      <P>I think there is only a tax on entry to dog racing and that there is no tax in respect of bets placed with bookmakers in these places.  A young man who goes to the dogs and sports his week's wages on these races ought to be made contribute to the general welfare of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the petrol duty some firms have been inclined to make a delivery charge, to be borne by their customers.  These very firms were well able to bear the expense of producers and gas bags when there was a shortage of petrol in the past.  The extra tax would not amount to very much and they should be asked in a very <Col N="1828" /> definite way to make their services more efficient and cut down the use of petrol if they want to economise.  Some of these grousers were able to pay for black market petrol in the past, and even in the recent past.  Now that there is a duty of 5d. per gallon, they get uneasy.  Luxury motoring will be discouraged by the imposition of this extra tax and I think that was the desire of the Minister, who wanted to direct petrol into productive effort and to ensure that it would be used in a better way, especially when we consider that the petrol ration elsewhere is not so good.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies opposite have suggested that bus fares may have to go up as a result of the extra duty, but I would like to point out that, calculated on last year's consumption, the 5d. would amount to, approximately only £50,000.  Córas Iompair Éireann were not forced to put up their fares when they had to bear the loss of £900,000 in respect of last year's working. I am sure they will be able to carry on for one year at least with this new duty of 5d. per gallon on their fuel.</P>
    <P>Hackney and taxi owners receive a ration of about 70 gallons per month and this duty will mean, approximately, 1/- per day extra.  The more efficient use of these vehicles will enable them to get back their apparent loss of 1/- in the same way.  Economy and efficient management of these vehicles will save at least 1/- per day to those owners.</P>
    <P>In spite of the food subsidies provided by the Supplementary Budget, the cost of living rose 11 points since last autumn.  The benefits envisaged by the Supplementary Budget were offset by higher duties on beer, tobacco and entertainment, which are normally consumed by the very man who was to benefit from food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Again, we note that some cinema proprietors are suffering for the sins of many, as a result of the abolition of the rebate allowed in respect of stage shows.  The Minister cannot be blamed for the fact that so many cinema owners were encouraged, since the introduction of the Supplementary Budget last autumn, to introduce these <Col N="1829" /> shows.  We know that in some of these places a fellow with a mouth-organ was employed for three and a half or four hours before the audience came along, so that the proprietor could claim that the period during which this man performed was longer than the period of the cinema show and that, therefore, he was entitled to the rebate.  The avoidance of tax was encouraged by the Supplementary Budget.  We have departed from that now, and I feel sure that the Minister will find some way of relieving those who must suffer as a result of this abandonment of the rebate which was formerly available.</P>
    <P>The Army shows a saving of something like £750,000 and also shows a reduction of 700 men.  Opposition Deputies have cried out that we are leaving ourselves in danger&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that we have the assurance of the Minister for Defence that the efficiency of the Army will be maintained.  I do not know what country we intend to invade with this efficient Army nor do I know what great nation we are going to stop if they intend to invade this country.  I have the utmost confidence that the people in general will do all they can to defend themselves but up to the present time we are being asked to pay taxes to maintain something that is unproductive. Our young men in the past have been encouraged to join the Army but those young men would do far more for the nation if they took part in the production of food.  Deputy MacEntee has described the abandonment of the transatlantic air services as sabotage.  I do not think it is any sabotage to reduce the cost of living. That is our aim.  Even on the score of prestige I would say that real prestige exists at home.  If we want to impress any foreigners we ought to impress them by the standard of living in this country.</P>
    <P>There have been savings on turf development.  It is well known that we have sufficient fuel for some years to come.  If Fianna Fáil had their way the people would be required to pay in taxes so that this turf would be produced notwithstanding the fact that it is not presently needed.  I am quite sure that when the need for turf arises <Col N="1830" /> the people will be quite prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The short-wave radio station has been abandoned although, I understand, it was three-quarters way completed. The short-wave radio would be of considerable advantage to the Irish nation in time of difficulty or war but, during a period of peace, the expenditure of practically £1,000 per week for the maintenance of such a station would not be justified.  Prestige begins at home and we will be judged by the social and economic standards existing in this country.  Taxpayers are asked to contribute towards defraying losses incurred by air services under Fianna Fáil in this particular Budget.  I feel sure that the Minister for Finance will not be asked to dig so heavily into the pocket of the Government, if you like to put it that way, in the future to pay losses for some class of experiment which at the outset was bound to show a loss This Aerlínte scheme that has been abandoned was instituted at a cost approximating to £2,000,000. Luckily for the Irish people they were able to sell the planes at a profit and have thus offset the losses to some extent.  However, in this wild attempt to impress other nations, we have spent £500,000 on the training of technicians and pilots.  That money, unfortunately, will go to the benefit of those other nations which will now avail of the services of these trained personnel. It would seem that the expenditure of this money in the first instance was not justified, considering that it could not reasonably be assumed that the services could be put on a paying basis in the near future.  In a recent reply from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a Parliamentary question he stated that the anticipated loss on that service alone would be over £150,000 during the coming year&mdash;and that was only an estimate which had been reduced from the Fianna Fáil estimate of £350,000.  Our population is not large enough to ensure that those heavy planes would have a full pay-load for each run to America and back.  It is well known that even our mail services from here to Britain and the Continent many times go with a very small load.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> Our agricultural output shows, during the past year, a reduction of 5½ per cent. on the 1938-39 figure while, at the same time, our industrial output shows an increase of 4 per cent. during the past year as compared with that of 1938-39.  It must be remembered that these industries have been established and subsidised at the expense of the main industry.  Notwithstanding that fact, the main industry shows a loss in the past year and these subsidised industries show an increase of 4 per cent. in output during the same period.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Finance, along with the Minister for Agriculture, must concentrate on increased production and efficiency.  Hoteliers will, I believe, gladly pay the increased prices on tea, butter and sugar.  Those people who can afford to go to hotels will quite willingly pay the normal price for the food available.  I believe that it is a departure on the part of the Minister for Finance in favour of the poor in order to ensure that certain classes will pay the normal cost of these subsidised foods.  They do not ask the poor to pay on essential goods and thereby make food cheaper for those who can afford to pay for it.  The margarine subsidy has been the subject of debate by the members of the Opposition Benches.  There has been no end to the debate on this matter, but it must be remembered that the margarine ration is only two ounces per week.  That shows something like a penny a week loss to the individual. It should also be remembered that rich and poor were entitled to the subsidy on the margarine and, therefore, only a quarter or thereabouts of the people who could appreciate that subsidy would benefit by it.  Therefore, I believe that the departure was well justified.  Finally, I would like to say that a gleaming ray of hope pierces the gloom of the predicted doom, and to-morrow is another day.</P>

      <P>As one who by my vote put these people, who are now on the far side of the House, out of office I must congratulate the Minister for having the courage to make some provision for the people for whom, since <Col N="1832" /> 1943, I have been fighting in an effort to improve their position.  When I heard the ex-Minister, Deputy MacEntee, talking to-day about the widows and the orphans I wondered if he remembered the day he ordered me out of the House when I was fighting for their cause.  There are Deputies who until the change of Government, remained silent in this House.  What the Minister has said is true&mdash;the dumb have spoken.  We hear them now trying to find holes in the Budget. They talk about retrenchment&mdash;but what was their retrenchment?  The ex-Minister, who is away, had not the courage to stay in this House when the Budget was revealed.  What was his remedy?  Smoke a cigarette less; drink a bottle of stout less; and do not go to the pictures.  That was the Fianna Fáil policy of economy.  At the same time, they provided luxury life for some people and the luxury hotels.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Allen talking in the terms he used to-day.  Deputy Allen is an auctioneer, and when he puts up a house for sale he always says: &ldquo;This house sold so many dozen stout and so many bottles of whiskey&rdquo;.  I move to report progress.</P>
