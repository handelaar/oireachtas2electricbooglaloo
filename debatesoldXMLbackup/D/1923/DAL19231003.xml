      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular knowledge of the facts stated by Deputy O Broin, but I have no doubt that hardship occurs.  Under the Act, however, possession is not to be given to the landlord unless the Court is satisfied that the hardship to him, in consequence of refusing him possession, would be greater than the hardship to the tenant in consequence of being forced to give up possession.  This provision puts upon the Court the duty of deciding which is the lesser hardship and making an order accordingly. There does not seem to be any better way of deciding such points.  It is not proposed to amend the Act, which represents the practically unanimous report of a Committee representative of all sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim of James Fin, Ballinagore, to the old age pension is at present before the Ministry on appeal on the ground of age, and has not yet been decided.  A birth certificate has not been received nor any other reasonably conclusive evidence of age.  When a previous appeal was under consideration the two declarations referred to in the question were submitted, but the deponents had not given adequate reasons for their belief that the claimant was the statutory age.  The evidence was, therefore, held to be insufficient and the claim to a pension disallowed on the 30th April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision on the present application will be deferred for a short time to give the claimant an opportunity <Col N="144" /> of submitting further documentary evidence of age or affidavits containing definite statements and reasons therefor to show that applicant has reached seventy years.</P>

      <P>Payment of salary as National School teacher has, where such payment is regular, been made to all teachers who attended the special course of instruction in Irish held in July and August last.  Payment for services as Professor and of the grants in aid of lodging and travelling expenses has been made, except in a few cases under consideration, to National School teachers and others who acted as Professors during the course.  The claims for the grant-in-aid of lodging expenses and travelling allowances made by the teachers who attended the course as students are at present being examined and passed for payment. The scrutiny of these claims, involving in each case a reference to the class roll, is onerous, but it is hoped to have the great majority of the payments under this head made before the end of November.</P>

      <P>I rise to propose the following resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil returns thanks to the Governor-General for his speech, and approves of the legislative programme of the Government as outlined therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this resolution was proposed, the country was confronted with dangers of a very serious and threatening kind.  It was a time of doubt and uncertainty for all of us, a time when no one could say that the future was secure.  We are not yet out of the wood.  The dangers which confront us are still serious, though of a different nature, but by continuing to follow the path we treaded in the old days and in the manner outlined in the Governor-General's address, by continuing to tread that path cautiously and warily, but withal firmly, I believe that this Dáil and the nation it represents has every reason for looking forward with confidence to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see here that this historic nation is now a member of the body known as the League of Nations.  It is only an embryonic institution at the present moment, but in it are the seeds of great things for the world and for humanity.  Ireland before played a very important part in international affairs when her scholars went all over the Continent spreading the light of reason and the light of Faith, and it is a welcome thing to us to see that we are about again to take part in the same or a similar task.  It <Col N="152" /> is also a good thing that we have participated in the Conference of the States making up the British Commonwealth of Nations.  That will strengthen us, I am sure; it will strengthen our financial position, which is a matter to be very seriously considered at the present time.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Electoral Act, I am sure, was gratifying to all the people who have democratic ideals before them.  By the adoption of adult suffrage our Constitution takes its place as one of the most democratic in the world.  We are also about to put into force a new Act which embodies reforms in the administration of law and justice.  The Irish people were, in the past, reputed, even by their enemies, to be a people that held justice and law and order very dearly, and it was the abuse of law and the abuse of justice in this country that was responsible for a great deal of the disorderliness and the lack of that law-abiding spirit that we found in other countries; but those remedial measures in our judicial system will bring about a return to the old ideals in this matter.  It has been an excellent thing that in the very difficult crisis through which we have passed we have been able to organise a police force.  I think it was one of the most creditable performances of the last Dáil that we were able to organise such a force in the face of such tremendous difficulties. Our military forces are after going through a very critical period, a period during which, in many respects, they had to take on the character of guerillas and which is now over.  We can say with confidence that we have a regular army which, from the point of view of courage and efficiency, is second to none in Europe.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment confronts us.  It is a problem of course that has been made, to a very great extent, by the Irregular campaign in this country.  It is a problem we have to tackle with all our energies, so as to see if we can overcome it, and I am sure, if the same capacity is shown in handling this difficulty as was shown in handling other difficulties during the last Dáil, we will have no difficulty in surmounting it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a measure for <Col N="153" /> the encouragement and development of agriculture has been outlined.  This, as we all know, is the key industry of the country.  It is at the present time, I am sorry to say, in a very serious condition, and it behoves us all, every interest in the country, whether commercial, labour or professional, to put our heads together and to see how this great industry can again be put on a sound and paying basis.</P>
    <P>I have only looked over the Governor-General's address, and I am sorry I cannot do full justice to the various points mentioned.  I will leave it now to the seconder to perform the part that I should have performed.</P>

      <P>I rise to second the motion proposed by Deputy Burke, and I may say that in the last Dáil I had the privilege of proposing a similar motion to that which Deputy Burke has proposed to-day. It was a motion approving of the Ministerial policy.  We have to-day practically the same Ministry as we had in the last Dáil.  We heard that the Ministry were unpopular and that they were doing things that were not right.  Well, the Ministry has been vindicated.  Every member of the Ministry who went up for election was returned at the top of the poll, I think, with one exception.  That shows to my mind that the people of the country are behind the Ministry and behind the Government.  And the sooner, to my mind, the misguided individuals who think that the Ministry have not or will not have the support of the people, realise the fact that they have and will continue to have the support of the people, the better for these individuals themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the same difficulty as Deputy Burke, who kindly said that I would <Col N="154" /> deal in detail with this address, more fully than he did.  I do not intend to do so.  I did deal, to a certain extent in detail, with the Address on the last occasion, but I have not had a chance of doing it this time.  I know that on the last occasion we had a very long debate.  I think, as a matter of fact, the debate on the Address went on for several weeks.  I do not think there is any need for dealing in detail with a subject like this.  The only thing I would attempt to point out is this.  We have the same Ministry that laid a programme before us in the last Dáil, and it is the same Ministry that is laying the programme before us in this Dáil.  They have been vindicated, and I hope they will be in the position of carrying their present legislative programme into effect, as they did in the last Dáil.</P>

    <P>This Bill will be a temporary one.  It is a purely provisional measure and it is framed to meet two administrative difficulties in the conduct of the Courts. The first is the impossibility of holding Courts at the accustomed place, the place named by Statute, owing to the destruction of the building, or for some <Col N="155" /> other good and sufficient reason; the second is the impossibility of personal service of documents in the usual way, owing to the absence of suitable process servers, or some other cause, and it is proposed to legalise service by post.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a small Bill dealing with the question of the renewal of licences. Owing to the absence of Petty Sessions Courts in September of last year, certain holders of licences were unable to obtain their annual renewal, and their licences lapsed technically.  The District Justices this year were in the position that they could not grant a renewal of these licences.  There was no licence to renew, strictly and legally.  There were similar difficulties arising out of the disturbed conditions of the last few years, and this will be a short Bill to get over those difficulties and to enable the licences to be renewed by the District <Col N="156" /> Justices.  I anticipate the Bill will be non-controversial.</P>

That seems to be the intention from the <Col N="157" /> wording of this motion.  I would like to have it made clear if that is the intention. If it be the intention, I suggest it is a rather dangerous principle to adopt, seeing that the Committee of Selection in the first instance is nominated by this Dáil and it might very easily suggest to the Dáil the discharge of members of a Special Committee for non-attendance, but this Dáil should assume the responsibility for that discharge.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That item 9 on the Orders of the Day (The Courts of Justice Bill, 1923&mdash;Committee) be discharged and that it be inserted on the Orders of the Day for Wednesday next.&rdquo;  I intended to move the adjournment of the Dáil this evening for a week as we are arranging conferences and otherwise are engaged in connection with the industrial unrest in the country.  It appears to us that it would be better that we should be able to devote the whole of our time to try and find an accommodation which we hope will be satisfactory.  I have called one meeting for this evening. It was not possible owing to other activities to have called it earlier.  I intend if possible to have another meeting to-morrow and a third meeting, if it be possible, on Friday.  For that reason I would ask that the Dáil should adjourn for a week.  In that case we would not take up The Courts of Justice Bill until this day week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be feasible then to accept further amendments. I might suggest that, as far as I am aware, very few people in the country are in great haste over this Bill, and I have seen it mentioned in the newspapers that the Attorney-General is about to take his place in the Dáil.  If that is so, I would seriously suggest that it would be a good thing for the Dáil and the country if the Government could wait until the Attorney-General could be present here to take part in the discussion of the Bill, and give us the great benefit of his knowledge and experience in dealing with the legal aspects of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Deputy is in a position to be as closely in touch with the general <Col N="163" /> opinions throughout the country as I am.  I made many pilgrimages through the country during the last few months. My impression is that there is a desire for this Bill, but, apart from that desire, the Constitution is not yet complete without it.  This matter has been before the country for some time.  It was objected to in the last Dáil that it should be rushed, but I would say that, even in the case of measures which, perhaps, were hastened in the last Dáil, there was at all times&mdash;it may be admitted by all Deputies&mdash;very fair and considerate expressions from Ministers with regard to recommendations made about the Bills.  I do not know that the Deputy is quite aware of the fact that there was very serious misgiving in certain parts of the country that this question had not been dealt with earlier, and many representations were made to us on that point.  There was in general, I think, the impression that we intended to act in good faith and that the delays were not unreasonable. Even since the Bill had been introduced very little criticism or suggestions which would improve the measure have come from the business people on whose behalf application was made that the Bill should be postponed.  I think there have not been material recommendations from them, and I think the Deputy will be satisfied when it is considered here that it will get very fair consideration, and it should not appear necessary to wait until any other legal gentlemen are returned to the Dáil.  I think the legal gentlemen in the last Dáil were surprised at the ability with which measures were dealt with by those who have not had any association with the law.</P>

      <P>The adjournment from to-day until this day week involves, as I gather, a discussion, first on the motion of Deputy Burke, the Second Reading Stage of the two Bills which have just been introduced by the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Committee Stage of the Courts of Justice Bill.  I want to ask the President if he can give the Dáil some indication of what his intentions are regarding the course of business.  Dáil members were given to understand that they were to come to-day presumably to carry on business, but now they may go back to the country, and that, of course, as the Minister for Finance would know if he were here, involves a considerable amount of expense.  If they have to come on Wednesday, I think they would like to know if they have to go back on Thursday, and if it is to be one day a week session, and also if it is the intention to carry on continuously, say, until Christmas, in dealing with the various Bills mentioned in the Address which has been laid on the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be able to promise two days' business next week and the following week, and I think it is possible that we may then have to ask for an adjournment. The course of business next week would be the consideration of the two Bills which have just been given First Reading.  The third item, I think, would be the Courts of Justice Bill.  I should say that the whole of the evening will be given to it.  On Thursday the Courts of Justice Bill, if it survives, will be taken up, and also on Friday, and it may be possible to sandwich in during these hours, the debate on the Governor-General's speech.  I take it members would like an opportunity of reading that speech fully, as many matters of legislation <Col N="165" /> are dealt with in it, and I suppose the policy of the Government will be open to criticism upon it.  I think it is reasonable that members should have an opportunity of studying it before making any statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that, in accordance with Treasury Letter 159/22 and General Prisons Board's Circular 977/22 the clerical officers in the Prisons Service are entitled to an allowance in lieu of uniform equal to the <i>actual</i> cost of the uniform supplied to the uniformed ranks; whether he is aware that these officers are, and have been, receiving an allowance equal to the cost of the unmade material, and that the cost of making the uniform has not been included in the allowance; and whether, as this means that those officers are not compensated for the making of their clothing and are not in receipt of an allowance equal to the <i>actual</i> cost of the uniform, as laid down in the Letter and Circular above referred to, he will now take the necessary steps to have this matter rectified and the officers put in receipt of the full allowance to which they are entitled?</P>

      <P>An allowance in lieu of uniform is granted to officers of clerical grades in the Prisons Service. As uniforms for prison officers are made up by prisoners' labour, the actual cost to the State is the cost of the materials, plus five per cent. for wear and tear of tools.  The allowance in question is equivalent to such actual cost.</P>

      <P>The bonus payable to Civil Servants is revised every 1st March and 1st September by reference to the average Saorstát cost of living figure in the preceding six months.  This average is arrived at for the Saorstát by ascertaining at the middle of each quarter the increase in the cost of living as compared with the pre-war period; the expense involved would not justify the carrying out of this investigation monthly instead of quarterly.</P>
      <P>The bonus payable by the Saorstát to its Civil Servants is higher than the bonus payable by the British Government to British Civil Servants under the British Agreement referred to in the question.  The relative figures are as follows:&mdash;</P>
