      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the destruction of bridges on the Dundalk and Newry Railway.  If he will have representations made to the proper authorities to have these bridges repaired, and have the line reopened, and, if so, will adequate protection be given to prevent further damage.  If he is aware that the closing of this line has the effect of diverting a large volume of traffic from its natural course to the area within the Six Counties, thereby causing serious inconvenience to the residents of the district and loss to traders within the Saorstát?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim of Mrs Dorringtons, who was partially supported by her son Christopher, was, after due investigation, disallowed on the ground that the extent of dependence which in the case of an unmarried soldier is taken to be the amount normally contributed by him to his home <i>over and above the cost (if any) of his own maintenance</i> for a reasonable period prior to enlistment was less than the minimum specified by the regulations, that is, 12/- per week, before an allowance can be given.</P>
      <P>It should be stated that the regulations governing the matter are based on the recognition of an obligation on the part of an unmarried soldier to contribute to the support of his dependants a reasonable portion of his Army pay, this portion being calculated as 8/- per week in the case of a soldier receiving ordinary rate of pay.</P>

      <P>I was going to explain that, as originally printed, the figures &ldquo;111&rdquo; were a misprint for the figure &ldquo;3&rdquo; of Schedule A.  The reason for this resolution is that great doubt exists as regards the sufficiency of the existing law for assessing profits on railways, fisheries and other concerns referred to in No. 3 of Schedule A in the Income Tax Acts.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular proposition I would like to give an opportunity to the Minister, or, rather, I would like to tempt him to avail of the opportunity which he has not yet taken, of justifying the continuation of these new Import Duties.  They were imposed in Great Britain during the war, and were imposed, I think, for a purpose which is not primarily revenue-obtaining and not primarily even protective, but to avoid the spending of large sums of money outside Great Britain when the money was required at that time in Great Britain. The effect, of course, has been protective &mdash;protection of British industries.  The effect of continuing those duties will, in some cases at any rate, be not protective; they will be very doubtful as revenue-producing taxes, and if they are not revenue-producing and if they are not protective they require some justification. The number of clocks and watches that are manufactured in Ireland, and the revenue to be derived from a tax on the importation of clocks and watches, would probably not be worth the cost of the tax collecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other duties that I have no knowledge of.  But I want again to bring <Col N="319" /> to the notice of the Ministry and to ask for some light on the question of the duties on cinema films.  The case has been put forward that the introduction of this particular tax in its present form is not going to be productive, and it is not going to be protective.  It is going to impede such commerce and traffic as there is in that particular bye-path of trade without any benefit to the revenue. The people concerned have approached me in this matter, and they inform me that they are quite prepared to recognise their responsibility to the Revenue and are willing to meet any demand that may be made upon them within reason for a sum of money equivalent to the amount that is likely to be drawn into the Revenue by this tax as at present administered. But they say that the effect of the tax as at present administered is going to be costly to the Revenue, and is going to mean a certain amount of disemployment. A considerable amount of transfer of industry from Dublin to Liverpool and Belfast, is not going to assist the Revenue at all, and generally will act not as a protection, but as a repulsion of trade from An Saorstát.  I think that some justification is required to be made for such a tax as this, which is not applicable. It does not meet the circumstances of the case.  Where men have offered, as I understand those people interested have offered, to pay a licence duty upon the films, being at least equivalent in its revenue result to the present proposed duty, but without any of the drawbacks to the conduct of the business or resulting in unemployment, I would urge that the offer ought to be sympathetically considered.  And in the case of any similar duty which we carry over, and which is obviously unsuited to the conditions of trade and industry in the Saorstát, we should be willing to alter the incidence of that tax.  Deputy Hughes raised another question relating to another industry two or three days ago.  It was the duty on industrial spirit. Only one distillery in the Saorstát has been engaged in that particular production, and its products have been entirely exported.  The amount of revenue if the product was consumed in the Saorstát, if the industry would continue, would, no doubt, be considerable; but the effect of this tax upon industrial spirit for export <Col N="320" /> to England or Scotland will mean a loss both to the Revenue and to the industry. The industry will be lost, and no revenue will be obtained.  So that here we have a tax not applicable to the circumstances of the country, the effect of which is to kill an industry, to lose the revenue, and to throw a charge upon the unemployment fund.  I submit that the case of any of those taxes that are not enumerated, but grouped under the term &ldquo;New Import Duties,&rdquo; which are inapplicable to the circumstances of this country, should not be continued simply in deference to the general policy of carrying on as we have been.  Where the case can be made against the imposition of taxes of this kind, I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of making a change and altering the incidence of those taxes.  I suppose, as between now and the introduction of the Bill, there will be time for the Ministry to make closer enquiries than they have done as to the effect upon the Revenue and also the no less important effect upon the industry of the country; and if it is found possible to make any change in the present proposals that such change should take place.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson lays down a principle which is incontestable, that taxes should not be continued which, of their nature, are not adapted to the special circumstances of this country.  The application of the principle depends upon a right appreciation of the facts.  If the facts are not altogether as he presents them the principle will not apply, with the result which he has raised.  On an earlier occasion I referred to the public panic with regard to these taxes, and spoke then&mdash;I need not repeat it&mdash;about the operation of the British Act of Parliament which came into operation in August, 1921&mdash;the Safeguarding of British Industries Act.  The Deputy evidently has his mind upon that Act and its operations to some extent at least.  But that was in the nature of protection. I gave instances of the British firms that produced photographic plates and films, and the combination of British manufacturers of lenses and optical instruments who appealed to the Board of Trade in accordance with that Act and succeeded in convincing the Board that their industries were threatened, because the German producers, owing to the difference <Col N="321" /> of the exchange, were able to put their special and highly efficient instruments upon the English market at a price lower than the cost of making them in England.  Deputy Johnson pointed out that some of those taxes which are now in question were not imposed by way of protection, but, as he rightly states, they were imposed to prevent the purchasing in Great Britain during the war of goods produced abroad, and which would have to be paid for.  In brief, it was to stop the exodus from England of funds that were needed at home.</P>
      <P>It is at this point that I join issue with Deputy Johnson.  I quite agree with him we have no films, photographic plates, or sensitive papers that are hurt by the competition.  Unfortunately the manufacture of lenses, which was one of the great things of Ireland long ago, has departed from Rathmines.  There is no lens or optical instrument industry to be affected by the competition.  As regards the legislation promoted in England to prevent the outgoings from England, we are on all fours to-day in the Free State.  I think Deputy Johnson would adopt the principle that exports pay for imports, or rather imports are paid for by exports. Unless we can induce the countries from which those things, cinema films for example, are imported to buy our products, how are we to pay for them?  Remember, too, they are luxuries.  All these kinematographic films for picture palaces no doubt provide beneficial and useful enjoyment for the people; but all the same, strictly regarded, they come under the category of luxuries Surely it is a wise policy on the part of the Finance Minister to attempt two things by the continuance of these taxes.  Firstly, to have a greater inflow into Irish ports by direct trading; and, secondly, to save us from the necessity of paying for those things otherwise than by paying for them with our own products by way of exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be utterly wrong in what I am going to say.  It is a matter of fact, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  Deputy Johnson and the public who write letters to the newspapers are under the impression that there is going to be a double tax upon these things, instead of a matter of book-keeping.  When they are imported into England a duty is charged there and paid there.  When they <Col N="322" /> come along here into Ireland for use in cinemas they will not have to pay a further tax to the same amount, but there will be a financial adjustment, not a double tax.  Now, the reason why there is such an outcry on these things is very easy to understand.  There are firms, like Pathé, that have monopolies.  There are certain firms that will give their product only to certain agents, and these agents have a monopoly in the distribution.  You try to buy a Goerz product anywhere in Ireland and you will find that the shopkeeper from whom you buy will have to get that product from a Dutch agent in London who has the monopoly of the Goerz product for the British Islands.</P>
    <P>Similarly, try to get certain films for exhibition in any of our picture palaces here in the city.  It cannot be done.  You must get them through the accredited agent, who has his profits accordingly. These people wish to have an arrangement by which someone in London is to have absolute control, not merely over the British, but over the Free State trade as well, and it pays them to raise this panic in the papers and frighten the people by saying that not merely is their beer going to cost them more, but their film pictures are going to cost them more.  It is quite a simple matter for a house in Ireland to arrange with those firms and get the agencies lodged here.  That is a good thing to do.  It is promotive of Irish business here.  Why should some of the great film-producing firms of America or of Italy not send those things direct to Ireland?  There are many things, I happen to know, which the Italians would like to buy from us.  There is a proposal at the present time to have two large steamboats in direct communication between one of the Italian ports and Dublin. For all that we send out they must send us something back.  We are not going to export our assets, but our products. I think that the proposition is thoroughly reasonable; that the very explanation that Deputy Johnson began with to account for Great Britain imposing this tax is the very reason why we should impose it.  It is to prevent the balance in the books of those other countries from which those things emanate being against us.  It is a useful, healthy measure to get the balance right.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the case as stated by Deputy Magennis <Col N="323" /> is quite true.  I think he has misrepresented the facts so far as the film industry is concerned.  What it is proposed to do is to extract from film renters a penny per foot for every film shown in Dublin, no matter where it comes from or what agency it comes through.  The film renters and those engaged in the cinema houses suggest that the same proposal that was made by the President yesterday in connection with another tax should apply to this; that the tax should remain as it is, and that this Government should make representations to the British Government for a share of the penny per foot already paid on films coming to Ireland.  If that is done the film renters are perfectly satisfied.  As it is now it means that for some films coming to Ireland the penny per foot will be more than the value of the picture itself, and the cinema houses say that the cost of getting these pictures from the film renters will leave it impossible for them to continue the trade.  They ask that the Government shall divide the penny tax that England gets on every foot of film, that when the film comes to Ireland the Irish Government should get their proportion of that penny.  If they do that it will satisfy all parties.  I think it is a feasible proposal, and that something ought to be done in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the cinema houses of Ireland pay a very handsome duty to the Government; they are unpaid tax collectors.  For every person who goes to see a film picture the Government gets from a penny from the low-priced seats up to 3d. from the higher-priced seats. From that point of view the Government ought to take into consideration the value of picture houses as tax collectors.  Another point of view raised by the film men is that when the penny per foot is put on cinema films in England they have 4,000 houses to recover the penny from and 4,000 houses to rent their films to, whilst in Ireland, when a penny per foot is put on, they have only from 100 to 150 houses to recover the penny from and they say it is an impossible proposition. I have already put papers before the Ministry supplied to me, as I am sure they were supplied to almost every Deputy, setting forth the claims of the cinema men and the film renters.  If the proposals in these papers can be considered by the <Col N="324" /> Government I am satisfied that the cause for complaint will be removed.  Before going on with the tax I would suggest that the Government should call in film renters and cinema men and ask them to show them some way in which a tax can be levied which will produce revenue. I am satisfied revenue is required, and the Government are right in taking every possible advantage that comes before them to get money, but they ought to do it in such a way that it will inflict the least possible harm.  I am satisfied if those in the trade are called in to consult with the Government they will put forward proposals which will produce revenue and at the same time cause the least possible harm.</P>

      <P>I do not know that it would be possible to give any undertaking with regard to the point raised by Deputy Johnson that there should be consideration of this question of fiscal policy between now and the introduction of the Bill.  Fiscal policy covers a very wide field, and to deal with it in this piecemeal fashion and in this particular way does not exactly appeal to me.  Yesterday I explained at some length what our proposals were with regard to the 4 per cent. tax-compounded securities, that we had to stake a claim.  Much the same thing would occur in this case.  We are staking a claim and fixing our position. If you want to enter into any negotiations you do not certainly enter into them when you have got nothing to give away with any advantage to yourself.  There is something to be given away once you take up this position.  There is nothing to be given away if you do not take up this position.  If there be any case for stimulation of the watch-making industry I think it certainly arises if those engaged in that particular manufacture know they are going to have an advantage over outside competitors.  In the same way, I think, with one exception, we have no motor car industry in this country.  There is only one firm, I think, engaged in that industry, and that firm is already under exactly the same disability, if I might call it, as firms in England exporting cars into Ireland.  If you do not take up that position and say you are going to impose these charges you have no case to bargain with, supposing it should appear to you, after consideration, that it was a case in which you <Col N="325" /> would like to make a bargain.  If there are firms contemplating the manufacture of cars, with this advantage in their favour this is certainly an opportunity for them to consider it.</P>
      <P>I do not know as regards the film business that there has been an excellent case made.  If a tax of ld. can be recovered from 100 houses the tax appears to me to be very small&mdash;merely the 100th part of a ld. per foot, supposing that were the charge.  If there are 150 houses it would be the 150th part of 1d.  That certainly, I think, is a tax that would commend itself to the most economically-minded cinema house owner.</P>

However, the people will be afforded an opportunity in the 12 months coming of knowing whether it is the case or not. They will not be able this time 12 months to say we did not give them an opportunity of making up their minds on that. This resolution is not of very great importance, but it is important at least to this extent, that you must take up a certain position with regard to other nations. Even at the present moment we are in what is called in diplomatic language the &ldquo;most-favoured-nation&rdquo; position as far as Great Britain is concerned. The proposal is that we should give even better terms than the most-favoured-nation terms.  That does not appeal to me.  I do not think it would be good business.</P>

      <P>I would like to move an amendment that the tax be reduced to 6d.  I do so for many reasons, as this tax illustrates the essential injustice of indirect taxation.  When the President stated a couple of days ago that Income Tax was the fairest tax that could be imposed I heartily agreed with him.  Although none of us is in love with paying any taxes, and perhaps least in love with Income Tax, at the same time, if we admit that taxes have got to be paid on something and that the Government must have revenue to carry on the business of the country, and if we cast our minds about as to the manner in which that revenue should be derived, we must admit that indirect taxation is unjust because of the casual and haphazard manner in which it presses on certain individuals.  People who drink tea pay this tax; people who do not drink tea escape it.  People who drink beer or whiskey pay a very considerable proportion of the revenue of the country.</P>

      <P>Though there is no essential reason why the people who drink beer or whiskey should pay for the upkeep of the State more than anyone else.  Personally I am in the fortunate position of escaping most of those taxes, but there is no particular reason why I should escape.  Assuming that the position of every citizen of the State were the same, they ought all to have an equal responsibility and liability to contribute towards the upkeep of the State, but a tax of this kind, which falls not only upon the poor but upon the poorest of the poor, illustrates the essential injustice of deriving the revenue of the State from indirect taxation of this kind.  The millionaire and the old age pensioner pay the same tax upon tea per pound.  In actual practice the millionaire drinks a great deal less tea than the poor person, and therefore the poor person might pay four or five or six or ten times the tax upon this particular article compared with what the millionaire pays.  I was glad, for another reason, to hear the President make the remark he did, because, while he is maintaining that there can be no general variation in taxes this year, if he is in the same mind next year we may look forward to a radical alteration in the whole method of levying taxes.  We may see him sweeping away all these <Col N="327" /> taxes and imposing an Income Tax proportionate to everybody's income.  Well, if he does, then, although he has probably a good deal of nerve in many directions, I do not think he would have the nerve to propose that old age pensioners should be taxed upon their income.  They are taxed under the present system.  The old age pensioner or the unemployed man or woman drawing the unemployment dole is taxed by the tax upon tea and sugar, and in many other directions, but I doubt whether the Minister for Finance would have the hardihood to propose that Income Tax should be levied upon the old age pensioner.  At any rate, if he did I think we would be able to demolish his case with the greatest possible ease. In private life I know that the Minister has a heart but as Minister for Finance I am not so sure that he has one.  At any rate, I would appeal to him to allow some remission upon these taxes not so much because of the amount of money involved, but because of the indication of the trend of thought in which his mind is travelling in regard to taxation.  It would be an indication to the people generally that when he has had time to go through the whole question and bring in his Budget next year that he would endeavour to adjust taxation to fit the burden to the back that has to carry it and see that taxes do not press upon the poorest section of the community, and I think he ought, by a small remission, to give an indication that his view would be that in any change made that it ought to be taken off that section of the community and the burden placed elsewhere, and therefore I move that this tax be reduced by 2d. in the pound.</P>

      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding that.  It delights me to hear support from the Labour Benches of this great doctrine that we should, as far as possible, set out upon a course of drawing the revenue from direct taxation rather than from indirect. It is true I owe the Deputy an apology. I thought his eagerness to espouse this cause was due to the determination of the Labour Party to pay no Income Tax, but he made it clear that he is willing to have Income Tax charged upon all incomes that are in the nature of personal acquisition or personal achievement, I may call it for convenience, to distinguish <Col N="328" /> the income that a man gets for his work as from the income which is really a sort of charitable support.  This tax upon tea is to fall more lightly upon Indian and Ceylon tea than upon China tea.  Now, I think I shall have the support of the medical representatives in the Dáil in maintaining that it would be better for the health of the community that a premium should not be set in this fashion upon the drinking of Indian tea as against the drinking of China tea.  The temperance advocates will tell you, and I think tell you properly, that the stimulant of tea is a useful stimulant, and, though not altogether non-injurious, is less harmful, on the whole less hurtful, than intoxicating drink.  The temperance liquors in Great Britain and across the border are to be exempted from the 4d. they have formerly borne, and I think we ought to encourage temperance drinking in the same way.</P>
      <P>I know that as Minister for Finance the President would like to have the country drinking whiskey without limit, but as a man and a brother I am sure he would favour the policy of a sober country.  At any rate, it is quite conceivable that by the judicious use of tea and coffee as a blend for the whiskey, the whiskey might possibly be consumed in a greater measure and with less injurious results.  This point is lost sight of in our discussion about Income Tax and other taxes.  There is nothing in the present Budget to recommend the new <i>regime</i> to the people at large.  After all, no matter how sentimental one may become, whatever sunburstery we may indulge in over our liberty and our self-government, the ordinary man in his ordinary moments will apply as the test of the value of what we have got how it affects his pocket, and if the burden is the same it would be hard to convince him that he has gained because his status has, as an individual, been elevated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old Greek fable of a merchant who was driving a heavily-burdened taxpayer&mdash;I mean ass&mdash;and he came to pleasant pastures, whereupon he descended and turned the donkey free.  After a while he heard the distant sound of oncoming horsemen, armed enemies, and he hurried to catch the donkey and said &ldquo;Make haste, the enemy is upon us,&rdquo; and the donkey made answer and said &ldquo;Will they put heavier burdens on me <Col N="329" /> than you do,&rdquo; and the man honestly replied &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; whereupon the ass answered &ldquo;Then it makes no difference to me,&rdquo; and he went on browsing in those pleasant pastures.  I am afraid the ordinary man will not be inclined to value this boon he has got of citizenship in the Free State, in which he has self-determination, if it is going to cost him more.  I am a strong advocate here, a poor advocate no doubt, but strong in the subjective sense that I am keen upon having things done according to policy. I would like the Free State to be made palatable to the people.  If your Free Stater has a cheaper, nicer and better breakfast table he will thank his God for the Free State.  It is an indirect way of exciting loyalty, and I think it would be worth the money.  It is really a large part of the population that is affected by this.  Again I say I would rather it was put on in direct taxation.  Everyone tells me it is easier to get money when a man does not know he is giving it.  It is easier to get in the taxes from tea, tobacco and sugar, because people will consume these, and they are not aware that much of what they are paying for them they are paying in the form of taxes.  Those who are interested in making good citizens of the State would like to have it made perceptible that what the citizen is paying for is good administration, that the administration is his, that he is paying <i>pro rata</i> for it, and that he is to indulge a healthy criticism in regard to making appropriate demands for it, and that its success and that his success are part and parcel of the one system.  You may get a bigger revenue in this fashion by not allowing a man to know whether or not or to what extent he is bled.  On the other hand, you will promote healthier citizenship if you will let him know the exact measure he is contributing, so that I think there is a variety of reasons in favour of reducing the tax on tea and sugar, the necessities of life with the majority and generality of the people and taking it out of other citizens in another form, rather in direct taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the proposition put forward that the tea duty be decreased from 8d to 6d. I think the Dáil would naturally wish to know quite clearly exactly what the reduction would cost.  I have before me <Col N="330" /> figures provided by the Ministry showing that at the 8d. rate the tea duty amounted to a round sum of about £800,000. Assumedly, therefore, the 6d. rate would amount to £600,000, showing that the reduction called for would be a reduction of no more than £200,000, assuming that the same quantity of tea would be consumed at the 6d. as has been consumed at the 8d. rate, although I think it is perfectly true that a greater quantity would very likely be consumed, and therefore the difference would not be quite so much.  It is generally acknowledged, in any case, that the cheaper a commodity the more is consumed of it.  That is a simple elementary fact in economics, but in any event I suggest that the reduction would not mean any considerable loss at all, or any loss so considerable as would appear in a reduction of £200,000, and for this reason.  We know that it is true at present that the majority of the tea consumed in the 26 counties of the Irish Free State passes through the distributing centre of Belfast, and will so continue to pass as long as the rate of duty between the two is exactly the same. One knows perfectly well by reducing it to 6d. instead of 8d. that the distributing trade for the 26 counties of the Free State, which is at present the monopoly of a city in Ireland but not a city of the Free State, would be captured for Dublin. An increase of business would result, and a large proportion of what would appear to be <i>prima facie</i> loss on the actual tax would be gained through Income Tax chargeable on the extra amount of business done by Dublin merchants that hitherto had been done by Belfast merchants.  It is upon that ground I suggest that if the tax were to be reduced from 8d. to 6d. the loss in revenue would be very little indeed, but the gain in the commerce of the 26 counties would be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further item worth consideration; there is a very complicated frontier between the six counties and the twenty-six counties.  If the tea duty were to be reduced for the twenty-six counties to 6d., while still prevailing at 8d. for the six counties, I take it to be a case proved in ordinary commercial experience that the distributing trade of the twenty-six counties would be captured for the distributing trade of Dublin as against the distributing <Col N="331" /> trade of Belfast.  But I go further. I say that a great deal of the business of the six counties would also pass through Dublin.  I say it would be quite impossible to stop a certain amount of trade passing across that complicated frontier, which would be very difficult to protect, so that actually in total results the Dublin distributing trade would go to supply the six counties.  That would be a very profitable business for us to contemplate. It might be said that it would be an illegitimate business to contemplate, but I do not ask that we should contemplate it as a State but to confine ourselves to what I may call category A of my argument and let category B be developed by such persons as desire to engage in it.  The result would be an increase in revenue, and the argument that I place before the Dáil at present is this, that although it may appear, on the face of the facts that a reduction from 8d. to 6d. would mean a loss of £200,000 in revenue, I suggest that a reduction from 8d. to 6d. would mean very little loss in revenue indeed, and certainly not such a loss as the arguments on the face of the facts would seem to assume.  I think it would be very good business for us.  I think it is excellent that such a reduction should be made in the interests of the people of this country, to whom tea is a necessity: that is a strong argument in itself, and I do not put it forward here because it has been put forward by those who spoke before me.  I add to their argument this further argument, that in addition to benefiting the actual consumers of the 26 counties there would be no loss of revenue to the State, but there would be a considerable accretion to the business of the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise to support the amendment, but I wish to express my sympathy with the arguments of the proposer, particularly when he suggests to the Minister for Finance that in any change which he may make next year he should give some relief to the poor man in respect to the taxes on tea, sugar and tobacco.  Those taxes amount to £6,000,000.  I submit, as was contended here, that tea and sugar are necessities of life in Irish homes and the tax they pay on them and on tobacco, which has also become a necessity, is too large a fraction of the total income <Col N="332" /> to be just.  Before a Commission set up by the British Government it was proved that the budget of one million of our people was only from about 10s. to 12s. a week.  If you bear in mind how hard it is for these people to live I think that the State that extorts £6,000,000 in taxation on such necessities as tea, sugar and tobacco is taking too much altogether from them.  There are £4,000,000 obtained on beer and three and a half millions on spirits.  There are taxes on entertainments, matches, etc.  The poor man pays his full share of those taxes. If you take the rich man's income and compare it with that of the poor man, and if you omit the taxes on tea and sugar, the poor man would still be paying his fair share of taxation.  That £6,000,000, or portion of it, could easily be found elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Why not, as suggested on the other side of the water, put a tax on betting? Anyone who sees the well-to-do people who go to Fairyhouse, Baldoyle and Leopardstown, or Punchestown, or sees illustrations about them in the papers, will be convinced of two things&mdash;first, of their ability, and secondly, I am confident, of their willingness to pay this contribution.  Some people say that you would be putting a tax on gambling.  In my opinion there is something amounting to unconscious hypocrisy on our part in our attitude towards that.  Betting is going on like drinking and it will go on, whether you put on a tax or not.  It is well able to bear taxation.  There is no gambling on that tax, however, for whether the backer wins or the layer wins the Government wins every time. I have great confidence in pointing out to the Government that such a tax is there for the reaching out of their hands, and that it is a tax on people well able and willing to pay.</P>
      <P>The tax collector ought to be ashamed to come to the homes of poor people for taxes they cannot afford, and it is a gross injustice.  The amendment does not go far enough.  I would take off that tax on tea.  It is a miserable tax.  Tea is becoming a necessity and a luxury together. If you take off only 2d. the manufacturers will gobble that 2d. and the consumer will never get it.  I am sorry I cannot support the amendment, but I would strongly urge on the Government to make that alteration in the incidence of taxation.</P>

      <P>I take it that when this amendment is disposed of Deputy Sears will move a further amendment to delete this tax, in order that his conscience and his intellect may be satisfied. All his arguments are in favour of supporting the amendment, and more than supporting it, but he tells us finally that he is going to vote against the amendment. Nevertheless, I have no doubt his arguments will help to convince the Minister for Finance that the amendment ought to be accepted, or that he ought to go one better and abolish the tax entirely. Perhaps if the Minister might signify his acceptance of Deputy Sears' arguments, any further discussion would be unnecessary. I see the Minister declines to accept Deputy Sears' arguments.  I agree in some respects that this particular tax ought to be considered, as Deputy Figgis has dealt with it, in relation to the sugar tax.  It is in the nature of the breakfast table taxes.  It is a tax upon the housewife. This and the sugar tax we may take as taxes upon women, and Deputy Sears has pointed out that the amount is unconscionably large&mdash;too large in proportion to the whole of the taxation.  I find, for instance, that the tea and sugar taxes in Britain comprises but one-twentieth of the total revenue, and yet the tea and sugar taxes over there are alleged to be abnormally high.  One-twentieth of the total revenue in Great Britain is derived from the tea and sugar taxes, but the proposal of the Minister for Finance here is to take from the housewives of the country, and more particularly, perhaps, from the children of the country, who are consumers of sugar to a very great extent, one-seventh of the total revenue.  One-seventh of the twenty millions that is intended to be derived from taxation in the ensuing year is to be imposed upon the women and children.  That is abnormally high, and is an unfair tax upon the breakfast table, but it is more unfair when one considers that this is the article that the poorest all consume.  With the tobacco which Deputy Sears has spoken of, and which, perhaps, is not under discussion, it is one of the little luxuries which have become necessaries. You are proposing to impose on the poor consumers of those luxuries&mdash;to take out of the housewives' basket one-seventh of the total revenue of the country.  It is well that we should examine the incidence <Col N="334" /> of taxation in this way, and if we do we shall find that out of every twenty shillings of revenue that is estimated for, these taxes upon necessities, or what are practically necessities&mdash;tobacco, sugar, and tea&mdash;amount to 6s. 4d. in the pound. The income tax, the property tax, the estate duties, stamps, corporation profits tax&mdash;those particular types of taxes which are taxes directly upon the wealthier section of the community, the people who are reasonably able to pay those taxes&mdash; only amount to 5s.&mdash;one-quarter of the whole revenue.  I contend that the incidence of taxation falls too heavily upon the poor.  The amendment of Deputy O'Brien is one little effort to relieve to a very small degree taxation upon the poor, and, combined with an effort which will be made to reduce the tax on sugar, would help to relieve to some extent those taxes.  The Minister has voluntarily, unnecessarily, and gratuitously, I contend, handed over to the income taxpayers, say, half a million pounds.  Well, that is a very generous amount; but I think we ought to extend our generosity and relieve the consumers of sugar and tea of a like amount, of which half, perhaps, ought to be taken off tea.  I beg to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputies are aware of the fact that last year the tax on tea was reduced by 4d. per lb.  That may not be within the general knowledge, but it is a fact. This proposal would involve a very considerable reduction of Revenue&mdash;Deputy Figgis and his financial figures notwithstanding. I have not got the happy knack of the Deputy of leaving my conscience outside the door when I come in here.  I have to bring it along with me, and I cannot close my eyes to facts.  I do not know that one is justified in urging that &ldquo;Although I cannot reconcile my conscience to this, it will hit the North <Col N="335" /> or someone else.&rdquo;  I do not see that. What would be the actual result of this amendment if it were passed?  It would be that you are going to sacrifice £200,000 at a time when you are not justified in reducing the revenue of the country, and when £20,000,000 have got to be raised through other sources than taxation. The case put up is, that this presses heavily upon the poor as regards tea, sugar, and so on.  From sugar, molasses, etc., the sum estimated to be received&mdash; I am not exactly standing on this Estimate&mdash;is £2,350,000.  I do not know whether Deputies here ever partake of Tipsy Cake, but sugar is used in that. I do not think it is an article that appears too frequently on the dinner tables of the poor.  Other articles are sweets and chocolates, and sugar is largely used in their manufacture.  The net result is, that this item alone is estimated to bring in a Revenue of £2,350,000.  It is urged that all this will press heavily upon the poor, and that they will be the principal contributors to this tax.  I say that is a very exaggerated statement.  I do not know that it is wise, without more exact knowledge of the situation, to take this particular estimate in hand, and say, that from the rich you derive three or four million pounds, and then to say that they do not contribute towards the other items in the list, such as tobacco, tea, sugar, and things like that.  Under these items, the rich certainly contribute their quota.  £200,000 means 4,000,000 shillings, and that is the amount we are asked to save.  Four million shillings means 1s. 4d. per year, per head.  If a family consists of six persons, it means 8s. per family, and that divided by fifty-two means less than 2d. per week, per family, and the unfortunate poor families in this country are to be bankrupt because we will not take off 2d. per family per week.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when he was speaking.  There are other two-pences; there are other methods of describing two-pences, and there are very vulgar descriptions of two-pences that I am not going to tell the Dáil about, but I may say that if <Col N="336" /> we are going dishonestly to reduce this source of revenue amounting to £200,000, we will have to raise it otherwise and that would mean an unjust imposition on other people, having regard to the fact that last year four pence was taken off the tea duty.  I was in some doubt, when Deputy Magennis told us the fable about the ass as to what he wished to convey.  The ass was not asked to transfer his allegiance from the English Government to the German or some other authority alien to his country, and that is the position here.  I remember reading once a story by a celebrated American, or Irish-American author, of the name of Dooley, and he dealt with a type not unknown in this country, called bachelors.  There was a proposal to tax them, and Dooley dealt with that matter and with the various troubles that taxation of that sort on bachelors was calculated to bring about, but he said when it came to the real question of the tax there was not one bachelor in the States but would come down to the counter in the Treasury Office and put down his five dollar bill and exclaim: &ldquo;Hang the expense, boys, it is worth it.&rdquo;  If there are tea-drinkers in this country I do not think they will object to pay this 2d., especially considering it will only cost them 1/4d. per year, which is a good deal less than one farthing per week.</P>
      <P>I do not think a good case is made out from the point of view that this is an unjust or unfair imposition.  I think it will be admitted that the figures are correct when I say that this reduction of 2d. would mean a loss of £200,000 or 4,000,000 shillings per year, and would only mean a relief of ¼ per head of the community.  Is that an unjust imposition?  I do not think it is, and I do not think we would be justified in borrowing £200,000 in order to give relief to poor and rich alike to the extent of 1/4 per year or a farthing per head per week.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I observe that the resolution purports to continue certain duties, and the second part of it declares, &ldquo;it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.&rdquo;  Then we have a schedule dealing with duties of Customs, duties of Excise, and other duties. Anyone who refers to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913, or the memorandum which came from the Chair, will see that the Act only applies to duties of Customs, Excise, and income tax.  The Provisional Collection of Taxes Adaptation Order made by the present Executive Council could not, and did not, purport to alter that.  I submit that it is not competent for us to pass the resolution <Col N="339" /> as it stands, because we would be purporting to give effect by resolution of this Dáil, and not by Act of Parliament, to certain duties which are not income tax, which are not Customs, and which are not Excise duties; we can only do that in the Finance Bill.  The resolution is all right so far as it relates to Customs and Excise, but I submit it is wrong in its relation to anything else, and we would be doing a thing which would be clearly and obviously <i>ultra vires</i> if we passed it as having relation to anything else.  It would be wrong to impose taxes which we have no power by resolution to impose.  I would ask you on those grounds to give a ruling on the matter.</P>

I think we ought not to reject this resolution which has been brought forward on advice, but I venture to suggest to the Government that before they proceed to collect any of those particular taxes under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, they should very carefully consider whether they might not find themselves in the same position as the Bank of England when the Bank illegally deducted income tax from Mr. Gibson Bowles.  If this resolution goes on, I do not intend to vote upon it.

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has suggested this resolution was drawn up under advice. It may very well be that the advisers overlooked the particular point that is now before the Dáil.  At all events, in view of the fact that the memorandum <Col N="341" /> which the Chair circulated, expressly says that the Act only applies to duties on Customs and Excise and Income Tax, I would suggest if the Finance Minister does not want to change this Schedule altogether he should make two resolutions of Number 8.  Let him take that portion relating to Customs and Excise as one resolution.  If he thinks he gains anything by passing the other, which I venture to think would be merely bluff, let him pass the other part of the Schedule as a separate resolution. Otherwise this Dáil is really being treated without the dignity due to it when it is asked to pass something and to mix it up with a thing which is not legal.

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That in view of recent developments towards peace the Dáil is of opinion that it would be in the National interest to release the prisoners now in a precarious condition as a result of hunger-strike.&rdquo; I thought when I was introducing this resolution it would be unnecessary to go so far, but, being in doubt, I gave notice of motion, and it is unnecessary for me to say anything more than I said the other day.  I appealed to the Government to be generous in this matter, and they not having responded to that appeal <Col N="342" /> I now have to appeal to the Deputies. I understand that three, at least, of the women in prison on hunger-strike are seriously in danger of death.  At least they are in some danger.  I do not know how many days they are on hunger-strike.  I never saw a person on hunger-strike, and am not sure whether a doctor can say when, after a certain period, they are likely to die.  They are likely to collapse after a certain period at any time.  If the Cabinet have made up their mind to let them die I think it is very regrettable at this particular time. Rightly or wrongly, many people think that the struggle or the war is over. We may have a blaze up here and there, but on the whole it is safe to say that it is over, that the Government is in a secure position, that they are the victors, and, being the victors, they can afford to be generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I would urge them to be generous in this matter, and not allow these women to die.  Hunger-striking may be right or it may be wrong.  It may be justifiable or it may be unjustifiable, but the death of Terence MacSwiney created a sentiment in this country that will take some time to get over.  No matter whether the strikers are right or wrong, public opinion in this country would be strongly in their favour, and I think it will militate against any chances of immediate security in the country if these are allowed to die.  I think the more generous the Government are at this particular time the more likely are we to have genuine security for life and property in the near future.  I would not urge them to act in this matter if I were not strongly convinced that it will help the Government rather than weaken it.  I am not going to argue about the charges against those on hunger-strike. I do not know why they are on hunger-strike. I do not know whether they have been tried or whether they have not been tried.  If tried I would like to know their sentence; and if there are charges against them I would like to know the gravity of the charges.  I got a statement of the charge against one of them.  That charge is for having ten copies of Poblacht na h-Eireann in her possession.  Any Deputy might have more than ten copies of that paper.  I often had more than ten copies of it.  I was keeping a file of them, and I had more <Col N="343" /> than ten copies.  Others of them I destroyed. There may be other charges. I do not dwell upon that either.  If the Government have made up their minds to let them die, I think the Dáil should know the actual charges and should know the actual reasons why they are being let die.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Defence is not here.  Perhaps it is a military reason, and, if it is, we should have a military answer.  If it is a military reason, I cannot see why Miss MacSwiney, who has been very active, was let out as being of no military importance.  Why should she have been let out while three women who have not been as active as she was, are allowed to die?  I do not wish it to be understood that I was against Miss MacSwiney being let out.  I think the Government were right in letting her out at the time, as I do not think it is right to allow any woman to die of hunger-strike. It may be justifiable or unjustifiable. At any rate, Miss MacSwiney and others were not allowed to die hunger-striking. It may or may not have happened, but it is possible that these people when going on hunger-strike may have imagined&mdash;or they may not have cared whether or not&mdash;but it is possible that they may have imagined that they would receive the same treatment as Miss MacSwiney got.  Therefore they were probably under some misconception</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that all who are on hunger-strike should be released, and, as I suggested the other day, a declaration should be made by the Government, or the Dáil that if anyone decided in future to go on hunger-strike that they would have themselves to bear the consequences of their acts.  But until such a declaration is made I think it is unfair to the prisoners.</P>
    <P>Now I see the Minister for Defence has come in, and I will repeat what I said. If they are being kept in prison for any military reason, I think it is due to the Dáil that we should know the military reason.  It is a very serious thing if we have to put three women to death. You may say they are doing it themselves. Perhaps it is partly true, that they are doing it themselves, but when they have started hunger-striking it is very hard for any individual to give in. It injures one's self-respect.  You must <Col N="344" /> consider it is very difficult for those on hunger strike to break the hunger strike. On the other hand, the Government are in a strong position and can afford to be generous.  I would urge them to be generous.  I am sorry that this resolution had to come before the Dáil.  I am strongly of the belief that it is wise and that it is in the interest of the Nation to release these prisoners&mdash;at least not to allow them to die on hunger strike. Being strongly convinced of that, I have introduced the resolution.  If the Dáil decides to let them die, well, I feel that I have done my duty in trying to save them, have acted as I think best.  Others may feel convinced that it is in the interests of the Nation to let them die.  I can understand that.  I hope they will be generous, in view of the collapse of the opponents of the Government, and I do not think they will regret it.  Even at this late hour I urge the Government to give us a promise that these women will be released.</P>

      <P>I am not a member of the Government, and on this matter I am speaking as a private member.  It is a rather thankless position to be in.  This is an issue that can be easily confused. It is a very easy thing to get up and ask that three young women who are in danger of death should be released.  It is not quite so easy to justify any position which does not exactly square with that. But really the issues are too serious to allow this sort of nonsense, this talk on a question of this sort to pass without some remark.  Deputy McCartan has appealed to the Dáil to be generous.  He has appealed to the Government to be generous.  He has compared the present position with the position which the late Terence MacSwiney took up when he went on hunger strike.  He has spoken about the way public opinion would be affected if any person was allowed to die on hunger strike.  He tells us he does not know anything, good, bad or indifferent, about the merits of the cases, and that it is going to injure the self-respect of these people if they stop the hunger strike.  It is a most extraordinary thing, on an issue of this kind, to get up and admit that he has not bothered to find out the merits, and that he does not <Col N="345" /> know what the charge is; that he does not know what the issues are, but simply gets up in an inconsequential fashion and asks the Dáil to let them out.</P>

      <P>I am quoting the Deputy. Take 20 out of the 26 counties in the Free State where there was not a shot heard until 1922, and supposing some young men in any of these counties were arrested after burning a house in the interests of the Republic and were put in jail and went on hunger-strike. Should they be let out regardless of what the issue was or what their motives were, and regardless of the other relevant circumstances of the case?  It seems to me that is the most childish and most inconsequential way to try a serious issue that I have ever listened to.  Those women are in the very same conspiracy.  They are part of a conspiracy which from the start to the finish, from the top to the bottom, in the mouths of the leaders and in the actions of the rank and file, has been the most dishonouring episode in Irish history.  Is there any doubt about that?  Is there any doubt in the mind of any Deputy about it?  It is the most dishonouring episode in Irish history from every point of view. These women are in that conspiracy. It may be said they do not know what they are doing.  You might give that sort of excuse for people who are not exactly responsible for their actions. But if that is so, and if they are to be let out for these reasons, give these reasons.  If these women are to be let out because they did not know what they were doing or were not responsible for their actions let us do it on that ground, but do not let us come to the conclusion here that they should be released because they are misguided Republicans or are adherents to some ideal which we all admire but which we cannot exactly further by the same methods as they are adopting.  Deputy Johnson some days ago expressed a sentiment with which I am in hearty agreement.  He said that if we had lost a lot both in destruction of material wealth and in moral destruction we had gained something, we had gained a sense of realism.  I hope we have.  It is the only thing we have gained.  If <Col N="346" /> we have gained a sense of realism we have gained something which the country is very badly in need of.  Let us display a little realism about this.  Let us cut out all the cant about Republicanism and all other 'isms and realise that there is something much more important than Republicanism or Free Stateism or any other 'ism and that is the ordinary common honesty and decency that have been outraged for the last 12 months.  You can release these women if you like&mdash;I am just speaking now as an ordinary member of the Dáil, I am not responsible for policy in this matter&mdash;but do not release them, for goodness sake, because they are adherents to any ideal which is a worthy ideal; do not release them because they are merely mistaken idealists; release them if you like for the same reason that you release people who are not responsible for their actions.  But be sure that you know what you are doing and be sure that the country knows what you are doing.  We have heard a lot about public opinion and about confusing public opinion.  It is exceedingly important at the present moment not to confuse public opinion.  Public opinion is being confused deliberately, has been confused for the last 12 months, by public men who ought to know better, and who face every issue that arises, every issue between wrong and right, by the simple expedient of agreeing with both.  That is the sort of thing that is rotting the country.  I hope the Dáil is not going to do it.  I do not care how they treat the question, but let them treat it with some sense of perspective. I was genuinely surprised to hear Dr. McCartan comparing this case with the case of Terence MacSwiney. Does he really believe that there is any analogy?</P>

      <P>In supporting the motion I must say that the Deputy who has just spoken as an ordinary member of the Dáil seems to me to have made no case at all why what has been the policy of the Government in these cases up to this should be departed from now.  There have been a number of hunger-strikers in some of the prisons under the control of the Ministry within the last three or four months, and invariably either the object of the hunger-strike was achieved, or for some reason or other the Ministers responsible released those who were on hunger-strike. That does not seem to be the position now.  We hear to-day that a certain hunger-striker who presumably in the eyes of the Ministry, was one of those parties to a conspiracy for the overthrow of the Free State, has been released.  We know of other cases where the people, as far as the citizens of the country know, took a more or less active part in the direction of the campaign against the Free State.  Here we have now the cases of a number of those who presumably are also parties to these activities and to that conspiracy against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the particular reason for making a distinction between these ladies and the others who went on hunger-strike and who at one period or another were released?  The Deputy does not suggest. Is it that from the military point of view their detention, which in these cases will probably involve their death, is of much more importance, or rather that their position and their capacity for doing damage is much greater than the capacity of those whom the Government have already released?  That is a question which I think Ministers might answer. Now on the merits of the case a good deal may be said on one side and a good deal on the other side.  If there are, as it is presumed there are, grave charges and grave reasons why these people should be detained then surely those charges are grave enough to suggest that there should at least be trials of those people.  If on the other hand the generosity of the Government has been so great and also its forbearance that they have charges against them, but <Col N="348" /> thought on account of the sex of the prisoners the charges should not be proceeded with lest the extreme penalty should be paid by these people, let the Government say so and let the people of the country know what exactly the position is.  On the whole, I think I support the motion, not so much as a matter of heart, but as a matter of head and of policy.  There may, or there may not be in the view of the Dáil an analogy between pre-civil war hunger strikers and civil war hunger-strikers; but, putting that aside, I think that the bigger interests of the State and the greater interests of the people in the State and of the Free State itself would be served if, as a matter of policy, the Government saw that these people were not allowed to die on hunger-strike.  I think that is the real argument in favour of the motion.  I am not suggesting by any means that if these are dangerous persons in reality that the State or the Government or the military should lose sight of them and allow them to continue activities which have been very damaging. I think there ought to be a middle course, particularly at this stage, when it is, or ought to be, obvious even to the blindest amongst the armed opponents of the Government, that that armed resistance cannot with any hope of success go on.  Personally from the beginning I always believed that the methods adopted by these people were not only wrong morally, but wrong from their own point of view as a matter of policy.  The same thing applies now, that it will be a very great injury to the State and to the whole future of the Irish Free State if the Government allow these people to die on hunger-strike.  It is not altogether a matter of turning round and saying these people are going to kill themselves, because the Government is in a position now when it can, unless all the appearances are deceptive, secure that the particularly damaging activities of certain people can no longer be continued.  Under these circumstances, and particularly in view of the present position, I think it would be a far wiser policy from the point of view of the State itself to prevent, if it is humanly possible, these people dying from hunger-strike.  Of course, if one was merely to take a Party view of the thing I would say that the best thing those of us who are ordinarily in opposition to the Government could do would <Col N="349" /> be to sit silent and not to ask the Government to do anything at all, as it would be always an argument on our side to say that they did such a thing.  In the greater and I think the higher interests of the State, and the tranquility of the people, as well as the proper realisation of some sense of law and order and justice, I think the Government would be well advised in dealing with these persons in such a way that they would not die on hunger-strike.</P>

      <P>People are arrested, they do not know what for&mdash;many of them, most of them, perhaps, know quite well that they have been guilty of offences&mdash;but many of them deny that they are guilty of any offence against the laws of the Free State.  They are not charged, they are not tried, and they are not sentenced.  In the absence of a charge, the absence of any recognition of the ordinary processes of law, they protest in the only way that it is possible for them to protest, and they take steps which amount to suicide.  The Government is placed in this difficulty, by virtue of the fact that they do not charge the prisoner, that they have no foundation for keeping these persons in prison. Then, after the protest has gone on day after day, a proposition of the kind that the President has spoken of is submitted. The mind is even more unhinged.</P>

      <P>There is no person I know or I ever heard of who is at present under arrest simply at the whim of somebody.  There is a reason for the arrest of all of them.  Charges as far as I know could be made against the vast majority of them.  I cannot speak now, for I have not seen the eight or ten thousand charges or whatever the number of charges is.  With regard to these four prisoners, we were informed, I think, on one occasion that they struck <Col N="351" /> because they were not tried and had no charges preferred against them.  These particular charges were preferred against them and it made no difference.  Then this particular circumstance occurred in which one of them signed this particular form, and in view of the fact that they had been a number of days on hunger-strike we agreed to accept the same form from the other three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to look at this whole problem sanely with a view to the after effects of the action either of the Government or of the prisoners.  Now I am not going to subscribe to the proposition that a prisoner who goes on hunger-strike ought to be released, rather than that the prisoner should be allowed to die.  But I am going to qualify that by saying that the prisoner must be a prisoner who has had a charge levelled against him or her, and had the opportunity of defending himself or herself against that charge, and has submitted to the courses provided by the law.  In the absence of any such procedure the Government, or any Government, cannot defend itself against the charge of allowing an untried prisoner to suffer death while in their hands.  If it is found, as it is contended by the Government here, that the circumstances of the time will not allow them to formulate charges and bring the prisoners to trial then they must be as illogical on the other side and say, &ldquo;We stand for that, but we will not allow prisoners to die on hunger-strike when they are on our hands.&rdquo;  Unless there is a charge, and unless good reason can be given before a jury of citizens, before the public, and before the Dáil, for the detention of any prisoner, they have no right or authority, and they are certainly very unwise from the point of view of future Governments to allow such a person to take steps that will lead to his death. Suicide is an offence, and it is the duty of the Government who has charge of a prisoner to prevent suicide.  The old practice was, of course, forcibly to feed that prisoner, and it is for you to decide whether it is better forcibly to feed than to release, and if you ask yourself that question, I believe you will answer that the wiser course is the release of the prisoner that is in your hands or charge. In the case of an untried and uncharged <Col N="352" /> prisoner you are trebly bound to look after the health of that prisoner, and I think in the circumstances the only alternatives are that a charge shall be formulated and the trial shall take place within the ordinary time provided for by the law.  Otherwise you have to submit to the protest, a protest that has become habitual and may become the common procedure.  That is a risk you have to take.  It may become the common procedure, but it is the only way to force a Government to adopt the processes of law, and remove the justification that untried prisoners have for taking this course to secure their release. I think that in the case of some of the prisoners in question the offences are probably altogether too trivial to think of allowing them to be balanced by the death of these prisoners.  They are not worth raising a big issue over, and it is still within the bounds and the powers of all the forces at the command of the Government to keep a watchful eye over such prisoners after they have been released.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, on a point of information I would like to ask two simple questions that have a bearing on the case.  Do I correctly understand the President as stating that after the hunger-strike was entered upon as a protest against no charge being made against these prisoners charges were eventually formulated, and secondly if so at what period and what date these charges were formulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter in which a Government cannot act as a Party would, cannot be blowing one way or another for popularity.  The Government must take the rough with the smooth, and do the unpleasant thing with the pleasant thing.  It is not a pleasant thing to keep prisoners who may die on hunger strike, but the Government have to face the unpleasantness of doing these things when necessary.  Now, the question of charges does not come into it at all, nor does the question of trial. We are faced with a great and hideous conspiracy against the people that has cost the country very dear in life and in material.  We are up against the necessity of breaking that conspiracy in order to save life and in order to save the country morally and nationally.  In the process of our campaign we have to take and to <Col N="353" /> hold prisoners, and the military necessity is there to hold those prisoners without trial, and we have executed prisoners without legal trial because of that necessity. We cannot allow a claim to be set up that prisoners have only to go on hunger-strike and we must release them. Our point of view in regard to the matter is simply this; we look at what the prisoner has done in view of the evidence before us; we consider what the prisoner is likely to do, and we decide whether or not that prisoner may be released.  The signing of the form has been made a formality to be fulfilled.  In this decision the thing must stand by what the prisoner has done and what the prisoner is likely to do.  A hunger strike cannot be allowed to be made a way of getting out of prison, and there is no reason for releasing a prisoner who has committed an offence greater, perhaps, than his neighbour, simply because that prisoner goes on hunger-strike, and says: &ldquo;I will commit suicide, or this, or that, if I am not let out.&rdquo;  We have to stand up to that.  We have to do our duty.  We have to do a thing that we regard as necessary, and it has been necessary to take and to hold women prisoners.  We know that a terrible amount of destruction of life and property would not have occurred if it had not been for the active participation of large numbers of women in the struggle.  It is as necessary for us, for the protection of the community, to hold women prisoners as it is to hold men prisoners.  We could not break the conspiracy we are up against if we were obliged to hold prisoners until cases have been brought before some kind of tribunal and a definite charge brought against them, and that charge pronounced by the tribunal to be proved.  We could not bring these ten thousand people to trial, and, on the other hand, we cannot, in the common interest, release them.  It is absolutely necessary for the Government, in the circumstances that exist, to stand on its right to intern without trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the right to intern without trial were taken away, the country would certainly fall back into chaos, and no member of the Dáil can doubt that.  We must stand on that.  We have no desire that any people should die.  We have no desire to hold any people that we could let out, but we cannot allow the people, who would not even sign a form as an indication that there has been any change of <Col N="354" /> spirit, or that they are not likely to attack the State in future, to chose when they will get out.  We must chose.  I think that the Dáil would, even on technical grounds, be very wrong in passing this resolution.  I think that the Dáil should deal with general principles, and that we should not have resolutions passed about particular prisoners.  No resolutions were brought up saying that certain prisoners should not be executed, or that certain prisoners should not be brought to trial.  It is impossible to discuss a case in all its details here, and the thing should be dealt with purely as Deputy Johnson dealt with it, on general grounds, either that no prisoner should be allowed to die on hunger strike or that prisoners might be allowed to die on hunger strike, and the decision in any particular case should be made by the people who can go into it and look into all the details.  We have gone a certain distance to help these people.  I do not know whether charges would have been brought against them all or not in the normal course, but in order to save their faces and help them to get off hunger strike, if they wanted to, charges were brought.  We have 10,000 or 12,000 prisoners. Only a very small number have been charged, although a very big majority of them could actually be charged if we wanted to do so.  The normal course is that, except in very special cases, we do not proceed with charges, but in order to help them to get off hunger strike if they chose to, we preferred charges in all these cases, although it might be that in only one or two out of the four cases, in the normal course of events, charges would have been preferred. Then Dr. Murphy signed a form a few days ago, not the standard form, but a form promising not to engage in the warfare against the State.  Now, if we had been anxious to let people die, or if we had been inclined to be stiff-necked or to stand on formulas, we would have refused anything but the standard form.</P>
    <P>We accepted that form, and he was let out.  We would be prepared to accept the same form in the case of the other strikers, although perhaps it is doubtful whether all of them would normally have been released on signing that form, but the Dáil could only properly deal with this thing by laying it down that no prisoner who had not actually been put <Col N="355" /> through the formality of a trial should be held, in spite of whatever they might do themselves.  I think, in the circumstances of the country, in view of what we have done and what we have had to do, in view of the fact that we cannot allow victory to be turned into defeat by any side-wind, the Dáil must, I think, agree that prisoners may be held, if it is felt that they are proper prisoners to be held, in spite of whatever they do.  I think that the Dáil will, on consideration and looking at the thing, not from a sentimental point of view, but from the point of view of reality, from the point of view of stern duty to the country, having regard to the responsibility that we have, that all the members of the Dáil have, allow this resolution to be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to urge on the Dáil the inadvisability of coming in in a particular case and with regard to particular prisoners, and of saying what course should or should not be taken.  It is not a pleasant thing to argue here about the lives of four prisoners, still less about the lives of four women prisoners, but the Dáil would be well advised to remember that there are ten or twelve thousand people interned, and that it would not have been possible to bring these ten or twelve thousand people before the Courts and charge them. It becomes, therefore, a sheer question of the Government's right, in defence of the State, to intern people, and if the Dáil says that people must be interned and must be held by the Government in defence of social order and civilisation here, then it ought not to come in and say in the case of particular prisoners, because these prisoners have challenged, <i>via</i> the hunger strike, your right to intern them, &ldquo;We think it well we should give way in this case.&rdquo;  You cannot say you should give way in this case unless you are prepared to go further and say the logical thing, &ldquo;You should give way in every case.&rdquo;  Is the Dáil prepared to say that we should give way in every case? This thing is progressive.  I was interested to note that by two Deputies who spoke we have been reminded of previous releases.  Doctor McCartan reminded us of Miss MacSwiney, and Deputy O'Shannon spoke of others.  That is true&mdash; it is progressive.  Every time you give way it becomes harder to take <Col N="356" /> a stand.  I have no doubt that it was a factor in the minds of the women who are prisoners that Miss MacSwiney was released on hunger-strike, and I have no doubt that if these women are released it will be a factor in the minds of future hunger-strikers and it will become more and more difficult for the Government to take a stand on any future case.  We are not faced with the question of four prisoners, but with the big general question of whether we could hold any prisoner who goes on hunger-strike. It is scarcely thinkable that the Dáil would say to-day &ldquo;Release these prisoners,&rdquo; and would say to-morrow or the day after to-morrow &ldquo;Do not release them.&rdquo;  We could not face the sorrowing relatives of future hunger-strikers and say, &ldquo;We do not quite see our way to take the same action in the case of your daughter as we did in the case of Mrs.  So-and-so's daughter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about being out of the wood.  I do not know whether I am an incurable pessimist or not, but I do say quite frankly from the angle of my own department that we are not out of the wood and that we have quite a considerable tract of wood to cover yet and that the aftermath of these last ten months is going to be more serious, perhaps, than the last ten months themselves. In many areas you have conditions bordering on anarchy.  From end to end of the country you have property &mdash;chattel property in some cases and land in other cases&mdash;in possession of people who have not a scrap or vestige of legal title to it.  There are going to be very grave legal problems for any Executive in this country to face in the future&mdash;problems that will make it utterly out of the question for any Executive to be overworried about the popularity of this or the unpopularity of that course.  If they are going to do their real honest duty by the people they will very frequently have to take courses that irresponsible people will not consider popular.  It is an easy thing for the rank and file Deputy to come here and to indulge his tendency to be compassionate, to be humanitarian, to be a good fellow, and he will go home and enjoy his dinner all the better having cast a fine humanitarian vote in the afternoon.  He has not to deal primarily with the consequences of that vote and <Col N="357" /> he may not expect to deal with them for some time at any rate.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the loss of self-respect, to the loss of prestige of the hunger-striker who breaks.  There is a corresponding loss of prestige and loss of strength to be considered for the Government that gives way when its clear right is challenged by the pride and stubborness of individuals.  This is not a time when you can afford to lose strength and prestige in that way.  There seldom, I suppose, was a country more in need of strong central Executive authority than this.  You ask us to give way and do a generous thing because we are victors.  We are not quite victors and we have not been victors perhaps as quickly as we might have been if we took a strong course before this, and we have yet to face the aftermath of the revolt.  We have a huge future of anarchy and revolution to face, and I submit that we cannot afford to be catering for the self-respect of those who took part in that criminal conspiracy against the State. We cannot afford to be whittling away our strength and prestige by doing what some would call a magnanimous thing and what others would call a weak thing &mdash;what I would call a weak thing.  If you are to stand at all you have got to dig your heels in and stand now because if you do not stand now you will not be able to stand hereafter.  If we give way on this point we court a ten thousand hunger-strike and will have to say hereafter &ldquo;while we did not stand before just because we were not in the humour we will stand now.&rdquo;  It becomes more a question each time we give way.  That is the case I put up for a definite clear stand in this matter, for having it well understood by the prisoners and their friends that this is a case where an individual puts himself in the way of a steamroller, which is the State's interest and the people's interest, because the people are the State, and that the individual who crosses the track of that particular roller must reconcile himself to stand by all the consequences of that crossing.  That may sound very harsh, and we have been taunted here with being harsh. We are harsh because we have a stewardship, because it is not a matter of our own likes or dislikes, but the honest and conscientious performance <Col N="358" /> of our stewardship.  A man could not be compassionate when he was one of a group which had in its hand the destinies of a nation.  We have had to grow shells of self-protection and defence because it was necessary to be hard.  It may be said that some of us have grown shells over-hard and impenetrable, but I do not agree with that.  I think that if a genuine compassionate case were put up, where it could be shown that the interests of all the people would not suffer by compassionate action, we would respond to such a case.  Here in a matter of this kind it is not these individuals, it is the general right that goes if you give way and you would not have the right to stand hereafter if you give way lightly and compassionately in this case.  I wish it were possible that every citizen in the country would understand this particular problem as it hits our minds and would understand that in a clear conscientious discharge of our stewardship we cannot see our way to give way.</P>

      <P>I regret I was precluded from being present at the beginning of this discussion.  When I read the notice of motion my curiosity was excited as to what was the recent development towards peace which recommends this proposal.  I do believe that the Executive has crushed the rebellion. But I do believe with the Minister for Home Affairs that the trouble, and the danger are far, far from over.  It is not merely as he put it, the aftermath that has to be reaped.  We have not reached the stage of having completely reaped the first growth.  I understand from friends of his, that Mr: de Valera insists upon promulgating a proclamation calling upon his followers to resist to the death. I have no reason to disbelieve the truth of that.  I understand he will place himself in considerable peril with regard to some of his followers if he insists in exacting that last ounce of service from them.  Therefore, I think we ought not to blind ourselves to the danger of the situation simply because we are entitled to rejoice over recent happenings, which foretell perhaps the coming of early peace.  I, as an independent member&mdash; I suppose I must describe myself as under that category since everyone else in the Dáil insists upon applying it&mdash;am painfully conscious that the representation which is made by the Minister for <Col N="359" /> Home Affairs is one to give us serious thought, and make us pause.  I have not that responsibility in administration which rests upon him and his colleagues in the Ministry.  Whatever I may feel about individuals, or however I may be inclined to feel, I have not that weight, that responsibility, that need of decision at all costs in the interests of the State. I fully realise there is that great chasm between his position and mine in the matter.  Yet, I did intervene a few evenings ago, and if occasion arises I shall feel it my duty to do so again, in the case of one individual who was interned, but who, in the interval, has happily been released, because of special circumstances. I do wish with the Minister for Local Government, and Deputy Johnson so far as I heard fragments of what he said, that the case was not brought before us as a case of named individuals, limited in number, and of ascertainable personality.  It would be better if the Dáil were to deal with the broad principles that ought in the Dáil's conception control the operations of the Ministry in these respects.  That I propose to do now.  I leave out of my consideration altogether the little I may happen to know with regard to those concerned in the particular motion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is this: If a prisoner, charged or uncharged, has got the fanaticism, for it is fanaticism, sufficient to subject himself to all the agonies of hunger strike, and is determined through the instrumentality of self-inflicted suffering to make his protest against whatever it is he feels bound to protect against &mdash;his imprisonment or whatever else it may be&mdash;are we, his gaolers, entitled to take him at his foolish word; and when he insists upon carrying this thing to the length of inflicting death, are we to say, &ldquo;Be it so&rdquo;?  That, I think, is a fair way of putting the question.  If this man insists upon doing himself to death in the name of whatever he protests against, are we justified in saying, &ldquo;Very well, you choose death; let it be death&rdquo;?  There is another alternative.  Refuse to let him damage our cause by this performance, which is not, when seriously regarded, the performance of a rational being.  He has lost his rationality for the time being.  That this is a common view of such situations I submit is provable from the fact that the <Col N="360" /> jury's verdict may be &ldquo;He committed suicide while of unsound mind.&rdquo;  Ninetynine per cent of ordinary juries, I believe, in dealing with a case of hunger striking, would bring in that verdict&mdash;that it was done while in a state of unsound mind.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;We have not exhausted the resources of civilisation,&rdquo; to quote the famous phrase. I would not allow these people to score over me by making themselves martyrs, as undoubtedly they become martyrs. No cause has ever been known to prosper without its martyrs.  &ldquo;The blood of the martyr is the seed of the Church.&rdquo;  If those people and their abettors want martyrs to revive a failing cause, would it not be folly on our part to provide them with what they seek when it is easy to submit them to medical treatment in hospital, and restore them to health and prevent their success in this game? Once they are restored to health, if they are still of the same mind to pursue the same course, re-imprison them, and if they are so demented as to insist upon again hunger striking, deal with them as before.  The Minister for Local Government laughs at that.  It may sound a foolish thing.  It may even have the ring in it of weakness.  What is the other alternative?  Do you call it strength to take a foolish man at his own foolish word?  I do not view it in that light.  I am as full a believer in pursuing a resolute course at all costs as any member of the Ministry, but I do not believe in gilding folly with the appearance of wisdom.  It it not wise to pursue those people to the death.  And there is another alternative.</P>
    <P>If I thought that the release of these people were a weakness and assisted their cause, or rather I prefer to put it, if I thought it would damage our cause, I would not take the present line I take. All life, practically all life at every moment, is a series of dilemmas: of difficult choices, and if it were not so, there would be no need for man to have recourse to prayer before making a decision. It is not always easy to see the right course, nor is the best and right course palpable to every one at every time; but, as between the two courses, I must decide, and my calculation of the probabilities as to each of them, will be the course for betterment.  If I consider, as in this case I do, that to allow prisoners to carry their fanaticism to the last length will injure my cause, then I believe that in the interests of <Col N="361" /> my cause, as a protector of my cause, I should not allow that to occur.  If there were no other course open to me, then I should be in this difficulty&mdash;the case described so ably by the Minister for Home Affairs.  If a man creates a situation for me, as he does, if he attacks me with lethal weapons, and I exercise my right of self defence, and, in taking reasonable measures to defend the integrity of life, I kill him, every rational man believes that I did not will to kill him, and the fault of what has occurred is his.  But, we know from ordinary Christian morality, that to provide me with that defence, with that justification, the situation which he has contrived must be one in which he has left me no other alternative in the exercise of my right of self-defence, but to use the means that come to my hands at the moment that the occasion provides, so that the guilt of his own death rests on himself.  Now, that justification applies here, and would apply absolutely if there were no other alternative.  If the opponent of the Free State is determined that the Free State shall not function, that he will oppose the will of the people by his will, and that he will not allow us to have those institutions in which we place our belief; if he can prevent that by this course, and if there was nothing that we could do, then I would vote for the Minister for Home Affairs.  But if this other course were tried, of putting the dying prisoner into hospital&mdash;again I will excite the mirth of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;to restore him to health he may not be so likely to subject himself to the same agonies a second time. In the interval of his recovery he may see the light.  There are historical precedents that I could mention, if it were not pedantic.  There is the famous case of a great Saint, St. Ignatius of Loyola, who became a Saint during his convalesence from a would he received in battle.  Men sometimes alter their minds about these things when they have the quiet and the time to reflect; above all, when they have an experience of this kind it might alter their attitude and provide them with a new angle of vision.  There is another consideration, a small one, but I think it has been overlooked.  We have between ten and twelve thousand prisoners. Is it suggested if some of these who <Col N="362" /> are now engaged in hunger-striking were treated as I suggest that the whole ten or twelve thousand would straight away set about hunger-striking?  I refuse to believe that.  I will not say there are few who have the courage to undertake a hunger-strike, but I do not regard it as a matter of courage: I regard it as a perversion of a diseased form of courage and as fanaticism.  Of these ten or twelve thousand prisoners how many are prepared to go the length of the fanaticism that we have seen exhibited by the few? I believe the number is so small that we can afford to disregard it, and that there is really nothing substantial in that argument. Now, I am not speaking on behalf of any particular individual.  I keep myself from that on the present occasion.  I am trying to support this doctrine, that we should not permit, or connive at, the self-infliction of death by any other prisoners if by any means in our power we can prevent that unfortunate issue; that, therefore, we should make it our practice that we shall not relent, that we shall not play the sentimental weakling's part of releasing a dangerous opponent to resume his dangerous operations against the State, but that we shall not permit him to injure our cause by putting us in the unpleasant light before the civilised world of allowing our prisoners to commit suicide while in our care.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that this is a case in which the mover of the resolution would be unwise in pressing it to a division.  Nothing that can happen in the case of a division is going to do any good to the prisoners in question There may be political effects, but that is not going to serve the mover of the resolution, and I would strongly urge upon him the unwisdom of pressing a resolution of this kind to a division now that the views of the Ministry have been expressed.  I think it would be a wiser policy, with a view to the success of his purpose, if the Deputy left the matter at the stage in which it has arrived.</P>
