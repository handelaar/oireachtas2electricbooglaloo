      <P>Before the Dáil goes into Committee, may I raise a question at this stage with regard to the Orders of the Day, which have been put into our hands.  I think that now is the right time to raise a matter that I have in mind with regard to item 2 on the Orders of the Day.  On last Saturday afternoon in common with other members I received these Orders of the Day.  No. 2 on these Orders is entitled &ldquo;The Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, 1923&mdash; Committee.&rdquo;  The actual amendments have only been received by me just now. I understand the difficulties that there are in this matter, but it does seem to me not in the public interest, and not proper to efficiency, that we should be asked to consider these amendments within a matter of ten minutes or half an hour of receiving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will recall that when this question of amendments was under discussion at the Dáil before, it was desired that amendments should be in our hands well in advance of the time when they were to be considered.  It was agreed that amendments should be handed in to you, at a certain time before consideration by the Dáil, in order that Deputies should have them in their hands for consideration. Obviously, the slightest glance at these amendments shows that they require a very great deal of careful consideration, to reveal exactly their bearing on the Bill of which they purport to be improvements and amendments.  I suggest that it is not right that we should be asked to consider amendments to a Bill of such importance without consent, until they have at least been in our hands one or two days in advance of their <Col N="382" /> being heard and considered in this Dáil. I urge, seeing that these amendments have only just come into our hands within the last ten minutes, in my own case at least, that the Bill to which they are amendments should not be considered to-day, but that it should be postponed in order that we should have time to give that efficient attention to these amendments that obviously they require.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with legislation here in very great haste.  It might even be said that we have legislation churned through this Dáil.  Let us at least give no further or greater colour to that allegation than is necessary, and also let us see that Bills of this major importance should have the fullest consideration, and that all amendments should be fully considered. Because if we take them up in a half an hour from now they cannot receive that previous attention that the amendments should receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>

      <P>I desire to draw your attention to No. 13 of the Standing Orders, which provides in terms that the Agenda shall be posted to the Dublin address of each Deputy so as to arrive not later than the first post on the morning of the day for which the Agenda is issued, and that it shall contain the text of all questions to be asked of Ministers and all motions to be proposed in the Dáil, or in the Dáil sitting in Committee.</P>

      <P>This Bill, The Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, 1923, was read a second time on Monday last.  When the Second Reading had been passed, an order was made that the Bill should be considered in Committee of the whole Dáil on the first day of this week upon which the Dáil would be sitting.  In pursuance of that Order made by the Dáil the Bill is now up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the disadvantages <Col N="383" /> under which Deputies labour from not having had the amendments put into their hands less than an hour before the Sitting of the Dáil, the facts are these:&mdash;I received amendments until Friday, and I received a very large number of amendments. I had them printed as quickly as possible.  Deputies now have the amendments in their hands at the earliest moment at which we could give them to them.  It is a great disadvantage to make an Order which necessitates taking a Bill without having proper time to consider the amendments.  I, personally, do not approve of that practice, because, speaking for myself, I have not had time to give the consideration to these amendments which, if I may say so, I suspect some of them merit.  From that point of view I deprecate the taking of the Bill at such a short notice.  The Deputies have received the amendments as fast as they could possibly have been got out.  The original mistake was the fixing of the Committee Stage for such an early date as to-day.  In the circumstances there is nothing which I could say or do, or which I could instruct my staff to do which would give a better result than has been obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter it was not my intention to imply any criticism whatever of you or your staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That would have been, and was, very far from my intention.  My intention was directed rather to a practical point.  While recognising that you and your staff have done all that could have been reasonably expected in the service of this Dáil, I say that, nevertheless, this situation having arisen on these amendments of such grave importance to the Bill, which is of itself of such grave importance, we ought not proceed with the Committee Stage to-day, and that we should not proceed with these amendments until we have had them in our hands for at least forty-eight hours, for careful consideration and comparison with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is we cannot consider the amendments in Committee to-day unless <Col N="384" /> we can get general agreement to take them, in the circumstances.  That is my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the explanation is quite simple.  There was no date specified when the Dáil decided to take the Committee Stage on the first day of the sitting this week.  It was not known then what day that first day would be.  Some weeks we start on Wednesday, and in other weeks we commence business on Tuesday.  This week and last week we started on Monday.  We had no reason to think that we would start this week on Monday; it might have been either Tuesday or Wednesday for all we knew.  The fact that it happened to be Monday, at the desire of the Leader of the Dáil, makes the difficulty of considering amendments so great that the suggestion for postponing consideration at least for a day seems to be a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister who arranged the Committee Stage of this Bill for to-day is to blame any more than the officers of the Dáil who were unable to get the amendments out in time.  It seems to me if there is fault at all it is in the Standing Orders, which enables amendments to be handed in up to an hour at which it makes it impossible for them to be printed, and in the hands of Deputies by the time the Bill comes under consideration.  It is open to anybody to hand in a sheaf of amendments up to 11 o'clock on Friday morning, and I think you, a Chinn Chomhairle, out of courtesy to Deputies, did accept some after that hour.  At any rate, it is open to Deputies to hand in amendments up to 11 o'clock on Friday morning for a Bill to be considered in Committee on Monday.  It is physically impossible to get those amendments set up and printed, have proofs corrected, and have the amendments sent out to Deputies so that they shall have them in their hands on Monday morning.  There is no post on Sunday, and it would be absolutely impossible to get amendments properly drafted and handed in due course to Deputies within the time prescribed by the Standing Orders.  If there is anybody at fault it seems to me to be the whole body of the Dáil, which when it fixed Standing Orders did not contemplate the possibility of amendments being handed in so late.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me it would be better if there were general consent to consider these amendments, because I take it if the amendments are ruled out, and if we go on to the Committee Stage without considering the amendments, it would not serve any useful purpose.  It also seems to me that most of the amendments are absolutely clear in their purpose and intent, and could all be well considered without further notice.  If we are to convenience the Dáil it would be better have the amendments considered now than have them considered on the Report Stage, or on the Second Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks obviously and clearly as one who has read the amendments and knows what they contain.  That is a great deal more fortunate for him than for the other members of the Dáil who have not considered them, or have not even read them.  With regard to your ruling in the matter, I understand consent is required before these amendments can be considered to-day.  If consent is to be unanimous, with the greatest reluctance in the world it will not be obtained, because I will object.  I believe that we ought not to proceed with the Committee Stage of a Bill of such prime importance as this, until the amendments to it have been in the hands of Deputies, and under consideration for at least two days in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy who lives in Dublin any consideration for the people who have been brought up long journeys from different parts of the country?  I am sure he is just as capable as any Deputy of taking up those amendments and digesting them.  I do not think it is treating the country Deputies fairly to be taking them up here and sending them away after half an hour or so.  We would be losing a whole day if we do not take those amendments into consideration to-day.  It is all very well for the Deputy who has only to cross the road, but country Deputies should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes may be able to digest the amendments, and grasp what they mean within ten minutes or so, but there are many of us who cannot do that.  It is not, perhaps, <Col N="386" /> fair to ask Deputies from the country to attend here and do nothing, but there is other business on the Orders of the Day.  Many of us who came from the country did not get those papers, although waiting purposely with a view to getting them.  We did not get the amendments until we came into the Dáil. It is hardly possible in such a short time for one to digest the amendments and be able to arrive at a conclusion as to their meaning.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to come to a decision I may point out that the position is that exception is taken by Deputies to having the Committee Stage of this Bill taken to-day, in view of the fact that Deputies have not had the amendments which it is proposed to move in Committee in their hands in time.  Consent has not been obtained to take the Committee Stage to-day, and it seems to me, therefore, that it would be better if we agreed now to postpone the Committee Stage to a later date.  The question is, what date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is not the position simply that the amendments are late but that the Committee Stage is in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the position is that the amendments are in time, but that the Committee Stage is not in order as Deputies complain that they have not received the amendments.  The amendments were received in time under Standing Orders, but the complaint is that it was not possible in the circumstances to circulate the amendments in time to the Deputies.  That is the position.  I think that is exactly what the Deputies complain of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that it is quite in order for Deputies to get any amendment, no matter how contentious it is, by the first post on the particular day on which that amendment is coming forward?  Is not that according to Standing Orders?</P>

      <P>The Standing Order is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Agenda for each day shall be posted to the Dublin address of each Teachta so as to arrive not later than <Col N="387" /> the first post on the morning of that day.  It shall contain the text of all Questions to be asked of Ministers and of all motions to be proposed (save such as these Standing Orders elsewhere allow to be proposed without notice).  It shall also contain the text of all amendments, whether to motions or Bills, intended to be proposed in the Dáil or in the Dáil sitting in Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>

      <P>The gist of the complaint is that we received these amendments as we walked into the Dáil and that there was no time to consider them.  I do not know whether Deputy Hughes believes that a measure of this importance should be dealt with in that cursory and summary fashion.  I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

      <P>(1)  In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &ldquo;subsequent purchase agreements&rdquo; means agreements entered into or deemed to have been entered into by or with the Land Commission on or after the date of the passing of this Act</P>
      <P>Provided that purchase agreements entered into at any time on the re-sale by the Land Commission of land purchased or agreed to be purchased, by the Irish Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board for Ireland, before the date of the passing of this Act, shall be treated as purchase agreements entered into before the date of the passing of this Act and not as subsequent purchase agreements.</P>
      <P>(2)  The expression &ldquo;tenanted land&rdquo; means land held under any contract of tenancy other than a fee farm grant, or lease for lives or years renewable for ever or lease for a term of years of which sixty or more are unexpired, and the expression &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly</P>
      <P>Provided that where land has become tenanted land as above defined by reason of a contract of tenancy entered into on or after the first day of September nineteen hundred and twenty-two, then</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  if the holding is in a congested districts county, the tenancy shall, if the Land Commission before the appointed day so declare, be deemed void as against the Land Commission and the holding shall vest in the Land Commission as untenanted land; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  if the holding is situate elsewhere, the land shall be treated as tenanted land for the purpose of the provisions of this Act vesting tenanted land in the Land Commission, save as to the price thereof, but shall not be sold <Col N="390" /> under this Act to the tenant unless the Land Commission certify that the creation of the tenancy was in the interests of the country.  If the Land Commission so certify the price shall be ascertained as the land was tenanted land, but if the Land Commission do not so certify the price shall be ascertained as if the land was untenanted land.</P>
    <P>(3)  The expression &ldquo;the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in the Irish Land Act, 1909, save that it shall, where the context so admits, include this Act, and the expression &ldquo;the Land Law Acts&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Acts&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in the Irish Land Act, 1909.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 54 a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After the passing of this Act, Sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, Sub-Section (1) of Section 29, and Sub-Section (3) of Section 30 of the Irish Land Act, 1909, in respect of improvements effected by the Congested Districts Board or the Land Commission, shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that certain Sub-Sections of the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909 shall cease to have effect. The Sub-Sections refer to certain applications to be made to the English National Debt Office.  Of course these provisions are now obsolete.</P>

      <P>In Sub-section (2) to delete all from the word &ldquo;other,&rdquo; line 47, to the word `unexpired,&rdquo; line 49, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to extend the benefits of the Bill to a class of tenancy not mentioned in it at all. Sub-section (2) reads: &ldquo;The expression &ldquo;tenanted land' means land held under any contract of tenancy other than a fee-farm grant, or lease for lives or years renewable for ever or lease for a term of years of which sixty or more are unexpired, <Col N="391" /> and the expression `untenanted land' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment brings in leaseholders, those who hold under fee-farm grants, and those who hold for a long term of years.  To my mind they should be brought in.  They are a very important section of tenantry.  They were never able to avail of the Land Acts, and had to bear a much higher rent than was current during the sittings of the Land Courts.</P>

      <P>The purpose the Deputy has in mind is really to redeem fee-farm rents, and rents payable under long leases.  Now, we do not want to alter the definition in that Sub-section.  It is the definition in all the Land Acts in respect to this question.  At the same time we are prepared to effect the purpose the Deputy has in mind in another way.  I want to point out that as far as fee-farm rents, leases for lives, or long leases are concerned they are covered by Section 29 of the Bill, so far as these leases are in Congested Districts counties.  That section says that where the owner of a parcel of untenanted land which is vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act uses and cultivates the same as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, then if the price of the land does not exceed £3,000 the land shall be re-sold to the owner.  That is what it comes to.  Remember this is untenanted land, fee simple, and will vest automatically in the Land Commission under the provisions of the Bill, provided that it is situate in a congested districts county. We are really dealing with landlords, and under the provisions of the Bill for automatic vesting which applies to the Congested Districts counties these lands will vest.  If a man has 200 acres of land held under a fee-farm grant in Co. Galway, and is an ordinary farmer, the holding will vest automatically in the Land Commission as untenanted land.  It is not a home farm.  He farms it as an ordinary farm.  It is not a demesne, and it does not come in under any of the exceptions. Hence it will vest automatically.  We are providing that if the value of the holding does not exceed £3,000 it shall be re-sold so that his case is really covered.  When the land vests the price is paid, the price remember, not of the fee farm interest, <Col N="392" /> but of the fee simple.  The head rent is redeemed, and when re-vested in him it is re-vested absolutely in fee-simple, subject to an annuity.  The definition is important. The advance is to him for the purchase of this parcel of land and vests in him in fee simple.  So far as fee farm rents and leases for lives are concerned in the congested districts counties we have such cases covered already.  I am prepared in regard to fee farm grants in non-congested counties to put in an amendment something like the following, on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a parcel of untenanted land situate in a non-congested districts county is held under a fee farm grant, lease for lives or years, renewable for ever, or lease for a term of years of which 60 or more are unexpired at the date of the passing of this Act, and the proprietor of the parcel applies in the prescribed manner to the Land Commission for an advance for the purpose of redeeming the rent created or reserved by the fee farm grant or lease, the Judicial Commissioner shall after hearing all persons concerned, order the redemption of the rent and all interests superior thereto, and fix the redemption price thereof.  The redemption price so fixed, together with such costs as may be allowed by the Judicial Commissioner shall be advanced and paid by means of 4½ per cent. Land Bonds, and distributed by the Judicial Commissioner as if the redemption price of the rent were purchase money of land vested in the Land Commission under this Act, and the amount advanced shall be repayable by the proprietor of the parcel by means of an annuity calculated at the rate of 4¾ per cent. on the amount of the advance and the parcel shall (if not already so vested), be vested in the proprietor in fee-simple.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect we, at the option of the occupier, redeem the rent.  I propose to put in an amendment to that effect on the Report Stage, by recommitting the Bill when the Dáil will have an ample opportunity of discussing the whole question.  The amendment will be before Deputies for the requisite time and they will be in a position to raise any points they wish.  I should say that we will have to leave the Section as it stands. We are not treating these as tenancies, as it would be incorrect to do so.  They have not been treated as tenancies under <Col N="393" /> any other Land Act.  We are meeting the purpose and achieving the same end by this amendment.</P>

      <P>In a case where a fee farm grant is payable jointly by a number, will the amendment now suggested by the Minister mean that one can buy, whereas the others need not?  I mean to say, does it mean that all those involved in the joint payment must agree to buy under the terms of the amendment, or can one buy and the others remain out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a fee farm grant is held jointly makes no difference. The only condition we make is that we shall not sell more than £3,000 worth. I brought this in relief of the land owning class.  If we did not put in a limitation we would be dealing with half the landlords in Ireland, and they could get this relief.  This is the same kind of land as we are purchasing for the relief of congestion.  A very large percentage of the landlords hold their lands under fee farm grants.  We are only dealing, perhaps, with a percentage of them who are really in the same condition as tenants; that is to say, they have small parcels of land, and they farm them as ordinary farmers.  But the principle is the same.  A very large percentage of the very much bigger landlords hold their lands under fee farm grants of this sort.  We are redeeming the rent in every case, except where the value of the land is over £3,000.  That is the only condition.  With regard to Deputy Wilson's point, the answer is&mdash;&ldquo;no.&rdquo;  Of course, the provisions in the Bill dealing with a reduction in rent between this and the appointed day does not apply to such persons.  None of the provisions of the Bill apply to such persons except insofar as they are land-owners. None of the provisions of the Bill as it stands at present apply to them except insofar as we are purchasing land from them for the purpose of distribution. We are merely inserting this amendment, and it is the first amendment which applies to them from any other point of view.  We merely did so <Col N="394" /> in order to put the small land-owners in the same position as if they were tenants of the same area of land.  We are conferring a very big benefit on them by allowing them to retain their lands.  Under the Act of 1903, and the Act of 1909, this land might be taken to be distributed. We are conferring a very big benefit on them by allowing them to redeem their rents.  As a rule these rents are very much smaller than judicial rents.  A small percentage may be bigger, but in the vast majority these are much smaller than the judicial rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in the case of a genuine tenant who is holding under a long lease that the Minister may have introduced this.  I know that they are pretty extensively held by tenants all over the country as genuine tenancies, and the cases I know of are dearer than the judicial rents.  Our object is to have these holdings treated as tenancies under this Bill.  They are not getting the full benefits of the Bill.  There were provisions in previous Land Acts excluding them.  They were expressly put in for the purpose of excluding them, but that is no reason why we should do so.  The Minister has told us that they will not benefit by a reduction on the current rents due.  Am I to take it also that they will not benefit by the State contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That will bear very hardly in cases where there are genuine tenancies, leases for lives and for 999 years, and all that kind of thing.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider this matter, because they are the cases of genuine hardship, cases of genuine agricultural tenancies which have come in under this form of lease, the same as other tenants came in under other forms of lease.  They are genuine agricultural tenancies, and they are denied the benefits of previous Acts.</P>

      <P>Let us see where we stand exactly.  The Deputy's amendment is:&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section (2) to delete all from the word `other' to the word `unexpired' inclusive.&rdquo;  Sub-section (2) reads as follows:&mdash;The expression tenanted land means land held under any contracts of tenancy other than a fee farm grant, or lease for lives or years renewable for ever or lease for a term of years of which 60 or more are unexpired, <Col N="395" /> and the expression untenanted land shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;  Deputy Gorey's suggestion is to have the sub-section to read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The expression `untenanted land' means land held under any contract of tenancy, and the expression `untenanted land' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;  I take it from his amendment that he means to deal with fee farm grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And he means to deal with leases for lives renewable for ever, and he means to deal with leases for the terms of which 60 or more years are unexpired. Well, fee farm grants are fee simple lands.  Some of the biggest land-owners in Ireland hold their lands under fee farm grants.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of very large land owners hold their lands under leases of lives renewable for ever.  Deputy Gorey is dealing exactly with the tenures of the land owners whom we are purchasing land from.  I agree there is a big distinction; the distinction, however, is in the size of the land, and the manner in which it is worked, but remember he is dealing with exactly the same tenures as the land owners with whom we are dealing in the rest of the Bill, from whom we are taking land.  That is the position. No other Bill did deal with them.  We cannot regard them as agricultural tenants or tenants in the same sense as judicial tenants.  If we regarded them as tenants we would have the extraordinary anomaly that a man would be at the same time both landlord and tenant, or rather he would be getting the provisions of the Bill as a landlord, and for the same land and the same tenure, he would be getting the provisions of the Bill as tenant.  That is impossible, and it cannot be done.  There is no way out of that.  As the Bill stands at the moment, this land vests in the Congested Districts Counties.  It vests in the Land Commission for the relief of congestion automatically as untenanted land.  There is no question about that.  This land under the provision of the Bill as it stands will vest in the Land Commission automatically as untenanted land for the relief of congestion.  We are conferring a benefit on the class of cases we are <Col N="396" /> considering here which they did not get under any other Act, and there is a considerable difference of opinion about allowing them to redeem their rents.  It is quite common to have a fee farm rent of £20 on farms of four or five hundred acres.  It is quite common to have 2s. an acre on leases for lives renewable for ever.  The Deputy sees the thing only from his own point of view.  He knows a few small lease holders, and he knows probably a few small fee farms grantees. He is looking at it from that point of view, and he wants to put in provisions in the Bill which would deal not only with these few small lease holders and these few small fee farm grantees, but with practically all the landlords in the country, making them landlords in one section and tenants in another.  I do not say for a moment, even in the case of small lease holders, or small fee farm grantees, that there are not rents which are high.  There may be a small percentage where the rents are high, but in the majority of cases they are much lower than judicial rents.  The reason I inserted this provision, apart altogether from the necessity of making a clear distinction between the land owner and the owner of a fee simple farm, was that if we treated them in any other way it is probable that in fifty or sixty per cent. of cases the annuity they would be paying would be higher than the original rent.  That would happen.  If the Land Commission is to go down on the holding of a man of thirty or forty acres held under a fee farm rent the Land Commission would have to value it as a non-judicial tenancy if we accepted Deputy Gorey's suggestion, and they would have to value it on the lines of what is its fair value as a non-judicial tenancy, and the procedure possibly would be that they would fix a third term rent which would in many cases be much higher than the fee farm rent.  Capitalise that, and the result would be that in the greater number of these cases the annuity would be actually higher than the fee farm rent if the Deputy only saw it.  However, we can argue this on the re-committal of the Bill.  This would achieve its purpose and do justice more effectively than his own suggestion.  What he wants is to redeem the rent at a redemption price.  We are not going to treat them as tenants because they are not tenants, and because <Col N="397" /> we do not want to have the Bill ridiculously drafted.  I will put in an amendment like that on re-committal.  The Deputy has a copy of it, and we can argue it at length, and have the benefit of a couple of days to consider the whole question.</P>

My own view is that Clause (<i>a</i>) should be left in.

      <P>Perhaps upon this motion the question that I want to raise will most conveniently come up.  I would like the Minister in charge of the Bill to give me some assurances upon this matter.  The question I want to raise is in regard to land in the vicinity of towns.  It was pointed out that the 1903 Act provided that where an estate was in the main agricultural and pastoral, towns situated thereon might be included in the sale of such estates.  It is said that the proposal in this Bill is retrospective, because there is practically a repeal of the 1903 Act as far as these estates are concerned by the provision that even a holding of itself must be in greater part or substantially agricultural.  That may or may not be a correct reading, and I would like the Minister to reassure us upon the matter, and say whether, in the case of tenants who have already purchased under the 1903 Act, their interests have been acquired, or may be acquired under that Act from the Commissioners, and whether the Commissioners are likely to adjudge their present rights and accruing benefits under that Act rather by the new powers they are getting under this Act than by the powers they have under the old Act.  That is the case put to me, and perhaps the Minister, who understands it a good deal better than I do, will explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle we accepted <Col N="400" /> in connection with this Act was the principle of dealing with all tenancies both agricultural and pastoral, or which are either partly agricultural or partly pastoral.  If they are purely agricultural and purely pastoral, it does not matter whether they were judicial or non-judicial, present or future.  We deal with them all.  That is the principle we went on, and if we are to call this a Land Purchase Bill, or a Land Bill at all, you could not make the definition any wider.  If you wish to widen it, we would have to bring in houses pure and simple.  That is the only possible extension.  Any further extension would bring in houses pure and simple, apart from land.  We are dealing with the holdings agricultural or pastoral, and we deal with them whether judicial or non-judicial.  That was the principle we accepted.  We could go no further without actually dealing with houses as such.  I think that is a sound principle. In any case we would have to re-christen the Act if it dealt with anything else.  It is very true that small towns under the Land Purchase Act of 1903, by reason of the fact that they were on estates&mdash;towns like Athenry, which was regarded as a village on a big estate&mdash;were sold.  We are not dealing with a man with a house in a town and no land.  The 1903-1909 Acts did not deal with such people to any appreciable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people had the good luck to come within the terms of the 1903 Act by reason of the fact that they lived in very small towns which were on very large estates.  The Commissioners decided that the fact that the town was on a large estate really made no difference, and held that it was mainly agricultural.  We are going a long way further than the 1903 Act.  We are selling town parks to the owners.  That is at least ten times as great a concession as the advantages which a few small towns got under the 1903 Act.  Whether the town is big or small, if a man is the owner of a genuine town park, and has a future tenancy, we are selling to him.  That applies to every town, big and small, and considerably outweighs anything that may be urged against the Act by reason of the fact that we do not deal with the owner of a shop in some country town to which there is no land attached.  That is my answer to the first part of the question. With regard to the second part, we do <Col N="401" /> not touch in any way the rights of people who have purchased, whether they be residents in a town or agricultural tenants in the country.  We do not interfere with the rights of anyone who has purchased under the previous Acts, with the exception, of course, that under this Bill we propose to have the power to take up even a purchased holding for the relief of congestion, but that does not affect the point which the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>The Orders of the Day for to-morrow have probably been printed by now, and will shortly be in circulation.  Would it not be convenient if we took the Committee Stage of this on Wednesday in order not to upset to-morrow's Orders of the Day?</P>

      <P>We have adopted the procedure of printing all the amendments in a separate sheet, so that we can follow the Committee Stage of the Bill throughout.  These amendments are now in the hands of the Deputies. To-morrow's Order Paper simply contains &ldquo;Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, Committee Stage Resumed,&rdquo; so there is no difficulty whatever in taking that to-morrow.</P>
