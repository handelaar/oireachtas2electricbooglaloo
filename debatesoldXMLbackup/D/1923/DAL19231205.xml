      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether by means of a Clearing House established in Dublin between the Inland Revenue Commissioners of Great Britain and Saorstát Eireann, or otherwise, it could be brought about that one claim only should be made on the citizens of Saorstát Eireann in respect of dividends paid by companies registered in Great Britain and other British securities; whether by this means the Irish Income Tax-payer should only have to pay one sum; viz., the higher of the two rates of Income Tax then prevailing in the respective countries, and any adjustment necessary between the two Governments would be fixed through their respective representatives in the Clearing House; and whether he would consider the advisability of consulting the British Government with a view to the establishment of such a Clearing House?</P>

      <NameTxt>AILFRID O BROIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the large number of complaints being made by unemployed men and women with reference to delay in paying the unemployment money, if he is aware that persons are signing for six and seven weeks before they receive their allowance; if he will take steps to speed up the consideration of all such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (replying for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not aware of any cases in which six or seven weeks delay has occurred in the payment of benefit to those entitled to it, and cannot investigate such statements without particulars of the cases the Deputy has in mind.  It is the fact that some delay in authorising claims occurred at the beginning of a new benefit year on October 17th, last, because the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, necessitated the balancing at that date of the account of each insured contributor.  This work was, however, completed some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he would not consider the advisability of merely ringing up the Exchange and asking whether the statement contained in the question is true.  Nine unemployed men called on me on the morning I put down the question, and they told me that they had been signing for seven weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in the <Col N="1375" /> answer that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has not heard of any cases in which for six or seven weeks unemployed men had been signing up.  If there are nine specific cases, and if you can give those nine names, they will be investigated immediately by the Ministry.  It was pointed out that there was some delay about the 17th October, owing to having to balance the books of each contributor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, will the Minister be surprised to know that people have been signing for 12 or 14 weeks in parts of the country?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in the answer that as far as the Minister knows there has been no delay of six or seven weeks.  Some delay occurred about the 17th October, as a result of having to balance the books of contributors.  If the Deputies have any cases which they wish the Minister to investigate, they can give the names.  I do not think he could go further than that, except to hold an inquiry.</P>

      <P>asked the Postmaster - General whether, having regard to the fact that there is only a tri-weekly delivery of letters in the rural districts, with the consequence that many people in those districts call for their letters at the Post Offices on Sundays, steps will not be taken to discontinue the charge which is at present made for handing those letters to callers.</P>

      <NameTxt>POSTMASTER-GENERAL (Mr J.J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension.  The delivery of letters in rural districts is not restricted generally to three days a week, there being a large number of posts working on six days a week.  All Post Offices other than those at which <Col N="1376" /> telegraph business is transacted, are closed on Sundays, and there is no delivery of letters to callers at any offices on that day.  Whether it is advisable to revert to postal labour on Sundays which, apart from other objections, would entail additional expenditure, is another matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances in which persons lost arms, prior to the Truce, varied in so many cases that I am afraid no general statement could be made.  For the present, I am afraid nothing but an ordinary statement of claim supported by any receipt that might have been obtained at the time is all that anybody wishing to make a claim can make.  It may be possible that after the receipt of a certain number of claims like those that the form of application may be systematised, but I have my doubts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he will state what soldiers (if any) have permission to carry arms when off duty; what steps are taken to see that soldiers who have not such permission do not take arms out of barracks except when going on duty; whether there is <Col N="1380" /> any regulation whereby a soldier when returning off duty must deliver up any arms he may have carried when on duty and give a strict account of all ammunition served out to him when going on such duty; further, whether in view of the many regrettable occurrences due to the carrying of arms by soldiers off duty, the Minister will impress on all concerned the necessity for a strict observance of the regulations governing the carrying of arms.</P>

      <P>No soldier has permission to carry arms when off duty except in very special cases, when the Provost Marshal issues the necessary authority.  Military policemen on duty at all exit gates from barracks have instructions to search any soldier suspected of being in unauthorised possession of arms; soldiers returning off duty are not required to give up their arms, but they must give a strict account of all ammunition issued to them when going on duty.  Instructions are issued from time to time impressing on all ranks the necessity for a strict observance of the regulations governing the carrying of arms.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of men discharged from the Army are not eligible for unemployment benefit because they have no contributions to their credit.  Such cases are limited to men who, before joining the Army, were not normally employed in an insurable occupation, and they are, consequently, in no worse position because of their Army service. Where a man normally employed in an <Col N="1381" /> insurable occupation joined the Army, the contributions necessary to keep him in insurance are paid, although Army service is not an insurable occupation. This position could not be altered without legislation.</P>

The President said that one of these reports&mdash; the report of the Canal Commission&mdash; was then being printed and would be <Col N="1383" /> available in a week.

      <P>It will be circulated, certainly, before the end of the week.  There may have been some delay in supplying the necessary number of copies, but a certain number of copies are available, and I take it that the reason they were not put upon the Table is that the full number was not available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting forward this amendment, Deputy Johnson said he bulked practically all his amendments in the one.  The same principle is obviously involved in all the amendments the Deputy has brought forward to the different Sections in this Bill. The principal object in this Section is the imposition of a minimum penalty. The minimum penalty actually exists in the Fishery Laws on a comparatively wide scale already, and when I brought forward this Bill I did so with the intention of tightening up, and possibly increasing, the penalties under the existing code, so as to make illegal fishing not a paying proposition.  Acceptance of Deputy Johnson's amendment would mean putting matters, from the fishery point of view, worse than they are at present, because it would mean abolishing the minimum penalties that exist.  I am not prepared to accept this amendment, because I believe that the minimum penalty is a necessity in the fishery law, if the law is not to be a farce.  It has been found necessary to have minimum penalties in the past for various fishery offences.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did not succeed in putting down these offences, it was because the penalties were not enforced. In addition to fixing a minimum penalty by law, we hope, in the future, that there will be a more strict enforcement of the law.  A minimum penalty is first heard of in a Fishery Act passed in the year 1848.  It was passed to meet an offence such as is mentioned in Section 2 of this Bill, to which the amendment we are now dealing with, refers.  The minimum penalty then imposed was 10s., and I think it is not unfair, in the present currency, to impose £2 as the minimum penalty <Col N="1385" /> where 10s. was imposed in 1848. Deputy Bryan Cooper referred to the fact that one of the reasons for the minimum penalty is this: That poaching is comparatively profitable, that one scoop with a net paid the very nominal fine that was normally imposed. That is quite so.  Deputy McGoldrick was concerned as to whether I brought in this Bill on my own initiative, or whether it was inspired through some persons with horns, some prominent officials wishing to inflict as much injury as possible on the poor unfortunate people.  I brought in the Bill as the result of many requests from many parts of the country, and I was not foolish enough naturally to bring it in without consulting prominent officials in my own <Col N="1386" /> Department.  If that offends Deputy McGoldrick, I am afraid I will have to sacrifice his vote.</P>
      <P>Under the existing Acts there are many minimum penalties fixed.  Under a British Act passed in 1850, relating to Irish river fisheries, there are minimum penalties in about a dozen different cases.  Under the bye-laws passed by the Inspectors of Fisheries in the Department of Agriculture there are fixed penalties which are tantamount to minimum penalties.  This Bill, therefore, in that sense, is no departure from the existing law, and I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In sub-paragraph (i), line 26, after the word &ldquo;Council&rdquo; to insert the words:&mdash;&ldquo;and also the control of the Department of External Affairs which shall comprise the administration and business generally of public services in connection with communications and transactions between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of any other state or nation, diplomatic and consular representation of Saorstát Eireann in any country or place, international amenities, the granting of passports and of visés to passports, and all powers, duties, and functions connected with the same, and of which Department the head shall be the President of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feelings which animate me in putting forward this amendment are somewhat as follows: I feel that in the interests of economy and efficiency it would be an advisable thing that the Ministry of External Affairs should be concentrated under the guidance of the President of the Executive Council.  I believe that in the actual working of our affairs in communications with foreign nations the Minister for External Affairs in almost all cases would find himself called upon to confer with the President, and I think that with such a young State as the Saorstát it is hardly necessary that we should have a separate Ministry.  A considerable amount of expense is attached to this Ministry, and by placing it under the guidance of the President I feel that we would save a large part of it.  I do not mean for a moment to suggest that the President has not a sufficient amount of work to do at present, but I do think that it might be useful that he should take control of this Department, <Col N="1394" /> and, if necessary, that he should employ a Parliamentary Secretary, or obtain the necessary help otherwise.</P>
    <P>I also would like to say that I do not wish to make any insinuations that the present Minister for External Affairs has not conducted the business in the proper manner.  I feel sure that the Dáil is willing to give him full credit for his capabilities and for the manner in which he has directed the business up to the present, but I think that it would be an important thing that we should concentrate on internal rather than external affairs, and that, except on matters arising out of our trade relations, it is rather inadvisable that we should devote so much attention and place too much emphasis on our connection with outside countries as to establish and maintain a separate Ministry for that purpose.  Taking all these considerations into account, I think that the Ministry should give serious consideration to this proposal.  I would say, in connection with this, that in order to have this amendment complete it would have been necessary to put in an amendment deleting Paragraph 11.  I have not done so, but I feel sure that if the Government see fit to adopt my amendment, they will introduce another at a later stage which would have this effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to associate myself with this amendment, because, I think, for the reasons that I explained on Second Reading, that the Dáil would naturally look to the President for responsibility under all circumstances, and that is the only matter that is concerned in the creation of a separate Ministry responsible for all matters in connection with external affairs.  The facts bear out the contention that I have made.  There has never been an occasion in which any explanation has been given to the Dáil, either in the days when it sat as a Constituent Assembly or since then, when it sat as the first House of the Free State Oireachtas, in which a statement has been made respecting the external policy of the Free State by anybody except the President.  There have been times when the Minister for External Affairs has answered in respect of the expenditure and estimates of the Department, <Col N="1395" /> but on main questions of policy it has been the case, and I contend it must in the future inevitably be the case, that all questions on external policy will be answered for here by the President of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is only fitting, seeing that he is to assume the major responsibilities in the Dáil for the policy of the Department, that he should be the person who should take over the entire responsibility of the conduct of this Department, leaving the administrative details to be conducted by some Civil Servant, who will be responsible directly to him.  In that way a separate Ministry, and the expense of a separate Ministry, will be saved, and that extra expense will be saved simply by achieving what must always be the case, and expectation of the Dáil, that is, that the President should deal directly himself with all external affairs.  It was for this reason that it was so desirable that the President should be relieved of the work imposed on him until the last election in connection with the Finance Department. Now, these financial responsibilities do not directly bear on him. There is a Minister for Finance, and the President is relieved of all other matters, and should be able and should be expected to attend to external affairs, and the responsibility for these affairs in the Dáil.  But to face facts quite frankly, everybody knows that the chief work of this Ministry has not been external affairs, but publicity, and it is desirable that a separate department of publicity should cease to exist.  If there is any statement to be made, let that statement be made from each department, whichever department be concerned in the issuing of that statement, without there being some official Ministerial publicity department.  We know that several of the Ministries have had from time to time occasion, very rightly and properly, to make statements to the Press.</P>

      <P>Very well, I bow to your ruling, Sir, and I will not touch on that matter, but if I may leave it with a sentence with your permission, it is this, reference was made to it on the Second Reading, and what was said on the matter in the Second Reading, by whatever Deputy made the statement, I entirely endorse.  I confine myself, therefore, to the immediate question, which is this, that inasmuch as the President will naturally be held responsible both by the Dáil and the country at large for the guidance of the policies of this State in regard to its affairs with all other countries, that the President should be always, as a cardinal principle, both President and the Minister for External Affairs, without the separate creation of a Ministry, and so save extra expense by getting a more consistent and logical division of responsibilities and offices.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a word in favour of the amendment.  I believe it is desirable that the President should answer to the Dáil for external affairs, and I note that it does, in fact, retain a Department of External Affairs. There is no intention, I presume, in the amendment to disband the Department of External Affairs.  The object is to ensure that that Department shall be controlled by the President.  I think it is quite desirable, and almost a certainty, that whoever may be nominally in control of the Department of External Affairs in practice, for any important matters the President will, as a matter of fact, answer to the Dáil and be in ultimate control.  I do not want for a moment to question your ruling respecting publicity, but it did occur to me that when international amenities are under the Department that the publicity activities of this Department might well come under that general term.  They have, as a matter of fact, been quite interesting to nations beyond the seas, the activities of this Department, and do conform to the term &ldquo;international amenities.&rdquo;  That by the way.  I think it is desirable that <Col N="1397" /> the President should at all times be answerable for matters as between the Saorstát and Great Britain, but the external affairs will be, I think, mainly in connection with Great Britain, and the practice that has already grown up by force of circumstances will necessarily be the practice in the future, and, therefore, I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general purpose of this Bill is to define a certain number of Ministers and Departments, without saying who shall be in charge of them.  Actually, as the Bill stands, there is nothing to prevent those Departments being under the President.  A good deal of talk has gone on about the Ministry of External Affairs being a luxury, and so on.  You have to have it, and you cannot get away from it. I daresay there are people who wish to go back to the status or lack of status implied by the Home Rule Bill of 1914. This is now a Sovereign Nation, and it has to do with other countries.  We cannot separate ourselves from other countries, and if we were utterly cut off from other countries, Deputy Gorey and the party he represents would be the first people to suffer.  This country has the power to initiate, to negotiate, to sign and decide upon the ratification of Treaties with other countries, and almost within the first week after we received our new status, questions arose which had to be decided.  There is no reason why this Department should not be under the President.  The reason it was not, was due to the circumstances of the time.  One of the speakers has just said that the most important business is Internal Affairs, and he did not want External Affairs stressed too much.  It was the very reason that Internal Affairs were the overwhelming pre-occupation of the country, and the Ministry, that made it necessary to have a Ministry of External Affairs.  When the time comes for the President to take over this Ministry, I can assure the Dáil it will have no trouble in getting rid of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the big question of policy, there is such a thing as joint responsibility. On the big question of policy the whole Ministry has equal responsibility, <Col N="1398" /> but the peculiar thing about this Ministry is it probably needs the attention of its Minister in small details more than does any other Ministry. Also an entirely new situation was created.  Questions of policy are involved in matters which seem very small.  Within the first week there was a question of policy involved as to whether we should pay 30/- for the repatriation of one of our Nationals.  The Department must be the first pre-occupation of the Minister in charge, and it requires more his personal attention in matters of detail than any other department.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenditure, we talk about economy.  What does anybody think the saving would be, if they did away with it as a Ministry, put it under a Secretary, and made it a sub-department of a Ministry?  The obvious effect it would have outside would be that we would go out of our way to take from the status of this country, by implying that we had no foreign affairs, which means we had no international standing. On the other side, I do not know whether people realise that Ministers are paid less than the major Civil Servants. They are paid less, because the major Civil Servants' salaries amount to the same as the Ministers', and they have, in addition, security of tenures and pensions.  Does anybody think you could hand over this Department to a minor Civil Servant?  We are actually creating a precedent.  Is it suggested it would be a good thing that this Department should be under a minor Civil Servant?  In effect the policy would be dictated by a minor Civil Servant.  So far as I am concerned, I realised long before the economy scare started that there was need for economy in this country.  The first thing I did was to do away with things that seemed to me more ornamental than effectual.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of talk in the earlier stages of the cost of the Ministry of External Affairs as compared with that of other countries.  We are a mother country with the major part of our people abroad.  We have four million Irish people at home, and 25 millions abroad. Canada is, therefore, as far as nationals are concerned, much smaller than we are.  My Ministry costs 1/40th of what is cost by the Canadian Foreign Department. My whole Ministry costs rather less than the Australian External Affairs Department in London costs.  New Zealand, which is infinitely smaller than Ireland, maintains an office in London which costs more than a half of what our whole Ministry costs.  The South African Government have an office in London which costs considerably more than the whole of the External Affairs here.  Our Department has two offices in America, offices in Holland, Belgium, France, and so on. The Estimates have been referred to as being over £60,000.  Those do not include the cost of membership of the League of Nations.  I realise the need for economy so well that I think that the Estimate we made this year, after including membership to the League, will pay our way in the League for this year, and possibly leave a certain balance over.  Deputy Figgis said in the earlier stages of the Bill that the Department of External Affairs was doing very little work now.  I do not know what steps Deputy Figgis took to find out what work it was doing.  Deputy Gorey said that we were not concerned with foreign affairs, but he entirely failed to understand the position of this country.  Deputy Gorey also said that this would be known as the Ministry for finding a job for somebody.  I can assure him that it is not a Ministry for finding a job for me, and, as I have already said, as soon as the President takes it over, I will leave it with very good grace.  Deputy Cooper pointed out that Monsieur Poincaire was the Minister <Col N="1400" /> for Foreign Affairs in France.  That is because the preponderating matter in France is foreign affairs, and if that were the preponderating matter in Ireland, I have no doubt the President would give attention to it now as he gave in the last year to other matters. Deputy Redmond spoke considerably about the Publicity Department.  That is a matter to which I would like to refer, but I am not permitted to do so. Mr. Milroy complained of the fact that our trade agents abroad are under the Department of External Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  In other countries foreign representatives are under the Department of Foreign Affairs, and for this reason, the moment we come to deal with other countries, although it seems to be a straightforward trade matter, there are always political and international questions arising.  The obvious thing is clear to everybody and a trade department can be expected to look after that, but you need a co-ordinating department to look after the political or national point of view, to suggest recommendations and maintain co-ordination.  So far as our department is concerned with foreign trade, we of course, consult with, and submit to, the trade department any matters that affect trade only, but the suggestion that we are making a cumbersome machine for dealing with trade with other countries is quite untrue and quite unnecessary.  We follow in that just the lines that are followed in other countries, and those are not arbitrarily followed.  They exist in the very nature of the circumstances.  On many occasions when dealing with things outside of Ireland, there is not only one department but many involved.  The External Affairs Department has to serve as a co-ordinating factor in these things and has to consider the point of view of the various Departments that may be contradictory and present the national or political view.  As I said before, there is nothing in this Bill which prevents <Col N="1401" /> this Department being under the President, and the reason it has not been under him so far is owing to the exigencies of the present situation.</P>

      <P>I would rather hear any line of argument before saying whether it was legitimate or not, but on the question of order about this particular amendment, paragraph 11 of Section 1 details the scope of the Department of External Affairs, and says: &ldquo;Of which Department the head shall be, and shall be styled, an t-Aire um Ghnóthaí Coigríche, or (in English) the Minister for External Affairs.&rdquo;  Under Sections 10 and 11 of the Bill it will be possible for the President to be also the Minister for External Affairs, or it would be possible for any other Minister to be Minister for External Affairs as well.  As I understand the amendment, its object is to make it statutory that the President, and only the President, shall be the Minister for External Affairs.

      <P>There are one or two points to which, I think, attention may be called in the Minister's speech.  It seems to be a most fortunate Department, because one moment he was magnifying it and at another minimising it.  It is like Mahommed's corpse; it is not important enough to reach the ministerial heaven, and it is too important to come under a subordinate Civil Servant.  He compared it with the cost of the offices in London, of New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, but he did not mention that these offices have great immigration schemes to deal with in trying to attract emigrants to take up the great waste spaces.  That is not our problem, as really we want to keep our people in the country.  The comparison in part is a fallacious one.  The Minister talked of our lowering ourselves, in reply to Deputy Gorey, if we do not have a separate Ministry.  In Canada Mr. Mackenzie became Prime Minister and also Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>It is not his first pre-occupation.  Surely the Minister knows that Canada is vitally concerned with her status, most emphatically now as she is an independent Treaty-making power.  Surely no Prime Minister or party leader is first pre-occupied with external affairs.  I think that even now the time has come when the real head of the State should be the person really responsible for external affairs.  He must be in the nature of things, and I think the time has come when he should assume all responsibility in the face of the world, and take the office on his own shoulders.

      <P>For the first time the Minister has been good enough to speak <Col N="1403" /> on this matter.  We have not heard him very often in the Dáil.  When he stood up I think he ought to have told us how much this Ministry is costing.  I am sorry I was not here to listen to what the Minister had got to say.  I want to know how much the Staff of the Ministry is actually costing, from the Minister down.  He said a Department of the Ministry was needed in London to deal with our trade.  Why have we a Ministry of Industry and Commerce if it is not able to deal with the trade of this country?  We have a Ministry of Agriculture which deals with our trade in agricultural products. The Minister for External Affairs objects to the statement that his Ministry will be known in the country as a Ministry for finding jobs.  I may tell you that outside the Dáil, and amongst the plain men in the street, it will be known as a Ministry of very little utility and a Ministry purely for finding jobs for somebody&mdash;not for the present Minister, perhaps.  I do not think that the President of the Executive Council, if he is given this portfolio, will be overworked.  He ought to be able to deal with this Ministry of External Affairs, if there is such a thing to be attended to; some of us very much doubt it.  The President can deal with the political end of it, if there is a political end to it.  The commercial end of it can be dealt with by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture.  I do not see the necessity for this Ministry at all, either its staff or its head, and therefore I support the amendment.</P>

For entirely different reasons from those of Deputy Gorey, I support the amendment. I believe the existence of this Department will, and must necessarily, increase if we are to get the position in world affairs that we are entitled to. I think it must necessarily increase and will require a Department as laid down in the Bill.  I think it is so important that it should be a Department of which the President of the Executive Council for the time being must be the head.</P>
      <P>Most of the arguments of the Minister for External Affairs supported the contention that to the outside world the fact that the President of the Executive Council is also Minister for External Affairs will add to its prestige and importance. It is because I desire there shall be statutory obligation that the President shall have charge of that Department, that I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>My chief object in rising is to stress and emphasise what already has been pointed out, that it is not a question of the existence or nonexistence of a Department, but simply a question of the political head-ship of that Department.  I might remind Deputies that it is really quite a short time since they, on the nomination of the President, approved each political head of all the Departments that there is joint responsibility for in the Executive Council.  They ought not to have approved these without consideration, and when the President nominated his Council, naming a man for each post and for the political head-ship of each Department, presumably Deputies gave the matter the consideration they ought to have given it.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember also that while the Dáil was sitting here demanding the very full attention of the President and other Ministers, there was sitting in London a Conference, not without importance for this country, for its people and for its future&mdash;the Imperial Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> Throughout six months the Minister for External Affairs was in attendance at that Conference representing this country and reporting to the President. The President, not being a bird, cannot be in two places at the same time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for External Affairs was present in London watching and safeguarding the interests of this country and reporting to the President of the Executive Council.  He could not have attended there with the same weight and in the same representative capacity other than as a Minister for External Affairs. If Deputies consider that the President himself <i>qua</i> Minister for External Affairs, should have been present in London throughout that Conference, then they have got to measure the corresponding loss on this side due to the absence of the head of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>It is not all quite so simple as it seems to Deputies Heffernan and Gorey, and above all it is not a question of economy to be effected by scrapping a particular Department, because that Department cannot be scrapped.  It is simply a question of the political head-ship of that Department and I think I have pointed out one practical inconvenience that would follow if the political headship had been vested in the President.</P>

      <P>The Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand did attend the Imperial Conference and they are not birds.  They arranged for business to be carried on in their Parliaments by their colleagues, sometimes at a good deal of inconvenience.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Home Affairs does not mistrust the Vice-President's capacity for carrying on the business of the Dáil.  I think those things can be all arranged very easily as in the other Dominions.  I think it would be an advantage to Ireland to have had our President on an equal footing instead of having&mdash;I speak with all respect to the excellent work <Col N="1406" /> the Minister for External Affairs did &mdash;a subordinate Minister doing so.</P>

      <P>I would like to touch upon one or two points made by the Minister for External Affairs, and in doing so I must congratulate him on what I consider to have been almost his maiden speech in this Chamber.  Not quite his maiden speech, but almost, and that very fact itself illustrates the contention that has been made throughout on this amendment and as the whole cause of this amendment, not that there should not be a Department for External Affairs, but that the responsibility for that Department must invariably be answered for in this Dáil by the President.  That has always been the case in the past and will be the case in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the Ministry was not a luxury.  We are not dealing with whether the Ministry is a luxury or whether the Minister for External Affairs is himself a luxury.  What we are dealing with is that in the circumstances the Dáil and the country will look to the President for responsibility for this Department.  That being the case, even minor economies are sometimes desirable, and the economy effected by saving the Minister's salary is an economy that will be quite desirable for this country.  The Minister has stated in reply to that that a Secretary would have to be appointed.  I imagine that there is a Secretary there already. There has been a Secretary.  A Secretary's salary has been voted.  The Minister for External Affairs referred to the joint responsibility of the Executive Council.  There we are all at one. There is joint responsibility.  Whoever in a Conference abroad, whether in Geneva, or in London or elsewhere, answers for that joint responsibility, all that is sought to be effected by this amendment is that for that joint responsibility one person, and one person <Col N="1407" /> only, will be answerable in this Dáil. And that person will be the person who must answer, who will be expected to answer, who always in the past has answered for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>We had occasion a month ago when a question was put by Deputy Milroy respecting the affairs of this State and its relation with another State, to appreciate this.  A question was put down on the motion for the adjournment.  By whom was the answer given?  By the President.  Go back over the proceedings for the past year, and every time a vital question has been asked in this Dáil, who has intervened in the debate to deal with the question?  The President. The Dáil would not be satisfied if any other person than the President had answered.  Therefore, the procedure that has been adopted, by the practice of the Executive Council itself, is a procedure for which statutory effect has been sought in this amendment. That is all.  The Minister says that the President may take the responsibility for it at an early date.  That still does not answer the contention of the amendment.  The Minister for External Affairs says that he would go with a good grace.  We would bear his going with philosophy and fortitude. But that still does not answer the purpose of the amendment, and that is, that the responsibility for External Affairs in the Free State is a responsibility that the people and the Legislature will look to the President himself to acquit.  Therefore, it is a responsibility that should be attached in any legislation in the Dáil to the Presidency of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>As I propose to vote against this amendment, if it comes to a division, I would like to say that the arguments that have been used in favour of the amendment seem to cut under the importance of the office of the Minister for External Affairs.  In the present state of the country there is not one of the Ministries that is more important, in so far as the work done under this Department is largely initiatory work.  At the present time, at all events, I would be very sorry to see the Department left in charge of any subordinate.  I quite sympathise with <Col N="1408" /> the arguments that have been used that the President should be Minister for External Affairs.  I think it is fallacious to say that he should be directly the Minister for External Affairs, because I rather visualise the President as being the head of all Departments. As President of the Executive Council, in matters of importance I think it is very right and proper that we should have his views, certainly on matters of External Affairs.  I do not think that that in itself justified the abolition of the Ministry of External Affairs.  In my judgment, and with the development that we hope and expect in the country, the work of the Minister for External Affairs will be largely increased. We all hope it will be largely increased, and we hope that we still will have the assistance of the President of the Executive Council in addition to the Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>May I point out what is an inconvenience, if this amendment is adopted.  It is a very definite inconvenience.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Johnson that this Department for External Affairs will become more important in the future, and that it will continue to grow to be more and more important. It does not require much stretch of the imagination to see that a state of affairs may arise in which the President may have another portfolio besides his Presidency.  Will you then burden him with the Ministry of External Affairs as well?  In that case you tie the hands of the Executive Council too much.  It may work very badly to the interest of the other Departments quite as important as the Ministry of External Affairs.  As to the arguments used by Deputy Figgis, and as to the President's replies here, we may point out that the President on all important questions, whether at home or abroad, is expected to be heard by the Dáil and the country.  Therefore, that is no argument.  There was no suggestion that all those other Ministries should be merged in the Presidency, though he may have spoken for them at times.  No real sound argument has been adduced to force the President to adopt this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that it appears to me that this amendment has been canvassed on every side rather than on the side which, I think, was originally intended, when it was put down.  The last two Deputies, when addressing themselves to this question, appeared to me to have had a very clear conception of what was meant.  In the first place, the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan is a point of very considerable importance. While to-day we may cite the case of Canada, Australia or England, or one of the other countries mentioned, and say that the Prime Minister, in any one of them, is the head of the Executive Council and has also got a portfolio of Foreign or of External Affairs, as the case may be, we must remember that there were examples also of remarkable statesmen in other countries having other portfolios which must have appealed to them in their judgment&mdash;and I presume their judgment was as good in their day as the judgments of the statesmen of Canada or of Australia in our time&mdash;of paramount importance to their own country at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case should you have in the future a Prime Minister, let us say, of the profound depths of knowledge of Deputy Figgis, just imagine for a moment Deputy Figgis burdening himself with such an unimportant matter as the portfolio of External Affairs when such great questions as Finance, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture were to be taken up.  I would expect him to take at least four or five of these Ministries, and even if he were to do that I think we would be limiting the capacity and the capabilities of a man of that type if we were to say that he shall only take the portfolio for External Affairs and that he was to be bound to it and could not get out of it. I may say for my own part that, in considering this question of offering portfolios to Ministers, or in asking members to take up the responsibilities of office, I had in mind always the man's own desires or capabilities for these particular posts.  I have no hesitation in saying, for my own part, that I have no particular ability whatever of any sort or kind for External Affairs.  Personally, I would feel very <Col N="1410" /> unhappy if I were offered, even supposing I were not in my present position, such a portfolio as that for External Affairs, and I would certainly have to refuse it.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is some exception taken by Deputies to the fact that I have not got a Ministry at present. In answer to that I suppose I am entitled to say that I am not a free agent altogether.  I would like very much to have one.  I did give up the Ministry of Finance with some regret. Of all the Ministries, it was the one that I had, perhaps, the most aptitude for. There appears to me to be two questions put forward by certain Deputies in recommending this particular office for the President: either to get rid of the present Minister for External Affairs, or to saddle the office on a man who does not want it, or at least who feels that he has not any aptitude for it.  I do not know whether that attitude can be general in the Dáil.  I rather hesitate to think it would be.  I do not under-rate the importance of this Ministry.  I do think that in speaking of Foreign Affairs for some years past our minds have, perhaps, expanded a little more than the merits of the case warranted.  When speaking of Foreign Affairs we hear now and again upon various platforms the question asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What does the world think of men being left on hunger-strike in Mountjoy?&rdquo; or something of that kind.  That, I suggest, is an unbalanced view to take on the question of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>If you were to ask me at this moment what I consider to be the most important duty in the State, I would say that the internal matters are of far more importance than the matter of External Affairs.  But, if you want to pourtray before an audience something which would attract their imagination, or stir up their enthusiasm, and give them an inspiration, you will say, &ldquo;What is the world thinking of us now?&rdquo;  My answer is that the world is just thinking whether we are managing to do well or ill the work that lies before us. There are other Departments of the State just at present which would need the attention of the President very much more than the Department for External Affairs, and more particularly in the present circumstances when the <Col N="1411" /> person who is occupying the position of President has no aptitude whatever for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>During the last two or three months, when I should have been in another place, the Minister for External Affairs was in a position to represent this country.  I understand he did it well, and it is not from himself that I have that information.  The Minister for Education was also there, and he was very well pleased with the work that was done by the Minister for External Affairs.  None of the other States, during that period, had their Parliament sitting, and I suppose I would have been told, perhaps not here but elsewhere, if I were absent from this Dáil during that time, that I was paying more attention to foreigners than I was to the people at home, so that I suggest we may take an unbalanced view of these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the saving of the Minister's salary, the saving of the Minister's salary may be a loss in other ways.  I would not feel satisfied in the present instance, as I have said, in taking up this office, nor would I recommend the Dáil to adopt this amendment, because the time may come when other people occupying my position may feel that they themselves would be able to render much better service in that office of the State than in the office of External Affairs, and that if they were to be burdened with this particular Ministry in addition they would not be able to give the close attention to important matters of State which these matters would warrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention in bringing forward this amendment was not to do away with the department of External Affairs, but to retain it under the headship of the President of the Executive Council.  Having heard the statement made by the President, in regard to his lack of ability and aptitude, or rather his alleged lack of ability and aptitude, for carrying on the business of External Affairs, I am rather inclined to think that I made a mistake.  I feel perfectly confident, however, that he has all the necessary qualifications for the position, and I am <Col N="1412" /> sure that he is entirely too modest in regard to his estimate of his own ability.  With regard to the point in reference to the matter of economy, I am quite aware of the comparatively small saving that would be made by this change if it were brought about. It would only mean a saving of £1,700 a year, or perhaps less, because if it happened that the Minister for External Affairs is removed and the Ministry put under the headship of the President of the Executive Council we would, no doubt, save the £1,700 a year attaching to that office, but very likely a Parliamentary Secretary would have to be appointed, with a salary attached approximating to the amount saved.  But economy goes further than that, and one of the main things about economy is the example we give to the country. We would be then setting an example of economy from here, even if only on items of the very smallest importance. We, who are in close touch with the people of the country, find criticisms of that kind, when we go down into the country, brought to our notice.  We hear that there are eleven Ministers, with very high salaries, and we are asked, &ldquo;Why don't you cut these down?&rdquo;  I felt that, in moving this amendment, I was aiming at eliminating the Ministry of the least importance in the affairs of this country.  I do not say that the Minister himself is of the least importance.  What I say is that this Ministry of External Affairs is the one of least importance, and I am still of opinion, that from that point of view, it would be very desirable that my amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, at the same time, of the importance of this Ministry and of this Department to the farming industry of this country.  I am sure it is very necessary that we should be in close touch with the different agricultural countries throughout Europe, but I feel there is considerable danger that in our new nationhood we may be liable to over-estimate our importance in the world, and that, like the frog in the fable, we are apt to blow ourselves out and regard our own opinion as of such importance in the affairs of the world that we may be in danger of bursting just with the sense of our own importance <Col N="1413" /> as the frog did.  For that reason I think it might be advisable that the Ministry of External Affairs should be placed under the headship of the President of the Executive Council.  I do not know any person who would be in a better position to judge the importance of the different matters which might come up with regard to the position of Ireland, and concerning its connection with foreign countries.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to mention is this, I would like to support Deputy Bryan Cooper with regard to the comparison made between the cost of the Irish High Commissioner in London, and that of Canada, New Zealand, and other Dominions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing very drastic in the amendment I am proposing.  It is merely an endeavour to transfer from the Ministry of Local Government what anybody would consider is not appropriate to that Ministry to what <Col N="1417" /> would appear to be its proper place&mdash; the Ministry of Justice.  I do not propose to break up the present machinery that is there for the collection of such data as is necessary for the preparation of registers and the conduct of election work in general.  I only propose to transfer the lever of Government from the hands of the Minister for Local Government to the hands of the Minister for Justice.  If any Minister is in a position to see that justice is carried out during elections and in the preparation of the registers and such work, the Minister for Justice is that person.  When a Ministry of Health was established in England on a more scientific basis, and different departments were set up under that Ministry, this matter of the preparation of registers and election procedure in general was transferred to the Home Office, which is equivalent to the Ministry of Justice in this Government. I suppose it may be argued that justice, either theoretical or applied, has very little to do with elections.  That is a matter I will leave to the opinion of the different Deputies.  But if any Minister is competent and in a position to see that justice is practised in electioneering work, and in the preparation of registers, I think the Minister for Justice is that person.</P>

      <P>This is one of those services which it is possible to transfer, even after the Bill is passed. That matter has been considered.  I do not think it would be right to say it has been under consideration.  But the Minister for Home Affairs has considered it himself, and I am not clear as to whether the Minister for Local Government has considered it or not. But it is under consideration, and if this amendment were to be pressed and passed we would be committed to this particular alteration without being convinced that it is satisfactory.  I incline to the view that it will be found necessary to make this alteration, but I think that the Deputy ought to leave it at that and I can assure him that it will get consideration.</P>

      <P>It is delightful to hear the President express himself in the way he has done, but one would <Col N="1418" /> imagine that the Bill was presented to the Dáil simply for ratification without consideration.  Surely, even though this matter is under consideration, or has been considered by Ministers, or some of them, that will not, or should not, deprive the Dáil of expressing its opinion as to the merits of this amendment. I think that the fact that the President has expressed himself in the way he has done rather encourages us to express the view more strongly that this particular function of government should be taken out of the hands of the Local Government Department and placed under the Ministry which is in charge of public order.</P>
      <P>The Ministry for Local Government and Public Health, as it now will be, will tend more and more to deal with matters of public health.  The function of preparing registers and looking after elections seems to be quite foreign to the work of Local Government and Public Health but is peculiarly fitting to that Department which is responsible for public order.  A proposition was made, I think it will be remembered, at an earlier stage of the proceedings of the Dáil, that a functionary should be appointed specially for the purpose of looking after elections and all pertaining to elections. That did not meet with the approval of the Dáil.  The Ministry for Justice, which is in charge of public order, seems very much more appropriate for the work of preparing registers and taking charge of the elections to the Houses of the Oireachtas and local bodies.  I hope Deputies will express their views on this matter rather for the guidance of the Government than otherwise.  If the matter is still open, perhaps even before the Bill passes finally, the Ministry will be able to make up its mind as to whether this particular Department should be transferred to the Ministry of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the main reason why this question of elections is at present conducted by the Local Government Department is that the register is prepared by the local bodies through the agency of the rate collectors and so on.  That is a fairly substantial <Col N="1419" /> reason why the control should lie where it is at present.  There has been a good deal of complaint and discontent about the manner in which the registers have been prepared and there is a feeling that they ought to be prepared by the police&mdash;the Civic Guard in the country and the Metropolitan Police in the city.  If that change were to come about it would remove, in my opinion, the case for responsibility by the Local Government Minister for the franchise and for election work generally.  If we were asked at the moment whether the Civic Guard could take responsibility for that work and could be relied upon to carry it out thoroughly, we would hesitate to accept the responsibility. At the moment you have not a full or a normal establishment in the country as there are about 150 more stations to be established.  The question could only be considered when you would have a complete establishment, and when you would have less of a strain on the police forces than at present exists.  In discussing the matter with the Minister for Local Government that seems to be the situation, that if responsibility for the preparation of the register were to pass to the police, and consequently to the Ministry for Home Affairs, or Ministry for Justice, as it will be when this Bill is passed, then the full control of elections should also pass.</P>

      <P>I hope the change will be made and that the Ministry who it is said are thinking over the matter will bring about the change very soon.  It is not directly to that, however, that I wish to address a question at this stage.  It is to a statement made by the President which perhaps strictly arises at a later stage, as it undoubtedly will, but which should also be considered here because it is proper to the consideration of the sub-sections to this Section that we are now considering.  The President stated it would be possible, if such a change were judged to be desirable, to transfer that function from the Local Government Department to the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Ministry of Justice as it then will be.  I presume <Col N="1420" /> he is referring to sub-section 2 of Section 11 dealing with the power of the Executive Council to distribute public services amongst Ministers. That raises a question in regard to this Section, particularly in regard to all its sub-sections.  Here is a definite allocation of service for a Department. If this Bill be passed, when it becomes an Act it will be the law of the land that these various functions shall be allocated to different Departments. Is it the intention that there may be within the purview of this Act, although these sections have set out definite boundaries to certain Departments, that these boundaries may afterwards be varied by the Executive Council?  If so, and if that is the interpretation that is to be given in the consideration of these sub-sections, naturally a good deal of the discussion of these sub-sections would be very materially changed.</P>
      <P>It is definitely stated here that these services that Deputy Hogan desires to transfer from the Local Government Department to the Ministry of Home Affairs are allocated to the Ministry of Local Government.  When they are allocated there it becomes an Act, and surely if it is desirable to transfer them, if the Ministry think they should be transferred, they should be transferred while this Bill is before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the Bill, in Section 11, makes express provision enabling the redistribution of public services, and in a matter of this kind, which will probably require legislation, it would be very inconvenient to proceed to redistribute the functions before you have legislation providing new machinery.  For instance, if the method of compiling registration lists is to be taken from one body of persons and put in the hands of another body it will require an Act.  If in the meantime you allocate the function to the Minister for Justice he will, during that indefinite period, have to take charge of persons who are more naturally under the Minister for Local Government, so that if this reform is effected it will require legislation, and attendant on that legislation an order could be made, under <Col N="1421" /> Section 11, redistributing this and putting it under Justice.</P>

      <P>On the point of the practicability of this amendment, if I am not mistaken it was found that during the preparation of the lists of the register that certain officials of the Local Government Department were not doing their work satisfactorily, and provision was made for somebody else to do that work.  It is quite possible that may be required again, and I can see that even within this amendment the satisfactory officials of the Local Government Department may still be employed, until the full machinery is at work, as agents for the Minister for Home Affairs or the Minister for Justice, as he may be.  I do not think it is unknown in Government services for servants of one Ministry to do duty on behalf of another Ministry, and I think that that might well be accomplished even though this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  This amendment and the next one are much the same.  The next includes the charge of roads and highways. The mere selection of one Minister as regards another does not involve very many considerations other than one which might be put forward as regards their adaptability for a particular class of work, but the taking of the ordinary machinery for the registration of voters from Local Government and handing it over to the Ministry of Justice is a step for which no reason has been given that would convince me that it was a desirable improvement on the present situation.  If there be anything wrong at all it is in the compilation, and that involves a number of very serious questions. There are people who consider that they have a vested interest in that particular class of work.  Vested interests of persons occupying positions under local authorities are usually costly things to annul, unless there is a very grave reason for annulling them.  You can dismiss, but if you simply take away, there must be compensation.  The local authority would, in my view, hesitate to compensate in a case of that sort, and the question is really too complicated <Col N="1422" /> to be dealt with in the manner of an amendment such as that, and at the same time the fact of improving it is what I believe the Deputy has in mind in moving the amendment.  No reason has been given as to how this would be better administered under one Minister than under another.  No reason has been given as to any particular machinery that one Minister might bring into play that is not in play at present.  If, on the other hand, there is to be an entire alteration of the system of registration that alteration is a big question, involving many considerations which I do not think would be disposed of by passing this amendment.</P>

The object of the latter part is to try to secure the attention of the National Government to the present condition of the roads.  I am of the opinion that the local authorities are not in a position to give the attention to the roads warranted at this particular juncture.  The roads in this country have been neglected very much during the past five or six years, with the result that the highways are, I daresay, about the worst in the world. All over the world to-day different States are giving this due attention, the attention it warrants in view of the heavy traffic in the way of motor haulage, and my proposal is that this matter should be taken from the local councils altogether and placed under a Ministry of Transport, as is proposed in the Railway Bill.  I think everybody will agree that the roads have not got the attention they warrant, and the object of this amendment, as I have said, is to take all extraneous functions from the Local Government Ministry and to make it as much as possible a <Col N="1423" /> Ministry of Health.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This also, to my mind, raises other difficulties.  At present the Minister for Local Government exercises control over the administration of local authorities, and in his capacity as supervisor of roads&mdash;I forget the exact term&mdash;is entitled to authorise the expenditure of certain moneys on roads.  We take him away and we anticipate a larger amount of expenditure on certain roads, and there would be no authority that I know of to deal with the matter should this amendment pass.  I have not observed any amendment placing the control under any other department, and then, in the event of the calamity of the failure of this other Bill to pass, as Deputy Wilson suggests, we would be left without any person in control of roads.  I am sure the Deputy had not that in mind when he put down this amendment.  There was a Ministry of Transport, or a Road Board, or some other organisation like that, but now the Local Government Department has taken over these various boards, which are now comprised in the one term, &ldquo;Local Government,&rdquo; generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there has been that opportunity for utilising the services of these institutions to their best. I think that we are on the eve of utilising them to their best, and of getting better value than up to this. <Col N="1424" /> It would be unwise now to make another change, at least until an opportunity had been given to the Minister for Local Government for making good, but in any case if it were desirable to take control away from the Local Government you must first make up your minds as to whom it is to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to point out to the Minister his lack of attention to the Bill of which he is in charge.  The same applies to Deputy Wilson.  There are provisions in other amendments handing over this particular function of looking after highways and public roads to another Department, and if the Dáil would signify its desire to have that function taken from the Local Government Department, undoubtedly it would be sensible enough to put the work into the hands of somebody else.  If the President would look at Amendment 11 he would find that what he thought an oversight has not been an oversight at all.  The President has noted that there was a Ministry of Transport, and a Road Board.  I think it is rather a pity that the fullest advantage was not taken of extending the functions of that Road Board.  The roads are becoming more and more a matter of importance, and less and less are they becoming local, and it was in view of the expressed desire to place administrative affairs on a more scientific foundation than they had been that this attempt was made to put the highways and public roads under the charge of an authority whose function it would be to look after provisions for transport, and take them out of the hands of Local Government.  Deputy Wilson has, I think, indicated more than once the difficulties that arise from the use of certain roads under one local authority by conveyances issuing out of another local authority's jurisdiction. We find very many complaints that heavy vehicles belonging to one town or district use roads of another district, and that will continue until you have some co-ordination of responsibility.  It was with that desire this amendment was put forward.  Whatever objections there may be to the amendment they are not the objections which have been stated.</P>

In the proposed Bill of course the authority would be set up, but I maintain he should first have that authority, which he calls Transport and Communications, and then he could transfer, as was intended to be transferred before, their functions, by taking them away from Local Government, and giving them to this body which he proposes to start, but which is not in existence at the moment.</P>

I agree with Deputy Johnson that there are very sound grievances at the moment.  In some of the local authorities we have road-ways which are very largely used, and from the traffic on which they derive no benefit at all.  These heavy motors pay a motor tax, and under the old <i>régime</i> it was under consideration as to whether the main roads would not be taken over and administered by what was called the Road Board, and some of the main roads in Ireland have been so administered.  Under the new <i>régime</i> these motor taxes are collected, and I do not know that any body has been set up corresponding with the Road Board.  Consequently the heavy maintenance now falling on several of the local authorities will have to be borne <Col N="1426" /> by these authorities, and, I think, unfairly borne.  It appears to me that this whole question of road transport is one that ought to have the serious consideration of the Government, and some considered proposals should be put before the Dáil with regard to it.</P>

That matter is in their hands&mdash;the maintenance of these roads as they should be maintained&mdash;and the co-ordination that Deputy Johnson looks for can alone be had by the existing authorities, the Local Government Department, using the power which is in their hands to see that the co-ordination takes place, and that those who run the County Councils and the Corporations and Urban Councils should see how they can co-ordinate.  I think at present we all see the necessity for an improvement in the roads, but now is not the time when the Local Government Department has framed a scheme dealing with these roads and which aims at seeing that the money expended and labour employed on these roads is done so to the advantage of the ratepayers, in the improvement of these roads and making them suitable for traffic, and place them in a position that those who pay their motor tax will have roads that can carry goods in competition with the railways.  To change the authority at present, unless there is some solid reason given, would be a very great mistake.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In page 4, line 9, sub-paragraph V. to delete the words &ldquo;vocational and technical training.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, together with the consequential amendment No. 9, purports to withdraw technical and vocational training from the Ministry of Education, and give it instead to <Col N="1427" /> the Ministry for Industry and Commerce. Technical and vocational training, or technical instruction, as it is known, has never been under the Ministry of Education in the past.  It is being transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Education, and I will try to persuade the Government that in making this change it should not be under the Ministry of Education but under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In spite of the devoted work done by very able men for technical education in this country I do not think that we can say it is in a satisfactory state.  I think it was started on wrong lines. About the time the Department of Agriculture was started, Sir Horace Plunkett explained his intention in a reference which I have been unable to trace.  As far as I can remember, he wanted every farmer to acquire a sufficient knowledge of carpentry to be able to mend a door or hang a gate. The result is that technical education has largely tended to produce a smattering of knowledge and, when a man has finished his ordinary education, sometimes he went to a technical school to learn to mend a door but more often to learn shorthand and typewriting, to get away from the farm.  Some weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture complained that amongst the functions which came under him were the teaching of French, shorthand and typewriting.  These are not part of technical education but rather are a part of secondary education. If they are technical education I can quite admit the case for bringing them under the Ministry of Education is a perfect one.  To my mind technical education should be something very different from that and instead of following the footsteps of the past the moment has, I think, come to make a very great change because we cannot afford to go on producing elegant accomplishments, which is what most technical schools in this country have been doing.  I remember about a dozen years ago&mdash;and I do not think the system has changed since&mdash;going over a technical school and discovering that for every girl learning cooking nine were learning to draw and shade <Col N="1428" /> cones and cylinders.  That is a very excellent thing in its way, but why should the State pay for it?  I want to make technical education an introduction to industry and as far as possible a branch of industry itself, and I think we should follow the lines adopted in Germany before the war. I am forced to take pre-war conditions because at present you cannot get information from Germany that is not propaganda on one side or the other. Before the war German technical education was very remarkable.  Take Chemnitz, an industrial town in Saxony about the size of Cork.  It would like to call itself the Manchester of Germany.  In Chemnitz there were compulsory continuation schools to which children went from the age of fourteen to seventeen and paid fees. There were two general artisan schools for teaching general trades&mdash;one for boys and one for girls.  There were trades schools run by trades guilds, and I wish our trades unions would think of taking up something of the same kind.  These schools were for tailors, chemists, innkeepers&mdash;I do not know if anybody in this country would say that innkeeping is a trade to be taught.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, barbers.  Surely nobody would like to be shaved by a barber who does not know his business.  Chemnitz is mainly a textile town and a special textile school was established there.  In 1900 it had about 60 students.  It had an academy which taught chemistry, engineering, and architecture with power to give degrees.  It had 404 students.  There was also a trade school which taught milling and engineering. The students there were engaged in industry and commerce during the day and went to school at night to try and better their conditions.  In this not very large German town, there were three technical schools directly connected with industry, and the working people thought it worth while to pay fees to go to them because the whole object of German technical education was not to train the rank and file, but to train officers.  All who were educated there felt that they were qualifying themselves to work upwards.  I should <Col N="1429" /> like to see something like that in this country, though I admit it would not be easy.  It would take a good deal of thought, and would require co-operation between employers and labour so that I do not suppose it would succeed. Take Cork for instance.  I believe it has a brewing industry.  I should like to see a brewing school there.  It has an industry for assembling motor cars, and I think the technical schools there should teach motor engineering in the hope of students turning out some improvements, for even the Ford car is capable of improvement.  These are the lines we ought to go on in the future. That is the reason I am putting forward the amendment, and I believe that technical training should belong to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and not to the Ministry of Education where it will become less practical and more academic.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has pointed out one of the reasons why technical education has failed in this country.  I am sorry, as one who has had a good deal to do with technical education, that I cannot agree with his reasons.  The reason that those engaged in technical education assign for its failure, for it has been a failure in Ireland, is the low standard of primary education in Ireland.  Owing to this low standard of primary education, boys and girls coming from primary schools are unable to pass the simple qualifying examination for entrance into technical schools.  The result is while we have magnificent schools, not alone in the cities but all over Ireland, they are, comparatively speaking, empty.  Technical education has been under a separate educational authority in Ireland since its inception.  I am quite satisfied if technical education is to attain to that position in this country in the future in which we would all like to see it, it is only by having it and all other departments of education under one authority.  I hope the Government will adhere to its proposal to place these different departments of education under one authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very little between Deputy Cooper and <Col N="1430" /> Deputy Good.  Deputy Cooper would like to see brewing and the technical side of brewing taught in Cork, and also the dyeing industry taught where there is a dyeing industry, and so on. That was not done in the past.  There was no attempt whatever to make arrangements for the teaching in technical schools of particular industries to suit particular localities where the teaching of, let us say, special subjects would be appropriate.  The reason probably was that there were very few industries, and there was not sufficient demand.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent&mdash;even though technical education, like primary, secondary and university education, is controlled and coordinated under the Minister for Education&mdash;the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, or, say the Ministry for Agriculture or any other Ministry who wish to develop any special branch of technical education, from making a special grant out of special funds to any technical school to develop that.  I think that sort of arrangement is much sounder than to take technical education in bulk and say it shall be controlled by the Ministry for Industry and Commerce. What is technical education? Reading is part of technical education. Writing, arithmetic, algebra, other subjects of that sort are taught and will always be taught in technical schools. French could be taught, shorthand and book-keeping could be taught and will always be taught in technical schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Cooper wants to provide for is, where there are special industries, and where it is necessary that special technical skill should be acquired for special industries in particular neighbourhoods the particular Ministry interested should be in a position to promote and develop them.  In this Bill the Ministry for Industry and Commerce can provide in its estimates for a grant to technical schools somewhere and would be in a position to say to a given technical school: &ldquo;We will give you so much per annum provided you give so many hours per week to this subject and provided you satisfy us as to the syllabus.&rdquo;  That is the point Deputy Cooper makes.  In the same way the Minister for Agriculture could say <Col N="1431" /> to any of the schools teaching agriculture through the country, and there are a number of them: &ldquo;We will give you a certain amount of money provided you give a certain course of agriculture in your schools.&rdquo;  That is provided for, but because it is necessary to provide for that, and to give a Minister who has an interest in such a subject a chance to develop it, we should not, because of that, hand over technical education as a whole to that Minister.  The Minister for Education should control technical education in its proper aspect.  There should be ample opportunities for any other Ministry, perhaps even the Ministry for Finance, which may be interested from its own point of view, to develop that in any school anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. PETER HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind nothing speaks so well as facts in most of those cases.  I agree with Deputy Cooper when he said it is a good thing that industry should be taught in technical schools and that facilities should be given for the teaching of particular industries in any district.  I venture to suggest that the fault lies greatly with the Committees of Technical Instruction, because I know that the Department are willing to help people to put up workshops of a particular kind suited to a particular locality.  I know that in the town I come from they have given a grant to put up a workshop driven by electricity, and all the various machines are there to teach young men what they are supposed to learn in railway work and foundries.  I think if the various Committees took up the class of work suitable to the district and asked the Department of Education for grants they would get them.  As regards motor engineering, it is only a few days ago since I had an interview with an inspector of the Department, and he was anxious to push the motor business, because, he said, there were a great deal of motor mechanics in that area and he would be prepared to establish a class in connection with the school.  I think it is a proper thing to do, but at the same time I believe that the Ministry for Education are the proper people to carry it out.  If the other Departments wish to give grants for a special <Col N="1432" /> purpose, as Deputy Cooper has said, it is a good idea.  The one great drawback, as far as technical schools are concerned, is the want of primary education. My experience is that very few boys and girls who get to 4th and 5th Standard and come to technical schools are fit to absorb what they get. I think if more attention were paid to this class it would be much better for technical education.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  It is generally admitted that anyone who has a practical knowledge of educational matters knows that education in this country is at a low ebb.  One of the principal reasons for that was the want of co-ordination in the past between the various education departments.  Education was run in a series of water-tight departments with no relation whatever between one department and another.  The result was that there was overlapping, waste of effort, and, on the whole, not at all the results that should have been obtained under a properly co-ordinated system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard from Deputy Good a reason for the failure of technical education. I do not admit at all that technical education, even as it has been administered for the past 20 years, is a failure.  But I do say that it has not been as successful as it might have been under different circumstances.  He rightly suggests that one of the reasons why that is so is that the pupils coming into technical schools have not reached the standard of education that they ought to have reached.  I admit that fully and freely, but I want to point out that under the circumstances as they existed it was absolutely impossible that they would have reached that standard.  What are the facts? There is no school-leaving standard at the present time.  There is no standard which it is necessary that a pupil should reach before he or she leaves the primary school.  They can leave when they like.  The average school-leaving age is from 9 to 11 years.  These pupils leave school, run about for two or three years, and it is only then that they begin to realise that they will want some smattering of education in order to get any employment.  Then they turn their attention to the technical schools.  They <Col N="1433" /> go into the technical schools and learn what they should have learned in the primary schools.  That is the position, and it is well that the Deputies should know it.  An improvement will not be effected unless there is co-ordination between the various systems&mdash;if we can call them systems.  I say there should be only one system, and the Minister for Education should be responsible for the whole system of education in the country.</P>
    <P>There are other important points. When the course of education in the primary school is completed, the boy has to make up his mind as to what he will do, whether he will go to the Intermediate school and enter a profession or turn his attention to industrial work and go to the technical school.  I hold that it is the duty of the Minister for Education to make provision whereby the programmes and curricula of the schools will be so co-ordinated as to enable the pupil to go from one school to the other without a break.  Deputy Cooper told us a lot of interesting things about what was done in a certain town in Germany.  I was waiting to hear whether or not education in Germany was under the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Education.  That would be the real point of his statement.  I certainly think that if we are to have improvement and progress in education, we must have one Minister and one Department responsible for education in the whole country.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy O'Connell put his finger on the spot when he said that co-ordination is the one necessity for education in this country.  It is not merely a matter of co-ordination in primary, secondary and technical schools&mdash;it runs right through up to the University.  University professors will tell you that pupils come up to the Universities without having attained a standard that fits them to receive what ought to be University education.  And so pupils going to the Universities are receiving what is really no more than a secondary education.  Technical schools have had a non-educational authority in Ireland up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Now it is proposed to put them under an educational head, which will coordinate all the systems of education. In this connection, referring to what the Minister for Agriculture said, I may say that he had been speaking to me earlier with reference to his own Department. The Government is ready to introduce an amendment in reference to his Department&mdash;and I think the same would apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;to permit the promotion in his case of agriculture, or in the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of industry and trade, by way of education.  By that means and in that way the point that Deputy Bryan Cooper made will be met.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely convinced by the arguments of Deputy Hughes or the other Deputies who have spoken against this amendment. I am not convinced by the argument that because the state of primary education is bad, therefore technical education should be put under the same authority.  It seems to me to be almost a paradox.  Also, I am a little afraid that the Ministry of Education has so many problems in its own sphere that the transferring of the problem of technical education would be a rather heavy burden to place on its shoulders.  I am impressed by the remarks of the Attorney-General, and also by those of the Minister for Agriculture.  I think the amendment the Attorney-General is prepared to introduce on Report Stage would improve the Bill.  We have had a valuable and useful debate on the subject, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to impress upon the Government the desirability of avoiding, as far as possible, the creating of a number of small schools. I quite agree with the Minister for Agriculture that if there is no possibility of providing the specialised education in connection with a particular industry in a particular district, then his Department should be given power to set up a special school for the specific purpose in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there should be a technical school in that particular area, and it is capable of adding an additional class and giving <Col N="1435" /> that specialised education in that technical school, it ought be done in that way rather than by setting up a series of schools.  I think that is the point we should be careful to avoid, and we should aim at concentrating rather than segregating.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-paragraph (v.), line 9, after the words `technical training,' to insert the words `other than scientific and technical research in relation to economic development.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a question as to the intention of the Ministry in regard to this. I suggest it should be research, with a definite scientific purpose, a technological purpose.  It may be undesirable that definite research work of that kind should be retained by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>I can understand, for instance, that the Minister for Agriculture would require to have authority over definite research work in reference to agriculture, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have responsibility for definite research work in relation to technology.  There does not seem to be any department within this scheme actively interested in research, and I think it will be generally accepted that industrial development and, perhaps, agricultural development depend as much upon the research student as upon any other single factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schedule 4 of this Bill places the Geological Survey under the Minister for Education.  I do not know what the Survey comprises, but if it is confined to land in connection with agriculture, it should be under the administration of the Minister for Agriculture.  The College of Science is used largely for definite and positive research.  Inasmuch as it is mainly used for educational purposes, it should be under the Ministry of Education.  But there are other operations possible in connection with it which should, I think, be under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture <Col N="1436" /> or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that that kind of inquiry should be definitely dissociated from the Ministry of Education.</P>

      <P>I hope this amendment will not be accepted.  Even so far as technical research is concerned, it seems to me that the greatest hope lies in research conducted under the ægis of the Universities, rather than under the ægis of the Government. I do not think that we need to look long back into the history of other Governments&mdash;we have not a long history of our own to look back to&mdash;to find that the needs of research have not been attended to by these Governments and are not likely to be attended to by Governments, who have many other things claiming their attention.  It seems to me that the hope of research, whether purely scientific or technical, lies in higher education and in the use of the laboratories connected with the Universities.  I hope the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson with, I am sure, the best intentions, will not be accepted.</P>
      <P>While speaking, I would like to mention a point in connection with this Sub-section, and to raise a question for the consideration of the Government. It may be argued that the wording of the Section goes further than is intended by the Government and leaves it open to some future Government to say that University Education has, through this Sub-section, lost that autonomy which, I am sure, the present Government does not wish to take from it.  It would seem to place University education on the same basis as the other systems of education.  I would ask the Attorney-General if he could not, on Report Stage, put in some words safeguarding University interests in that respect, and thereby remove the fears of those who, I think, reasonably regard the wording of the Section as ambiguous.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the last point, the position in connection with the Universities is that they are corporations under Charter and are self-governing units.  It is not proposed by the Bill to touch their autonomy or <Col N="1437" /> their educational or chartered position. If there is any doubt about that, the matter can be made right by a small amendment on the Report Stage.  The Section is rather directed to another aspect of the question.  Apart from the existing, permanent revenues of the Universities, if public moneys are to be granted them, that should be done upon the recommendation of the Minister for Education, and on his satisfying the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council that the grant should be made. Otherwise it is not proposed to touch the Charters of the Universities.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Johnson's point, the amendment the Attorney-General mentioned in connection with the last amendment moved by Deputy Major Cooper, will, I think, cover the matter he has in mind.  The Dáil has to remember that the most important schools of the country&mdash;primary, secondary, technical and university&mdash;will not be controlled by the State at all.  This Bill only deals with education and only controls education for which money is paid out of the taxes.  If Deputy Johnson's amendment were inserted in this Section, it is quite possible that it would not be competent for the Minister for Education, or any other Minister, to make grants in connection with scientific and technical research in relation to economic development.  Deputy Johnson will agree that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce be in a position to encourage scientific and technical research in relation to economic development, the Minister for Education and other Ministers should be also in that position.  I think the amendment which the Attorney-General indicated in regard to Deputy Major Cooper's point will meet the case.</P>

      <P>The arguments of the Minister are, I think, sound.  The object of this amendment was rather to leave it as a possibility for the Ministry of Agriculture or of Education or of Commerce, if funds were available, to do something positive for economic development in a specific line, which might not seem to be quite educational work.  I realise that the effect of the <Col N="1438" /> amendment would be, perhaps, to deprive the Minister for Education of certain rights which I would like him to have.  Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;In sub-paragraph (vii.), line 38, to delete the word `transport.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>The powers and responsibilities of this Ministry, as detailed in Clause 7 of this Bill, and also in the Schedule, show quite clearly that it is already overburdened.  It can be seen from the Schedule that the Ministry is really a combination of the Board of Trade, under the old regime, and the Ministry of Labour.  If the Minister and his advisers were in a position to give that thought and consideration to the problem of unemployment which is requisite, they would have, in view of existing conditions, a job that would be quite sufficient to keep them going for the next twelve months.  The functions of the Ministry are extraordinarily comprehensive and varied.</P>
      <P>It is improbable, especially in view of the declarations that have been made by the Government that there is going to be a greater amount of Governmental control for the Irish Railways or the Railways in the Free State, that the Ministry will be able to give the attention in the future to the question of Transport that they are able to give at the present time.  There is a case as a matter of fact for a separate Transport Ministry quite apart from the Transport and Communications Bill.  Whatever the fate of that Bill may be, if we believe the statements that have been made in this Dáil with regard to Government policy, and with regard to the future of the Railways, then I think that that aspect of the problem dealing with Railway, Canal and Road Transport should be dealt with by a separate Ministry.</P>
      <P>The Transport and Communications Bill does not add to the number of Ministers already in existence, but I think the amendment might be acceptable to the Government in view of their own declarations.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>

      <P>That was the deduction that I naturally, and I think most Deputies, drew from the Deputy's speech.  The time has not yet arrived for a separate Minister for Transport.  The Executive Government have not absolutely decided what they are going to do in regard to the railways.  If they propose taking over the railways, then one could understand the necessity for creating a separate Ministry of Transport, but under existing circumstances all the arguments that were used this evening against a Ministry for Foreign Affairs could be used with much greater force against the proposed Ministry that would result if the Dáil were to fall in with the views that Deputy Davin has given expression to.  Transport, in so far as it will be dealt with under existing conditions by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be a relatively small matter.  Railway transport is at present in the hands of several companies.  In all probability the same control will continue to be in operation, though the number of companies will probably disappear, and you will have one or two companies functioning as regards the control of the railways generally in Ireland.  In these conditions I think there is no necessity for giving effect to the amendment that has been moved by Deputy Davin.  We have not yet reached the time at which it is desirable that there should be a separate Ministry of Transport.  On the Bill to which he is to speak this evening I am sure Deputy Johnson will air his views at length and effectively, and that will be the time, I should say, when the decision reached on that Bill will determine whether the necessity for having a Ministry of Transport will arise in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Attorney-General has discovered the real point at issue in this matter.  In the first place, as I understand, the proposal in this consequential amendment is to make the Postmaster-General Minister of Transport and Communications, and, I suppose, of the Post Office, because, as far as I can see, it is not intended to take away the Post Office, but to change the name so that the Post Office should be administered by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and that there should be no mention whatever of that very important service in which the Postmaster-General has distinguished himself during the last eighteen months or two years.  I regret that I was absent from the Dáil when the Deputy was making his case for this particular change, but it appears to me that Industry and Commerce, as a Ministry, has had now a very considerable experience of these particular activities, including railways.  While Deputy O'Mahony is quite correct in saying that the Government has not a policy, he is correct to this extent that the Government has not disclosed its policy.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputies would not wish to hasten unduly the bringing forward of proposals for dealing with such a very important matter.  I am not at all satisfied that the Postmaster-General himself has a particular appetite for extending his activities in this direction, and I am not satisfied either that a case has been made to discount the work that has been done by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in respect of these particular services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that the amendment could be accepted by us; in fact it could scarcely be accepted by us, in view of the fact that a very important event is to take place at 7 o'clock this evening, and we would, to some extent, <Col N="1441" /> anticipate the discussions upon that very important measure if we were to give any consideration just now to the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>During recent months, and, indeed, for many months past, I have had considerable experience myself of this very intricate service, and I am of opinion that it would be very unwise at present to change the administration of these services from one Minister to another. I have no doubt whatever but that the Postmaster-General is a very able and competent Minister, but I do say that he has a very large establishment to administer, and that it is quite large enough to tax the energies of even a very capable Minister like himself, and that there are opportunities, very big opportunities, I should say, for effecting some improvements even in that service.  I should say, in common with other Deputies in the Dáil, that I admit the great improvements the Postmaster-General has effected already in that service.  To bring now under his administration another service, and a very different service to the one that he has, would be certainly unduly to tax his ability.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 10: To delete sub-paragraph (viii.).  On the Second Reading I dealt with the question of this Department <Col N="1442" /> existing as a separate Ministry, and I should say, in moving this amendment now, that it does not mean that the Department of Fisheries as a separate Department should cease to exist, although I urge that it might be split up and made a sub-department of other departments, but that does not necessarily follow.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove it as delineating apart for a separate existing Ministry in order that on the next reading the opportunity may be furnished for re-dividing the services enumerated in it amongst certain other Ministries. I stated, on Second Reading, and I repeat it, that if we were in the position to do so, the Department of Fisheries might be made one of the most important Departments of the State.  It might be raised, if moneys were available to be allocated to it, into a position of such great importance that it would then justify the allocation to it of a separate Minister.  I am now putting forward this amendment, not because I do not think the Department should be kept alive in view of that possibility of the future, but because there is no means at the present moment to make this Department of Fisheries a live department, to re-organise the whole of the national fisheries as they require to be re-organised, and particularly to organise export markets and home markets in the way in which they ought to be organised, so that I think that for the immediate purpose of this Bill the Department of Fisheries should be allocated elsewhere to another Ministry and not exist as a separate and distinct Department.  Now, I am met already by the argument raised in one or two places that it lies within the functions of the Executive Council in this Bill to say that one Minister shall discharge two or three of these Departments. That, of course, is perfectly true; that is the text of the measure, but I imagine that it would be conceded that by setting up these departments under separate heads, and calling each a Department in the official language in which the word Department is used in the Constitution, the way is paved for the creation of separate Ministries as well as separate Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that the Ministers that <Col N="1443" /> exist at the present moment are the Ministers that exactly, in number and in function, agree with the Departments set out here in Section 1.  I urge at the present moment that while the Department of Fisheries should be continued there is no need for a separate Minister for Fisheries.  Therefore, the whole of the services as enumerated in this Sub-section should be removed from the separate Ministry mentioned and should be placed over in the charge of other Departments.  And when that is being done I think a little previous examination might be desirable.  I believe it is right that sea fisheries should not be allocated to the Department of Agriculture, and I would like in that regard to see the whole of that branch of this nation's service, depending, as it very largely does, on the organisation of export markets, taken over by Industry and Commerce.  I do not stipulate for that, but I throw it out as a suggestion.  But I do urge that because they both happen to be called Fisheries there is no necessary connection between the administration of Inland Fisheries and Sea Fisheries.  I think that the administration of Inland Fisheries should continue to be exercised by the Minister for Agriculture because they naturally arise out of the operations of the Land Act; but the main question that I am placing here is this.  This Sub-section should be deleted because there is no room and no time, and there is no money for a separate Minister of Fisheries, and, therefore, in this Bill the whole of this Section should be removed and the duties and services of this Department that exists, and will continue to exist, should be attached to the service of other Departments.</P>
    <P>There is only one further matter that I want to deal with, and that is in reference to the argument put forward by the Minister for Agriculture himself on Second Reading.  He spoke of this Bill as being a permanent measure. I think that the allocation of different services cannot be regarded as in any sense permanent.  Different allocations are bound to be made as experience goes forward in the future.  All that this Bill really can be said to achieve is, <Col N="1444" /> for immediate and for present purposes, until the necessity for change should be evident when certain departments should be so separated as to make room, and give justification for, the creation of Ministers in respect of them, and it is because of that conviction that I urge that Sub-section (8) should be removed and that the Ministry at the next opportunity should reapportion those services amongst other Departments, so saving the creation of this separate Ministry.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this amendment I should like to say, in the first place, as Deputy Figgis will admit, there is no such thing as a permanent Bill with a sovereign Parliament. Undoubtedly although this is not, on the face of it, a temporary measure nor were a number of other measures, still as things grow and develop, amending Bills will be passed, reorganisations made and subsequently, perhaps, a Consolidation Bill of a more permanent character devised.  This is a Bill which organises the Departments of the State as they now stand, and puts them into their natural divisions, and Deputy Figgis answers that by saying that his amendment does not mean that the Department of Fisheries should cease to exist.  Now the deletion which he proposes, I am afraid, would have that effect, whereas what he is really driving at is that there should not be a separate Minister at the head of this Department, but that the Fisheries Department should be assigned with some other Department to an individual Minister.  I suggest that this is the wrong time to make that case.  The time for making that case is at the creation of Ministries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Figgis has stated that under the Bill one or two Departments may be combined by Executive Ministers. The position is that these great Departments of State may be combined by the Dáil when the Dáil is electing its Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there must be some loose thinking somewhere. Ministers are elected under the Constitution.  Under this Bill particular Departments of administration will be assigned to them.  At the beginning of a new Ministry the President is elected by the Dáil.  He proposes to the Dáil that he will appoint so many Ministers and assign them so many of the Departments of State.  He may combine two or three under a particular Minister and the Dáil may not approve. The Dáil may refuse to approve of his nomination for that reason. Again, he decides to leave certain Departments of State as at present, as the President did at the commencement of this Dáil, outside the Executive Council. It would have been open then, for instance, as Fisheries and Agriculture were left by the President outside his nominations, for the Dáil to have combined Agriculture and Fisheries as two Departments in the same Ministry.  The point I am making now is that this is not the time to raise this question.  This question becomes appropriate at the creation of a particular Ministry.  This Bill is not concerned with that particular matter.  It is concerned simply with putting on paper, under headings, the various Departments of State&mdash;the natural divisions of administration. When the next Ministry comes to be chosen, then Deputy Figgis can romp home with his proposition about combining them, if the President of that day should not himself take the initiative in doing that.</P>

      <P>The question at issue seems to be not whether or not we should have a particular Minister or a special Minister for Fisheries, but whether or not we should have a Department of Fisheries.  I am strongly in favour of retaining the Department of Fisheries, inasmuch as I believe that the fishing industry is one of the most important that we have, next indeed to the agricultural industry itself.  It is capable of even more development at <Col N="1446" /> the moment than the agricultural industry; at least there is more room for improvement there, seeing that practically nothing has been done during the last 20 years or so.  I will, therefore, oppose the amendment, because I believe that the fishing industry is of such importance, and can be of such vital importance to the country, that it is essential that a special Department should be devoted to its administration and development.</P>

I have stated, and I repeat, that I believe that if there was finance available to vote for the creation of a proper Ministry of Fisheries it might prove to be one of the most lucrative things that this country has done.  I believe our fisheries are probably our greatest natural resource.  It is a fact that at the present moment there is not that finance available. Whether that finance be available or not, it is surely obvious to everyone that that money will not be voted during the next financial year, and it is hardly likely to be voted in the financial year after the next.  In view of that you have got merely the maintenance of an existing Department, without the inauguration of new policies, without the finance appropriate to the inauguration of this policy, without any chance of extension or expansion, without any opportunities for the organisation of markets.  These things all cost money, and the money will not be available. Under the circumstances I argue that the Department should not exist as a separate Department, but that it should be put in with some other Department and administered by the Minister for that Department.  I appreciate the strength of the argument of the Attorney-General when he says that this was not the proper time.  I have all the greater reason for agreeing with the Attorney-General because I raised that very question when this matter was brought forward in the Dáil on an earlier occasion.  I thought that was the right time and not this.  But we were referred then to this occasion.  We <Col N="1447" /> were told when we raised the question, as to whether a Minister for Fisheries should or should not be appointed, that that was not the time to consider it and that it ought to be postponed until the Ministers Bill came on, when we could raise the question as to whether there should or should not be a Ministry of Fisheries.  I think the Attorney-General is right and that those who raised the question on an earlier occasion were right.  We and he are in agreement on that matter, but seeing that that assurance was given that we could raise the question now and not then we have raised it now.  I appreciate all that Deputy O'Connell has said as to the necessity for a proper Department of Fisheries with a Minister giving the whole of his time to it, when there would be enough finance brought into that Department to make it a living Department.  But there is not the finance.  There will be merely the continuation of the normal automatic functions of this Department until some time we hope in the very near future.  During that intervening period this Department of Fisheries should not exist as a Department in the separate sense that it will be entitled to a Minister, but it should be included in this Bill with the services of another Department.  It will be argued that because this Bill has set down in the Sub-sections of Section 1 certain separate Departments that each of these Departments will be Departments in the sense of the Constitution carrying separate Ministers.</P>

      <P>That is the sort of muddle-headedness&mdash;I do not know whether it is deliberate muddle-headedness&mdash;that Deputy Figgis has been the victim of since this Bill was introduced. This Bill does not aim at providing machinery for the situation that exists on the 5th December at five minutes to 7 o'clock.  It aims at providing the machinery of Government for the next 20, 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>That does not mean to say that we will not have to improve and amend it. At this stage at least we ought to know what we are aiming at.  We are aiming to provide machinery of government for the future, and any argument that it is not appropriate at the moment, while admitting that it may be appropriate in a year or two, is simply giving away the whole case.  It is common ground at least that in two or three years a very ambitious and a very costly, if you like, Ministry of Fisheries would justify itself.  That is a common case.  We are providing machinery here that would enable us in two or three years to do that.  Deputy Figgis' amendment would mean that if in two or three years we wish to add a Ministry of Fisheries we would have to have a special Bill for it.  If that is sound as far as Fisheries are concerned, why not apply it to every other provision of the Bill?  The Deputy did not give the question any thought, and that is shown by the fact that he has not made a single suggestion as to what Ministry it should be attached to.  It may be that I did not hear him.</P>

He certainly said before he sat down that he would not give the Dáil the benefit of his view as to what Ministry it should be attached to.  I suggest that he should begin to think about that question.  If he did, he might find reasons for establishing a separate Ministry of Fisheries more cogent than he thinks.  The fact of the matter is, and you have got to realise it, there is a special problem in this country, and that is the problem of the congested districts.  I think experience will show that you will require something like a Minister for the congested districts to deal with services that are peculiar to the congested districts, and that are not common to the congested districts and the other districts, such as land purchase.  That is the reason why I am advocating that there should be a separate Ministry of Fisheries, and that the same Minister should deal with rural industries. We have the machinery in the Bill for the future developments which, I suggest to the Dáil, experience will show is necessary in that direction.</P>

The motion is not put down in hostility to the Government.  I realise that these returns cost a certain amount of money and take a certain amount of time to prepare.

      <P>&ldquo;That the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin be admitted to present petitions of the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the said city before Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Dáil to confer upon the Dublin Corporation and the Lord Mayor of the city the same privilege that they had of presenting petitions at the Bar of the House in Westminster. Within the last ten or twelve years the Dublin Corporation, through its Lord Mayor, availed of this privilege on two occasions.  One petition was presented by the then Lord Mayor, Alderman Farrell, in support of women suffrage. The other occasion was when a petition was presented on behalf of the citizens of Dublin in 1916, to protest against what was described at the time as the brutal murders in North King Street, and it was proved that British soldiers raided the house and shot occupants in their own bedrooms, and so that the crime could not be detected they buried the victims in the cellar.  This matter leaked out.  It was conveyed to myself, amongst others, by persons who heard the digging during the night.  A visit was made to the house and it was discovered that bodies were buried there. The matter was then brought before the Dublin Corporation and, having heard the details, they decided upon availing of the right to present a petition at the Bar of the House of Commons. Sir James Gallagher was Lord Mayor at the time and he, with the officials of the Corporation, were received by the Speaker and the petition was accepted, with the result that a sworn enquiry was held into these shootings and, if I am not mistaken, a very reasonable verdict was brought in by those who held the enquiry, condemning the shootings and proving up to the hilt that certain actions had taken place which would not be allowed by any military authority in the world.  I forget who held the enquiry, but I know that some time <Col N="1452" /> later, following it up, Sir John Simon visited this country to enquire into the death of, amongst others, the late Mr. Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
    <P>In view of those two important occasions in which the Corporation succeeded in getting fairly satisfactory results in consequence of their right to present a petition, I ask the Dáil to accept this Motion.  Arguments have been put up to me to-day that should it be carried there is nothing to prevent every other Deputy who had an interest in a county council or urban council from asking that the chairman of such a body should receive the same privilege.  With reference to that, I might say that I think it is up to every Deputy, no matter what his pride in the area he represents may be, to remember that Dublin is the capital of the Irish Free State.  I am satisfied to let this matter go before the Committee, but I would ask that Committee to consider the points raised by me and to remember that on the two occasions on which the Dublin Corporation presented these Petitions it was not so popular to attack that body as it is to-day.  I quite agree that we have now a Parliament that can investigate all matters, but at that time it was admitted that the Dublin Corporation did good work when they presented the Petition which resulted in the enquiry into the terrible murders in North King Street.  I move the Motion.</P>

      <P>I gather from what Deputy Byrne has said that he is prepared to accept the amendment which stands in my name and therefore I do not think I need do more than to say that it seems to me to be illogical to proceed to discuss part of this question.  We have now appointed a Committee on Procedure to go into such questions, and therefore I simply content myself with moving the amendment, &ldquo;To delete all words after the word `That' and to substitute therefor the words: &ldquo;all questions connected with the presentation of Petitions before Dáil Eireann be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for report to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In seconding that <Col N="1453" /> I take the opportunity of stating that in connection with the first pilgrimage mentioned by Mr. Byrne I objected to the proceeding&mdash;the first occasion on which he states that the Dublin Corporation presented a Petition on behalf of Women's Suffrage.  I think that the Party, of which I was a member at that time, also opposed it and I think what they said was that it was not Women's Suffrage at all but that it was certain interested women who got a particular chance of having certain advantages from the Parliament of Westminster, and we opposed this procession of the Lord Mayor's up the floor of the House.  I understand he went up when the House was empty and that no notice was taken of it.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the proper body to regulate these matters. As far as Dublin City is concerned it has a fairly considerable representation in the Dáil&mdash;fifteen Deputies out of 150; one out of every ten&mdash;and I think what the City of Dublin may require in the future will be very well attended to by these Deputies.</P>
      <P>If we are to allow the Dublin Corporation this privilege I am positively certain that the Postmaster-General would immediately stake a claim for Cork and that we would have every other local authority claiming the same right.  To some extent that might possibly interfere with the independence of Deputies.  We have recently seen an attempt by the Dublin Corporation&mdash;or certain members of it&mdash;to feature political propaganda.  Certainly if that be the motion behind presenting Petitions here I will oppose it.  It is not for the purpose of giving play to that kind of thing.  We have no time for demonstrations of feminine excitement, and I hope we shall not have them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the Dáil to give a Second Reading to this Bill I shall have to relate somewhat of the <Col N="1454" /> intentions and go into some detail with regard to its general purposes and its needs, but I want to say right at the outset that this Bill is not presented in the expectation that when it is passed it will make any great revolutionary change, or add any great extent to the well-being of the masses of the people.  Further, I want to say that it is not put forward in deference to any preconception regarding nationalisation, or State ownership, or collectivism, or anything of that kind.  It is put forward in its present form in the belief that necessity compels action of this kind if the most is to be made of the nation's transport conveniences.  It has been asked why there should be any attempt to press forward such a Bill as this is at this moment; why should we not leave things as they are?  The answer to that is, of course, that the public, traders, agriculturists, travellers, are pressing for some action to be taken regarding the future of the railways so that they, particularly the traders, will know where they stand.  They are pressing for changes, because they believe that changes would result in a reduction in rates.  The railway companies, too, are uncertain of their future, and are holding up necessary development because of that uncertainty. The need for urgency was present in the minds of the Government eighteen months ago.  At that time they appointed a Commission and instructed it to sit day by day, if possible, with a view to making recommendations with regard to the future of the railways. Recommendations were made, but, as announced in the Dáil, the Government were not prepared to accept them. They recognised still in January of this year the urgency of the problem, and they said that they would give the railway companies a certain period within which to bring forward their own proposals regarding consolidation, or amalgamation, or grouping, and if within that time no agreed proposals could be brought forward by the railway companies then the Government would be prepared to bring forward their own proposals.  That time expired six months ago, and the necessity for action, from the public point of view, seems to be as urgent to-day as it was <Col N="1455" /> then, so that I think no excuse is required to be made for presenting this Bill as an attempt to meet the case put forward by many sections of the community, regarding the railway problem particularly.</P>
      <P>I want to lay stress at this stage upon this point, that this is not a matter of railway policy alone.  It is because the railway position is so closely associated with the general economic condition of the country, and its future economic policy is so much bound up with the railway policy, that I ask the Dáil to look on this whole problem, not from the point of view of railway policy, but from the point of view of national economic policy.  I think the Dáil will realise the necessity, if they are looking forward at all, for having at least a faint idea of what they propose this country should be; have some idea at least of the lines of policy on which it is intended that we should develop. We have a country to make the most of, and the question really is, what are we going to do with it?  The railway policy might well be directed towards satisfying the requirements, the desires, of the railway shareholders, and the country and the Dáil may say that we have faith in the natural genius of the people, and as a State, as a Legislature, all we have to do is to stand aside and keep order and let who will, do what he wishes, in the belief and faith that by allowing everybody to do as he wishes within the law that good must certainly come.  That is quite an understandable policy, and it is a view held by many Deputies, and those who hold that view will object no doubt strenuously to any proposals such as are in this Bill, but the appeal I am making is to the Dáil to set before itself at least a conception of the future, and to recognise that the transport problem is clearly bound up with any conception of the future of the country.  Really we have to decide whether transport is to be subordinated to general public policy, or are we to allow those in charge and control of transport so to order and govern their affairs as detrimentally to affect national policy, provided it satisfies the desires of those in control of transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I think it will be admitted that railway policy may conflict with national economic betterment, and the basic question I am putting to the Dáil is whether national economic betterment should be the primary purpose of transport policy, or whether transport policy should be so directed as to satisfy the desires of those interested in the transport business, irrespective of its effect on the national well-being.  To come down to a concrete illustration, it would be good railway policy, for instance, to encourage the transport of bacon through Dublin to Leicester&mdash;it is a long journey&mdash;and to bring back boots from Leicester to Limerick.  It would be good national policy to limit transport, and if other things were satisfactory to direct the bacon from Limerick to Carlow, and transport boots from Carlow to Limerick. National policy would be served by the second, while railway policy would be better served by the first.  I ask the Dáil to agree with this proposition, that if railway policy conflicts with national interest, railway policy must be subordinate; but speaking purely in general terms one would require to consider how best to ensure that railway policy will be subordinated to national policy.  That is really the problem to be answered in the discussion on this Bill. It may be said that there are a variety of proposals before the country for consideration.  It is urged by some, perhaps not very many, that the present arrangements should be continued, that there is no need to make any change the companies will look after themselves, and incidentally the country will benefit.  I think it will be generally agreed, here, at any rate, that that proposition is out of the question.</P>
    <P>If we take merely the question of baronially guaranteed lines we are faced with a problem which must be solved, and which can only be solved, by some change.  Representatives of those counties which have baronially guaranteed railways will not be satisfied to allow matters to remain as they are. The second proposition is that we should allow the absorption of selected lines by English companies.  No legal change is required for that.  Certainly no legal change is necessary.  It can be done by Stock Exchange operations.  I <Col N="1457" /> do not know how many members of the Dáil there are who will agree that that will be a desirable development.  Then we have the views of the Farmers' Unions as indicated by their witness before the Railway Commission&mdash;that there should be a continuation of the present ownership, that there should be no restriction upon any body of persons coming together who would like to build a new railway in competition with existing railways, and that the present railways should not be allowed to continue their monopoly but that there should be an authority set up to control rates.  That, I think, is a short and fair summary of the attitude of the Farmers' Union through their spokesman, Mr. Young, of Stradbally.  I do not know whether that view of railway economics is likely to be acceptable. The proposition that any group of men should be free to build a new railway anywhere and that the Legislature should not exercise any control in such a matter, whether it is largely supported in this Dáil or not, certainly would not commend itself to men of average experience in economic matters. Then we have a proposal that we should leave the railway companies to enter into voluntary amalgamation, allowing them, if they desire, to leave aside, out of the amalgamation, the non-paying companies.  I do not think that that either would commend itself to the Dáil.  Non-paying companies have been set up by Acts of Parliament, and, rightly or wrongly, they are part of the transport system of the country and must be considered, and I do not think that the Oireachtas would agree to voluntary amalgamations which allowed the non-paying companies to be left entirely outside.  Then there is the proposition which, it is suggested, was once, at least, the policy of the Government, that there should be compulsory amalgamation.  Such schemes would have to be submitted to the Oireachtas for consideration and approval, and then there is the scheme of State ownership and ultimate control.  The proposal which I have put before the Dáil is, of course, the last, and it is not by any means a new proposal.  It is neither revolutionary, radical, bolshevik, or anything of an abnormal nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> It has been recommended by the most staid conservative Commissions, and no one will allege at this stage that State ownership of railways has anything of a radical or revolutionary character about it.  There have been Commissions on this question of Irish railways running from 1836, 1865, 1881, 1906 and 1922, and, without exception, these Commissions have recommended State intervention of one kind or another. They have recommended changes in the administration of the railways, recommending Government action of one kind or another, and in reporting the history of railways in this country one reads the refrain, &ldquo;No Government action was taken.&rdquo;  Commission after Commission, and Inquiry after Inquiry, and still the continuous refrain, &ldquo;No Government action was taken.&rdquo;  I have a sort of notion that if Government action is not taken the railways will get into such a position in this country as detrimentally to affect the course of development.  I have said that this proposal is not revolutionary, nor is it new.  Even Adam Smith wrote so many years ago, &ldquo;The tolls for the maintenance of a high road cannot with any safety be made the property of private persons.&rdquo;  John Stuart Mill said: &ldquo;The charge made for services which cannot be dispensed with is, in substance, quite as much compulsory taxation as if imposed by law.  This applies to the case of a road, canal or railway.  These are always in a great degree practical monopolies, and the Government which sets such monopolies in the hands of private companies is in much the same position as if it allowed individuals or associations to levy any taxes they chose for their benefit on all malt produced in the country, or on all cotton imported into it.&rdquo;  The opposition to the proposal in this Bill is, in the main, an opposition to the principle of State ownership.  It is, I would point out, not an opposition to the principle of State subsidies.  Most of the opponents of the proposal, whether within railway circles or within mercantile circles, do not oppose, but rather suggest, the necessity for State subsidies in one form or another.</P>
    <P>They vary in their suggestions regarding the amount of control which <Col N="1459" /> such a substitute would carry with it, but none is consistent in taking this line that the State should neither have anything to do with railways financially nor in management.  I am very doubtful whether an efficient railway system can, in this country, be provided without some form of public assistance.  While I believe that is true, it is not intended in this Bill to provide for such public assistance.  We are suggesting that every effort should be made within State control to provide a railway service on commercial lines without any subsidy, leaving the users of the railways to pay all the charges that are incurred in the running of the railways.  Whether that will succeed or not, either under State ownership or under private ownership, is a matter for the future.  I will say this though, that the State has, as a matter of fact, in Ireland, come to the assistance of privately owned railways to the extent practically of seven million pounds. Most of it, no doubt, has been refunded, but the fact remains that State assistance, to the extent of £6,873,653, a sum equal to over fourteen per cent. of the total capital of the railways, has been provided by the State.  These figures are taken from the Scotter Commission Report, which Commission concluded its labours, I think, in 1910.  Of course we must bear in mind in speaking of the question of the ability of railways to maintain themselves without external aid, that there was pre-war for many, many years that kind of assistance, which arose from the underpayment of the railway servants.  Every witness practically, on the railway side, admits that before the war railway servants were underpaid.  True, they say, they were only in line with the rest of the community.  Nevertheless, the conclusion is that shareholders obtain their dividends by virtue of the fact that railways servants were underpaid.</P>
    <P>Now let us assume that the proposal for State ownership is not accepted, and that we are bound to the principle of unification.  Without public ownership it is the only practical alternative to the proposals of this Bill.  I have referred to the baronially guaranteed <Col N="1460" /> lines.  The railway companies' view of that is expressed by the General Manager of the Midland Great Western, speaking on behalf of the companies as a whole, and not merely of his own company, that if the railway companies were to be expected to take over the baronially guaranteed lines then there must be a subsidy from the State.  They also have the view that that subsidy shall not carry with it any representation on the board or any control over the management.  Even the minority of the Scotter Commission advocated a State subsidy.  Now, I am stressing this case, because I want you to have in mind, when you are thinking of the merits of this Bill or the principle involved, that the alternative is some form of railway organisation which involves a State subsidy.  It is suggested that there might be some kind of control over the rates by means of a Rates Commission, some kind of control from outside.  That is the view of the representatives of Chambers of Commerce, Farmers' Unions and the trading public generally, from all one can hear.  It is urged on every hand that there must be a tribunal to determine what the rates on merchandise shall be, that a body may be set up to make representations.  Rather in the language of the Scotter Commission minority they might make representations to the companies regarding the adjustment of rates.  On that I would like to stress the evidence of a very high authority, Mr. Acworth, who is a member of the minority of the Scotter Commission reporting against nationalisation.  He wrote in a book called &ldquo;The Railways and the Traders&rdquo; these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For every shilling cut by an expeditious tribunal off a rate, it is easy for the railway companies, if they are agreed to act in harmony with each other, to withdraw two shillings' worth of facilities; and the traders may make up their minds that this is what must inevitably happen if the railway companies are confronted with lower rates, simultaneously with the rapid rise of working expenses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Assume that your tribunal can fix a reasonable rate, what is the use <Col N="1461" /> of it unless it can schedule to its judgment a minute specification of the quality of service to be given in return for the rate?  The railways can bring down troops of expert witnesses.  How can the tribunal refuse to hear them when every student of railway economics knows that the reasonableness of each particular rate depends not merely on its own individual circumstances, but on a comparison with all the other rates and a consideration of the company's business?  But for a farmer or shopkeeper, with the assistance possibly of the local attorney, to undertake to fight trained railway experts with a lifetime's experience and with every fact and figure at their finger's ends, is only to court defeat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Railway Rates Tribunal, which is merely an attempt to adjust rates on merchandise, is a broken reed, entirely unfitted to secure the needs which the trading community desire.  The late Chairman of the Brighton Railway Company goes so far as to declare that even successful action is futile before a Rates Commission.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Companies could easily retaliate, under a sense of injury, by measures which no control could prevent unless it was prepared to take on itself the entire responsibility of the detailed management of the line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the classic case of the Chatterly Colliery Company:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thinking they were illegally overcharged by the North Staffordshire Railway Company, they took them before the Railway Commission, proved their case and secured an order confining the railway within the legal maximum.  Thereupon the railway company flatly declined to carry the traffic of the Chatterly Company.  They were again taken before the Commission and at once ordered to resume the traffic, subject to a penalty of £50 a day for refusing. They complied with the letter of the order, but `under as awkward and inconvenient circumstances for the Chatterly Company as the railway company could possibly arrange.' And Sir Alfred Hickman <Col N="1462" /> declares that though, technically, the Chatterly Company won everything, they could not compel the railway company to afford them ordinary facilities such as were necessary to carry on their business, and they were obliged to compromise the matter upon worse terms than the Commissioners had allowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the experience, I think, of many traders, even in this country.  I am quoting this case to show that the reliance upon the Railway Rates Commission to ensure that the traders' interests shall be safeguarded against the railway companies' attempts to make fish of one and flesh of another, in their efforts to make traffic pay, is quite unsatisfactory so far as influence on privately-owned companies is concerned. I ask the Dáil to conclude from that that the interests of the mercantile community, the manufacturing community that may come, the agricultural community, and the general travelling public cannot be secured by outside control.  The logical end of that argument is that a public service, such as the railway service, should be publicly owned and controlled in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I hope that every Deputy has carefully examined the provisions of the Bill and satisfied himself or herself as to where the defects, if any, lie.  Some, no doubt, will say the defects lie in the principle of public ownership.  Others will say that they agree with the principle of public ownership, but that the methods of control and management are not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Others will say that, granted the desirability of public ownership, the method of acquiring is not satisfactory to their views, or that the price to be paid is too generous or the method of fixing the price unfair.  I hope that Deputies will give vent to their opinions on these various points before the Bill leaves the Dáil.  In the main, I would like to say that we have taken the lead of the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the financial proposals of the Bill.  We desire to be at least as fair as the Government.  We acknowledge that they set us a very good example as to the method of acquisition <Col N="1463" /> and the terms of purchase and rate of interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey reminds me that there are arrears even in connection with railway service.  I may give the Deputy an assurance&mdash;if that is what he is seeking&mdash;that the arrears of payment from the County Councils to the railway companies will be completely wiped out by this Bill. Our desire in regard to finance and management of the railways under this scheme is that the railways should be run in such a way as to make the receipts cover all expenses, and to avoid the necessity for any State subvention. I hope that will be possible.  I hope, no matter what be the future of the railways, it may be found unnecessary to provide a State subvention.  But, as I said earlier, I am personally doubtful of the possibility of making the fullest use of railway transport without some form of State subvention.  But that may be a matter of future State policy. I hope that if ever it is decided that State assistance is required, that it will be for a definite, specific purpose, and not to make up deficits.  I would hope, for instance, that railway policy might be directed towards encouraging transport between points within the country, as distinct from the encouragement of transport from within the country to outside the country.  That encouragement may involve eventually some form of State subsidy in the earlier stages.  But that may be entailed, whether railways are nationalised or whether they remain under private ownership.  I have said that we have taken the Land Act as a precedent for our financial proposals and, differing from the report of the last Railway Commission, we are not proposing to deal with individual stockholders, but rather with the companies as corporate bodies.  We propose that there shall be a Railways Tribunal to fix the price, and that Railways Tribunal may be paralleled by the Land Commission. The Tribunal will value the undertaking, taking all the circumstances into account, and that Tribunal will also decide <Col N="1464" /> how the purchase price of any company might be distributed amongst the various grades of stockholders.  The intention is that the undertaking shall be valued on a net revenue-earning basis.  In doing that, it will be necessary to have regard to the amount of such earnings in the past, and to take into account the possibilities of maintaining these net earnings, having regard to all the circumstances, including the demands of the trading community for lower charges and the demand of the employees of the railway companies for a reasonable livelihood.  We also lay down that the maximum shall be based upon the average of the five best years in railway history&mdash;the five years preceding December 31st, 1913.  I have a suspicion&mdash;almost a conviction&mdash;that no matter what Tribunal would be set up, it would be found in practice that the maximum of fifteen years' purchase of the average of those five years would be the normal, one might almost say the minimum.  We propose that railway stock should be issued in exchange for the stock of the company, such railway stock to be guaranteed by the Central Fund, in addition to the earnings of the companies.  The stock would carry in one case 4¾ per cent. for 67 years, and 4½ per cent. for the first five years. Terminable annuity certificates will be issued, carrying, as I say, 4¾ per cent. for 67 years.  At the end of that time the debt will be paid.  At the option of the stockholders, redeemable stock certificates, carrying 4½ per cent. for 72 years, with a quarter per cent. sinking fund for 67 years, would be issued.  The financial effect of these two methods would be identical, so far as the State is concerned, and as I have said already, it is proposed that the debt due to the companies for the arrears of baronial guarantees would be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to these financial proposals I would just like to draw attention to two or three figures.  The total capital of the railways is round about £47,000,000 or so, according to the last figures I have been able to see, and for the five years preceding 1914 it may be said that the total yield of the dividend paying stock of the Irish railways was <Col N="1465" /> round about £1,700,000.  I have made an estimate, and I mention this to reassure certain timid Deputies who own railway stock or who have aunts or mothers-in-law who own railway stock and are afraid of the widows and the orphans, that assuming the revenue to be on the basis of, say, the year 1920, and assuming the expenditure to be on the basis of the most recent returns we have been able to find, there is ample margin not only for paying out of railway revenue all the requirements of this stock, but enough to leave at least a little for reductions in rates.  The reassurance I want to convey is, that from the calculations I have been able to make, the plan we have embodied in the Bill would allow debenture holders to receive, on State guarantee, 85 per cent. of the 1913 income from debentures, and that, bear in mind, was the best year in railway history.  Preference stock holders would receive, or could receive if so allocated, 75 per cent. of their 1913 income, and ordinary shareholders about 60 per cent. of the 1913 income, bearing in mind that that would be a State guaranteed income for 72 years.  Now that is even better than was guaranteed to the landlords by the Bill introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and passed through the Dáil and into law, and which was generally acclaimed by the country as most satisfactory.  We cannot, then, be charged with being niggardly or unfair to railway stock holders when we have done as well for them in this Bill as the Government is prepared to do for the landlords.</P>
    <P>This Bill does more than deal with the transfer of railways from the present companies to the State.  It proposes a scheme of management which, I submit, meets the requirements of the mercantile community as expressed through their witnesses before the recent Commission, and meets the requirements of the railway companies through their spokesmen in so far as they demanded something like a single control, without interference from busybodies or political activities of one kind and another.  Our proposal is that the railway system should be fitted into a general transport system, a system which has to do with all the means of <Col N="1466" /> communication in the country.  We have suggested, but have left the details to be worked out, that a road transport system, a canal transport system, and a postal communication system should be brought under one effective ultimate Government control. We do not think, for instance, that the Post Office is the kind of service which requires a political head by itself.  We conceive that the transport and communications of the country should be fitted into the general social economy, and should be finally controlled by a single Minister, but that the actual working of those various departments should be under expert guidance.  That is the conception that is attempted to be applied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are looking ahead, and we are asking the Dáil to think not merely for the next two or three years or five or ten years, but to lay plans for the building up of the nation, and one of the most important factors in that building up will be the means of communication and transport, and we are trying to persuade the Dáil to agree to a system which would enable all those various means to be co-ordinated under one Minister.  There is just one other point of minor importance that I wish to refer to.  That is the effect of this scheme upon the railways which are outside the present jurisdiction of the Saorstát.  We have conceived of the railway system of Ireland as a single system, and we look forward to the time, not far ahead, when that system will be, in effect and in fact, a single system under a single head nationally controlled.  We recognise the facts of the present day and we suggest that the appointed day, again following the Minister of Agriculture, for the transfer of the railways which run into the six Northern Counties should be a day to be appointed when convenient.</P>
    <P>It is quite within the purview of the Bill that if the necessity should arise such portions of the railways as are in the area of jurisdiction of the Saorstát should be transferred.  We prefer that a cutting of that kind should not take place unless it is found to be absolutely necessary, and hence we have suggested the delay of the transfer of the Northern Railways to a more <Col N="1467" /> convenient season.  There are, of course, innumerable points that will be raised in discussion, or shall I say, that could be raised in discussion, and no doubt most of them will be; but I think that to the broad principle underlying the Bill&mdash;State purchase, control of the railways in the interest of the nation as contrasted with control of the railways in the interests of railway shareholders&mdash;the Dáil should assent and further, perhaps I would have no difficulty in persuading the Dáil that if the principle of State ownership is accepted then the principle of purchase will be accepted also.  I, therefore, ask the Dáil to agree to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>We have listened to Deputy Johnson in proposing the Second Reading of this Bill, as we always listen to him, with pleasure.  As a novice in political matters, it strikes me as strange that a Bill of this public importance should be introduced as a Private Bill.  I think it has been recognised generally that the particular activities of an opposition is to take advantage of the slips that come from the Government benches, and when we find Deputy Johnson and the Labour Party bringing forward a Bill of this importance it seems to me very much like as if they did not anticipate, in the near future, at all events, occupying the Government benches, and that the opinion they must have come to is that in risking their reputation in the production of this Bill they are not doing their Party very much harm.  I think another consideration in this matter is this:&mdash;Whereas the Bill is brought forward by the leader of the opposition the attitude of the Government seems to be open to question. They have given us very little guidance in the matter, and it seems to me that the Government are in the happy  tion of looking on while the opposition exploits the proposition to find out how far it will go down with the country. That, I think, is the rather happy position the Government find themselves in.  In other words they are letting <Col N="1468" /> Deputy Johnson and his party pull a few chestnuts out of the fire for them, and I congratulate him upon that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the railways we have had some experience of Government control.  During the war it was considered necessary that the Government should take control of the railways, and speaking as a commercial man, I do not think the result of that experience has convinced very many traders that they are going to benefit by the change.  I am not prepared at present to take up the cudgels on behalf of railway administration.  It would not be politic to do so because to-morrow or the next day I may have various complaints against the railway companies.  But I do say that from a trading point of view, with all their defects&mdash;and they are many no doubt &mdash;I prefer the devil I know to the devil I do not know.  Any experience we have to rely upon in connection with the Government management of trading concerns is not, I think, a happy augury for the proposals of this Bill. What are railways?  It seems to me that not only in this country but in other countries railways have been made a stalking horse for all sorts of unsound propositions.  What is the difference between the railways and other ordinary trading concerns?  Railways have been built on a capital supplied by the shareholders to do a certain work.  In an ordinary business way these people put their money into the railways with the hope and prospect of getting a return for their money.  The Government are necessarily interested in the railways because of the powers which they hand over to the railway companies and consequently it is necessary for them to keep a certain amount of control as they would have a right to keep control of any form of industrial undertaking which required administration.  But why glorify the railways?  Why propose to nationalise the railways?  Have they a monopoly?  I think not.  They are a means of transport; so are steamships; so are your roads; so are motors on the roads; so is the air, or, at least, it will be in the course of time.  Trading concerns and trade are, no doubt, to some extent, dependent on railway traffic, but, from my point of view, I <Col N="1469" /> would rather see the trading community taking a stand themselves in the matter of organisation so as to be at any moment independent of the railways, if the railways were unreasonable. There is nothing to prevent it. If the rate from here to Cork is unreasonable what is to prevent the trading community having a boat to run down by sea or putting on motors to run down by road?  Personally I would rather see the trading community in the position of being able to tell the railway companies as far as the rates are concerned, that the rates were unreasonable and that they would take the matter into their own hands. What is Government control going to do for us?  Is it going to reduce the rates?  I think not.  Is it going to better the service?  I think not.  What we want is not unification.  We want the railways kept in a position to give us alternate routes for our traffic and &mdash;I am not saying they will do it&mdash; I hope they will take care of their own affairs.</P>
    <P>The shareholders are the proprietors in this case.  They ventured their money in the undertaking.  Where railways have been a failure I think you will find that mostly they have been a failure because they have been promoted and subsidised by the Government. In connection with these baronial railways which we hear about as being non-paying, if the country and the Government wish to put up an uneconomic proposition for the good of the country, I do not think they have a right afterwards to saddle the failure on anyone else.  In the same way, if a body of shareholders come forward and put money into a concern, and it is a failure, I do not think you will find many people coming in to sympathise with them to the extent of recouping them for money they put into the business. That is the main thing I want to emphasise, and that is why I object to the glorification of the railways any more than any other business or trading concern in the country.  In taking <Col N="1470" /> up this attitude Labour points to the fact that they were particularly interested in railways.  Through the operation of political forces which they were able to manipulate, they have secured a preferential and a peculiar position for railway servants that would never have applied to this country under ordinary conditions, and that would never apply to trading concerns as a whole on purely economic grounds. That is the difficulty our railways are in at the present time&mdash;the inflation of the charges which were forced upon the railways against the recommendation of the railway managements and in spite of any representation that could be made so far as they were concerned. That is the difficulty as far as the railway companies are concerned to-day, and it is not, I think, due to anything else but the operations of a law that cannot and will not apply ultimately to this country.</P>
    <P>Following the principles of this Bill, I think I may describe it as nationalisation of the railways mainly.  If I may speak on behalf of the traders, and, I think, of the public generally, either the Labour Party or the Government will have to put forward very much more cogent reasons for the change they propose to make than they have done in this Bill, in order to get the support of the people who will have to pay the piper if the Bill came into operation.</P>
