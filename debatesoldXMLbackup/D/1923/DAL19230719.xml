      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether certain whole-time officers of the Limerick County Borough Technical Instruction Committee were removed from office in September, 1919, for reasons other than incapacity or misconduct, under circumstances over which the officers had no control; whether they were awarded pensions and gratuities under Sealed Order of the Local Government Board in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919; whether their rights to such pensions were challenged in the Courts, and finally confirmed by judgment of the Court of Appeal; whether these officers are to be paid the pensions and gratuities so determined, and what arrangements, if any, are being made for that purpose, considering that nearly four years have elapsed since the awards were made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has no liability in this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand these officers resigned with the permission of the former Local Government Board under Section 8 of the Local Government Act, 1919, following upon a dispute concerning the administration of the Limerick County Borough Technical Instruction Scheme. Subsequently they applied to be granted allowances for loss of office.  The Limerick Corporation refused their claims, and later their cases were decided on appeal to the former Local Government Board.  The allowances so awarded were fixed at the maximum two-thirds rate, an equivalent of 40 years' service, when in only one instance did the actual service rendered reach 20 years.  The Board's decision was at the time challenged by the Corporation in the Law Courts, and was confirmed as stated.</P>
      <P>These cases are at present under consideration, and <i>ex gratia</i> advances in respect of the pensions and gratuities awarded are being made without prejudice from the Government Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to have printed and circulated a Bill dealing with the final disposition of the affairs of the Courts set up by the Second Dáil and by the First Dáil.  The Bill asks for the necessary statutory powers to wind up the business of the late Courts, and provision is made therein for the completion of the cases that were pending at the date of the abolition of these Courts, the hearing of appeals which were pending at that date, the registration and enforcement of decrees given by these Courts, the review of such decrees and whose correctness is questioned, and other matters arising out of the final winding up of the Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine that the main criticism of the Bill will be that it ought to have been introduced long since.  We would have wished to introduce it many months ago, and we are aware that hardships did occur here and there owing to its non-introduction; but in the circumstances of <Col N="1089" /> the time it was necessary to have a sense of proportion, and to deal first with the more important and more urgent matters.

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 34, page 14, line 65, after the word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;under this Act,&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;compulsorily,&rdquo; lines 65 and 66, and in line 66 to delete the words &ldquo;be extended&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;extend,&rdquo; and in line 67 after the word &ldquo;bog&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for the purpose of providing turbary for the occupiers of land in the neighbourhood thereof,&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;same,&rdquo; line 67, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;said bog.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It merely alters the wording; it does not alter the sense of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The lay mind reads this in such a way as to suggest it does alter the meaning.  It seems to me to be a weakening of the original proposal. The original section says: &ldquo;The powers of the Land Commission to acquire compulsorily any untenanted land shall be extended to include power so as to acquire any bog, whether the same is or is not subject to any right of turbary of other persons than the owner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the amendment seeks to alter it so that it will read, &ldquo;The powers of the Land Commission under this Act to acquire untenanted land shall extend to include powers so as to acquire any bog.&rdquo; I do not know what the exact meaning of the word &ldquo;extend&rdquo; may be, but if there is no reason for the alteration, it seems to me to raise a doubt as to whether the powers of the Land Commission <Col N="1090" /> would be to acquire bog compulsorily, whereas the original form made it quite clear that these powers should be extended so as to include powers to acquire any bog.  By altering the wording it seems to suggest to me that the powers will be only to acquire bog for purely local fuel purposes, and only at an agreed price.  As originally drawn, I rather thought that there would be powers to acquire bog for other than local fuel purposes. I do not know whether it is deliberate on the part of the Minister to make that change in the purpose, and, if there is no change in purpose, but merely a change in language, I suggest that some more justification should be given as to the reason for the change. Is it that it was not clear in the original form, or is there in fact a change in purpose and intention?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in intention.  The word &ldquo;compulsorily&rdquo; is left out deliberately because, it is reminiscent of the Acts of 1903 and 1909. It is possible that if the wording of this section was left as it was, and if the word &ldquo;compulsorily&rdquo; remained, it might be then held that the bog would be acquired compulsorily under the terms of the previous Acts and paid for in cash. This is only an amending Act.  There were compulsory powers to buy in the 1909 Act.  It is possible that the Judge might decide that a purchase under that section would have to be paid for in cash, whereas we want to ensure that the payment should be in bonds.  We make it clear that the Land Commission have power to take bog compulsorily by making the section read: &ldquo;power of the Land Commission under this Act to acquire any untenanted land.&rdquo;  They have power to acquire untenanted land compulsorily. I was going to suggest to leave out the word &ldquo;extend.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary. &ldquo;Shall include power to acquire any bog,&rdquo; etc.  That makes it absolutely clear that we have power to acquire turbary compulsorily as we have power to acquire untenanted land, and it makes it clear that payment is to be made in bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any necessity to include the words &ldquo;for the purpose of <Col N="1091" /> acquiring turbary&rdquo;?  That is a limitation, I think, and I would be rather inclined to argue that it is a weakening of the clause to put in that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice there is nothing in that sentence.  It is a description of the purposes for which you require it.  If we left it &ldquo;to acquire any bog&rdquo; it would be rather a peculiar way to draft a compulsory section.  You always set out the purpose for which you want it.  It is mostly a descriptive clause and in practice it does not in any way limit the power of the Land Commission to acquire turbary.  They will only acquire it for persons living, say, seven or eight miles away, and their discretion as to whether a man is living in the neighbourhood or not is very extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing in the course of inquiries into the utilisation of peat it were found possible to utilise a bog even in a small area more efficiently than the present method, then could the powers be held to extend to that bog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say not.  If some company wanted to acquire a large area of bog for the purpose of manufacturing peat by machine methods, I doubt if they could take it compulsorily under this Act.  You can only take turbary, as you take land, compulsorily for the purpose of division.  The Land Commission will have, especially in congested areas, large areas of bog on their hands, and when they are taking up bog they will take larger areas than they require.  If they do not take up a particular area, and persons want it for experiments, I do not think that they could take it compulsorily, and I do not think that it was ever intended that they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that you are not looking ahead, and you are rather limiting the powers unnecessarily of the Land Commission in respect of bog.  If there were new methods found for utilising bog, not necessarily the extensive schemes the Minister spoke of, but even small schemes, the powers you are now taking are limited unnecessarily.  You are closing the door without any necessity for closing it.  If that sentence were deleted, it seems to me the protection would be quite sufficient, and a possibility of utilising bog by new methods will then be available under this scheme.</P>

    <Col N="1092" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much that even if that clause were left out it would make any difference.  Under the Bill as it stands the Land Commission have only power to acquire turbary compulsorily for dividing it amongst tenants and landless men.  The Land Commission will have on hands large areas of bog as the result of the operations of this Act.  They will take up practically all the bog in the province of Connaught automatically.  It will vest in them as untenanted land.  They will thus have very large areas of bogs on hand with no particular use for them.  The same will apply to a lesser extent to areas outside that.  When they buy bog they will have a lot over.  The only way it can be limited is in the case where someone is looking for a particular area of bog which is not taken up, and he comes to the Land Commission asking them to acquire this compulsorily, at the same time saying that he wants it for the purpose of a small or a big experiment.  The Land Commission cannot take it compulsorily. If you left out those words even they could not take it.  Further, would it be the right way to do it?  We are going a long way to meet people who are experimenting in turbary by keeping all this bog on hands.  Would it be right to give the Land Commission power to take compulsorily a bog for purposes which have nothing to do with the relief of congestion or land purchase, especially in view of the fact that we are interfering with the rights of turbary of third persons in the bog?  If the Deputy will read the section, &ldquo;the powers of the Land Commission to acquire compulsorily any untenanted land shall be extended to include power so to acquire any bog whether the same is or is not subject to any right of turbary of other persons than the owner, and whether or not an advance under the Land Purchase Acts has been made for the purchase of lands including such bog, and, if made, whether redeemed or not.&rdquo;  We are interfering with the existing rights of turbary, and it would hardly be fair not only to take bog for the relief of congestion from people using it, but to take it for experimental purposes, especially in view of the fact that in practice there will be no difficulty about it, as the Land Commission will have far more bog on hands than they will require.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a holding has at any time been vested in a purchaser under the Land Purchase Acts subject to a superior interest or charge the Judicial Commissioner shall on the application of the proprietor, after hearing all persons concerned, order the redemption of the said interest or charge and all interests superior to them and fix the redemption price thereof.  The redemption price so fixed together with such costs as may be allowed by the Judicial Commissioner shall, notwithstanding the provisions contained <Col N="1095" /> in sub-section (4) of Section 9 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, be advanced and paid by means of 4½ per cent. Land Bonds and distributed by the Judicial Commissioner as if the redemption price were the purchase money of land vested in the Land Commission under this Act.  The advance shall be repayable by the proprietor of the holding by means of an annuity calculated at the rate of 4¾ per cent. on the amount of the advance, and the said annuity shall be consolidated so far as circumstances permit with the existing purchase annuity (if any) to which the holding is subject, and shall be recoverable in like manner as a purchase annuity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section also deals with the redemption of certain interests.  Probably the Farmers' Party and those acquainted with the subject are aware that many holdings were vested in some superior interests at the time of purchase, and this clause proposes to redeem these superior interests.  It follows on the same lines as the previous clause.  The object is indicated in the first part, and the procedure by which it is carried out is indicated in the second part.</P>

      <P>How can it be in this section?  This section deals with the redemption of head rents.  We will come to the other question the Deputy raises at a later stage, and I will deal with it then.  I suggest a slight change in this section, with the leave of the Dáil.  The last paragraph reads: &ldquo;The advance shall be repayable by the proprietor of the holding by means of an annuity calculated at the rate of 4¾ per cent. on the amount of the advance, and the said annuity shall be consolidated, so far as circumstances permit, with the existing purchase annuity (if any) to which the <Col N="1096" /> holding is subject, and shall be recoverable in like manner as a purchase annuity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose to delete the words &ldquo;shall be consolidated, so far as circumstances permit, with the existing purchase annuity (if any) to which the holding is subject, and.&rdquo;  There is an objection to consolidating the two annuities.  This section deals with purchases under the Ashbourne Act.  Only the interest of the occupying landlord was purchased; superior interests were not purchased, and it aims at redeeming the superior interests. Now, the annuities payable under the Ashbourne Act would not be paid into the same account as the annuities payable under this Act and in respect of these redemptions.  Hence there would be a very serious book-keeping objection to consolidating them.  There can be no particular objection to a particular farmer paying with two receivable orders instead of one.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where in the case of the sale of any land an agent has been employed in the management of the estate comprising the land sold, such sum as may be sanctioned by the Land Commission may with the consent of the owner of the land be paid to the agent in Land Bonds out of the purchase money on his ceasing to act as such agent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGibbon has asked me to move this amendment, which stands in his name.  I do not think the amendment will require very much to commend it to the Dáil or to the Minister for Agriculture. It is not an amendment which confers any rights, but merely allows, with various consents, the Land Commission to pay the land agents something in Land Bonds for the loss of the positions which they have held hitherto.  The amendment is purely permissive, and allows the land agents something in Land Bonds for the loss of their work, provided there is the consent of the landowners and others concerned.</P>

The landlord, having disposed of his property, and having received his price, will necessarily have to make arrangements to pay off all his hands, land agent as well as others.  I suggest that this should be a purely private arrangement between the landlord and his employees, and I do not see why an amendment of this kind should be put into the Land Bill.

      <P>I do not know very much about the law on the matter, but the amendment proposes to give power to the Land Commission to transfer part of the Land Bonds to the agent out of the purchase money which would come to the landowner.  The payment will be made direct, and not through the landowner.  I understand there is a legal necessity for this; otherwise Deputy FitzGibbon would not have put down the amendment.  I cannot speak on the legal aspect of the case, but perhaps the Minister for Agriculture would say whether the amendment is necessary or not.</P>

      <P>Is the purpose to save transfer fees?  I take it these bonds are marketable, and that there will be some fees to pay on the transfer, but if the Land Commission is going to hand these Land Bonds over to a third party, with the consent of the landowner and the agent, there are, I understand, some Stock Exchange and Finance Minister's charges avoided.  It occurs to me if that is the only reason for the amendment, that it might be accepted.  After all, the average agent does not come under the unemployment insurance, and, being deprived of his unemployment benefit from the State, he might well be allowed to take something from the landlord.  While it is true, perhaps, to say that in most cases the agents have been worse than the landlords, still people are saying now &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; and perhaps the landlord may be allowed to make a gift to his agent for having borne the sins that he himself should have been responsible for.</P>

The arrangement simply proposes to pay certain fees to the agents out of the purchase money.  The State is putting up no money.

Personally I have no objection to the landowners giving away Land Bonds, even to the extent of putting them in the Liffey, if they so choose.  I desire to say that I appreciate the kindly feeling that prompts this, the kindly feeling of the landowners in giving compensation to their agents, who were, I suppose, very efficient servants in their time.  As a matter of fact, the landowners seem to be putting the agents on the same level as public servants, and are treating them accordingly.  I hope they will do the same with their herds and with other workpeople who, up to this, have been engaged in the management of their property for them.  I would have no objection even if they were to compensate them out of the bulk of the arrears. It does not matter very much to the land agents where the compensation comes from, whether it is out of the bulk of the arrears or in Land Bonds, so long as they get it.  I think the landowners ought to be congratulated for the kindly feeling which this amendment reflects towards their land agents, and I think the Government and the Minister for Agriculture ought to be congratulated in providing them with the money to do that.</P>

In any case the Government ought to be congratulated on putting the landowners in the happy position of being able to give away a slice of their bonds in cases like these.

      <P>The landlords are very generous, or perhaps they are very loyal in carrying out their part of the bargain. No doubt there was an understanding between them and the agents, and perhaps others, in putting this through.  I know there was an understanding between them with reference to the previous Acts, under which the bonus compensated the agents for the loss of their employment. This will be a nice thing coming into the offices of our leading solicitors throughout the country who are not dependent upon this means of living.  It will make them comfortable for ever.  I think the landlords and the Government and everybody concerned ought to be congratulated.  I do not think we ought to stand in the way at all.  The State is very kindly providing the money out of public funds and out of the sweat of the unfortunate occupiers of the soil.  We were told about mortgage and other charges, but we never heard of the pensions provisions that were contemplated. We did not know that this was supposed to be one of the landlord's outgoings.  I am sorry we did not hear about it.  We would be more kindly disposed had we heard about this.  Anyway we wish them joy.</P>

There is no objection to the amendment, therefore I am not going to waste time talking about it.

      <P>To insert before Section 38, page 16, a new section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Land Commission shall have power to provide a suitable right of way or means of access to any property vested in or by them under this Act or any previous Act, subject to the payment by them of reasonable compensation in respect of any land acquired by them for this purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I hope will be of great value to the Land Commission and which is very necessary.  We know that in the past many Petty Sessions cases arose out of the fact that there was a great lack of agreement about rights of way on lands and such things, and the impossibility in many cases of getting from one place to another.  I have put forward this amendment really to convenience the Land Commission and do away with this fruitful source of litigation. The amendment provides that the Land Commission be empowered to compulsorily acquire suitable rights of way or means of access to any property vested in them or by them under this Act or any previous Act, subject to the payment by them of reasonable compensation in respect of any land acquired by them for this purpose.  I hope the amendment will appeal to the Minister.  It is one that will make for happy relations between neighbours, and will do away with a lot of legal contention.  I think it is absolutely essential in many cases.  I know of one or two cases in particular where there is not a right of way in certain places, and where they have no right to cart machinery and manure.  I think this amendment will enable the Land Commission to set these things right.</P>

They could not go back on the land purchased under the 1903 Act and change a right of way over the land.

      <P>(1)  Where it appears to the Judicial Commissioner that prior to the appointed day a landlord, or in the case of untenanted land, an owner, has been liable for the cleansing or maintenance in whole or in part of any watercourse, drain, embankment or other work, either alone or in conjunction with other persons, and whether under the terms of a contract of tenancy or otherwise, he may direct that out of the Land Bonds representing the purchase money there shall be transferred and applied in manner hereinafter provided Land Bonds sufficient to yield such income as in his opinion will be required for the future cleansing and maintenance of such watercourse, drain, embankment or other work, in accordance with the liability as ascertained by him of the former landlord or owner.</P>

    <P>This Amendment is to cover cases that were put forward during the discussion that took place in the Committee Stage dealing with embankments and watercourses. It covers that class of work fairly comprehensibly.  I do not see that there is any common obligation laid on the landlord towards works that were of <Col N="1103" /> general utility and of necessity to tenants. The Amendment gives the Land Commission power to make provision for watercourses, drains, and numerous other things, serving a large area, and to take from the landlord in Land Bonds a sufficient sum to yield what will pay for work that the landlord is now being exempted from.  It is the duty of the Land Commission to see that the Bonds are held, and that the community will not suffer by the change of ownership.</P>

      <P>Because it says here that &ldquo;all these minerals, or rights of mining and taking minerals, digging and searching for minerals, are vested hereafter in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; and it adds a proviso that this section shall not apply to any mine or quarry that is being worked or developed by the owner on the appointed day.  But under Article 11 of the Constitution there is a still further proviso which, presumably, being in the Constitution, governs this. It is not expressly stated in the amendment, and there might, with clarity, be included in the amendment a statement that such vesting shall be subject to the trusts, grants, leases or concessions.  It might quite argueably prove to be the case that a farmer might not himself be mining, but he might have granted certain leases and concessions, which are not dealt with in the amendment, although they are implied in the Constitution, and in order to make the amendment square with the Constitution I think an addition of such words would be to the advantage of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the second proviso, because it seems to me that there are no grounds for paying anything for minerals which are not worked <Col N="1105" /> or developed and probably have not been known to exist, and why the owner should be entitled to receive 25 per cent. compensation for things that he did not know existed, or, if he did know they existed, has not made any use of them, passes my understanding.  It seems to me to be throwing a gift into the air unnecessarily, and I will ask the Deputy to justify the second proviso if he can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the second proviso can be easily justified.  We are taking up this land compulsorily, and the owner would not part with it but for that fact.  We do it on a wholesale scale, and we are giving him no option.  If we happened afterwards to find a gold mine in an area of untenanted land which we have taken up, it is only fair that the owner who had to part with the land at fifteen years' purchase should get something. That is only equitable and just. It would be a different thing if we were buying the land voluntarily, but here we are taking up all untenanted land compulsorily, and taking it up at a price which no one pretends has anything to do with the value of any minerals in it.  I think that is an answer to that.</P>

      <P>The explanation makes it clear, I think, that the Dáil should oppose this proviso.  I take it that it is in order to move the deletion of the second proviso, and I therefore beg to move it.  I take the view quite definitely that land which has gold under the surface, which has been lying there unworked, such land having been purchased even compulsorily does not justify the State in paying this 25 per cent. to the landlord.  He is not losing anything.  We are compensating him for the loss of property which he did not know he possessed. He cannot be said to have purchased the estate in the belief that there was gold there, or copper, or any other mineral; and if he did, and held it out of use, knowing that there was mineral wealth there, he should pay compensation to the State for not having used it, knowing it was there.  Certainly no compensation should be paid to him because you have taken from him that which he was making no use of, either for himself or anybody else.  The proposal is unfortunate. I think we were told, in one of the discussions, that it is agricultural land we were dealing with, and the landlords' <Col N="1106" /> rights, at least the landlords' rentals, were being purchased.</P>

      <P>Yes, I beg your pardon. We are dealing with untenanted land in this, but, nevertheless, it is agricultural land, and the fact that these minerals are not being worked, and have not been worked, seems to me to take away any claim in justice or equity, or even any claim upon generosity, that the landlord may have for any compensation for those unworked minerals.  As is more likely still, the existence of those minerals might not be known at all to the landlord, but we are to compensate him for their loss.  That is over-generous, and I think that no claim for any such compensation could be justified, and ought not to be asked for, and I urge the Dáil to delete this second proviso in this new sub-section.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson, I am pretty certain what the effect of the amendment would be, but to this extent I am in doubt, that I am not quite certain of what the exact meaning of the words proposed to be deleted are.  Let me take a hypothetical case.  Here is a parcel of untenanted land that becomes vested in Saorstát Eireann.  At some future date there may be a considerable deal further on, and in time valuable mineral properties are discovered in that land.  Supposing at that time Saorstát Eireann should decide not to sell that land.  What I am putting is, that if at some future time the State decides not to sell that land but to lease it, which is a practicable course to adopt, and which, if its own geological surveys prove valuable properties to exist there it would be very well advised to adopt. In that case, is it to be the effect of this amendment that the person who owns land at the moment and suspects no mineral virtue or value to be contained in, is he to get 25 per cent. of the profit of the working of these minerals hereafter? If it be the case that you have a large profit, a deduction of 25 per cent. from that would mean that the venture would still be worth working, but if the net profit was small the reduction of 25 per cent. might prove it was not an economical proposition.  Therefore, by binding the future in this way the State and the national wealth may be injured, and I urge that the whole of this might be considered.  As the matter now stands I am prepared to vote for the adoption of the amendment by Deputy Johnson, because this second proviso unnecessarily binds the future, and may prove of injury to the industrial development of the resources of this country.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that the object of the amendment is to do away with all the interests of the owners absolutely?  If not, what is it then?  Some of the people who have purchased under previous Acts got minerals, and some were retained by the landlords, and others were vested in the State, according to the voluntary agreements they made.  I would like to know how far the amendment proposes to go with regard to this amendment.  Are the people who actually owned the land to get nothing at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the people who are actually in <Col N="1108" /> possession to get nothing at all?  Twenty-five per cent. seems to me to be a small amount; it is little enough, too little to my mind.  To cut away that twenty-five per cent. altogether seems to be going a little too far.  Perhaps the Minister's word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; would apply here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to what I said before.  The reason we provided twenty-five per cent. for the owner is quite clear.  We are taking the land compulsorily; we are taking it on a wholesale scale.  If gold, coal, or iron were subsequently discovered under neath it, the least we might do is to compensate the owner.  With regard to Deputy Figgis's point about twenty-five per cent. out of the net profits, if there were any profits at all, it would not be possible to take twenty-five per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the misapprehension my first words created, and I showed exactly how from a business point of view, what I said stated is correct.  If it were yielding a net profit of twenty-five per cent. it could afford to pay twenty-five per cent., and would still be an economic proposition, but it with a deduction of one-quarter the net profit were not more than five or seven, it might still be an economic proposition, but with the deduction of twenty-five per cent. it would cease to be.  To fix an arbitrary twenty-five per cent. in advance is not economically wise if the mineral resources of this country are to be developed, because the margin of profit available for the working of a large number of them must necessarily be very small, indeed.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputies generally have been more or less convinced that the purchase scheme of this Bill is fair, and while being fair to the tenant, is not ungenerous to the landlord. That was the claim that was made, and under that claim Deputies have been induced to vote.  Those who voted on these grounds surely are not going to be persuaded to add something to their generosity to the landlords at the expense of the State.  The landlord is in possession, or has been in possession, of certain rights to draw rent from agricultural land.  These rights have been purchased and are being purchased at a price which the Minister has urged, and which Deputies generally have been persuaded to agree is not unfair.  They are parting with their control of that land for the sum which has been mentioned by the Minister in promoting this Bill.  Deputy O'Maille comes along and says that if it is found at some future time that under this land which has been purchased by the Land Commission, there are minerals which the landlord knew nothing about, or if he did know anything about them, had taken no interest in them to work or develop them in any way, and if the Land Commission makes use of those minerals by leasing them hereafter or selling them, then the person who is now selling the land is to get twenty-five per cent. unless his interest shall have been purchased in the meantime by Saorstát Eireann.  Are we to understand from that that he retains his mineral rights?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under Clause (a), because that provides for any mine or quarry which is being worked or developed by the owner.  That I can quite <Col N="1110" /> understand, and I am prepared to concede. But we are dealing with mines or minerals which are not being developed or worked by the owner, and which, in all likelihood, the owner never would have developed.  He possibly had no conception that there were minerals under his land at all.  We are asked to ensure that that landlord who, on the passing of this Bill, would have no rights in those minerals, receives a payment of twenty-five per cent. in rents or purchase money which may accrue to the Land Commission by virtue of a subsequent arrangement they make with a company or an individual who undertakes to develop these minerals.  I say that is unnecessarily mortgaging the Land Commission's future.  It is giving away money; it is quite gratuitous and unnecessary.  It is telling the landlord or his sons that henceforward we are, at least, conceding they had a right in those lands; that all the statements that have been made in the Dáil and in other places regarding the method of acquisition by the landlords, may have been true in regard to agricultural land, but are not true in regard to the minerals under the land. We are asked to say that whatever may have been the fact in regard to the land as agricultural land, and however truthful is the contention that people who work the land were the true owners, subject to the national needs, so far as the minerals are concerned it is suggested that the landlords are perfectly entitled to twenty-five per cent. of any profits that may be made out of the sale or purchase.  That is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a gift that has not been asked for.  It is asking the Dáil to say, &ldquo;While you have been so generous to us with regard to your agricultural land, you have been so friendly disposed to your tenants and the fact that you have not kicked up too much of a row over the 15 years' purchase justifies us in saying if there is any bonus to be thrown away we will give it to you; if any luck comes to the State by reason of the fact that there are minerals under the lands, we are going to give you 25 per cent. of this luck.&rdquo;  I wonder what necessity there is for introducing this proviso?  I do not think there has been any good argument put up in making so generous a promise. Surely when the landlord has given up all his claim to the agricultural value of the lands which he is selling we <Col N="1111" /> have no right to come along and say to him &ldquo;We will secure you, at least, 25 per cent. of any profits we may make because of any discovery of minerals under that land in the future.  You need not do anything to help to work these minerals but because your father or grandfather or great grandfather obtained possession of the surface, we are going to secure you 25 per cent. out of the profits we may make if these minerals are found there at some future time.&rdquo;  I am surprised at the Minister accepting this amendment in its present form.  I am sure Deputy O'Maille, now that his attention has been called to it, will agree to delete the second proviso, and allow the new Sub-Section to finish at the word &ldquo;claim.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputies will have to remember that we are not dealing with tenanted land exclusively.  We are dealing with the untenanted land, with land that the landlord is farming.  We are taking up such land.  We are acquiring it compulsorily.  The landlord is in the same position now with regard to a very great part of the land we are taking, just in exactly the same position as the farmer is in relation to his own holding.  We are taking up this land compulsorily on a wholesale scale, not at the market price but at a certain price for sub-division to tenants and congests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair price, having regard to the prices that the tenants are able to pay for it.  It has nothing to do with the market price, nothing whatever. It is a much smaller price than was given under the previous Acts.  The Land Commission is retaining for itself the minerals on this land, and without any attempt, of course, in any way to pay for them. If there are any minerals they do not go to the tenant-purchasers; they are retained by the Land Commission.  We do not profess to buy them; we simply retain them for the Land Commission. They are there.  If it is found afterwards that there are valuable mines in these lands, say gold or silver or lead or copper mines or anything you like the Land Commission, who have never paid a penny for these minerals, and I am sure they have not paid anything extra which would go in some way to pay for those minerals, are asked to pay a <Col N="1112" /> very small percentage of the price to the owner from whom we are taking the lands compulsorily, and who conceivably might have worked these minerals if the land had been left to them.  In the previous Acts of 1903 and 1909 there is a similar provision, and I am willing to change that provision slightly to make it read like this: &ldquo;Provided also that where any such rights vested in Saorstát Eireann under this section are at any time hereafter let, leased, or sold, the person who would have been entitled thereto if they had not so vested shall be entitled to receive such a share of money in respect of the same or for profits as shall be hereafter determined by the Oireachtas.&rdquo; That will leave the whole question open to the Oireachtas afterwards.  They can say how much the owner is entitled to. I put it to the Dáil that it would be grossly unfair, having taken those lands, having reserved these minerals, if the owner who was not paid for these minerals, and whose land was taken compulsorily, and who in that sense will not have an opportunity of working them, that the State should make any profit out of these things, and that he would be entitled to nothing.  Under the 1903 and 1909 Acts there was a proviso similar to the last proviso here.  I am offering now to change this as I suggested.</P>

      <P>It seems to me there has been a doubt in Deputy Johnson's mind about this matter.  If that amendment were accepted I rather fancy that the whole section would be quite contrary to Article Eleven of the Constitution.  Deputy Johnson's amendment would mean that the landlord would not get 25 per cent. of any profit acquired in the working of the minerals of the lands.  In that case you will be able afterwards to come in, and claim all the minerals under Article Eleven of the Constitution which says &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann shall claim the mineral rights, subject to any valid private interest therein.&rdquo;  I take this clause suggested as in the nature of a bargain, to give a certain percentage in the case of minerals. In return for that the landlord surrenders his rights.  If this Bill becomes law, Deputy Johnson says there will be no private interests.  I think that admits the landlord has private interests in any undeveloped minerals.  If we passed this section it takes from the landlord all <Col N="1113" /> these valuable private interests.  We may be doing something that may land us afterwards.  He can come in under Article Eleven of the Constitution, and say, &ldquo;Under Article Eleven of the Constitution you have no right to take these from me; they were given to me by the Constitution and I claim the whole mineral rights now.  I will take the whole profits arising from them.&rdquo;  I submit this will be a very proper bargain to make.  It costs the State nothing.  For that the seller would be giving up all his rights as guaranteed to him under the Constitution.  The State will get 75 per cent., and the present owner 25 per cent., and for that offer the seller would be giving up all his rights which are guaranteed under the Constitution.  I think, as the Minister has said, it is only fair to give him something for his present rights.</P>

I am not speaking without definite relation to certain pieces of untenanted <Col N="1114" /> land where 25 per cent. would debar development. Take the land in Co. Kilkenny within the area of the Leinster coalfields, where there is only one seam possible to work at 21 inch thickness. As now worked, it does not show a greater profit than 6 or 7 per cent.  If 25 per cent. were taken off, the proposition would be reduced to a line ball proposition. I congratulate the Minister on removing the 25 per cent., and leaving this question to be decided in the future by the Oireachtas&mdash;not only as a question of justice, as a question of right, and as a question of valid interest, to which Deputy Thrift has referred, but also as a question as to what such available rights or property, hereafter discovered, can bear in order that their working and development may be made profitable.</P>

      <P>Before this is definitely put, I would like to recur briefly to the point I made before.  I understood the Minister to say that the word, &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; in the amendment, included the leases or concessions, but the leases or concessions I have in my mind are those held by third parties. If the Minister is convinced that the third party rights protected by the Constitution are adequately covered by the word &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; I do not press the point, but I think it is worth inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that it is possible this suggested amendment is an improvement upon the fixed rate, but it does not satisfy me as to what I think the Dáil should ask.  What is created by this sub-section in this new form, as it seems to me, is a new landlord's interests.  With this sub-section inserted the landlord's present interest in the minerals which are hidden and have not been worked, and may not be known to the landlord&mdash;these interests are transferred to the Land Commission, that is to the State.  What the new sub-section now proposes to do is in effect to create a new interest for the landlord.  It suggests that &ldquo;unless his interest shall have been purchased in the meantime by Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

It simply does nothing, as a matter of fact.  It says that future Parliaments may make up their minds what they wish to do, and if that is a fair interpretation of it, I will make up my mind on the subject before we come to the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ROONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 34, to delete in Section 41, lines 39 to 42, the words &ldquo;by a Co-Operative Farming Society (in this Part of the Act called the Society), or by a body of Trustees, by means of advances made by the National Land Bank, Limited (in this Part of the Act called the Bank),&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;by means of advances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is for the purpose of giving tenants similarly situated as tenants of the Land Bank, and who are paying interest in lieu of rent to other banks, the same treatment I think it would be very unfair to provide for tenants that have the good fortune in this case to be tenants of the Land Bank and to leave tenants out of the benefit of this Bill who have the bad fortune in this case to be paying interest in lieu of rent to other banks.</P>
      <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle at this stage took the chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnRooney" hpid="Mr. ROONEY Mr. ROONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ROONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one of a series in my name, Nos. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41.  I think we might deal with them all when dealing with the one.  I think the tenants who are dealing with other banks should be put in the same position as those dealing with the National Land Bank, and that is the object of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose the Deputy has at heart is effected already in the Bill.  If he looks at Section 30 of the Bill he will find it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the owner of a parcel of untenanted land which is vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act uses and cultivates the same as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry; then</P>
      <P>(a) If the price of the parcel together with the value of any other lands in the possession of the owner as ascertained by the Land Commission does not exceed £3,000 the Land Commission shall, unless in their opinion it ought to be retained for improvement or enlargement or for utilization in connection with the relief of congestion, re-sell parcel to the owner at the said price, if before the appointed day he has undertaken to purchase it at that price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in the Congested Districts, that is in <Col N="1118" /> the whole province of Connaught and in the counties of Kerry, Donegal, and part of Cork and Clare, all the untenanted land bought by landless men will vest in the Land Commission as untenanted land.  It is practically all fee simple land and the Land Commission will have the power to re-sell back to the owners.  That I take it meets the case which the Deputy has in mind so far as the congested districts are concerned. Now in regard to the case outside the congested districts he will find that that is provided for in Section 33 which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission may purchase any untenanted land which they consider necessary for the purpose of providing parcels of land for any of the persons or bodies to whom advances may be made under the provisions of this Act, for such price, payable in 4½ per cent. Land Bonds of equal nominal value, as shall be agreed upon between the owner of such untenanted land and the Land Commission, and such land when vested in the Land Commission shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act relating to the providing of parcels of land for the persons or bodies aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gives the Land Commission power to buy untenanted land voluntarily from these people, and of course they will want to sell it and to make advances for the person or body to whom advances may be made under the provisions of this Act which is for the purposes of Section 29.  Now between Section 33 and Section 29 the Land Commission have ample power to deal with cases so far as there is any merit in the case.  They can buy the land voluntarily and resell it to the body or the trustee or the individual.  Between these two Sections they have ample power to deal with every case which has any merit in it.  There will be cases that they will not deal with, and rightly so, but so far as genuine cases go, they have ample power.  The reason we have a separate Section for the Land Bank is because the land was bought under peculiar circumstances. The method of buying was peculiar, and all the conditions attaching to Land Bank sales were unique, and we thought it better to have a separate Section dealing with this separate case in which landless men bought land, and <Col N="1119" /> we have divided that matter in the Bill between Sections 33 and 29.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I know one case in Kilkenny and Carlow where the land was bought for £64 an acre and the bank advanced the money on the guarantee of the trustees.  There is one case in Carlow in particular which will be a very knotty problem.  Are you going to deal with the other banks on the same basis as the Land Bank?  The Land Bank started about the same time advancing money for the purchase of land; the other banks came into competition with them.  I have another case in which the tenants are subject to the ordinary landlord's rent and also to interest on a mortgage which brings the land up to £6 an acre.  I do not know how you will deal with that.</P>

      <P>We will not be able to solve all these cases here, and the Land Commission will have to do the best they can in each particular case.  It is quite true that land has been bought very dear all over the country, and it will be very hard to deal with many of the cases.  I assume the Land Commission, if they consider the land security at all, will finance the transaction up to 4½ per cent., and will try to relieve the tenants from the interest which they owe to the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be quite clear as to the effect of this amendment. The new sub-section speaks of &ldquo;by general regulation authorise the registering authority to register the person claiming under any instrument executed by the proprietor.&rdquo;  It seems, from the original reading, that where there was to be any sub-division, it would be with the consent of the Land Commission, which rather suggests an individual application for consent and a consent in respect of individual cases; but the new sub-section speaks of &ldquo;general regulations,&rdquo; and rather suggests a general assent to sub-division in a class of cases, but not in an individual case where an individual application is made and an individual assent given.  The case seems to call for a separate application and a separate assent in every case rather than for &ldquo;general regulations&rdquo; covering a whole class of cases.  Some words seem to be required to say that the Land Commission shall, subject to these &ldquo;general regulations,&rdquo; make the assent that is spoken of under sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to apply to a class of cases which are quite common.  Very often a farmer by his will leaves the holding to one member of the family, but, perhaps, directs that his widow shall have the right to reside in a particular room of the house, or something or that kind. Technically, that is a sub-division, and it is in order to ensure that every case like that might be dealt with by general regulations, rather than that a special application should have to be made to the Land Commission, that this amendment is introduced.  The registering authority will deal with cases of that kind rather than the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>With your permission, as you are otherwise engaged, I shall move the amendment standing in your name, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 64 (2) (a), page 25, line 5, after the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and there shall be payable to the tenant such compensation as the Judicial Commissioner may declare him entitled to in respect of any sums he may have expended on improvements. Such compensation shall be payable in 4½ per cent.  Land Bonds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is to carry out an undertaking that was given on a former Stage, that where in a congested district a holding had been created by a very recent letting and the tenant had incurred expense in putting improvements upon that holding, and where the letting was declared void by reason of its having been made with this Act hanging over its head, that such tenant should be entitled to such compensation for his improvements as the Land Commission thought fit to give him.  This is to carry out an undertaking given by the Minister, and it is only doing justice to a tenant whose holding is upset.</P>

      <P>I want to commend this amendment.  I think it is a very <Col N="1124" /> good sign to find that Ministers are prepared to incorporate in Acts of Parliament a suggestion of this kind, that the chief officers of a trades union be consulted before any legal rules are drawn up.  I think it is a very desirable precedent to create in the law, and I hope it will be followed by other Departments as well as the Department to which the Minister for Agriculture is responsible. There are quite a number of cases where the chief officers of trades unions might well be consulted before any decisions are taken by Departments, and I commend this amendment to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  If I may say so, it is a most annoying amendment.  It alters the whole scheme of the Bill.  We could easily go back to the old system under which every holding would be inspected. That might be the fairest way, but it was in response to the demands of the unpurchased tenants and the various other Land Associations that I dealt in this system of averages.  I believe it is sound as far as it goes, and applies to judicial rents.  Deputies want to have <Col N="1125" /> it both ways.  They want to have an average, and if the tenant is not satisfied with the average, then they want that they should be able to apply to the Land Commission and have a new inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be ashamed to have that in an Act.  Why should not the landlord apply also if he thinks the rent is too low?  Let us do injustice if we like, but hide it if possible.  I would not accept this at any price because it alters the whole scheme of the Bill.  We agreed that as far as judicial rents were concerned that a specified reduction would be given and that was recommended for two reasons.  (1) expedition; (2) having regard to the fact that rents were regulated by law and escaped the inflation due to the war that any little injustice that would be done by an average would be so small that it would not make any difference. Here we are back to the old scheme under which any tenant that likes could apply to the Land Commission to come and value his holding.  That would hold up the sales for a very long time and would, in fact, bring us back to the system in the 1903 Act.  This amendment would mean that wherever a tenant thought he could get his rent reduced he could apply to the Land Commission, but if the landlord thought the rent was too low he could not apply.  A provision of that sort in an Act would not be a credit to the Dáil.  It would not be what you call even-handed justice, and I will not accept it.  We fixed this 35 per cent for first and second term rents with a view to having it so low that it would cover any cases, even special cases, and I am satisfied that no hardships will be done by the automatic application of that rule.  In fact, Deputy Gorey practically admitted yesterday that the tenants were perfectly satisfied with the 35 per cent. reduction.</P>

      <P>I know they are peculiar cases.  These tenants or their children <Col N="1126" /> could not go into a Court while the original owner lived.  There are some cases in County Kerry.  After the original owner died the children went into Court during the war years and a high rent was fixed that counted as a third term. In these peculiar circumstances there is a hardship.  There are only a few of them &mdash;they would not be half a dozen. These are the only cases I have in mind that this might apply to.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, during the war strangely enough the average of rents was reduced.  The average reduction during the war was practically as great as the average reduction before the war.  There may be an odd case, but we cannot help that.  I do not suggest for one moment that there will not be odd cases where there will be some hardship, but the number will be extremely small.  If I pretended that I could introduce a Land Bill that would not do some little hardship in some cases I would be pretending to do what I was not able to do.  The advantage of this procedure is its expedition, and I cannot depart from it at this stage.  The whole scheme of the Bill rests on it.</P>

The particular distribution of them might be different, but the moneys will be required.  As regards No. II.  `To the Public Trustee for the account of Trinity College, Dublin,&rdquo; that is already dealt with.  And as regards No. III., that is an item which, as I explained already, is inserted as a provisional arrangement, pending the ultimate adjustment of the Excess Stock and Bonus account, and it is an agreement without prejudice to the ultimate settlement, a temporary agreement for the year.  I think the sum in question was £160,000 altogether.  A portion of it is <Col N="1131" /> taken out of another Vote, and this £134,000 is inserted in this Vote, making up the agreed sum of £160,000, which was undertaken at the last Financial Conference that we had in London, to be the contribution from the Saorstát towards the service of Excess and Bonus Stock, so that although the moneys in question may not be administered by these bodies which it is proposed to repeal under the Act, they would nevertheless be required by some other body which would discharge the functions that had been ordinarily discharged, or to deal with the Fund called the Ireland Development Fund.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I was not able to follow everything the Minister said on this Vote.  £50,000 for secret service is a decrease from £220,000 voted last year.  Explanations were given regarding the very large sum included under this head last year which were accepted by Deputies, but we were assured that it was certainly not a vote for espionage.  There is now the sum of £50,000, none of which is to be spent for the purpose for which the large sum was spent last year, but £50,000 is a very large sum to spend on espionage.  £50,000 is an extraordinary large sum to spend on secret service for a country of this size.  I assume that we have not sent spies to the Chancellories of Europe.  I assume that we have not sent spies to all parts of the world, and I cannot think, in the absence of that overseas espionage, what £50,000 is required for.  It may be true that the practice in other countries has been to vote large sums for Secret Service, and to ask no questions.  I do not know how this sum per head of the population compares with Votes in other countries per head of their population, but I would have hoped that our position would not require a sum of £50,000 to be spent on Secret Service, which I assume, in the absence of contrary information, is for espionage.  Three and one quarter million of people, no army for overseas service, no necessity to find <Col N="1133" /> cut what other countries are doing with their armies, and their navies, and their fortifications, and yet an expenditure of £50,000 on spies.  I say it is altogether too much, and I move that this Estimate be deferred back for further consideration and reduction, and some detailed information to be given to the Dáil.  I am not going so far as to say that the State may not spend any sum on Secret Service, but I dissent entirely from the suggestion that any sum of this kind of £50,000 should be so spent.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct any misapprehensions that might possibly be in the minds of the Deputies by reason of the statement that has been made by Deputy Johnson. On the last day, three or four weeks ago, when this Vote was on, I undertook to give Deputies who would apply to me any information that they thought it was their duty to get in connection with this Vote.  To any Deputy who so applied, I gave the information, and it is scarcely fair to a Government to have the statement that has been made by Deputy Johnson made and not met or answered, having regard to the fact that I agreed to give all reasonable information to settle any reasonable doubts or scruples Deputies might have with regard to this Vote.  There are no agents of the Government in the Chancellories of Europe or elsewhere, to find out what prospects our Army might have in the event of a war taking place with any of these countries.  We are not interested in such matters.  We have no schemes of conquest in our minds, and neither have we any fears in our minds that in these Chancellories there are any sinister methods behind the Governments.  We are only concerned with the stability of the State here.  As far as I have been able to discover from the figures, there is a relatively small sum which by any stretch of the imagination or any elaborate exaggeration that might be made by any person would not have the colour or tinge, or could not have the term &ldquo;spy&rdquo; applied to it.  As far as I have been able to see from the lists supplied to me, the sum of about £140 is not explained with the same degree of detail as the other items.  I have undertaken to give the information to any Deputy, and even though a great number of Deputies have not applied for that information at any time, never would I <Col N="1134" /> rebuke them, or refuse to give them reasonable information on a reasonable enquiry on a vote of this character.  But I do say, if there be a privilege at all attached to the Executive Council, there is a privilege with regard to an item of this character.  The amount, having regard to the circumstances of the case, is a relatively small sum of money, not a very large sum, but the largest sum spent to date, from the information, before me, is £6,050.  It is a matter, which if I informed Deputies as to the reason of its disbursement, or the service it is applied to, they would shrug their shoulders and say it is really not Secret Service at all.  I am still prepared to give that information, but I think it is due to the Executive Council and to the public that we should not lie under the inference that might be drawn by Deputy Johnson's speech that we are using this money to reward spies.  That is not the case.</P>

      <P>I think the President is really attempting to misinterpret Deputy Johnson on the matter. The President said the Executive Council was only following the example of other countries in not giving much public information on a vote of this kind.  That may be perfectly true, but it is well known that the main reason why that information is not given in other countries is because no Government desires, if it can possibly help, other Governments to know what exact measures of spying it is taking against these other Governments. Deputy Johnson has said he assumed that it was for no such purpose that this vote or the greater of it was designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Vote is for internal purposes&mdash;for internal espionage. Now, while it may be satisfactory to Deputies to get full details if they ask for them privately, it is not, I think, in the public interest that the public should be kept in the dark as to the main lines on which this money has been or is to be spent.  It is in the public interest to know whether it is a political service or a military service.  We all know the Army has got its intelligence service; we do not know whether or not that service is covered by this Vote.  We know that other arms of the State, such as the police, for instance, have got their intelligence service and their secret service: we do not know if it is for them this <Col N="1135" /> money is being provided.  Then there is the ordinary police anti-criminal secret service.  There is one thing that the people of this country have to get an assurance of, and the putting down of a Vote like this, without giving any public explanation, makes them think that there is being carried on in this country what was carried on under another regime&mdash;a purely political secret service, not altogether against criminals or people who attempt to further their ends by violent and illegal methods but that there are possibilities of quite a different order of political secret service altogether; and while an Executive Council has certain rights and privileges, it is not proper that the country should not be taken into confidence on some of these things, even if there were only a broad general outline of the particular activity given, without revealing anything that would weaken the position of the State. I think that ought to be given publicly. In other words, the directions in which it is intended that this money should be spent ought to be indicated.  It is much better in every sense that people should know exactly where they are and what they are responsible for.  After all, when a Deputy gets information of a private nature, it is more or less confidential, and we here in the Dáil should not consider that we are simply the rulers and the governors.  When we come in here, anything we know or do is a matter for our own responsibility.  There is a responsibility for us outside, and it is only fair and just that that responsibility should be shouldered.  It is only fair and just that the people who will have to shoulder it should know exactly what it is.  I urge that the Dáil should ask for more consideration in this respect, because we are not here merely as a body of individuals who come and hear certain things and get certain information for our own private satisfaction; we come here to do business and get information for the public satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that there is not any of this money used for political purposes, as intimated by the Deputy, I have no misgivings regarding the matters which have been mentioned by Deputy O'Shannon.  I quite understand it is open to severe criticism, by people who have peculiar mentality, to allege all sorts of things <Col N="1136" /> against the Government.  Whatever Government is in power it will have to have a service such as this.  I do not know, and I have not been able to find out, that any Government has given, or offered to give, as much information as I have offered to give in regard to this matter. I do it all in good faith, believing in the confidence of the members of the Dáil and believing that they are entitled to this information.  It is quite possible that another man in the same position, or another Executive Council, might not be so willing.  There are; as Deputies know occasions when certain expenditure has got to be made which it is not desirable in the public interest that people should know.  Whoever has the responsibility of Government at a particular time may be placed in exactly that position.  It may be while one would ask for a sum far in excess of what is required, none of it might be spent, or a very small portion of it might be spent, in one year. For instance a sum of £220,000 was voted last year, and not £130,000 in that respect was spent.  When this particular service was entered in our list, the largest portion of it was not even in contemplation.  It was found that a certain service was required and there was no other means of discharging the cost of that service except through this Vote.  Having regard to that fact, and the fact that there is nothing to hide but there is a certain position which had to be conserved and which is not conserved in the interests of the present Executive Council, I do not see my way to publish broadcast the details of this particular Estimate.  I am prepared to give reasonable information to any reasonable inquiry, and if Deputies were to approach me on the subject and get the information that I am prepared to give, they would be satisfied too, I am sure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Government must have some fund at its disposal for purposes of this kind, a purpose to which, I have no doubt, this money is devoted.  So long as we keep the amount within reasonable bounds, in my opinion the Government ought to get what they ask for subject, in our judgment, to whether or not the amount asked for is an amount they could possibly require for the purpose within the 12 months.  It would frustrate all the objects of such a fund as this if, in the middle of the year, the Government <Col N="1137" /> were to come to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;we want such and such a sum for Secret Service.&rdquo;  It would at once appear from the facts existing at the time what it was the sum would be used for, and then it would altogether cease to be secret.  It equally ceases to be secret if they have to disclose at the beginning of the year the kind of purpose for which they intend to use it, and once one concedes that there must be some money available for Secret Service purposes, then I think the only question we can ask ourselves is whether the amount put down is so grossly exorbitant that it ought to be refused.  When I recollect the fact that only a year ago we voted £220,000 for this purpose, it seems to me to demonstrate a very reasonable exercise of economy on the part of the Executive that they have reduced it to about one-quarter of that amount this year.  Although a good deal of this year has gone already, they have only expended five or six thousand pounds for this purpose.  Whatever surplus is left over after the expenditure of this year goes into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is not as if we were voting money which they could hoard for us in future years.  In this case whatever is not expended comes back to the Exchequer, and if they come for a new Vote next year they must tell us how much they spent last year.  If it should appear in this year, which I fancy would be a normal year, that instead of £50,000, only £25,000 will be spent then you could say that next year it could be cut down to £25,000 or £20,000.  If they come down such a big amount in one year, then the Dáil would say that they would be able to take a further slice off next year.</P>

He has been extremely fair to the Dáil in offering to give any Deputy who applies to him full details of how this money is spent.  I do not think we should ask or go further in the matter than that.  I do not think it would be right to ask him to publish the details of the money set apart for secret service when he is quite willing to let us know how that money is spent.  It may be that some of us would object to the amount as being unreasonable.  But at the same time we are able to form an opinion of that by going to the Minister <Col N="1138" /> and getting these figures from him.  I certainly intend to support the Minister in this Vote.</P>

      <P>It would be idle, I suppose, to paint the lily.  I am prepared to support this Vote, because I do believe that any Government would require some such fund as this.  I do not think it is excessive.  I am not rising to question the amount.  I think one is bound to deplore the necessity. But the necessity is generally admitted, and has been admitted by Deputy Johnson, and I think is resident in the fact. I am not rising, therefore, to question it. but merely to ask for information on one matter that I think the President would do well to mention.  I do hope he will take my assurance that I am raising the matter in no fractious spirit.  It is this: When an item like this, labelled under the general label &ldquo;Secret Service,&rdquo; with no sub-heading and no particulars, is passed by this Dáil, what exactly is the procedure adopted in the Accountancy and Audit Departments in order that it might be known by the Accountant and Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department whether the sum is being put into the pocket which the Dáil, trusting to the Executive Council's discretion in a matter of this kind&mdash; this Executive Council, or any Executive Council&mdash;desires it should be put?  It is a matter that does lie in the control of the public purse.  I am sure he will give us information on that matter.  It is really at the bottom of the whole thing, and would be a matter for elucidation in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment I have put forward is that this estimate be referred back for reconsideration with a view to reduction.  The amount would run to about £1,000 a week for a year. The Minister has said, I think, and Deputy FitzGibbon understood him, as I understood him, to say that only about £6,000 had been spent under this head up to date, and nearly four months of the year have passed.  Why, then, is £50,000 required?  Contingencies presumably? Possibly that the Secret Service money may be required?  I think it is too much.  I have admitted that it is possibly too much to expect that a modern State can do its work wholly with its heart, if it has a heart, on its sleeve; but I am not prepared to admit <Col N="1139" /> that a sum of £50,000 is required by this State for Secret Service.  I have not asked for all the details to be published. I have asked the Dáil to disagree with a sum of £50,000 being voted for this purpose. The Minister has said that he would give as much information as it was reasonably possible to give to the Deputies if they would make inquiries from him, and more than other Ministers may be willing to give.  That is not satisfactory either.  Deputies obtaining information of that kind are thereby precluded from raising the question of any matter which may be divulged; in their receipt of that information they become parties to the expenditure of the moneys, whether they approve of the purpose or not. There cannot be much discussion on a matter of this kind.  It is really a question of whether we are willing to vote such a sum whether it is considered large or small, is a matter of opinion, such a sum as £50,000, or £1,000 per week, for a Service of which we know nothing, and shall know nothing.  Even when the accounts are audited the figures or details will not be given to the Dáil, because it is a Secret Service.  It is a vote of a sum of which we know nothing, and shall know nothing, and I say that a sum of £50,000 is too much to vote away in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Figgis, the operations regarding the expenditure in reference to this money is that the matter is first brought before the Executive Council.  Arrangements are then made in the Department of whatever Minister is concerned.  The responsible Minister shall personally sign or transmit to the Minister for Finance a form showing the amount to be expended. The Minister for Finance signs it.  Then, after the check that takes place in the Department responsible for the expenditure there is no other check, nor will accounts be published regarding the expenditure of this money.  That is the usual normal course in other countries. Regarding what Deputy Johnson stated, the question arises as to whether the amount is excessive.  One cannot express an opinion about that without knowing in what particular circumstance the money is expended.  The next question that would arise is&mdash;is value received? <Col N="1140" /> Well, I am satisfied that there is, and I believe any Deputy to whom I would disclose the figures would be equally satisfied.  The third question is&mdash;is the money well and properly expended? This would lead, to some extent, to the question that has been raised by Deputy O'Shannon.  I am obliged to Deputy FitzGibbon and to Deputy Sir James Craig for their support of this vote, and also to Deputy Figgis.  The time might come at any period during the year, when it might be necessary to have a sum of money available for the purposes of a national character.  I have stated more than once here as well as elsewhere, that it was my hope that this Dáil either now existing, or in the future to be elected, would be a Dáil composed of people who would accept a certain share of national responsibility with regard to the matter. I am not at all sure that other people would agree with giving the information that I am willing to give Deputies who would put a question privately to me with regard to these services.</P>
      <P>I know that there is political insight, and sometimes a political scruple, in this country, which is not so well evidenced in other countries, and so many people in this country know so many people, that suspicion is sometimes well grounded. In that case, I think, there is a certain candour advisable in dealing with public affairs.  That candour entails responsibility. The Dáil must accept that as the Executive Council accepts its responsibilities. I think it is in the interest of the public that that candour should be accepted.  If members do not agree with that, it is open to them to wash their hands of the responsibility of providing the Executive Council with a considerable sum of money.  None of the money has been wasted, and it has not been used in the sense that people associate secret service in their minds.  It has not been used in the sense in which secret service was associated in the old days in the Castle.  It is money spent with one purpose only in view, and that is the best interest, the best good, and the safety of the citizens of the State.  To that extent, I believe, it is our duty to insert a pretty considerable sum of money in the Estimates. It would not be sufficient if it was used in the sense of the criticism made by Deputy O'Shannon.</P>

In the drawing up of this Estimate was provision made for the extra expense that would almost inevitably follow upon the passing of the Land Bill and does that account for the increase of the £42,000.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gerald FitzGibbon took the Chair at this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the £20,000 was an arbitrary sum, simply an estimate last year of our conception of what this particular service would cost us.  Last year up to the 1st April the expenses on administration of this service was borne by the British Government and the department was not handed over to us until the 1st April so that the sum of £200,000 is really a shot rather than an Estimate.  The Estimate was not graded, I forget whether that is the exact term, but it meant a distribution as between the North and South of Ireland of the whole service of the Land Commission which had to be undertaken. That occupied a considerable time. Deputies will remember that at the time of the passing of the Constitution considerable difficulty arose about any Civil Servants engaged here upon Government work as to whether they automatically came over to us on the 6th December, and there was something very little short of a puzzle at that time to arrange how we should work the Land Commission while we had got over the other services, we had not got the Land Commission and the reason was that the &ldquo;scheming&rdquo; of the staffs as it was called had not been undertaken and consequently we did not know what we were in for.  Now that operation took place in the meantime and the only difference between the estimate of last year and this was that last year the sum was put down at £200,000.  I see under the sub-head &ldquo;Land Settlement Department&rdquo; that &ldquo;salaries,&rdquo; etc., and <Col N="1145" />&ldquo;travelling,&rdquo; etc. &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; are down under J and K.  I do not know that any extra expenses in connection with the Land Bill were in contemplation when this estimate was being prepared.  I rather think not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to the question of this £5,000 under J. &ldquo;salaries etc.&rdquo;, and £1,800 &ldquo;travelling &amp;c.&rdquo; no details are given as I already pointed out. I think that the Dáil would be interested to know what exactly is the position in regard to this Land Settlement Department. Is it a continuation of the old Dáil Settlement Scheme, because most of us were under the impression that that had been suspended, or is it a preparation for a new scheme of land settlement and the latter is in contemplation on the passing of the Land Bill?  I think that perhaps with the exception of Deputy Wilson and his colleagues and perhaps the colleagues sitting behind Ministers we are not very familiar with the work of the Land Settlement Department, that is since the change.  We all knew something of it in the times when they were trying to settle the land troubles in the old Dáil but we are not familiar with the work of the present Land Settlement Department and I think the Dáil will be interested and has some reason for asking a question, as to how this money is being expended and what is the work being done which necessitates this £1,800 in travelling expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Agriculture is rather tired, after dealing with the Land Bill, and I can only give what is my own idea on the subject.  As far as I am aware, speaking from memory, something like £300,000 worth of sales took place under the old Dáil.  Now I am very much afraid that they were not altogether a success.  The Department officials worked very hard, but one can understand that without good Government machinery behind them, and some resource the type of settlement which they endeavoured to effect, lacked a good deal of solidity.  In other words they sometimes bought an estate and bought it at a pretty considerable price and disposed of it to a number of persons who put down certain sums of money.  In effect it was not Land Commission work, as we know it, but an endeavour to either get land for landless <Col N="1146" /> people or to get additional strips of land for congests.  I am sure that there are a number of officials engaged on this work.  They had service with the old Dáil but, as far as I know, they have not yet been apportioned into the service.  We are drawing in the old Dáil officials into the service and that is the only reason I know of that there should be put down &ldquo;travelling expenses.&rdquo;  I may mention an estate where a distribution of land took place.  It occurred in a neighbouring constituency to my own. There were several reasons why the land should be taken; it was an historic farm and there was a popular movement in favour of getting it and I think that generally speaking the real defect in connection with any work done under the old Dáil was due to the fact that land was at a very high price during the years of the operation of the Land Settlement Courts, and that what was an economical proposition some years ago as far as land is concerned is no longer economic now.</P>

Fuller details have been put into my hands since then, and perhaps it is just as well that I have not them here at the moment.  But there is this question which could not be dealt with in the Bill itself.  It was left over from the Land Commission Bill for an Executive decision.  It was suggested at the time that a suitable place to raise this question of the status of these officials would be on this Vote.  I would be glad if the Minister would state exactly what is being done in this matter.  It will be remembered by him that the case put forward was that the Congested Districts Board's officials, according to their length of service, should be treated as though they had been, what in effect they were, though in fact they were not, Civil Servants, and should be transferred into an equal grade in the Civil Service when taken over into the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I did not know that this question was going to be raised, but I do know that the matter has received the consideration of the Ministry of Finance.  From recollection, I would say that my information on the subject was that these officials had not passed the Civil Service examination, and that in seeking to get the advantages of Civil <Col N="1149" /> Servants they were asking for something which was not in contemplation at the time they entered the Service.  An effort is being made to get them into the Land Commission, but I have no information as to the details or as to how the work is getting on.  All I can say is that no general direction has been given or accepted by the Ministry of Finance that they are entitled to be regarded as Civil Servants in the way in which ordinary Civil Servants enter the Service.</P>

I know that the sum voted last year may or may not have been spent, but if it was not spent it was not liable to surrender.  I would like to know whether, in fact, it was spent, and further to hear from the Minister for Fisheries some information regarding the intentions of that Ministry concerning the fisheries in these congested districts.  I would like to know if the Minister has any information to communicate to the Dáil regarding the fisheries in the congested districts.  I understand that since April the expenditure of the money, or such part of it as may be affected by the fisheries, has been expended by him, and as there are special problems relating to the fisheries in these congested areas, quite apart from the general problem, the Minister may have something to say in respect to his work and intentions in regard to these special problems.  When we were dealing with the Vote for the Ministry of Fisheries the Minister made a general statement regarding the work of his Department, but not with special relation to the congested districts.  Perhaps this Vote will give him an opportunity to say something on these matters.</P>

The answer that was put forward by the Ministry at the time that that argument was made was, that this would mean a certain demand on the Exchequer which this country was little prepared to pay at the moment.  To that a reply was made by those of us who put forward the case on behalf of those employees that there had been certain accumulations and that these accumulations existing could be used for that purpose, justly and rightly used, without making any call upon the Exchequer.  If I might use the expression, the claim of these employees in respect of pledges which they had received was, that these accumulations should in the first instance be garnisheed by them before the balance passed over to the Central Fund.  That <Col N="1151" /> was the argument put forward at the time and we were asked to raise that argument again on the estimates for the Congested Districts Board.</P>

I was requested on behalf of those clerks later to propose a still further modification. I submitted it to the Minister and we discussed it, and he satisfied me that it was impossible to introduce it into the Bill for the purpose which we had in view.  I think that is the answer to Deputy Figgis's enquiry at the present moment.  The undertaking that was given was that these men would be brought over into the Land Commission service and that in due course the Civil Service certificate would be issued to those of them who were qualified for it, and in that way they would be put upon the permanent staff as Civil Servants.  I personally was satisfied with the undertaking that I received on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The sum voted last year on this account was £10,000.  We do not know whether it was all spent; I think we were told it was not.  The sum asked for this year is £11,423.  We are obliged to provide a suitable establishment, <Col N="1152" /> and I take it the Dáil is finally responsible for the definition of what is suitable.  I do not think an expenditure of £11,000 should be asked for to provide for the Governor General's establishment: £5,545 for the salaries and wages of the staff; and £3,000 for an allowance for expenses to the Governor General.  That is in addition to the salary provided for in the Constitution, which equals £10,000 for the year.  We are asked again to pay the balance of the cost of purchasing and equipping two armoured cars, and the balance of the cost of purchasing and equipping a motor car for A.D.C's., a total of £1,873, and £940 for telegrams and telephones for the year.  The total is £11,423.  I think that is entirely beyond what the country can afford.  It is an expenditure for this year of £21,423 for the Governor General's salary and for his establishment.  There is no rent to be paid, I think, for a house.  There is not a charge in this Vote, I think, for coal, fire or light.  That has already been provided for in another Vote.  We have already voted £5,000 for certain proposed works in respect of the residence of the Governor General and the late Chief Secretary's Lodge.  I do not know what is required for the Governor General's residence, but I think I will not be far wrong in suggesting that the greater part of it is required for such works.  A sum of £8,850 is also provided for maintenance and supplies to the Governor General's residence; £992 for furniture, fittings and utensils; £1,600 for fuel, light, water, and cleaning.  A total of £11,442 for maintenance, repairs and other current charges.  Proposed new works, £5,000; salary, £10,000; and establishment, £11,423.  That is rather a costly luxury. I submit that there is no need for ten persons at a cost of £5,545 to be attached to this establishment, in addition to an allowance of £3,000 for expenses.  The Comptroller of the household has £600; a chaplain, £250; medical attendant, £100; private secretary, £600; assistant private secretary, £350, in addition to clerks, and three A.D.C's. at £1,100, £1,000, and £700 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think these charges are justified. Does any Deputy in the Dáil think they are justified?  The old idea was that there were all kinds of duties devolving upon a Viceroy, social duties, and Official duties, that would appertain to a King, and that these duties inevitably called for very <Col N="1153" /> considerable assistance, clerical, secretarial and the like.  We have been led to believe that we were getting away from that, and that the Governor General's position would be strictly official; that there would be no court, and that the social functions would be such as would appertain to an official who was filling the necessary niche in the administration, but would not, by virtue of that fact, have any special equipage or train.  We are having an expenditure thrust upon us which would only be excusable if there were such functions attaching to the office.  Can anybody explain why it is necessary to have ten officials, at the cost I have indicated, attached to the establishment of the Governor General, and three A.D.C's. at £1,100, £1,000 and £700 respectively? I am quite certain that some work could be found, useful, perhaps necessary work, for some officials attached to the Governor General, but I cannot see that there is room for a Comptroller of the Household at £600, plus a Private Secretary and an Assistant Private Secretary, costing between them £950, with a clerk to that Comptroller, plus Typist and Extra Clerical Assistants, and then three A.D.C's.  It is quite commendable that certain public works should be established of a useful character to find employment for unemployed citizens, but it is not usual to appoint men or women at such charges for comparatively useless work, at such a high cost for unemployed people.  The question of the salaries is closed; the question of expenses in connection with repairs and maintenance is temporarily closed, but the Dáil has, unfortunately, in my view, quite wrongly voted for the payment of these sums for the maintenance of the Governor General's Establishment and for its re-lighting; but I hope the Dáil will not vote this sum of £11,423 for his establishment, in addition to all the rest.  To test the Dáil, I beg to move that this Estimate be reduced by the sum of £6,423.</P>

In respect of the other charges, they are the normal charges paid in Canada or Australia.  They may be heavy, but they <Col N="1154" /> are part of our agreement, and I am subscribing to them.

They want to know why this is so, why they have to pay in their taxes for the upkeep of this bloated establishment which, as the President said, is on a par with the institutions in Canada and in Australia, which are two continents, while our country is only twenty-six counties and a poor country.  Of course, we all agree that the Ministry were bound by the provisions of the Treaty to provide £10,000 for the Governor General and to maintain his house.  We all understand that.  But, at the same time, it seems to me that there has been excessive extravagance here, and I could not, when questioned on it in the West of Ireland, give any explanation that would enable the poor people, working on the land at 30s. a week, to understand the necessity for this expenditure.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Johnson and Wilson that the provision is extravagant.  Altogether, in all the Votes for this year, it comes to £40,000, or about £2,000 short of £40,000. It is too much.  We have entered by an earlier decision into an agreement to pay a certain amount.  Whatever the opinion of some of us on that amount may be, that job is closed, but it is not, I think, a good analogy to say that because the British Dominions have Establishments something similar to this, for their Governors General, we should have the same in Ireland.  Deputies should remember that out there the people have still got the Monarchical tradition.  They have a conception of dignity, and of history connected with the representative <Col N="1155" /> of the Crown that we in Ireland have not, and that the people of Ireland, so far as we know them, do not desire.  Even so, there are many in those countries who are inclined rather to cut down the expenses of a thing like this.  We who have an opportunity of going about the thing in a right democratic manner are, if we pass this Vote, as it is put before us, throwing away that opportunity&mdash;wasting the opportunity.  I have little hesitation in saying that if we go on in the spirit in which we have been going on, we shall soon find Levees, and Drawingrooms, and all the paraphernalia of a little court.  It is not good enough for Ireland.  We ought to cut it out.  The President said that he is quite satisfied that the three A.D.C.'s have done their work.  I have no doubt about that.  So far as I know about them, they are quite capable of doing it, and doing it well, but the President has not told us&mdash;he has not told the country&mdash;what that work is and why it should take three of them for it.  I suspect that, to some extent, it is not the exact kind of work that is done by A.D.C.'s to the Governor General of Australia, or South Africa, or Canada; that it is rather in the nature of temporary work due to certain recent circumstances.  If that is so, then it should be provided for otherwise, quite otherwise.  I referred to that before.  I do not want to labour the points that have been raised.  A case has been made against this huge Establishment, and the case has not been answered. I want to raise rather another aspect, and that is that, as we all understood, and as is perfectly clearly understood in the British Dominions, the office of Governor General is a non-political office.</P>

      <P>It seems to me from recent readings of the newspapers that there may be a tendency to depart from that particular non-political line.  I do not for a moment suggest that, so far, in any of the gentleman's public speeches he has been acting as the mouthpiece of the Executive Council, but I do form at least a personal impression that in one of those speeches he was speaking in a more or less political capacity.  I am not, at the moment, agreeing or disagreeing with the particular sentiments he expressed, but I suggest that it would <Col N="1156" /> be well if from no other quarter, then from this particular quarter, that he should be reminded that even though he were expressing an overwhelming majority opinion that he should not express that opinion if it touches upon the sphere of what is purely politics.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson, it seems to me, has perturbed himself unduly with regard to the answer he is to give these poor downtrodden and oppressed people of the country who will ask him to account for this Vote.  There are questions which do not admit of being answered in view of the mentality of those who put the questions.  An old lady looking up from her newspaper asked her husband &ldquo;What is the Vatican?&rdquo; and he replied &ldquo;Oh, the Vatican is a place where the Pope lives,&rdquo; and she retorted with a certain amount of heat &ldquo;But why the Pope?&rdquo;  Now that is a type of question which defies answer. Would Deputy Wilson, when given this conundrum to solve, not feel that he would have a sufficient appearance of reply in the fact of the Treaty?  Again and again it has been laboured in the Dáil that one of the terms upon which the Free State was secured was that we entered into a Treaty by which we took our place among the circle of free Nations, called the British Commonwealth of Nations.  One of the terms of the bargain was that we were to have a Governor General, representative symbolically of the Dominion Union, and we were to pay, it was stipulated, the salary that is paid for one of those Governors General. Now, none of us like that.  With regard to this matter I always feel like the character in the &ldquo;Yeomen of the Guard&rdquo; who explained to the heroine &ldquo;I did not take to assistant head jailing because I liked assistant head jailing.&rdquo;  We did not set up a Governor General because we were in love with the idea, or with the institution, but because it was part of the bargain.  An argument has been used here which seems to me difficult to follow without a certain amount of mental gymnastics.  We are only 26 counties. What does it matter if we were only six?  It is not the extent of our geographical area that is in question.  It is our status.  It is a question of quality and not of quantity.  The Governor General at any rate, is the outward and visible sign of the status which we have in the Commonwealth of Nations.  On <Col N="1157" /> a previous occasion I argued as steadfastly as I was capable of arguing that the cost of the maintenance of this Establishment should be borne by a Dominion Vote. I take this opportunity of recanting that opinion.  It is only right to be absolutely frank in these matters.  When I contended that the Office was created not by our choice, but was forced upon us, I held as a corollary to that contention that the cost should be borne as an Imperial charge.  This is a matter on which I hold second thoughts are best, because on reflection it occurred to me that if it were an Imperial charge that would constitute a further and unnecessary Imperial link, and that if we do accept, as we must accept, the Office, it is better, at any rate, that we should pay for it by our own Vote.  I am quite satisfied that that is the more dignified position to take up, so that the only remaining question then is the question of amount. I remember that a celebrated leader of the early Radical Party in the British House of Commons, Mr. Labouchere, defended the Vote as a Radical in the British House of Commons on the ground that so long as there was a Royal Family to support it was only proper to support in a way consonant with the dignity of the position and the standing of the country of which they were the official head.  It seems to me that that was a reasonable view to take, so I am not prepared to share the heroics of Deputy Wilson in believing this is something which is a wrong and an outrage on the poor.  No doubt that money would run a very substantial housing movement. It would provide funds for a University extension; it would provide funds for a great many things.  So too would the expenses on the Dáil, and the allowances for Deputies.  We could argue away everything if we choose to concentrate just upon one aspect at the time.</P>
      <P>Everything must be viewed in its relations.  If we take things out of their relations we are dealing with abstractions. It seems to me that so long as Ireland is a Dominion, and pending arrangements for the housing and what is called the paraphernalia of the Government and State, it is better for us to endure the situation with fortitude.</P>

      <P>It is always very interesting to hear a recantation, especially when it is put with the characteristic alluring grace of Deputy Magennis, but it is not to pay that compliment that I rise.  Perhaps on another occasion we shall have an opportunity of paying an even greater compliment to him.  I rise to invite the President to be good enough to say whether the Governor-General, when speaking recently on certain political subjects, was expressing the mind of the Executive Council.  I am a bit troubled about that and I would like if the President would be good enough to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Where does this tradition come from of the Governor-General being non-political being dumb dogs, to use a Biblical expression?  The accusation is made that the British tradition is being followed, and in the next breath an accusation follows that the British tradition is not being observed. After all, may we not make our own traditions? Quite recently a distinguished fellow-countryman has been going back upon all the traditions of his office.  Lord Carson is a Judicial Officer and he has taken a very active part in politics.  This is a period of revolution.  Everything is undergoing the <i>boule versement.</i>  Why not the Governor-General give a lead in new departures?</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis, defending in the way he did this Vote. <Col N="1159" /> is entertaining and interesting.  He has done what the other supporters of the Government are not willing to do, and he has done it in a way which would almost make one believe he himself was supporting this Vote when, as a matter of fact, every word he has uttered rather supports the contention that the sum should not be voted.  When Deputy Magennis quoted Mr. Labouchere, I was reminded of other supporters of the Vote who defended themselves, though radical, in voting for sums for the upkeep of the British Monarchy, by saying &ldquo;The more we allow them to spend, the sooner will it be brought into disrepute.&rdquo;  Is that the view of Deputy Magennis?  Does he desire to bring this office into disrepute by supporting a Vote amounting <i>in toto</i> to £37,865 for the establishment and upkeep of the residence of the Governor-General and his salary?  To deputies who want to reduce the status, to prevent the possibility of this officer of the State attaining a social influence and power at an expense that is undesirable&mdash;a social influence and power which is antagonistic to the popular sentiment at the present time&mdash; it is tempting that we should encourage a very heavy expenditure on that establishment so that the people will more readily and more swiftly come to the conclusion that the office ought to be abolished <i>in toto.</i>  The risk, I think, is too great.  I would prefer to cut down expenditure and save something this year, and by cutting down expenditure, limit the possibilities of increase in unjustifiable, or shall I say artificial, social influence and political authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Magennis forgets that this officer was accepted by the Dáil and I think he himself pointed out that he was to be an officer of the State who would not have freedom to declare public policy, to make political utterances, and to do all the things which a free ruler a powerful independent ruler might do, but in political or State affairs to utter only the voice of the Executive Council.  He was in fact to be a formal spokesman in high State affairs of the will and wish of the Executive Council.  Deputy Magennis recants again, he wants that high official to be a free citizen, while holding that high office to be capable of making party speeches.  That is the freedom that the citizen who does not clain such authority as the Constitution gives to the Governor-General <Col N="1160" /> might well have and should have.  But when any citizen has accepted this office, or any person has been appointed to this office, with distinct limitations both Constitutional and implied, limitations in his freedom, then he ought not to break through these restrictions.  If this officer of the State is to be free to take part in political discussions, and make political pronouncements which are his own and not the pronouncements of the Executive Council, then you have brought the office into a position where every utterance will have to be publicily discussed, and somebody will have to be made responsible for that.  So far we have understood that the Executive Council would be responsible for the utterances of the Governor-General. Deputy Professor Magennis asks that he should be free to make utterances on political matters on his own accord, and which may not be the views of the Executive Council.  That immediately alters the whole Constitutional position of that officer.  Deputy Magennis defending the office, and claiming certain liberty for that officer, contended by implication, though he did not say it, that it was reasonable to vote £11,423 for his Establishment in addition to his house, salary, maintenance, etc.  No attempt has been made to justify that Vote except by the President in saying that in respect of £2,800, he accepted personal responsibility for the advice he gave that these three officers should be appointed.  We are still awaiting the answer to Deputy O'Shannon's question as to what the duties are. But apart from those three officers, costing £2,800, there are other offices which are redundant and unnecessary, and there is an allowance of £3,000 for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment in addition to the £11,442 already voted in another Vote.  It is really delightful to go through these various Votes, and to find out how officials' salaries may be made up.  You get a cheque for so much on the first of the month.  Then you get a supplementary cheque for another purpose on the fifth of the month, and a further cheque for another purpose on the thirteenth of the month, and they are all utilised in one or other of the purposes which appertain to the occupation of the person receiving this salary.  But they are put down in different groups so that nobody will know at first sight what actually is being paid for these se vices. A little examination shows that for this <Col N="1161" /> year the Dáil is asked to spend £37,865 for the Governor-General's salary and upkeep. I submit that that is entirely too much and that the sum that has already been voted on account £5,000 ought not to be exceeded.  That is the effect of the amendment which I have moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson on the grounds not that I consider the salary out of place.  Provision is made for that in the Constitution, and moreover some of the salary will come back I presume in taxation to the revenue.  But I hold that under the circumstances, establishment charges are extravagant. We have been told by the Minister for Finance over and over again, and by many other Ministers when any application was made for money for other purposes, that it is only by the strictest economy that the nation can get on its feet.  I do not think, in the establishment charges for the Governor-General, that strict economy is practised, not that strict economy that we have heard so much about from the Government.</P>

      <P>This is not the time to raise it.  If the Deputy has a question in that connection he should put it on the Order Paper and I will answer it. With regard to the items making up this account, Deputies are probably aware of the fact that this residence, in which the Governor General is housed, was once offered to Henry Grattan as a present by the British Government.  He very properly refused it.  It is a very expensive establishment.  It has always cost a considerable amount of money to keep up and no economy practised by any person in residence there would limit the heavy expense of that establishment.  If no Governor General were living there the cost would still be the same so far as upkeep is concerned, if you meant to keep it in order.  The upkeep of the Chief Secretary's Lodge is considerable but it is not nearly as much as this.  The other items here are items which form the Establishment.  That is part of your bargain.  It is part of the bargain anybody else in our position would have to put up if they meant to carry out the bargain made.  The Establishment cannot be maintained on the sum which Deputy Johnson's amendment would leave available for the purpose and it would not carry out the bargain.</P>

      <P>The sum asked for now for the salaries and the expenses of the Governor General's establishment is £6,423.  £5,000 has been voted on account.  An amendment has been offered to reduce the sum by £6,423. That amounts to a direct negative, because the sum asked for here is not the full sum asked for, namely £11,423, as stated in the book.  It is just £6,423.  I will, therefore, put the Motion, and those in favour of the amendment can vote against the Motion.</P>
