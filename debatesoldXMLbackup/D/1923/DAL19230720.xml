      <P>The rule-making authority of the County Court Judges is at present engaged in drafting rules of Court under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.  It will not be possible to give the information asked for in the question until these rules are ready, which it is hoped will be next week.  The Deputy is aware of the fact that a large number of small claims has been dealt with in Dublin.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that owners of property destroyed in O'Connell Street, who have erected temporary premises, have been assessed by Commissioners of Valuation 33 per cent. higher than their old premises; and to ask if he will take steps to remedy this injustice.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he would take steps to withdraw this 33 per cent. increased valuation on a wooden hut erected in O'Connell <Col N="1166" /> Street, and not put the person assessed into the position of having to go to Court?  I think the Minister will agree that it is rather an unjust valuation to put on a wooden hut.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether it is intended that the owner of this wooden hut will be put to the inconvenience and expense of going to Court to get the valuation reconsidered, or whether he will take that responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question offhand, because I did not see the question on the Order Paper until now.  This matter has been under consideration in my office for some time; not this particular item dealing with O'Connell Street, but the general question of re-valuation where premises have been destroyed, either through the operations in the Anglo-Irish war or the operations which have taken place since the Truce.  I have made arrangements to see the Commissioner of Valuation to consider how best the matter can be dealt with.  I can give no undertaking, but I do say there is present in the minds of all the parties considering this question the importance of dealing with this in an equitable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the old Reconstruction Act there is a provision in operation which prevents the valuation being increased to anything further than what it was in the days before the premises were destroyed?  I would like to know whether the Minister's Department will consider the advisability of giving the same treatment to the residents in Upper O'Connell Street as were given by the British Government to residents in Lower O'Connell Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is much more complicated than the Deputy appears to realise.  First of all, if one were to undertake the arrangement that was come to after the destruction of premises in O'Connell Street in 1916, one would have to bear in mind the fact that Dublin had been recently revalued, and that a revaluation or a re-assessment of new premises bore scarcely the same relation to a newly-valued city as, say, the <Col N="1167" /> re-assessment of valuation in Cork, which would be a re-assessment on a modern basis compared with an old valuation which was in operation for some fifty, sixty, or seventy years.  If one were to take the headline that was taken in the case of 1916 in the destroyed area, the people affected in the City of Cork might reasonably object to that, and I know there was a clause passed in an Act in 1916 dealing with revaluation, and pointing out that the old valuation should prevail for twelve years.  I know that.  It is on that account, and on account of the obvious injustice to people, that we are considering the matter.  It is scarcely fair to ask us if we have considered every phase of a matter of that sort when the matter is still under consideration. We are considering it and taking into account all the elements of the case, and there are more elements in the case than the Deputy has mentioned.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to introduce the Superannuation and Pensions Bill to amend the law relating to superannuation, and to authorise the granting of pensions to certain classes.</P>
      <P>The purposes are to make provision for Civil Servants employed in the old Dáil Department, to provide for victimised public servants, to provide pensions for wounds or deaths in respect of members of the C.I.D., the Citizens' Defence Force, and the Protective Force; to provide for a revision of the pensions to certain pensionable National School teachers; to enable arrangements to be made with the British Government regarding the operation of the Superannuation Acts as respects transferred officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask leave to introduce the Civil Service Regulation Bill to regulate the appointment of persons into the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann and to establish a Civil Service Commission to control appointments.  The Dáil will recollect that on the 8th June I explained the proposals of the Government in regard to the creation of a Civil Service Commission, and undertook at that time to introduce a Bill to put the Commission on a statutory basis.  I do not think it necessary now to say more than that the Bill sets up a body of Commissioners to control appointments into the public service, and that a certificate of fitness will be necessary before any person can be given a permanent appointment in the Service.  The Bill also gives the Commissioners power, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to regulate temporary employment in the public service, to regulate the method of selection in the case of certain professional and technical appointments which are of the character requiring selection rather than an educational examination.  The Bill lays down for appointments to the general body of clerkships, etc., in the public service the principle of open competitive examinations. I should say that in arriving at the proposals outlined in this Bill the Government has given very careful consideration to the system adopted in other countries.  We attach great importance to this Bill, for the Civil Service is the machine through which the government of the country is largely exercised, and in the interests of efficient and impartial administration it is essential that recruitment to the Service should be so regulated as to draw into the ranks only those whose efficiency and character fit them for the important work of State service. I accordingly move for leave to introduce the Bill.</P>

      <P>Since we discussed the Educational Vote a few months ago a very considerable amount of progress has been made by way of administration. The Dáil will recollect that when I did complain, as I did more than once, of the absence of any promise or shadow of a promise of the introduction of an Education Bill, the Minister replied that much could be done through administration.  I must confess that at the time I was somewhat sceptical as to the amount of progress we were likely to have through that mechanism. It is only fair to say, and it is a pleasure to me to make the confession, that what has since been published on behalf of the Ministry of Education indicates that not only has this great national subject not been neglected, but that it must have been given a more than usual amount of highly considered thought, and that a great step forward has been taken to provide the country with that type or system of secondary education which its needs demand.  I might, as a member of the late Intermediate Board, complain to some extent of the methods employed in getting this new machinery into motion. It is notorious with regard to motor cars that the engine requires to be run in.  It takes at least 500 miles of running to secure that desirable result.  The poet Byron, referring to his sudden blaze of glory arising out of the publication of &ldquo;Childe Harold,&rdquo; declared that he went <Col N="1171" /> to bed and rose up one morning to find himself famous.  The members of the Intermediate Board went to bed one evening less than a month ago Commissioners of Intermediate Education, and rose up in the morning to read in the newspapers that they were merely private citizens.  However, I make no complaint with regard to that.  The dissatisfaction with the method is swallowed up in the supreme satisfaction with the aim of what has been done.  There was, the Dáil will remember, a great deal of criticism published by way of complaints that the new development was about to sweep away examination.  But that is not so.  And even if it were so, the reform would not be altogether wrong. Now, I have always been an advocate of examination, and I say what I have just said without the slightest fear of any inconsistency being imputed to me. We have had quite too much of the external competitive examination in secondary education of late years.  That does not mean that external competitive examination in secondary education in Ireland was always bad.  The Boards of Education have long been butts for popular and consequently unconsidered criticism, and now that the Intermediate Board has passed away, and, like Sir John Moore in the poem about his burial, &ldquo;They carved not a line, they raised not a stone,&rdquo; I for one am willing to leave it alone in its glory.  It did great constructive work.  I have had my own quarrels with it until I became a Commissioner myself, but it must be said in justice that it did great constructive work.  Before the Intermediate Act came into operation there were many secondary schools characterised more by listlessness than by work, and very, very few indeed in which real education was attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of examination, with grants on results to teachers and huge arrays of exhibitions and prizes for the successful students, galvanised existing schools and brought into existence innumerable others which, though not of the highest efficiency, really attained to wonderful efficiency when we consider the conditions under which they had to exist. I have been an Intermediate pupil, an Intermediate teacher, an Intermediate examiner, and an Intermediate Commissioner, and I think therefore that in point of experience in regard to Intermediate <Col N="1172" /> Education in Ireland I might, without undue want of humility, claim to be able to say something about Irish Intermediate Education at first hand.  I have always been interested in secondary education; I have studied secondary education as it is carried on in other lands, and I have no hesitation in saying&mdash;and it is not a boast made in the spirit of national vanity, but a statement which will bear examination&mdash;that we have built up in this country a very admirable supply of intermediate schools, and that we have laid the foundation here for higher education, arising out of Intermediate School work, which is bound to be in succeeding years of the highest value. There was too much of the external examiner. It is proposed now to reduce that type of examination to a minimum. This is not a revolution which the Ministry are creating.  I read from what I call the swan song of the Intermediate Board passages of its last report, in which it is indicated that the substitution for the examination system of an Intermediate certificate and a leaving school certificate was the line upon which reformation ought to proceed, and that is the line upon which I understand the present Ministry of Education has already set out.  In pre-war Germany, which we were accustomed to look to as the great exemplar for educational policy and educational procedure, there was what was called a certificate of maturity.  Corresponding to that in the Scotch system was the leaving school certificate.  A great point of superiority which I would recommend to the Ministry on the side of the German maturity certificate was that the progress of the pupil was attested by his teachers under the supervision of inspectors who represented the Ministry of Education, and the nation was bearing the expense of subsidising secondary education.  The record of the student's progress of that type was the material factor in the granting of the certificate and in the fixing of the terms of its wording.  Armed with such a certificate, the student was at liberty to enter the Universities or the higher technological institutions, and it provided him with the necessary qualification for entrance to the learned professions.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt perhaps at too much length, you would say, for a Parliamentary discussion, upon educational policy, but I should like to inform the Dáil that quite recently there was a prolonged and <Col N="1173" /> a highly alert debate in the French Chamber of Deputies on this very question, and the Minister for Education, M. Léon Bérard, explained his reasons for adopting a certain policy.  That is a matter upon which I would like your indulgence, Sir, to dwell for a moment. Our secondary schools have, to a great extent, been under the influence of those views on education which were fixed, almost stereotyped, since the Renaissance, the idea that the great classical writers were the spiritual ancestors of modern Europe, and that no education could be regarded as a true education that was not based on a classical foundation. In these days of scientific progress, and when so much regard is bound to be paid to a type of instruction in the school which will fit the pupil for undertaking, immediately on leaving school, the responsibilities of life belonging to the type of life in which he finds himself in these days, the natural reaction takes place of insisting, perhaps unduly, on a higher value for scientific teaching.  It seems to me that in the teaching of classics a great deal of time was wasted on what is merely the apparatus of scholarship, and on the other hand on the teaching of science too little regard was had to the extension of mind, the training and cultivation of the imagination to the making of what we call a whole man, a many-sided man.  This debate in the French Chamber to which I have just referred concentrated largely on what was alleged to be the failure of the modern type of education, and the pendulum of French educated opinion is swinging back in favour of classical teaching as part of the general education of pupils up to fifteen or sixteen years of age.</P>
    <P>I would advocate strongly that so far as regards an Intermediate certificate the conditions should be a satisfactory attendance for a full number of years at a primary school, followed by at least three years in the secondary school, in which the education imparted would be of a general type&mdash;for example, two foreign languages, preferably English and French, or English and German, a fair amount of Mathematics, some Chemistry, and an introduction to a knowledge of Economics and of Civics.  That would not be an overloaded programme, and the overloading would be avoided by choosing systems which have hitherto contained a great many things which, however valuable they may have been in <Col N="1174" /> the 17th or 18th century, I would respectfully suggest are largely out of date. The aesthetic sense of the pupil can be awakened, and the first lines of training attempted on the basis of modern literature. There are people who will ask you to believe that all that has been of best thought and best study in the world belongs to ancient days, just as you are to believe that all the great paintings are old masters.  There is room for another opinion upon these questions, and I would advocate that an introduction to the thought and style of the aesthetic aspects of literature, and all the culture that comes from that side of training, could be at least equally provided by masterpieces of modern literature, particularly of French.  Unfortunately, while I am dilating upon the splendid prospects of secondary education under the new regime, I am conscious all the time of one blot on the fair picture, and that is the position of the teachers, especially of lay secondary teachers, through whom the great work is to be carried on, the practical side of education as distinct from this work of the educationalists.</P>
    <P>I have nere a document sent me on behalf of the lay secondary teachers.  It lays great stress upon what so many of us emphasised on a former occasion&mdash;the wretched status and the wretched pay of the secondary teacher.  The intermediate Board, amongst its other good deeds, saved the genuine Intermediate teacher from one great evil.  There was a time, not so long ago, indeed, when anyone on his way to a profession took up secondary teaching as a <i>modus vivendi</i> on the way.  He was an amateur, and never meant to be anything but an amateur, untrained, without his heart in the work, and he meant to abandon it as soon as he could.  There was introduced in 1918 a State system of registration of secondary teachers.  The conditions demanded there were of considerable severity. For a school to get the full grant it should be staffed with men in sufficient numbers who had a University degree, a diploma in education, and three years' experience of teaching.  These are exacting demands to make, and one might fairly well expect in equity that the teacher who satisfies these demands, and gives of his best services to the nation in the work of a secondary teacher, should have a higher rate of remuneration than the ordinary Metropolitan policeman. <Col N="1175" /> This is a subject on which I cannot speak with moderation, and I find it difficult to refrain from using the language of irritation. There is no part of the world except, I should say in the Western States of America, where it is more necessary to make education respectable than in our own country.  Our people through long tradition are pretty like the French.  I do not like to say too much on this matter, and very little would be too much, but I do think that they are impressed very considerably of the worth of a thing by what they see paid by way of respect or otherwise to those who are identified in their minds with that institution.  Now, secondary teachers are not able to impress the imagination of the populace by the social position which they occupy. They are in quite as bad a position as professors.  Professors are a despised class in this country, and I say that without fear of contradiction.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows there are two tests of the height of civilisation to which any country has progressed&mdash;the position of women in it and the respect that is paid to learning in it.  In one of the Western States of America a little while ago a man of Southern State extraction was invited to a levee, where he was to meet a very distinguished negro preacher, a Doctor of Divinity.  A Southern friend protested against his presence there, and inquired of him how he had addressed the distinguished ecclesiastic.  He said, &ldquo;I did not like to be offensive to him, and so I did not call him Sambo; and I did not like to sacrifice my principles with regard to niggers, so I compromised and called him Professor.&rdquo;  The secondary teachers' remuneration is of enormous importance to the future of education, because here, as elsewhere, you cannot expect any but enthusiasts to take up an arducus line of life, devote themselves to the work, and be satisfied with less emoluments than their capacities would entitle them to in some other occupation. Enthusiasts join religious Orders, and they teach for the honour and glory of God.  If you are determined to exclude the laity from educational work, then you cannot adopt a measure more calculated to be successful than to keep down the level of salaries of the teachers to its present level, £180 to £230 per annum.  That is the average rate. There is no security of tenure.  The secondary <Col N="1176" /> teacher goes on his summer holiday, and he has no assurance as to how long that holiday will last.  He may never go back to his school.  Security of tenure, assurance of employment; look at what that accounts for with the working man.  Everyone interested in sociological problems is aware that there is nothing more destructive of efficiency than unemployment.  Next to unemployment in that regard is the dread of it. There are no pensions for these men.  It is not the Minister that is to blame, nor the Ministry of Education, for this.  Yet there must be someone to blame.  Are these men the victims of cosmic operations merely?  They are the victims of economic and other considerations, and I suggest that the public are at fault, and the section of the public most particularly at fault are the parents of the children who are satisfied to derive these great and lasting benefits from the work and self-sacrifice of this class of men, and who go on with equanimity year after year contemplating their disabilities and profiting by them.</P>
    <P>If we propose a grant in aid to these men there would be a howl from public representatives that the Exchequer was being drawn upon unduly, and that the taxpayer was being burdened.  But the taxpayer ought to be burdened.  Education should be a first charge upon the Exchequer of the country; it is the basis of all future progress and future development. There is an idea abroad that secondary education is for the middle class, more particularly the upper middle class, and that it has no concern whatever for the people at large.  That is an altogether mistaken view.  Altogether mistaken.  If education of a secondary type was at the disposal of the middle class until recently, that was merely because of the reign of the bourgeoise.  We are making a new State here.  We are advancing on lines which we hope will be characteristic of our own civilisation.  We intend to shut out no avenue or career to brains.  Anyone who can purchase the highest type of education and places himself at the service of the State in its higher offices should be free to do so.  All we want is the removal of all barriers; equality of opportunity&mdash;and equality of opportunity is one of the principal tenets of democracy. If the schools of Ireland of a secondary type are to be efficient the <Col N="1177" /> teachers must be paid.  How are they to be paid?  It is quite obvious that if fees are to be raised we block the entrance into these schools to the sons of poor men. Therefore the obvious way of coming to the relief of these schools is so obvious that it does not need to be pointed out. It is a sad thing that year after year in Ireland the same plea has to be made. Either we intend&mdash;I say this in all seriousness as the dilemma that ought to be put to the Irish people&mdash;to shut out lay teachers from the secondary schools altogether, and we will not allow education to be a profession for a layman to engage in, or if we do, then we shall not have him, year after year, subjected to this disability which interferes with the efficiency of his work.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to add any additional argument to the case for the teachers made by Deputy Magennis, because he has covered the whole ground and no new argument can be added.  But I feel so strongly on the point that I would like to support the case he has made.  I think it is my duty as a Deputy to underline the case that he made for the secondary teachers.  As regards that humorous American story that he told us when the visitor took the middle course and called the Bishop a professor, I think if he had to deal with the poor secondary teacher in Ireland he would have no hesitation in calling him Sambo, because he was on the bottom rung of the ladder.  I do not agree with Deputy Magennis on one point.  He said the responsibility lies upon the parents.  I cannot see where the parents are to be blamed any more than any other citizen. All the citizens of the Saorstát are equally at fault in this matter, and the Government cannot escape its responsibilities. At present they occupy an inconsistent and illogical position regarding secondary teachers.  The primary teacher has to have certain qualifications before he can teach the pupils going to his school.  Then the more advanced pupils require teachers with higher qualifications, and the State has stepped in and said to the secondary teacher, &ldquo;Before you can teach in a secondary school it will not be sufficient for you to have all the qualifications of a primary teacher.  You must have additional qualifications, and though we call upon you to have superior qualifications to the primary teacher we will see that you do not get half the salary that he gets.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1178" /> position is very illogical altogether.  If you go to the Army you will see instructors there for teaching private soldiers; you will also find instructors for teaching the officers, but the instructors in the one case are paid considerably more than in the other case, as is natural and reasonable. So with all the other professions. But when you come down to the secondary teacher you find that he is not at all to be on the level of those who have less to do and less onerous work. Why should not the secondary teacher get even the salary that the primary teacher gets?  The want of security which has been referred to by Deputy Magennis is a very serious question; it has a most unsettling effect upon the teacher.  He is on the eleven months system, like the grazier's bullock.  He does not know what is going to become of him at the end of his time.  I met secondary teachers time after time, and it was painful to hear them complain of the uncertainty of their future.  A number of the establishments in which those men and women teach are, no doubt, private establishments, but these men and women are doing national work; the State has recognised that, and the State has that responsibility and must face it. Those people must be put on a proper level.</P>
      <P>With regard to pensions, they are in a very bad way.  You give a better salary to a man you send down the country as a Civic Guard than you pay to the secondary teacher, and when the Civic Guard has spent his life looking after publichouses, collecting &ldquo;drunks,&rdquo; and all the other items of his varied profession you give him a fine pension, but the secondary teacher gets no pension. If I were asked to look around for a man under whose paternal care I would place the secondary teachers I would not go beyond the Minister for Education.  I am sure there is no need for Deputy Magennis or any other Deputy to commend the hard case of those men and women to him, but it is necessary all the same for Deputies to emphasise the injustice of the position in which those men and women find themselves.  They spend their lives in very hard and trying work, and they should be decently paid.  They should have security, and they should have a pension.  They are engaged in work of a national character, there is a national responsibility, and we should see that they are treated fairly.</P>

      <P>This question of the position of the Intermediate Teachers is not a new one.  It is well the Dáil should know that it is only a few years since the State recognised that they had any responsibility whatsoever to lay secondary teachers.  Before that time these teachers were employed by private individuals, or people who conducted schools and got certain grants in aid of such schools.  They were free to employ these teachers, or such persons as they wished to employ, irrespective of the qualifications of those persons, and at whatever rate of remuneration they could get them to accept.  Some seven or eight years ago, after considerable agitation, the State did come to recognise that it had some measure of responsibility to these teachers, and it made certain provisions&mdash;altogether inadequate provisions, as everybody knows and as everybody admits&mdash;to meet those responsibilities.  Early in 1921 the position had become so desperate that a conference was convened of the heads of the various Intermediate Schools in the country, in consultation with the Intermediate Commissioners, and this conference agreed upon a scheme.  A scheme was submitted to the Government.  Unfortunately, so far as the scheme was concerned, it coincided with the time when the government of this country was about to be transferred to the Irish people, and so the British Government did not proceed with it.  The Secondary Teachers naturally expected that when their own Government would be established one of the first things they would do would be to take up this question of Secondary Education and the Secondary Teachers.  I think it will be admitted that the Secondary Teachers as a body certainly did their part in bringing about the state of conditions which made the Free State possible.  In the Northern area their difficulties in setting up a new Government and a new Administration were no less than they were here.  The Northern Government within the last year has introduced a very comprehensive Education Bill, and has made ample provision for Intermediate Education and for the Intermediate Teachers.  It has set up a scale of salaries and pensions&mdash; or it is about to set up a scale of salaries and pensions&mdash;and this scale will come into operation as from the beginning of the last school year, 1st September. Speaking some eight months ago or more, <Col N="1180" /> when this Vote was under discussion in the Dáil, the Minister for Education (Deputy Professor MacNeill) said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are three points&mdash;salary. tenure of office, and pensions&mdash;on which I do not think there is a single person alive who, speaking conscientiously, would deny that in these respects the position of Secondary Teachers is gravely unsatisfactory.  I do not say it with regard to justice, with regard to the men and women concerned, but in regard to the public interest and the right education of their children.</P>
      <P>These are the three points which have been referred to by Deputy Magennis and Deputy Sears, and they form the three principal claims made on behalf of those teachers.  There is no question whatsoever that the gravity and unsatisfactory state of the position of the Secondary Teachers has been admitted by the Minister for Education on various occasions and by every Party in the Dáil. But nothing has come of it.  It is really heartbreaking to find that when a case is put up to the Minister or the Government the grievance is admitted, but nothing is done to remedy it.  No steps are taken by way of remedy.  I think it was Deputy Professor Magennis who stated earlier that if it was proposed to increase the provision made for Secondary Education, it is quite possible a howl would go up from the people.  I do not know on what he bases that assumption.  As a matter of fact, many public bodies, as the Minister for Education knows, have submitted resolutions to him during the past year calling special attention to the position of Secondary Education and of Secondary Teachers, and urging strongly that some remedial steps should be taken.  If we can accept that as any evidence of the feelings of representative people on the matter, I think there is no danger that there would be any protest from any quarter such as the Deputy would seem to anticipate.</P>

    <P>A year, or practically a year, has passed since these Estimates were last before us.  On every occasion on which it was possible in the Dáil the position of Intermediate Education has been discussed. From all sides there has been general agreement that it was necessary to do something.  Yet nothing has been done.  I do not see how the Dáil would be justified in passing this Estimate as it appears before us, and, if I am in <Col N="1181" /> order, I would propose that it be referred back for further consideration.  That is the only way the Dáil can show its mind in the matter.  There is nothing to indicate that we may not come here again in twelve months time and find just the same work before us.  A long list of Bills was put before us yesterday, but no hint was given of a reform in this blot on our educational system.  I content myself, therefore, at this stage with moving that this Estimate be referred back for further consideration.</P>

      <P>Some short time ago I had occasion to stand up here and draw attention to an Estimate in connection with primary education.  In doing that, and in making the remarks I then made, I had in mind this particular Estimate also.  I knew the salaries of secondary teachers were only from £180 to £220. I also knew that they had no security and were not entitled to any pensionable rights.  What I objected to in the last Estimate was not the money spent on education, but its unfair distribution. I do not think it is equitably distributed. When I was commenting upon the other Estimates, I knew that the salary the primary teacher is in receipt of ranges between £400 and £450, between the salary, Capitation Grants and other allowances.</P>

They are not getting anything like justice; they never did.  I knew that they were men with a higher standard of educational qualifications and that they were called upon to impart that higher standard of educational knowledge to the youth of the country.  I knew that they were capable men and that they did impart it.

      <P>The general practice is that when a young boy or girl reaches eleven or twelve years, they are sent to the secondary schools in order to get a better education.  The people who impart that better education are not paid half as much as the teachers in the primary schools.  This, in my opinion, ought to be made a national question; the nation ought to face it.  I do not know that it ought to be faced in the way that some educational authorities in the Dáil advocate, and that is by reducing the number of primary teachers to about one-third, to get rid, as they say, of the duds.  Some of our educational authorities here admit that half the number of primary teachers, or perhaps more, are duds.  I have heard that expression used by some of our educational authorities in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis was one.  That might be one means of meeting the demand that is now being made in respect to secondary teachers.  The other method would be in order, as I suggest, to distribute the funds more fairly, to reduce the salaries of the primary teachers and transfer the amount to the secondary teachers.  I am not in favour of having a drastic reduction in the number of primary teachers.  This course may be necessary in the minds of men who are capable of forming an opinion, but it is largely a question for the primary teachers themselves whether they will do with a smaller salary or prefer a reduction in their numbers by one-third or one-half. It is no uncommon thing in the country to find going into the homes of primary school teachers a sum of between £700 and £800 per year.  The secondary teacher has no means of making this amount.  His salary is a bald £180 to £220.  I appeal to the Minister for Education and to the Government to devise some means whereby the secondary teachers will be put on a standard of decency and given the fair play that they have not been getting.</P>

      <P>I do not think any very useful purpose is likely to be served by a lengthy discussion on this matter, by repeating the battle of books on the floor of the Dáil, or even by passing the amendment which Deputy O'Connell has moved.  I dare say what he desires to get is the same as what I desire to get. I think it is most important that we should get from the Minister for Education at the very earliest possible moment a statement that he is going to deal with this matter on legislative lines, and further, perhaps he might give us some statement of the general lines on which he is going to deal with this problem.  I think, though I do not very often agree with Deputy Gorey in what he says about education, that there was a certain element of commonsense in his remarks about the matter being possibly dealt with by a re-distribution of the total Vote for Education.  I am not at all sure that the Minister for Finance will be glad to hear him say that.  In view of the income of the State, our Vote for Education is a smaller one than it ought to be.  I am perfectly sure we do not get value for the money, for some reason or another.  I am not approaching this matter in the way Deputy Gorey did, by thinking of the salaries of Primary Teachers as being too large, and that they are being over-paid for their work. The work they do is of such importance that it is impossible to over-estimate it, particularly if we are to have at the back of our minds anything like that equality of opportunity to which Deputy Magennis refers.  I have always said, and I now contend as an obvious truth, that the most difficult teaching in the world is that which is given at the very commencement of a pupil's education.  The very highest qualifications are really required in teaching the young.  You cannot have a too highly trained body of Primary Teachers or of Junior Secondary Teachers.  When the pupils get older, if they profit by what they have learned in the Primary Schools, they can get along by themselves.  I do not want to minimise in the slightest way the work done by the Primary Teachers; neither am I going to spend time stressing the conditions of the Secondary Teacher.  We have heard, and probably the Minister for Education will be the first to admit it, that the Secondary Teachers are working under impossible conditions, and as a consequence the State is suffering <Col N="1184" /> the greatest loss and harm.  By the harm that is being done to Secondary Education in the country by reason of the method in which it is worked we are losing the best of the Secondary Teachers. That matter is urgent, and should be dealt with as soon as possible, otherwise this drain of the Secondary Teachers will go on.  I want to refer very briefly to this and to point out that the matter is even wider than as a matter concerning Secondary Teachers only.  There is the efficiency of the school itself to be considered. The grants given to Secondary Schools have been really on the down grade.  This is owing to two causes; the first is due to the amount of money available, and the second is owing to the number of pupils attending the schools. The grant per head to the schools has been diminishing rather than increasing. Then we have information furnished by Commissions, for example by the Commission that preceded the Macpherson Bill, and the admissions in that Macpherson Bill, that the conditions were intolerable, and should not be continued. Still the fact remains to be dealt with. I suppose I have experience now of 25 years, I am sorry to say, of many Boards and of some of the most successful Protestant schools in the country.  I know very little, I am sorry to say, about the others.  But I do know the conditions under which these schools have been trying to make themselves efficient.  Before the war it was almost impossible. Since the war, with the increase in prices, it has been really impossible. That difficulty has been added to by the fact that the grants to the schools have been diminishing.  I merely say this to point out that the matter is vital, and that it cannot be remedied without State aid.  The schools have done as much as lies in their power by raising their fees to meet the demands upon their exchequer. But the whole difficulty in raising fees is to prevent the best of the young pupils, who ought to get the advantage of education, from getting those advantages which the Secondary Schools give.  I want to give the best brains of the primary schools a chance to go to the Secondary Schools and, if possible, afterwards to the Universities.  That cannot be done without State aid.  I think it would be important for the country as a whole if we could draw from the Minister some such statement as I have suggested, that he would deal at the earliest <Col N="1185" /> possible moment with this problem as a whole, and that he is prepared to bring in legislation to deal with it, Deputy Gorey once said there was too much education in this country.  Now, that very statement disproved his statement.  I contend that it is of the very first importance. We cannot afford to stint our grants for Education, whether for Primary, Secondary or University Education, or the various branches of technical education, in agriculture or commerce, and in technical branches of science.  It is of the very highest importance to us, if we are going to make this country a sound business proposition, that we should develop our education on all these branches.  If you want to make your agriculture a success it means that what you want is education on the best and most modern methods of carrying on agriculture.  Unless you get that education in the schools or the Universities you will not make your agriculture in this country a sound business proposition. The Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day used some very wise words with reference to the needs for efficiency in commerce, and said that it was necessary that commerce and business should be carried out on sound modern economic lines. You will not have that done unless you have Schools of Commerce to show business people how modern methods are to be applied, how this business can be worked on sound modern lines.  You want your technical industries to be developed by technical instruction.  The amount of real technical instruction that is given in the country at present is of the very smallest kind.  Most of the technical schools have to spend their time doing what is the work of the Secondary Schools.  There are very few schools in the country where technical subjects are taught.  I would suggest to Deputy O'Connell that he is not helping this subject by moving this amendment; it is not a practical amendment, and he should join with me in trying to get such a statement as I have indicated from the Minister for Education.  That would be of real practical value now.  I think it is urgently necessary.</P>

      <P>They have a good case.  Unfortunately, however, the teacher has really few friends.  To whom shall the teacher go?  He cannot go to his pupils.  As a body they do not think of his interests.  The parents only try to get as much for as little as possible.  That has been the history of education for 2,000 years.  A schoolmaster 2,000 years ago complained that the parents wanted the children to know everything, to be taught everything, but they wanted to pay nothing.  The taxpayer now is burdened, too, and he wants to pay as little as possible.  In the meantime the unfortunate teacher is practically starving. He cannot do his work well.  His task is hard enough as it is, but it is worse when he has to eke out his living by overtime, by drudgery, by private tuitions and other work.  Some of them work 10 and 12 hours a day, and life becomes impossible for such a man.  He cannot do his work well.  I am not going to touch on the abstract work of the teachers or to foreshadow a scheme.  We all know that there must be an examination of the education question in its full length, and some scheme born of this will probably be embodied in the Bill in the near future.  The pivot of any educational scheme will be the secondary teacher.  He is the man who gives the fine polish to the work of education, for he picks out the flower of the intellectual crop of the year and despatches them to the professions or the Universities.  One of the real resources that we have got is the brains of our people.  The secondary teacher, too, is a man who discovers the pupils with talents and puts them to the best work.  Now, I wish to say that I do hope the Government will see their way to promise something like a supplementary Vote.  When I saw that Vote for secondary education this year the same as the year before, I could not help thinking of an incident in &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop.&rdquo;  You remember where they <Col N="1187" /> were feeding that unfortunate servant, and Dick Swiveller saw Miss Brass going to the safe, bringing out a leg of mutton, and making a great array of sharpening a carving knife, and then cutting off two square inches of meat.  &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  said Miss Brass. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Marchioness.  &ldquo;Never say you do not get meat in this house; eat it up,&rdquo; said Miss Brass.  &ldquo;Do you want any more?&rdquo; asked Miss Brass.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Marchioness.  They were evidently going through an established form.  I cannot help thinking that in this Dáil we are going through an established form. I really hope that the Minister will be able to give another helping to the secondary teachers.  I will not weary the Dáil by dilating on their needs; they are well known to you all.  Nor can I cordially support Deputy O'Connell's amendment; but I would urge the Minister to indicate a hope to these, one of the most deserving classes in the community, of better things, and a hope of some immediate relief.</P>

What we all wish is a promise, or a declaration, on the part of the Finance Minister of something in the nature of a supplementary grant.  If that were given, it would be unnecessary to send back the Estimate.  It is merely in that sense that I am opposing the amendment, and that, strictly speaking, is not opposition at all.  When Deputy Gorey joined the alliance on behalf of education I could not help exclaiming, in Biblical language, &ldquo;Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;  His support and the support of his Party count for so much in this matter that I rejoice exceedingly. True, he used the support as a sort of shield from which he hurled darts at the primary school teachers.  His method. then, is Biblical, like his new position. He would rob Peter to pay Paul.  He accused me of referring to one-third of the National school teachers as &ldquo;duds.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>One half.  I must have met Deputy Gorey in some astral plane, and it was my astral body that spoke.  However, that is not material <Col N="1188" /> to the present issue.  I think that there is one danger in this matter, that while time after time we must hark back to plead the claims for higher remuneration, the public will come to the conclusion that the dominant consideration with representatives of educational matters is money.  That is one of the false positions into which, not once or twice, the advocates of education have been forced. We are made to appear in a false light. I am standing here again to have an opportunity of making a further plea for the teacher, and this time for educational freedom.  It is true that Deputy Thrift is an educationalist&mdash;and we all recognise him as an educationalist of very high standing, wide experience, and immeasurable abilities&mdash;and with Deputy Alton, is not in favour of discussing questions of educational policy in the Dáil.  Inasmuch as there is on foot so much of a reform by way of administrative work, I cannot altogether agree with him.  I think there ought to be some criticism.  To my mind forefront the question of the programme of studies set out for the schools; next to that the method of teaching; and after that, and an ancillary agency, the test of examination.  Putting as I do, in the forefront the question of the programme of study, it is most necessary that freedom should be secured for the really excellent teacher, if not to frame his own programme of studies, under the supervision of the Ministry and subject to correction and advice on the part of the Ministry's inspectors, at least to give him a share, by way of criticism, in the preparation of the programme.  The better the teacher the better the assistance he will give in this matter of what is a furtherance of national interest.  If you cramp the teacher who is interested and capable, by imposing on him a very old and stereotyped programme you are doing him, his pupils, and his school an injury. You are wronging education.  That was the great fault of the system that existed hitherto.  There was a cast-iron programme devised in No. 1 Hume Street, sent out on a given day in the year, and from that until the day of the examinations battalions of little boys and little girls in all the schools were regimented accordingly.  It did great work, I quite admit, notwithstanding the evil character attendant upon the provision of one programme for all boys and all girls alike.  But now that we have a capable <Col N="1189" /> body of administrators at work, and the full and complete articulation of all its members, a great deal can be done&mdash;a very considerable deal can be done&mdash;in setting educational work going upon appropriate lines.  I believe that if the teachers were assured now that something in a spirit of sympathy was to be done for them to redress their financial grievances, if they were told that their work is to get freedom or expansion, and their personal initiative is to have full play&mdash; that their own personalities, in fact, are to operate not merely in the importing of instruction or the securing of results fees or the adding to the list exhibitioners, but in the forming of character and the development of the spirituality of the pupils entrusted to them, in fact instilling in the pupils a sense of values which are the values of the teacher as a developed personality&mdash;if we were able to assure them of that, and that that was the view of the Dáil in criticising the Estimate, we would have alleviated in very large measure the sense of grievance on the part of the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know these teachers, and I know the professorial staff in the country fairly well, and while our constant outcry that their remuneration is not equal to the services given, it is not our pre-occupation. The fact is that just as one is often inclined to say about the poor that because of their poverty their patience is the most marvellous phenomenon they possess, the silence of those men&mdash;let me call it by its proper name&mdash;their extraordinary subservience to the conditions imposed on them, is what ought to strike the public mind.  When a few of us are vocal with regard to their grievances, it must not be understood that the teachers are preoccupied with the question of salary; they are far more interested in their work and in the progress of education; and I believe, therefore, that if this message went out to them from the Minister on behalf of his Ministry that the teacher is to be for the future recognised in Intermediate schools, not as a retailer of goods, but is in his measure and according to the limits within which he works on education, that it would be exceedingly helpful. There are ever so many things that are militating against secondary education in Ireland.  One is the poverty which necessitated the withdrawal of pupils prematurely from schools.  Another is <Col N="1190" /> the erroneous idea that secondary schools are intended to be a sort of vestibule to the Universities, and nothing more.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he will give me a minute or two.  I merely wish to support this appeal for better financial conditions for these lay teachers.  One of the professors in Trinity College told me some time ago that the Head Master of one of the most important secondary schools in the country came to him and said: &ldquo;Can you give me a first-class mathematical science master for our school; the school has been doing so badly in science at the Intermediate Education examinations that we are going to be wiped out if we do not get a first-class master?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I can give you a first-class teacher if you pay him well. How much are you going to give?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;£300 a year.&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;I cannot give you a first-class man for £300 a year.  I will get you a second-class man for that, but if you want a first rate man you will have to pay £500.&rdquo;  They had a consultation in the school, and they arranged to give £500 to this first-class man.  The result for science in his first year was extraordinary, so much so that they appealed for an assistant science teacher, and they said: &ldquo;We cannot give so much salary for this teacher, we can only give him £150 a year.&rdquo;  The professor said: &ldquo;I can only give you a sixth rate man for that, but I can give you a second rate man for £300 a year.&rdquo;  A second rate <Col N="1191" /> man was obtained for £300 a year, and the results were most extraordinary. Now, I say we can get no good results unless we get first rate teachers, and we cannot get first rate teachers unless we give them first rate pay.  I have not the same knowledge and experience of secondary schools as some of my colleagues have, but I have knowledge of the men who come from the secondary schools into the professions, and I have a very intimate knowledge of the amount of the learning these men have acquired, and sometimes of the lack of it.  So far as the professions are concerned, I say that if we want to keep up our professional status, we must have the men properly taught in the secondary schools, and again I say, if we are to have the pupils taught properly, we must have the teachers properly paid to teach.  I should like to say, in regard to the necessity for proper equipment, that I should like the Government to see that there is sufficient equipment for teaching scientific subjects.  Pupils can pass examinations well in other subjects whereas in physics and chemistry, and such subjects as should be taught in the intermediate schools are practically being neglected.  We have not been pressing the teaching of these subjects in the schools, because the ordinary English subjects are not to our minds sufficiently well taught at present.  I know that the Minister for Education has in his mind that these intermediate schools should be allowed to develop on their own lines and, to a large extent, I would agree with him, and I would even agree with him to be content to do away with all public examinations if there was to be a proper examination of class work in the schools at the end of the year.  One other point I should have liked to refer to at more length is, that many of these schools have been started as private schools in houses that were not suitable for schools at all, and as time went on the pupils increased and they were crowded together into rooms that were in no way fit for educational purposes, and the result is that too many of these schools generally are of a denominational character, whereas if one large school were equipped where these denominations could meet together, in my opinion, we would have less trouble and better feeling in the country than at present.  Finally, I <Col N="1192" /> should like to ask the Minister how much of this £30,750 is set apart for teachers, and how much of that actually gets into the pockets of secondary teachers; in other words, how much of it is used in administration and how much do the teachers get?</P>

      <P>I find myself in a rather pleasant position with regard to the discussion on this Vote.  I should say that any Minister in charge of any particular Department of public administration must feel highly gratified when he finds everybody on every side insisting on driving and pushing him in the direction in which he wishes to go.  I will not yield to the temptation of dealing with any of the general aspects of education that have been brought before us by successive speakers.  It is a very strong temptation to me.  I should like to make my own comment if I had time to think it over, but I have not exactly the same readiness of speech as many of the Deputies have.  I should like to make my own contributions to the discussion on the more general aspects of education, especially of Secondary Education, but other occasions will be found for matters of that kind.  With regard to the motion before us, to refer back the Estimate, I need not remind the Deputy who makes it, and the other Deputies, that these Estimates are in print and in the hands of the Deputies now for several months.  These Estimates were made ready for the printers&mdash;and this is a matter which not a single Deputy who has spoken has noted&mdash;in circumstances which I do not want to discuss here at all.  This country was being subjected to loss at something like the rate of a million sterling per week.  It was in that situation that these Estimates had to be drafted.  That was a very material consideration in the drawing up of the Estimates, and, having mentioned it, I will say nothing more about&mdash;shall I call it&mdash;the hyperplexus of the various Deputies who spoke.  The difficulty, too, in regard to the proper payment of Secondary <Col N="1193" /> Teachers has causes which have not been mentioned.  One would think when one sees this thing and hears it discussed that the only person to blame is a hard-hearted Minister for Finance or an indifferent Minister for Education. I do not say it was put forward here, but that point of view has certainly been given prominence to.  First of all, one of the things to blame, in my mind, is the form of our education and its peculiar classification.  We have been subjected to education in water-tight compartments&mdash;primary and secondary.  One can see at once if those lines of division did not exist that it would not be possible for Deputy Gorey to draw a distinction between the scale of remuneration of Primary Teachers and the scale of remuneration of Secondary Teachers. I often asked myself what is the meaning of this primary business and secondary business.  Why not tertiary or quaternary?  What is the exact meaning of it?  What is the object of it, and what purpose does it serve?  I think that classification has a great deal to do with the present situation.  You have two strictly divided bodies, which keep the people engaged in public education in the country on two totally different systems. There are other reasons.  Deputy O'Connell told us that a howl would go up from the people and that public bodies have submitted resolutions.</P>

      <P>It is only the words I am concerned with.  I do not wish to ascribe them to any particular Deputy.  The solution of this question might be reached if something else, and not a howl, went out from the people, and if public representatives brought something to the solution of these difficulties beyond resolutions.  It is evidently a matter of finance; it is a matter of financial provision.  No resolution has reached me in favour of raising more <Col N="1194" /> money for this purpose.  With regard to the acuteness of public feeling, it is right for the Seanad to pass a unanimous resolution, as it did some months ago, on this subject, calling for better financial treatment of those engaged in secondary education, and it is right for members of the Dáil to show its unanimity&mdash;I think every part of the Dáil has been represented in the statements that have been made here to-day&mdash;calling for an improvement in the position of secondary teachers.  These things are right; they are gratifying, but&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;not enabling.  I never concealed my own view with regard to this, and I suppose people are expected to change their views when they become invested with Ministerial appointment.  My views remain the same; I think, as I always thought, that no teacher ought to be a casual hireling.  I think that education is supremely the most important work that the nation has to take on hands.  I do not think anyone can deny that to himself.  If anyone here who has responsibility for children refers to his own case he will find that for him the providing of education in every shape and form for them is the supreme thing.  If that be so for him, it is so for everyone else. Therefore it is so for all of us.  But when people come to deal with these things from a public point of view they forget that.  There is, I think, no exaggeration in what was implied in the illustration brought forward by Deputy Magennis that, while people speak in this way, they do not appreciate the work of teaching as they ought to do.  I will give you proof of it.  I hope that all our Senators, when they are drawing up their wills, will make as good and ample provision for education as for any other charitable purpose.  I hope that the more or less wealthy people of the community, when they are also thinking of how their surplus wealth will be disposed of after they have passed away, will remember&mdash;what every testator of Ireland appears to forget&mdash;the interests of education.  That is one of the reasons why the teachers in our colleges at present are in the position they are in. With all our talk about education, there is no country in the world in which the people of wealth and of means have done less for education than in this country of ours.  If some small proportion of the surplus wealth that is disposed of in a <Col N="1195" /> variety of ways were directed towards educational purposes, the situation with regard to our secondary schools would be very different from what it is.  The situation with regard to the Universities, about which we will probably hear a good deal later, would also be improved.  I do not intend to make any statement with regard to the general principles of education, and I do not intend to make any statement with regard to future legislative proposals.  I will confine myself to the matter before us.  I am quite certain that if it were in the power of the Dáil&mdash;if they had the power under the Constitution&mdash;the Deputies would unanimously, or almost unanimously, bring forward over the heads of the Ministry, in case they were reluctant, a Vote for a substantial increase of the amount allocated here for secondary education, and make it particularly available for the salaries of secondary teachers.  The question was put to me as to how much of this money goes in administration.  I have not had time to make close, exact official enquiries, but I believe I can answer offhand&mdash;practically none.  Any portion of it spent on administration is infinitesimal.</P>

      <P>Naturally the country is disturbed by the present dispute in connection with the traffic at the quays.  From time to time the country has been disturbed over disputes between employers and employed.  Very frequently we are treated to lectures, appeals and pleadings for something to be done to avoid the interminable disputes, interminable strikes, and frequent locks-out.  We are told that the future prosperity of the country is menaced, that it is impossible to build up a community, healthy and economically prosperous, while the danger exists of workmen ceasing work, and workmen refusing to bend in any way in regard to their trade customs and regulations.  We are told frequently that the hope of peaceful development of industry in this country is baseless unless some change can take place, which would ensure that workmen would no longer be undependable, that strikes would, as a matter of fact, cease, and there would be no longer any labour disputes.  I ask the Dáil to consider this matter very seriously, and to come to the conclusion that the chances of peaceful development are very small unless some assurance or guarantee can be given to workmen that their lives will be safeguarded, because, after all, you take my life when you take the means whereby I live.  I want the Dáil to recognise this very important fact in this connection as in so many other connections. The question of education has been under discussion, and I think I remember that, in an earlier debate on that question, the Minister for Education laid it down that education as well as political institutions were means to a definite human end&mdash;the developing of a healthy, happy, human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Dáil, and I think it is important for the public also, to recognise that even industry and commerce are not entities of themselves, and ends to which human activities should be directed.  On the contrary, industry and commerce, prosperity in those walks of life, are only sought for because we want them to serve human ends.  While that may seem axiomatic, and not necessary at all to refer to here, I am very much afraid that people have got into the habit of thinking of trade and commerce and industry as an end to which all energies should be directed, and that human prosperity, human happiness and human effort must be subordinated to something <Col N="1198" /> called trade or to something called commerce. Now, the end of all and every industry is, as we must all admit, to feed, clothe, house and provide amenities for the people.  I think that if that axiom is borne in mind it will not be difficult to persuade Deputies that the workmen who are engaged in trade, workmen whose occupation is to further industry and commerce, must incidentally to the commerce, but inevitably and with that definite forethought, be the first item for consideration and the first charge upon any industry or commerce. That leads one to this consideration, which is the kernel of what I have to say, that unemployment and the fear of unemployment is the greatest fear that the workmen have.  The fear of unemployment, the need to promote the chances of employment, to protect their interests when in employment, and the defence against what they deem to be an attack upon those conditions, and their chance of employment in the future are the primary purposes of Trade Unions. Trade Unions were established and have grown up, and have always considered as their primary purpose and reason for existence to protect the interests of the workmen.  When regulations concerning trades are made, when opposition is, as has so often been the case, offered to machine developments, it is always on the ground that the effect of the introduction of new methods is going to deprive the workmen of their chances of a livelihood, as in fact it does, at least for a period.  Otherwise those labour-saving machines would not be introduced.  It is this fear of unemployment that is the underlying explanation of three-fourths of the labour disputes, not all, but a great majority of the labour disputes. An important consideration that must be taken into account by the workmen, whether as individuals or as organised bodies, is the necessity of looking ahead and trying to conserve their chances of employment three months, six months, or twelve months in advance. When we bear in mind, then. that this fear, this sense of insecurity, is the great underlying cause of the great majority of labour disputes, I think it is clear that our efforts should be directed straight to the solution of the problem. and if it is humanly possible to remove that insecurity from the workmen's minds, then you are going very far to make possible a peaceful development of <Col N="1199" /> industry in the country.  I believe it is possible so to organise the human resources of this country as to ensure that every man capable of working and willing to work shall have opportunities for work.  Now, this problem affects probably not more than a half a million men.  The security that I seek is provided for the man who has land.  He may have to work very hard for a very little return.  He may be compelled to make his own soil, as he has done in the past.  But, having made it, he can at any rate, by the application of his labour to that soil, provide sustenance for himself and his family.  It may be mean, it may be poor, as it is in these congested areas of which we have been speaking so much, but there is that ultimate security to the landholder against starvation.  But this problem is the problem of the landless men, whether the country landless men or the town landless man, the proletariat, the propertyless man who is dependent for the livelihood of himself and his family upon the chances of the labour market.  Now, those chances are very variable.  Some men are fortunate.  Some men are lucky enough to be placed in a position where they are insured permanence of employment, and where the amount of security is so great that the risks of starvation and the risks of hunger are small.  There is a vast mass in this country, as in other countries, who cannot see two weeks ahead, and who do not know where next week's food is to come from.  The very much greater number of them have not the slightest security for a livelihood three months ahead.</P>
    <P>Because of that insecurity, they have been forced into a defensive position, and are obliged to say: &ldquo;We must conserve our narrower interests, and we dare not, because of the insecurity, enlarge our vision until we find ourselves in a position to say there are no risks; we are assured of employment in the future, and with that security we can let our imagination and our impulses and our feelings have full play.&rdquo;  I believe if you would understand the position of the workmen <i>en masse</i>, you would have to consider the position of the undeveloped societies, the hungry societies who cannot and do not give rein to enterprise because the margin of sustenance at their disposal is so limited.  It is only when, by virtue of good fortune and good harvests, luck <Col N="1200" /> in the hunt, that ample provision is made for the future, that they can allow rein to their energies and their enterprises. I want to bring about the same position for the workman.  I want the workmen to be able to say: &ldquo;We are secure against unemployment; we are guaranteed that if we do work that is put to us we shall not want, and our families will run no risk of hunger; insecurity, so far as it is humanly possible of achievement, has passed.&rdquo;  Then men would be justified in demanding a full measure of social service from all, and demanding a removal of many restrictions that impeded the progress of industry and commerce. I believe until you give that assurance it will not be possible to call for that output, for that removal of restrictions, and for that increased effort in time of emergency that in a community of citizens of good will ought to be possible. I am putting it to the Dáil that we ought to accept this proposition as a responsible National Assembly, so that the workers of the country should be guaranteed regularity of employment, or, failing that, maintenance for the work which they are willing to do, but which the organisers of industry have not been able to provide.  This is not a revolutionary doctrine.  In essence, if looked at from a slightly different angle, it is already in being through the Poor Law Institutions, but unfortunately wrongly, Poor Law administration was conceived and carried through as though poverty and destitution were offences which ought to be punished.  We do provide some kind of State guarantee against starvation by hunger, and we impose upon citizens an obligation to accept of that substenance which the law places at their disposal.</P>
    <P>We want to get away from the atmosphere of the Poor Law, and we want to say to workmen that our energies, our organising ability, and the resources of the State will, if necessary, be called in so as to ensure that every workman will be guaranteed useful employment, employment for the common good, productive work, useful service, and will be paid adequately for that service.  I believe this proposition, if it were tackled as the problems of defence and problems of a similar kind have been tackled in this and in other countries, could be successfully dealt with; but it cannot be successfully dealt with if we are going to look upon it merely in the light of an <Col N="1201" /> extension of existing systems.  It may mean that we shall have to face certain consequences, but I am not asking the Dáil, in this proposition, to commit itself in the slightest to any conception of future social order.  I am not asking the Dáil to alter its view of what kind of a State this should be.  I am asking the Dáil to accept this as a fundamental proposition, that men willing to work, who have not the means of work, and have no land on which to work, must be guaranteed the opportunities to do useful work at reasonable pay.  The two great industries which have been most seriously affected by labour disputes in recent years have been the building trades and the transport trades.  The numbers of men affected in those trades are not unmanageable if organisation was looked at seriously.  Probably 30,000 men in the building trades, apart from odds and ends, and probably 40,000 or 50,000, taking all the transport trades, including the railways, cover those two big industries. I put it to the Dáil that the problem of the organisation of all the men engaged in those two branches of industry is not insuperable.</P>
    <P>The men engaged in manual work, the men engaged in the direct work, could, if they put their minds to it, contrive to assess the amount of human energy that is required for the annual output in those trades.  The labour is there; the men are there; the capacity and experience are there; and society has, by one means or another, so directed itself that 30,000 men have set themselves to the occupation, say, of building.  I say it is our duty, as a State organisation, to induce, if possible, those to whose care has been committed the organisation of the building trades, to ensure to all these men in the building trades that their work would be well directed and would not be wasted.  This is the problem of the elimination of waste, and I want to say that the organisers of industry who claimed that title, which ought to be a proud one, have to justify their claim and have to organise, or assist in the organisation, of all that energy and experience, and direct it to the building of houses primarily, and other buildings at the same time.  But they have no right to expect to have at their disposal thousands of men just when they require them.  It is not impossible to estimate the requirements of building for five years ahead <Col N="1202" /> It should be comparatively simple in this country.  We know what the housing needs are.  The Minister for Local Government and the President know that. We know, within moderate limits, what the needs are in respect to public works. We know what the capacity of the country is, and I say that there ought to be some means of fitting the needs with the capacity to supply these needs, and that means the organisation of the men in the trades.  So it is with transport. What is the procedure?  We have frequently come across a position something like this.  A ship comes into a harbour. It is required to be discharged, and some hundreds of men are wanted on the spot. They are required to work night and day, and to be available to work night and day until she is discharged, because it is too expensive to keep that ship lying in dock.  I ask you to bear in mind what that means.  It means that it is of much greater importance to have 500 men available, waiting on the rota, unemployed, to be ready to discharge a ship that may come in on any day, because a ship cannot be kept waiting. That is topsy-turvydom.  Surely it is more important to have men employed, to have men regularly organised, whose life would be comparatively regular, even though that ship has to wait for two or three days longer for discharge.  But with organisation there is no necessity, I would contend, even to delay in the discharge of a ship of that kind.</P>
    <P>I submit that the problem of casual labour and the method of decasualisation of labour ought to be taken in hand both at the docks and in every other occupation, and I believe that, notwithstanding that many men are opposed to any attempt to decasualise labour, thinking that it is chancy, no doubt, and sporting, and gives them an opportunity to have a flutter occasionally, I believe that for the social good decausalisation should proceed, but it can only proceed if it is accompanied by a guarantee of employment. I am asking that the Dáil should accept this view, and, having accepted it, that then the representatives of employers' organisations and workers' organisations should be called into conference and be told that this being the view of Dáil Eireann, it is their duty to find the best means of achieving this end&mdash; this end of the organisation of the industry of the country, the regularisation of <Col N="1203" /> the labour of the country, and the adequate payment for that labour.  We shall be told, no doubt, that industry cannot stand the present charges.  Wages must come down, conditions must be altered, labour must be more malleable and elastic in its demands.  Well, I answer, for my part, that when these essential conditions are secured I am prepared to do everything that one man can to achieve the rest, but until these essential conditions are assured I say it would be disloyal to workmen, it would be suicidal for workmen, to give up their only protective measures and forces.  We are all hoping and believing that it is possible of attainment, that there is no necessity for workmen in this country to have to follow the market of labour in other countries, and we think that this country is living in a fool's paradise if it expects that there will be an accommodation of that kind; that all that is to be done is to say, &ldquo;Somebody else in another country is working cheaper than you are working, and therefore you must adjust your prices to theirs.&rdquo;  High wages for three weeks and no wages for two means low wages for five, and that is about the condition that so many men find themselves in. I would like the Dáil to agree with me in this, that there can be a reorganisation of industry, that labour can be well protected, that improvements can be made in the conduct and administration of the industrial machine, that employers can learn how to direct their industries very much more efficiently than they have yet shown any signs of; that these things can be done when the foundation is laid, that a workman is not running the risk of unemployment in a week, two weeks, or six months.  Give us this guarantee, and then we can see what are the best means of arriving at that end.  I ask the Dáil to accept this motion.</P>

      <P>With the larger part of this exceptionally weighty utterance of Deputy Johnson I find myself in complete agreement; I mean by the larger part the larger in the bulk of matter that it presents for thought rather than merely the larger part of it as it would appear to the reader of the speech. Deputy Johnson has gone back for his <Col N="1204" /> first principles to that mediaeval Christianity which it has been so long the fashion to deride.</P>

      <P>Modern civilisation, which is so boastful of its own alleged achievements, derides it, but modern civilisation has found its complete refutation in the Great War and the consequent upheavals in Europe. There the great test was applied to a materialistic so-called civilisation, a civilisation based on the egotism and egoism. As regards the relation between labourer and employer Deputy Johnson goes back to what is taught in the Catholic catechism, which is not ashamed to preserve the doctrine of an earlier age, &ldquo;Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal.&rdquo;  That is our theory now, though I prefer to say nothing for the moment about our practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When, notwithstanding our catechetical lectures and instruction, we find ourselves later in life investors of capital and employers of labour.  But it is with the doctrines as enunciated by Deputy Johnson that I prefer to deal.  I think it is time for this Dáil, on behalf of the Irish nation, to express itself here and now in favour of a type of civilisation wholly different from the Teutonic semblance or simula-crum of civilisation which has been operative in Great Britain and Ireland and through the German Empire since the 17th century.  Deputy Johnson spoke of waste.  Unless we are willing to take the attitude of Cain and ask &ldquo;Am I my brother's keeper?&rdquo; how can we look on at the social shambles that this competitive system creates, this horrible waste of humanity, and look on and feel that we have no share in participation of guilt?  We are all guilty, as the phrase runs, of brother's blood so long as we raise no voice of protestation.  The waste is incalculable, and, what is still worse, the waste is irreparable.  There is a very fine poem written by a Labour laureate to replace &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When wilt Thou save the people, oh God of Mercy, when?</P>
      <P>Not thrones and crowns but nations, not kings and lords but men.</P>
      <P>Flowers of Thy heart, oh God, are they,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Let them not waste like weeds away,</P>
    <P>We are their heritage of sunless day.</P>
    <P>God save the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that expresses my conception of the prayer that should go from all of us who feel the social unrest that we lament around us everywhere to-day.  The awful phrase was used again of &ldquo;the labour market.&rdquo;  We did away with the slave market in name.  What is the labour market as we know it to-day, as described by Deputy Johnson, as regards its by-product, if not its intentional product, of casual labour?  &ldquo;The world is out of joint,&rdquo; says Hamlet, &ldquo;oh cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.&rdquo; That &ldquo;cursed spite&rdquo; has come to the Parliament of Ireland, for we must do something to set right the social dislocation of the country.  It is one of the great problems that concerns the Parliament. Deputy Johnson asked us to guarantee regularity and permanence of employment. I wish we could guarantee it.  I took a note that he said it must be guaranteed, and I substituted that it ought to be guaranteed.  At a time when there is so much talk around us of a General Election, one's memory naturally harks back to one's election address and the pledges made in it.  May I egotistically recall a passage of mine?  I undertook to support&mdash;it was regarded as an eccentric thing on the part of a University representative&mdash;all legislation that would tend to humanise labour.  I received a letter from an unknown correspondent, dated from Cork.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I see that you intend to humanise labour,&rdquo; ran the letter.  &ldquo;If you can persuade labour to work you would go down to history as an immortal statesman.&rdquo; I undertook to support&mdash;and I am carrying out my undertaking&mdash;everything brought forward here that tends to humanise labour.  That is our Christian profession, that we regard humanity as God-like, and that everything in the system under which a human being lives his life that tends to degrade him from the high level of personality is evil, and is to be stamped out.  The human being is entitled to live his life under conditions that are consonant with his status of personality. These are sometimes ridiculed as the doctrines of the visionary.  They are part of the Gospel that Christ came here to preach, and I am quite satisfied <Col N="1206" /> to be ridiculed as a visionary so long as my doctrine or my profession is in accord with that Gospel.  We forget too often, because we see a mechanism gone astray, what was its original purpose.  Society, as I spoke of it the other day, is intended to provide that environment, that set of surroundings, opportunities and safeguards which will enable the individual to develop himself in the highest measure to realise all that it is in him to become. Society exists for the meanest individual for that purpose, as well as for the most exalted.  It does not follow that because a child is born under conditions of poverty or of destitution that he is to be kept, when he grows to adult manhood, as a mere slave or instrument for the creation of another man's wealth.  We have the spectacle of one portion of the community, describable as the idle rich, rolling in luxury, and the majority of the people worse housed than the cattle, and living with that dreadful insecurity which only a miracle, it seems to me, can save from producing either insanity on the one hand, or crime on the other.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion, during a holiday, having the pleasure of visiting one of the most beautiful places in the world&mdash;Isabela and Lago Maggiore. Where I landed was one of the most squalid fishing villages imaginable, and through that I found my way into the gardens of the Count Borroméo.  It was an earthly paradise overlooking the lake to Stresa.  In those gardens was every type of beautiful vegetation.  When I looked at the castle of the Count and these superb grounds, and looked down at the little dark, noisome narrow lanes in which the population of Isabela was confined, I could not help&mdash;I make this confession frankly&mdash;thinking that if I were one of these men some night I would make my protest.  A few years ago &mdash;I remember I mentioned this to the Archbishop of the place when I had the honour of meeting him&mdash;in San Francisco, an anarchist went into a Catholic Church and shot the priest on the altar rails while he was giving Holy Communion. I pointed out to the Archbishop, and some American Bishops who were with him, that all that was wrong with that man was that in his action he was too logical.  This man felt that, were it not for the preaching of our priests of the doctrine that in another world they would be compensated for the harsh and cruel <Col N="1207" /> treatment they undergo here, that they would rise up and pull down, some day of mad destruction, the whole fabric that victimises them.</P>
    <P>I hold, and I hold it strongly, that it is the duty of everyone who is interested in the preservation of society, who is an opponent of anarchism, to profess those doctrines not merely by lip service, but by actual conduct.  It is the only way to save society.  The doctrine that Deputy Johnson has expounded, in the larger portion of his speech, is utterly opposed to the doctrine of class warfare. which is the weed that flourishes when the materialistic conception of life is allowed to replace the proper conception of human values.  It is useless for men to write books exposing the fallacies of Carl Marx.  It is useless for lecturers to make us shudder with horror at the accounts of what revolutionaries have done in mad protest against the system that wrongs them, unless we are prepared to show by constructive work that the doctrines we hold by and stand for can be worked out into institutions, the operation of which would be to provide the attainment of those ideals and the realisation of those advantages for which the anarchist is so anxious.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Deputy Johnson, that conferences should be called, that, in fact, a permanent system for conferring should be set up, to avoid the destructive methods of labour warfare, I think that when he asks us to guarantee regularity and permanence of employment, he is asking us to do what, in the circumstances that exist, we cannot do. It would not be honest if we were to pass a resolution with the words &ldquo; we guarantee,&rdquo; because we have to renew &ldquo; a clean heart and a new spirit&rdquo; in society before the Government would be in a position to give such a guarantee as an effective thing.  That is the trouble.  If he asked us to proclaim our faith in such a system, or to assert the right of the Government to make a reformation, I would be with them.  I have spoken on another occasion on an aspect of this problem which I would like&mdash;only I am detaining you quite too long&mdash;hurridedly to bring before you.  To reform one defect in the system of investment and the responsibilities that it brought with it, of which Sir Walter Scott was a notable victim, the laws were altered <Col N="1208" /> under the control of which Joint Stock Companies are floated and run.  That has brought about impersonal relationship between employer and employed. If A.B. invests his money in Mexican Oils, or in some far  away company, he has no opportunity of knowing or of assuring himself what the conditions are under which the dividends he is glad to receive are earned.  The ideal demand would be that he should not take those dividends unless he were satisfied that they had been honestly distributed.  But in the nature of the case, from the circumstances that prevail, it is impossible to make those investigations, or to discover whether one is really reaping the fruits of villainies perpetrated without his knowledge, or whether he is receiving results honestly achieved.  The whole world would have to be reorganised.  The whole system of investment and employment would have to be changed from top to bottom.  As I put it in Biblical language, &ldquo;A clean heart and a new spirit would have to be created&rdquo; before it could be done.  As we cannot build a great wall of China round our country, and as we cannot keep ourselves out of international relations, the utmost we can hope to achieve is to secure within our own dominions, within our own realm of operation, a better scheme.  But we could not guarantee.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think that Deputy Johnson has rendered an enormous public service in coming forward with a resolution so worded and so expounded by him to-day.  As the leader of the Labour Party, I, as one humble member of the Dáil, would applaud him to the echo.  He has dissociated himself clearly and unmistakably from those who espouse the class war doctrines.  He has taken sides with the sane reformer who seeks to remedy appalling abuses by the application of correct thought.  That is a great national service, and it is because I sincerely believe he has done that service that I have taken the trouble to add to my increasing volume of unpopularity in this Chamber by making another long speech.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis has agreed with the greater part of the argument put forward by Deputy Johnson, but he sticks at the conclusion. However welcome it may be to us to find Deputy Magennis again returning to the paths of virtue and justice, <Col N="1209" /> not to say of good sense, it would be still more welcome if we found him agreeing to the only practical conclusion that is to be drawn from the very premises with which he has expressed such hearty agreement.  In this country, as in other countries, there has always been too much expression of sympathy and agreement with principles without a corresponding effort to put those principles and that sympathy into practical form. Deputy Johnson's motion calls for a conference for the purpose of devising the best means and methods of providing regularity and permanence of employment and satisfactory payment for work done.  Deputy Magennis says it is not possible in all the circumstances to guarantee such permanence and regularity of employment.  On the contrary, I maintain that on the very basis of the philosophy which he has been expounding here&mdash;which I, for one, have no hesitation in admiring, even though it comes from a much earlier age&mdash;every individual according to his needs and according to his wants has a right to a livelihood unless by the conventions of States he is deprived of life or of livelihood for some crime.  If that be so, it must follow that society must provide him with the means of livelihood, and, unfortunate though it may be, or fortunate in the view of other people, the only avenue to a living or to a livelihood that the great majority of people have is through some sort or kind of employment.  I maintain then&mdash;and I think Deputy Magennis, if he comes back to his sources, and not only to his sources but to the modern interpretation of them &mdash;will find that there is an obligation on the State itself to take such means and such measures as will provide for the common well-being of the citizens.  For that reason I hold that there is an obligation on this State to find the ways and means of guaranteeing what is asked for in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that we cannot guarantee.  We can guarantee if the proper methods are taken, and if the proper spirit is shown by those in whose hands largely the power of guarantee lies.  But here, as elsewhere, you have a large section of the people in whose hands that power lies neglecting their first duties, I am not going to say merely as Christians, but their first duty as citizens, because their one aim, their one object, their whole desire in life, is to do nothing but to build up something <Col N="1210" /> for themselves at the expense of other people.  There are riches in the Saorstát, there is wealth in the Saorstat, there is intelligence and there is ability in the Saorstát, there is recuperative power in the Saorstát, but there is a minority in the Saorstát that controls the means of life to a very great extent, and they are not willing, up to the present, to surrender their control in the larger interest of the citizens, unless and except they can gain out of it something which the general body of the citizens cannot gain. Deputy Magennis knows perfectly well why there is distress and conflict between the different classes here as elsewhere. And he knows as well as any of us, that now, above all times, there is a moral obligation on every citizen of the State to make such sacrifices as are necessary for the common interest and the common well being of all citizens of the State. No one in this Dáil will deny that the general body of workers, whatever their faults may be, and they may have faults as individuals, and faults, perhaps, as a collective body, they have not hesitated to give more than what is their right, and they will not hesitate to make such arrangements, and to make such sacrifices and to bear such suffering as may be necessary. On the other hand they see those who control their very lives not getting appreciably poorer, not divesting themselves of any of the better things of life, but on the contrary, making use of much of the wealth that the workers themselves have helped to create and to contribute to, giving themselves a better time and an easier mode of locomotion, and a finer and an easier living and livelihood. Further, we find them if threatened with sufferings or with sacrifices a little bit out of the common with something that they and their fathers were not faced with, until within the last few years, threatening, and in many cases carrying out their threats, to clear out of the country from which they have drawn all their sustenance, threatening and carrying out, the threats that if the workmen will not choose to accept just what they give, then they will close down their establishments and throw the workmen on the mercy of the State. Against this there is no practicable proposition, there is no practicable conclusion to be drawn except the conclusion that Deputy Johnson has drawn, and that <Col N="1211" /> is that it is the duty not only of the body of the citizens, not only of every section of the citizens, but of the State, as the expression in a certain form of the whole body of the citizens to find a way and a means to guarantee what Deputy Johnson's motion has asked.</P>

      <P>I have been interested in listening to the debate.  Some of the debate was on a very learned plane. Some of the Deputies went to lengths that I am unable to reach.  When I speak on this matter I will content myself with very plain words.  I will come down to facts as close as I can to what is actually in existence.  We are told that the cause of this discontent is the fear of unemployment.  I do not believe that for a moment.  There is no evidence of that.  None whatever.  Is it the fear of unemployment that has caused the present strike, the present holding up of traffic in the city of Dublin and at the ports in the Saorstát?  There is a huge strike on in the County Waterford.  Is it the fear of unemployment that has been the cause of that?  In what form has it led to it?  Is it the fear of unemployment that was the cause of several strikes and several dislocations of trade all over the country, that has put an end to the little industries that were creeping up or were extending at the time?  These little industrial concerns were started up and down the country, some of them in my own county, and what has put an end to them?  Demands were made that the people who put up the strike knew could not be met out of the business.  Still the strike was put up.  The industries were closed.  They are closed yet, and will never be opened.  Was it the fear of unemployment did all this?  Was it the fear of unemployment brought about all this dislocation of trade?  Is there any such case that has really happened in which anybody can put his finger down and really say it was the fear of unemployment that caused such and such a strike?  Can anybody point to a single strike that was caused by unemployment? Now, is it permanence of employment for which the demand is made?  Or is it a demand for a permanence of wage for adequate work or a fair return?  I have heard a good deal of this permanence of work.  I believe it is not permanence of work at all that is required. I believe it is a permanence of wage, a <Col N="1212" /> permanence of a certain amount of money each week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not come to the farmers at all.  I will confine myself to the city.  Is the amount of work done at the Trinity College Corner below in Nassau Street a return for the wage that has been expended on it?  Is that an example there in one of the principal streets and throughfares of our city of what would be given for a wage?  I would like to know the figure of the amount of money that has been expended on that job down there.  I would like to know the number of square feet that are in the whole job.  I would like to know how much it has grown from day to day.</P>
      <P>There is no use talking about work if it only means shamming at work.  I mean work as understood by a certain section of the people in this country.  I have great sympathy with Deputy Johnson if he means a wage for work, and I am prepared to go a long way to meet him; but I have no sympathy with him if he means a wage for little or no work at all for, practically speaking, shamming work.  I have no objection to a guarantee of a wage if we get a guarantee of work or an adequate return for that wage. There will be no necessity for the State to take up this matter any more than the Government of any country, if there is a fair guarantee that work will be done. There would be no necessity for State interference if work is given for the wage that is paid.  Any man knows, no matter what he says here in the Dáil, or outside, that if we could get a guarantee of self-reliance, and a guarantee of effort, it would be very easy to guarantee a wage, for the wage would come automatically. What do we find all this demand for a guarantee of work amounts to, as we see it in practice?  I mentioned Trinity College corner as one instance. I could take you to several other corners, but I cannot take you to very many corners in Dublin where building is being carried on.  Why?</P>

      <P>The man who wants <Col N="1213" /> work and who is willing to work can always get work.  A great deal has been said about the men engaged in the building trades.  Why is this question raised about the building trades?  Why were we not given the causes of the trouble in those trades when this particular strike was mentioned?  Why were we not told about the transport trade?  We are told about permanency of work in the building trade.  We have as much raw material in this country as in any other country in the world, and it is as near to our doors and nearer, in fact, than in any other country.  Yet, we cannot carry on the building trade.  We have rock, brick, lime, sand, mortar, cement and timber; we have everything in the matter of raw material.  Why then can we not carry on the building trade as well as any other country is carrying it on?  Why have our cities not grown?  Why have the slums not been replaced by good houses, and why are our suburbs neglected?  In any other country in which one travels one can see houses being erected around every city and town. Where will you see one around Dublin? All you can see are three or four houses at Blackrock, and whether they were built by State aid or by private enterprise I cannot say, but I am surprised that even those houses were erected. What is wrong?  We have all the raw material we require.  There is something lacking, some big essential lacking. Building trades cannot go ahead here, but they can elsewhere.  The answer is&mdash; it is not a paying proposition, and it is absolutely impossible.  Our business men and our contractors are ready to go ahead and invest money at a small profit, or on the chance of even getting back their own money.  Why are they not engaged in these enterprises?  It is because they know that not even their money will come back, and they know that it is a dead loss to engage in the building trade. In another discussion on the building trades, assertions were made from these benches, and they were not denied even by professional men&mdash;men engaged in the very trades referred to.  It cannot be said we have not a market for houses in Dublin, and that houses are not needed in the city.  Houses cost more in Dublin than in any other city that I am acquainted with.  In any town or city in England house building will not be so costly as in Dublin.  Here you are asked <Col N="1214" /> £1,000 or £2,000 more for a house than anywhere else.  The market for houses in Dublin is the finest in the world, and yet houses cannot be erected here.</P>
      <P>Labour will be doing us a very good turn if they would help us to find out the disease in the building trade, and they would be doing us a much better turn still if they helped us to cure it, or if they help to apply the medicine for that disease, medicine which would help the State to cure it or help the State to apply the medicine.  Something is wrong in the building trade.  Most of us know what is wrong, and I am sure the Labour leaders know what is wrong too.</P>

      <P>It is very well to say that the State should step in and guarantee comfort and decency to every member of the human family, to every cog in the human machine, but are all these cogs of the human wheel ready to fall into their places and to do their share?  If they were prepared to do that, and say that, then we would be on the right road, and we would not be talking this clap-trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If employment is guaranteed Deputy Johnson tells us he will do his best to do the rest.  Is he able to do the rest?  I am sure that Deputy Johnson is sincere in the promise that he has made that he will do his best, but is he able to deliver the goods?  Has his end of the machine been brought up to that pitch that they recognise that self-reliance and effort should be contributed on their part, and does he think that he can guide all his cogs into their places, and make them do their part?  I give him credit for being sincere in this and wishing to do it if he could, but the question is, can he?  There is another aspect of this case.  If everything is right in the building trade; if, as I submit, and as everybody must admit, we have all the raw materials and still no buildings can be carried on; something must be wrong.  Is it at the source of production of the raw materials? Are these raw materials too dear? Do they come to the building trade too dear?  Are the men who are engaged in the production of the raw materials paid too much, or must they produce the raw materials at a less cost so as to enable the building trade of Dublin to carry on? Is it the position that the people engaged in the production of raw materials, quarried stone, bricks, cement and so on, <Col N="1215" /> must work for less and produce more? That is, perhaps, a way of answering the question.  I do not think that the answer would be found there, but it is one way of answering the question.  Are we to be asked for a guarantee of employment that will not pay for itself?  Is that the proposition; that will not give a sufficient return to pay for itself?  Who is going to pay for it if it does not pay for itself? The people of this country, the people who produce, the people who work, and when we talk about the wealth of this country we mean only the wealth that comes from production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the wealth we have.  If some of the people who produce have to subsidise other people who produce them, I do not think we would be acting quite fairly; we are not giving a better return to the man who produced more than to the man who produced less. We are not giving a man a return for his efforts or for his work.  The reason that so many men can go slow in this country and need not do their full share is because a certain section is doing more than its share, and is carrying the rest on its back, and because people in the agricultural districts have not been getting a fair return for their work, men who can afford to be idle at the expense of the small farmers who have put in an intensive effort and who have never had a return for it; not the man who is paid a wage and is only paid on chances, who, with his family work hard from day's end to day's end.  Other people are living on this toil for which he never got a return, but I think he going to get a return for it, and the sooner people make up their minds to that the better.  If you are looking for a man who worked to subsidise another man who will not work I warn you that you are not likely to find him and you are less likely to find him in the future, and we, who represent the people, will try to educate them to that, and try to guarantee that they get a full return for every effort they put up.</P>

      <P>I mean the human machine, this particular big wheel of the machine.  If all those cogs are ready to fall into their places and do their duty automatically, then, I think, we shall have arrived at a very happy stage. Have we arrived at that stage?  Before we ask for guarantees we ought to try to arrive at that stage.  We ought to give some guarantee that we are on the road, at least, even if we had not started.  We ought to see some indications that people are prepared to give an effort and are prepared to work.  We ought to have some real indications of that, and that they mean to work.  If they do not mean to work there is no use talking about guarantees.  The time is not ripe for guarantees.  Deputy O'Shannon says that a section of the community neglects to do its duty.  I agree, but I say that, perhaps, more than one section neglects to do so.  It may be that a few other sections that he has not mentioned, have neglected their duty also.  Until all sections in this country are prepared to do their duty, fit into their places, and pull their weight we have no use talking about guarantees.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this motion, and I may say that I was very pleased to hear the remarks that Deputy Magennis has made on the matter. Deputy Gorey also, I may say, interested me.  He usually does when he starts talking about things of which, I beg to suggest, he has very little knowledge indeed.  There is one thing that he said with which I agree, and I am very glad that he admitted it; that was when he stated that a number of us have been talking clap-trap, and, I presume, he has included himself in the lot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>He made a statement to the effect that it should be no more necessary for the State to interfere in a matter of this kind in this country than in any other country.  I submit that the fact that he made this statement proves that he knows very little about conditions <Col N="1217" /> in other countries; that the fact, if it is a fact, that other countries do not interfere in a matter of this kind, is no proof at all that their interference is not necessary. As a matter of fact, anybody who has studied the conditions of the workers, and social conditions generally, through out the world, must recognise that it is necessary for somebody, if not the State, to interfere in other countries to do what Deputy Johnson is asking that we should do here.  Deputy Gorey also wants to know if it were permanence of work or permanence of wage that the workers wanted, and he implied that it was permanence of wage.  I submit that Deputy Gorey is judging wage-earners by his own class.  He is trying to imagine that they want to get what he has been wanting to get and perhaps give as little return as he has been wanting to give.</P>
      <P>Again, to show his lack of knowledge on the subject he instanced the corner at Trinity College, and he questioned if good value has been given for the wages earned on it, and then he says he would like to know what is the cost of the job. I think it is altogether unfair to start denouncing these men.  I do not know them, and I have no personal interest in them.  He denounced these men for being slackers, and in the same breath he admits that he does not know what the job costs.  He shows just as much ignorance in this matter as he did on other matters.</P>

      <P>He asked then was it right that the people who work in this country and do useful work should subsidise people who do not want to do useful work, and he said if there were people in the past willing to do such things, and to subsidise loafers they would not get them in the future.  I think as regards the Land Bill that there were some people willing to subsidise other people.  As a matter of fact, I was under the impression that there is a certain percentage, 10 per cent., I think, of the total cost of the land that would be bought from the landlords, that will be paid by the people of Ireland generally, and not only by the farming section which will benefit by this. <Col N="1218" /> I submit it is not consistent for Deputy Gorey to be willing to accept a subsidy in order to enable unpurchased tenants to purchase their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor are we.  And at the same time he denounces the provision of a subsidy for another section of the community to enable them to earn a bare subsistence in this world.  Deputy Gorey mentioned unemployment, and he mentioned disputes in Dublin and Waterford. He questioned if it was the fear of unemployment that caused these disputes. It may not be directly the cause of the disputes in Waterford and Dublin, but in Dublin, at any rate, it is a fact that the dockers who are involved in the dispute, as well as the dockers in other ports, are always subject to long periods of unemployment.  This has made them desirous of retaining the daily wage they already possess.  If these men were granted a wage which would give them a decent existence, and if they got that wage week after week the fifty-two weeks of the year I do not think they would be unwilling to give a decent return for that, and I think there would be very few disputes in the docks in Dublin or elsewhere.  He also mentioned that many little industries had been attempted to be started throughout the country that were destroyed by industrial disputes If my memory is correct, I think, on a previous occasion when a similar matter was being discussed, Deputy Gorey made a similar statement, and Deputy Johnson asked him to name the particular industries in Ireland that had been destroyed by trade disputes.  On that occasion Deputy Gorey did not name these industries. Before he makes a statement like that I would like if he would give us these facts.  I hope the Dáil will pass this resolution.  I was an employee at one time in the building trade for twelve or thirteen years.  I know the men in the building trade are not half as bad as Deputy Gorey would lead us to believe I have often heard it said when comment was made on the bent shape of men in the building trades that they had worked themselves into S hooks to keep sufficiently in the good graces of their employers, and to keep their jobs.  I can assure the Dáil that up to four and a half years ago, when I was employed in <Col N="1219" /> the building trade, that there was no employee of a building contractor in Dublin, or in any part of Ireland, who had an easy time.  Deputy Gorey's references on a few other occasions, as well as to-day, was trying to give the impression that the reason why houses were not built was because labour in the building trade was so dear.  I happened to be a member of the Departmental Committee on the Rent Restriction Act. Some of the evidence given to that Committee showed that everyone was not agreed that it was the high cost of building that was responsible for the present shortage of houses.  In fact, two or three witnesses stated very definitely that building had ceased in a sense long before the European war.  Some of them stated, and I also saw it stated in some trade papers recently, that it was the Finance Act of 1908, that was responsible for the lack of building, or for preventing the building of houses by those who prior to 1908 had been building and selling houses at a profit.  I do not claim to know much about that Act, but I understand that it was because of the number of forms that had to be filled up to show the value of houses erected and the rest of the red tapeism that was in the Act, that put a check upon building, and that was six years or so before the beginning of the European war, a long time before there were any disputes of an extensive kind in the building trades.  There had not been a dispute in the building trade except once twelve years previous to that. I have pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Johnson, in putting this resolution to the Dáil, does so in the best interests of the State, and I take it his intentions are of the best, and the one helpful thing, I think, about his whole speech was that he spoken of the future, trying to leave the past to forgetfulness.  I think that if we are to have that mutual co-operation which is essential to the peaceful development of industry and commerce, undoubtedly, we must forget a good deal of what has passed, and direct our attention to the future.  As late as yesterday we had in a certain town in the South of Ireland what might be termed an industrial conference.  There were present at the conference representatives of Labour in the particular industry and representatives of the Board of Directors. <Col N="1220" /> In going down to preside at that conference, and knowing the position which each side had taken up, two of us had very little hope of ultimate success. For ten hours we tried to hammer out some form of agreement, and during the whole conference I found that whenever the tendency manifested itself on either side to get back to the past, things were getting pretty hopeless. I appealed to both sides to forget the past, and to look to the future. The result was that after ten and a half hours, we arrived at a conclusion which I think the future will prove to be satisfactory and to make for the peaceful development of at any rate one Irish industry on a very large scale.  The management of the Industry felt quite certain that though in the past they had been able to employ only from 60 to 70 men all told the result of yesterday's conference would enable them to employ within a couple of years from 600 to 800 men.  It was an industrial conference, with the past as far as possible obliterated, and with mutual goodwill.  I must bear testimony to that&mdash;mutual goodwill on the side of both parties and a successful conclusion arrived at.  I would point out that the conferences which Deputy Johnson refers to in this resolution, if they are to be of any use, must depend upon the mutual goodwill of both parties entering into them.  Goodwill and co-operation are necessary for capital and labour if we are to have a peaceful development of industry within the State.  That is essential. Deputy Johnson has assured us that he has no intention that this Dáil should commit itself to a policy which would be a revolution of the present social order. I think that is putting exactly what Deputy Johnson said in moving the resolution that he did not wish to commit the Dáil to a revolution of the present social order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exactly the Deputy's words as the words which I wish to put myself as representing what he did say.  I have hope that with mutual goodwill on the side of both capital and labour schemes of organisation can be <Col N="1221" /> hammered out which will put industry in this country in such a position as to enable it to so develop that it will ultimately absorb all those of the State who are at the present moment find it hard to eke out an existence.  I have hope of that and as far as these conferences of representatives of employers and workers' organisations are concerned, if we have any reasonable hope given us that the parties will enter them with goodwill, I think that the Government would be justified in calling such conferences together.  But there must be reasonable ground for believing that the parties enter them with goodwill. I regret, however, that the resolution in its entirety is not acceptable, because of the very social order which Deputy Johnson admits exists at present.  The resolution simply proposes an ideal state of things.  It would be ideal to have every man guaranteed a means of living, but there is no use in passing resolutions which we cannot carry out.  I would ask Deputy Johnson to accept an amendment of his resolution which I would then very cordially support.  I would ask him to delete &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 2 and &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; in line 3 and to substitute for these words the word &ldquo;have.&rdquo;  If the Deputy will accept the amendment I shall very cordially support the resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests that we should be willing to take the shadow and forfeit the substance, that you may have the hair even without the hide or without the body or the flesh of the beast.  If I had thought of accepting any such resolution as satisfactory I would not have opened the discussion.  The proposition is that we should say that the workers should have regularity and permanence of employment.  Nobody will dissent from that, not one single soul in this country or in any other country. The proposition that I put is that if you want to lay the foundations for peaceful development, for development without the interruption that strikes so often cause then you have to remove the cause of three quarters of those interruptions which, despite Deputy Gorey, has its roots in this fear of hunger and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Dáil that inasmuch as this country is capable of maintaining out of its produce a much larger population <Col N="1222" /> than it at present contains, the first task of the organisers of the industries of this country is to utilise the labour available to increase that production, if necessary, but to distribute that production in return for services rendered.</P>
    <P>This is the proposition I am putting to the Dáil.  It meets Deputy Gorey in the essential point that he made.  If Deputy Gorey had read the motion he would not have made half his speech.  The other half was made simply to show that he desires to create or develop an antagonism between the town workman and the country workman.  The proposition in the motion is that having agreed upon this fundamental requirement then&mdash;it is not that the State should do it unless other people fail to do it&mdash;the State should call into conference the human elements that go to the creation of wealth in order to devise the best means of putting into operation and giving practical effect to this fundamental proposition.  If you say that that is impossible, then, as Deputy Magennis has pointed out, you are denying certain essentials of your faith.  Surely, you are not going to preach that certain things are desirable but certain things are impossible.  You are not going to preach the doctrine that certain things are ideal and can only be reached by angels and that therefore they are of no use to humanity.  I maintain, on the contrary, that this is a practical proposition for human society and for human society in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the anxious state of mind of some of the people living in the Northern counties at the present time.  This matter has been forcibly brought to my notice by people who are near neighbours of mine who, as a matter of fact, live only a couple of miles away <Col N="1223" /> from me.  They are commencing to think that their interests have been neglected and that the Deputies here do not wish to have the Clause of the Treaty dealing with the Boundary put into force.  They think that before now some action should have been taken.  I wish to say, at the outset, that I do not wish to wring from the Government any statement that they do not desire to make.  If they consider that it would be embarrassing to them or hurtful to their policy that any statement should be made, then I do not ask them to take any such course.  But if it is within the power of the President, or any member of the Government, to make a statement which would ease the minds of those people who live in the Six Counties, and particularly in that portion of the Six Counties which hopes to come within the scope and the authority of this Parliament, I would be glad if he would do so.  There is a good deal to be said, perhaps, why a statement on this subject has not been forthcoming up to the present. To my mind, at any rate, the time was not ripe for any such statement.  There is a lot of unrest and dissatisfaction amongst a large section of the people in the North of Ireland as to why this Boundary Commission has been, as they call it, &ldquo;shelved.&rdquo;  A good many statements have been made in the Northern papers, and by the Northern Premier, and it is for the purpose of getting a true statement of the facts put before the country that I bring forward this motion this evening. I understand that Sir James Craig has stated that he is not going to appoint a Commissioner to assist in settling this question.  This Government must have some policy on this question, and I would like that policy to be stated here this evening, if it is possible, in order to allay the fears of a large section of people who are yearning to come in and obtain their rights under the Treaty.  These people feel&mdash;and in my opinion justly feel&mdash;that time is slipping by and that their rights have not been given effect to.  I, therefore, ask that the President, or some member of the Government, should make a statement on this vital matter which will have the effect of allaying the fears of a number of our countrymen in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question I wish to state that the Government is of the opinion that the <Col N="1224" /> opportune moment has arrived to give effect to the remaining provisions of Article 12 of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, to announce that the Government has taken the first step in this direction.</P>
      <P>After very long and mature consideration we have chosen Dr. Eoin MacNeill, Minister for Education as the best person to represent the Saorstát as our Nominee on the Boundary Commission.  Dr. Eoin MacNeill has, I am happy to say, with great public spirit and self-sacrifice, consented to act in this most responsible and arduous capacity, and His Majesty's Government of Great Britain has been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that at this juncture I should briefly re-state the position with regard to the North-Eastern Question.  It is very simple and very clear:</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Treaty the Parliament of Northern Ireland had the choice between two courses.  The first was that Northern Ireland should remain in the Free State, in which case it would maintain the powers conferred upon it by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and also the area allotted to it under that Act, with our willing assent.  Thus in order to secure Unity by the establishment of an All-Ireland Parliament, our plenipotentiaries were ready to leave very large powers in the hands of the Northern Parliament, and to leave under its jurisdiction an area admittedly very much larger than that to which it was entitled on the basis of the wishes of the inhabitants.</P>
      <P>Article 12 provided the second course open to the Northern Parliament.  Let me remind Deputies of the terms of that most important Article.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If, before the expiration of the said month, an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free Stateshall no longer extend to Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have effect subject to the necessary modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting <Col N="1225" /> of three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of the Irish Free State, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland, and one who shall be Chairman, to be appointed by the British Government, shall determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions, the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the Boundary of Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by this Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 7th December last, as we know, the Northern Parliament exercised the undoubted right given it under the first part of this Article of the Treaty and voted itself out of the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>This action of theirs has made inevitable and imperative the carrying out of the remaining provisions of that Article, viz., the establishment of the Boundary Commission.</P>
    <P>Until that Commission reaches a decision in conformity with the terms of reference already quoted, it is plain to every man that it is impossible to say what the area and boundary of the future Northern Ireland, that sprung as it were from the first part of this Article, will be.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, as I have said, essential; &mdash;essential for all parties, for ourselves, for Great Britain, and for Northern Ireland to have the new and actual proportions of the latter area definitely and justly established.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to recall, except in the barest outline, the reasons for this provision, the obvious justice of which was very frankly admitted by the British Signatories to the Treaty.  I need only say that the boundary of Northern Ireland was drawn by the Act of 1920 in a quite arbitrary fashion, not in accordance with the ascertained will of the people concerned, but in such a way as to give a section of this people an extent of territory <Col N="1226" /> wholly out of proportion to their local majority.  That territory includes two whole counties&mdash;Tyrone and Fermanagh&mdash; in which the majority of the population desire union with the rest of Ireland, and other areas, such as parts of Armagh and Down, contiguous to the Free State, the majority of whose inhabitants also desire to be Free State citizens.  The justice of revising the boundary, in such a way as to meet the wishes of the maximum possible number of the inhabitants, and to leave as few discontented citizens as possible on each side of the border, will we believe be evident to all the world.  As said before, our plenipotentiaries were prepared, in the interests of unity, to leave the boundary of Northern Ireland as it stands.  But since the North-East has decided for the present against unity there can be no justice in maintaining a boundary which runs so counter to the desires of large masses of people.  Any division of the country we hold to be deplorable and against the real interests of both sections.  We hope and believe that it will be merely temporary.  But while there has to be division we demand that it should be division on equitable lines and as little hurtful as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that this demand of ours for a redrawing of the boundary is not made in any spirit of hostility towards our Northern fellow-countrymen.  We desire peace and harmony with them, and we believe that peace and good-feeling are essential for all parts of the country. But we cannot possibly ignore the discontent and dissatisfaction of those supporters of the Free State in the North who are kept against their will and wish out of the jurisdiction of the State to which they desire to belong.  We believe that the removal, so far as is possible, of that reason for discontent is necessary in the interests of harmony, and that a satisfactory settlement of this question is one means of creating a better feeling between the inhabitants of all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.15 to 3 o'clock on Monday.</P>
