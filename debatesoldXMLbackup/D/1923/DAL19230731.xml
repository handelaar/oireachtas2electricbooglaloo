      <P>asked the President whether, in view of the bad treatment and low prices received by barley growers last year and its serious effect upon this important industry, he will recommend that an embargo be placed upon imported grain during the coming season or that the State guarantee a price which will secure to the grower a reasonable return for the use of his land.</P>

      <P>The suggestions made by the Deputy are essentially matters affecting the fiscal system of the country and the measures necessary for the development of agriculture, and it would be well, I think, to await the Reports of the two Commissions considering such subjects&mdash;the Fiscal Commission and the Commission on Agriculture&mdash;before coming to any conclusions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been directed to the statements made in the newspapers as to banks in the Saorstát being required to make a return to the Government of dividend warrants cashed for their customers, and whether he will state under what Act such particulars are required and the purposes for which they are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (The President) William T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of misunderstanding appears to have arisen in connection with this matter, and I am obliged to the Deputy for the opportunity he has afforded me of explaining the position.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1918, bankers and other persons in Saorstát Eireann entrusted with the payment of any dividends payable out of any public revenue other than that of Saorstát Eireann or with the payment of any interest, dividends, etc., payable in respect of the stocks, funds, shares or securities of any foreign or colonial company (including a British company), become liable to deduct Saorstát Eireann income tax at 5s. in the £ for 1923-24 and account for such tax to the Revenue.  In the great bulk of these cases British income tax at 4s. 6d. in the £ is already deducted, and the operation of the ordinary law would, therefore, have resulted in a total income tax deduction of 9s. 6d. in the £.  According to a statement made by the writer of &ldquo;Notes from Ulster&rdquo; in the issue of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> of the 26th July, this is actually happening in the case of persons resident in the Six Counties who have investments in Saorstát Eireann companies, that is to say 5s. Saorstát Eireann tax is deducted by the Secretary of the Company in the normal course, and 4s. 6d. British tax is deducted in addition by the Northern bank which cashes the dividend warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst the Finance Act for this year was under consideration it was represented to me that this system would involve grave hardship on taxpayers in the Saorstát in very many cases unless some modification could be adopted, <Col N="1681" /> and Section 10 of the Finance Act was passed to deal with the point.</P>
    <P>This section on the one hand authorises the Revenue Commissioners to make arrangements with the banks relieving them of the liability to deduct Saorstát Eireann tax in such cases, and on the other hand imposes on the banks the obligation to furnish to the Revenue authorities particulars of the cases in which, but for the operation of this section, they would have been obliged to deduct Saorstát tax.  The object of the latter provision is, of course, to secure that the tax due to the Saorstát may be collected by means of direct assessment on the recipient of the dividend.</P>
    <P>The advantages of this arrangement from the point of view of the taxpayer are obvious.  It saves him the inconvenience arising from a deduction of tax which may be far in excess of his liability, and, since the Inspector of Taxes who assesses the dividend will normally have the taxpayer's return before him when the assessment is made, and can, therefore, make the appropriate deductions and allowances, it also relieves the taxpayer in most cases of the necessity for making a repayment claim to the Saorstát Revenue authorities.</P>
    <P>There is no deep-laid scheme underlying the concession.  It is not the fact, as stated in some quarters, that the banks must divulge particulars of their customers' private affairs in general, or that they must furnish details of <i>all</i> dividend warrants cashed.  The section, for example, has no reference whatever to the dividend of a Saorstát Eireann company, since Saorstát tax in such cases is deducted by the Secretary of the Company.  The banks are merely obliged to render particulars of dividends from which they would otherwise have had to deduct tax, and whilst, technically, the section as passed would necessitate the rendering of particulars by the banker in such cases whether he deducts tax or not, the Revenue Commissioners will not, in practice, require the details called for by the section in the case of any taxpayer who prefers that the ordinary provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1918, should be given effect to in his case, and Saorstát tax at 5s. in the £ deducted from his dividends.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to refer to.  It is stated that, in consequence of the income tax arrangements, <Col N="1682" /> many persons are transferring their bank accounts to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  It must be borne in mind that residents in the Saorstát are liable to make returns for assessment by the Saorstát Revenue authorities of all income which has not borne Saorstát tax by deduction at the source.  Where a taxpayer opens a bank account outside the Saorstát, pays into that bank account the proceeds of dividends which have not borne Saorstát tax, and then omits such dividends from his income tax return, the conclusion is almost irresistible that he is deliberately endeavouring to defraud the Revenue of the Saorstát, and thereby shift his own burden on to the shoulders of his fellow-taxpayers. It will be the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to use every effort to bring such persons to book, and to secure the imposition of the maximum penalties which the law prescribes for the punishment of such offences.</P>

      <P>The bread used in Athlone Barracks is baked by the Army.  Until recently the flour used was purchased locally.  It is now being bought from the Dock Milling Company, and is Dublin-milled flour.  The general practice in regard to breadmaking in the Army is to use Irish-milled flour.</P>

      <P>The cutting of thistles on the Curragh Greenlands is still in progress. The work is being carried out by a small permanent staff, none of whom has been dismissed.  The men referred <Col N="1684" /> to by the Deputy in his question as having been discharged were engaged specially by the Office of Works for the work of removing the noxious weeds on the lands under the control of the Ministry of Defence.  On the completion of this work six of the men were discharged, and the remaining three are still employed on another temporary job.  The excessive growth of weeds on these lands this year is due to the absence of cavalry or artillery manoeuvres, which during the British occupation helped considerably in keeping the ground clear.</P>

      <P>I was speaking when we adjourned last evening on Section 27.  Overnight we considered to what extent we could meet the objections by Deputy FitzGibbon, and I am prepared to ask the leave of the Dáil to insert an amendment in Sub-section 1, Section 27, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In line 11, to delete all from and including the words `time shall be' to the end of the sub-section, and to insert in lieu thereof the words `Court may if it is satisfied that justice so requires, extend such time to any date not being later than three months after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>That goes a considerable distance to meet my objection, but I would ask the Minister to consider between this and the next stage whether he would not go a little further and add a proviso: &ldquo;Provided always that this section shall not apply in the case of any land which shall be conveyed or assured <i>bona fide</i> and for valuable consideration.&rdquo; One of the great difficulties that this section has created in my mind is in regard to people who have got&mdash;as I know of my own knowledge some people have&mdash;a statutory title to land, and have paid money for it, and the vendors have gone away with that money.  This section would enable the unfortunate man who paid money for land under a good title to be ejected from that land, and there would be no means of recovering the purchase money he had paid to the person who may have gone away.  I do urge the Minister, now that he has seen that this is not a perfect section, to consider whether he cannot make it very much better than it is by at least protecting those people who have got property for which they have paid good money.  It seems to me that the merest justice requires that people of that kind should be protected.  These people do not seem to fall within the provisions of the amendment that the Minister has already indicated his willingness to introduce.  A simple proviso such as I have read would <Col N="1686" /> meet the case.  Otherwise I am grateful to the Minister for the way he has endeavoured to meet the objections I have put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recollected that one of the first problems that confronted the Provisional Government after its establishment was the matter of organising a police force to take the place in the country of the Royal Irish Constabulary which it was agreed with the British Government would be disbanded. For that end a committee was set up to advise the Government.  That committee having sat for some weeks recommended the formation of a new police force in Saorstát Eireann, excluding the Dublin Metropolitan Police District.  They recommended that the Police Force would be centrally controlled, and responsible to the Executive Government.  That recommendation was accepted and acted upon by the Provisional Government, and a start was made at the organising of the Civic Guard.  This Bill is brought forward with a view to giving the Executive Council Statutory power to raise, train, equip, pay and maintain the Civic Guard, and from time to time to determine within the limits set out in the Schedule the strength of the Force.  Subject to the general regulations to be made by the Minister for Home Affairs, it is proposed to vest in a Commissioner of the Guard general directions and control of the Force.  The Bill provides that the appointment of the Commissioner and the other officers of the Force shall be made by the Executive Council.  As the force is not local, but is an organised National Police Force, it is essential that it should not exist out of the immediate authority of the Executive Council.  A provision that all officers should be appointed by the Executive Council will give a proper constitutional derivation to their authority, and a proper direction to their allegiance.  I want to direct the <Col N="1689" /> attention of Deputies for a moment to Section 4, Sub-section 1 of the Bill.  It reads: &ldquo;The officers of the Civic Guard shall be divided into the several ranks specified in the First Schedule to this Act, and all such officers below the rank of Surgeon shall be appointed, and may at any time be dismissed, by the Executive Council, and may be from time to time promoted or degraded by the Commissioner in accordance with regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>It is felt that to preserve strictly the theory that all Executive power and authority wielded in the country is, in fact, the delegated power and authority of the people, that commissions in this police force should be given by and on behalf of the Executive Council, and it is clear that commissions can be withdrawn only by the body that gives them. In the Executive Council is pooled the Executive authority in the country.  The people delegate to their representatives in the Dáil their own power which in turn is entrusted to a Committee of the Dáil itself which is called the Executive Council.  That Executive Council is a pool of the fountain head of the Executive authority of the country, and that is delegated out on well-defined conditions to individuals.  The Act of withdrawing that Executive authority which is derived from the people must be from the body which delegated it.  Therefore, the commissions to officers in this Force will be held as from the Executive Council, and the Executive Council must perform the Executive act of withdrawing these commissions, if withdrawal is considered necessary.  I want to make this point clear.  You cannot put a man at the head of a force of this kind and expect him to preserve proper discipline, and to attain a high standard of efficiency, and at the same time proceed to undermine his authority or to undermine the discipline of the force.  I want to make it particularly clear to members of the public, and to members of the force itself that the Executive Council will act through well defined channels, and will in fact act on the recommendations of the person who is placed at the head of the force.  It would be a fatal thing if members of the Guard or members of the force were to get any idea into their heads that by personal contact, let us say, with politicians, or otherwise, that they could provide for <Col N="1690" /> themselves a Court of Appeal from disciplinary decisions of their own authorities. That is not the position.  It will be a disciplinary offence if any member of the Guard attempts to secure contact with the Executive Council, or with members of the Executive Council, otherwise than through the recognised channels of seniority and rank.  In a young force it is necessary to stress and to emphasise things that are recognised as being a matter of course amongst older disciplined bodies, and consequently I want to dwell for a moment on that aspect of Section 4 Sub-section (1), that the Executive Council could not entrust to an individual the task of enforcing discipline and of maintaining efficiency of that particular force if his word did not go every time in matters concerning the internal discipline of the Guard.  Therefore, what is maintained under Section 4, Sub-section (1) is that the withdrawal of the delegated authority of the people from any individual, must be an Executive Act, an Act of the Executive Council; but I want to make it clear that the Executive Council will act through well defined channels, and on the recommendation of its responsible official who is placed in charge of that particular force. Members of the force will be required to take a declaration pledging themselves to be faithful in their employment to the Executive Council.  That declaration is set out in the Schedule, and states that they are to render true service and obedience to Saorstát Eireann and its constitutional Government.  The maximum strength of the force is set out in the Schedule.  The maximum estimated strength required is 4,119 ordinary Guards; the statutory maximum is 4,400, leaving a margin of about 200, if it should be considered necessary.  There will be a small Reserve Force maintained in the Depot, a Reserve Force of about 200.</P>
    <P>This force will be there to meet any calls that may be made for extra police from particular areas.  If that number of 200 is kept as a floating number of men returning to the Depot from time to time, gradually in about three or four years the whole force will have passed back through the Depot, and the matter of keeping such a Reserve will not be a waste.  Men who go on Reserve like that in the Depot can be taking special courses, and in any case it is perhaps <Col N="1691" /> to the good that the longest time that any member of the force would be away from his headquarters would be, speaking roughly, about three or four years. If you take it that there is a body of 200 men on Reserve in the Depot for three months, that would be 800 men passing through the Depot in one year, and in four years that would practically cover the entire force.  It might be just as well that policemen would have an opportunity of doing special courses in that way when they are called back to the Reserve.  Section 6 proposes to confer on the Minister for Home Affairs powers to make regulations to govern the general distribution of the Guard throughout the country.  It is at present proposed to occupy 807 stations, but the ultimate scheme of distribution can be fixed only in the light of experience. The number of barracks in the occupation of the R.I.C. on the 1st June, 1914, exclusive of those situated in the Six North-Eastern Counties, was 1,129; the proposed total establishment of the Civic Guard provides for 807 stations. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to go into a comparison of the strength at this stage.  If Deputies were interested I could, in answer to a question, give a comparison of the strength of the Guard with the actual strength of the R.I.C. in the twenty-six counties in 1914.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the rates of pay and allowances and the pension scheme of the Civic Guard should be regulated by orders to be made by the Minister for Home Affairs, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  These orders will require to be laid before the Dáil, and the Pensions Scheme will not become operative unless approved by resolution of the Dáil.  Provision is made in Section 10 for the holding of inquiries and the examination on oath of complaints of neglect or violation of duties which may be preferred against members. Members of the Guard are required to give one month's notice of their intention to resign, unless authorised to do so by a senior officer, and to deliver up, on resignation or dismissal, all clothing, etc., supplied to them.  Provision is made for the creation of representative bodies to enable members of the Guard to bring to the notice of the Commissioner or of the Minister matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, other <Col N="1692" /> than questions of discipline and promotions affecting individuals.  Attempts to cause disaffection amongst members of the Guard or to induce members of the Guard to commit a breach of discipline will be punishable by fine or imprisonment. Unlawful possession of clothing supplied to any member of the Guard will be similarly punished.  In Section 18 there is provision that the costs and charges incurred in respect of the Civic Guard shall be paid by the money provided by the Oireachtas, and provision is made in Sub-section (2) of that section to preserve the existing liability of local bodies under any of the statutes mentioned in the Fourth Schedule in respect of the Food and Drugs Act and the Weights and Measures Act and the conveyance of prisoners and lunatics.  It is proposed in Section 19 to create a Fund, to be called the &ldquo;Civic Guard Reward Fund,&rdquo; for the reward or benefit of the Civic Guard in such manner as may be arranged.  This Fund shall be composed mainly of disciplinary fines imposed on members of the Guard.  It is proposed to repeal the provisions of the Constabulary Acts relating to the organisation or internal administration of the R.I.C. There are very numerous references in other Acts, such as the Summary Jurisdiction Act, to officers and other members of the R.I.C.  The repeal of such Acts is not practicable, and it is accordingly necessary to adapt references of that kind, and that is covered by Section 20.  Section 21 provides for the application of the Bill to the existing force known as the Civic Guard, and for giving retrospective statutory recognition to that force.</P>

      <P>My objection to this Bill is similar in character to the objection to the Military Defence Bill.  The proposition was that there was a necessity for introducing a Bill and passing it to legalise the Civic Guard, and we all agree, I think, that that was necessary. But we did not expect to be asked to consider a detailed scheme for the organisation of a police force for the future.  This Bill purports to make a Constitution for a police force for the country&mdash;a centralised police force&mdash;and we are asked to do that in these last two or three days of a session.  I say that that is not fair.  It is not reasonable, and it ought not to be <Col N="1693" /> proceeded with.  Facilities to legalise the present organisation, to carry it on until there is time to examine a Bill relating to the establishment of a police force, could have been accepted without demur, but I think that this Bill raises quite a number of questions of controversy that would require a good deal of consideration. It cannot have that consideration if we are to deal with the other Bills that are coming forward.  There are questions that might be raised on every one of those points that the Minister has endeavoured to describe, and a good deal of examination and comparison between this Bill and the organisation that is proposed to be set up in this Bill with other police forces, and this is not intended to be a temporary Bill.  It is to be a permanent establishment of a police force. The organisation is set forth.  The whole scheme, penalties, discipline, and the like, are set forth, and we are asked to pass the Second Reading and to pass the Bill into law really without consideration. I do not think that that is carrying out the intention of what was more or less a general agreement that non-contentious or formal measures could be passed, and that certain steps would be taken to legalise the existing institutions.  This is not merely legalising the present Civic Guard, but it is formulating a Constitution for the Civic Guard and making it a permanent force, without giving us an opportunity to examine and criticise the measure.  We have in Section 14, for instance, a scheme which has only just been imposed on the London Metropolitan Police, and we do not know how it is working out.  We cannot tell whether it is satisfactory, or leading to a better disciplined and more efficient police force.  But it is being put upon us here, and upon this Force, whether we like it or not.  This question of a Reward Fund, practically in its essence is an encouragement to over-officiousness.  I do not think that it is a desirable clause to put into a Bill, and I do not think it is at all a satisfactory method of encouraging the proper observance of duties to reward officers for extra zeal in finding out petty offenders.  These references to the membership of various kinds of societies and organisations, too, I think would require some examination.  One need not be accused of trying to make a police force a political body, when one objects to the decitizenising of policemen; and to impose <Col N="1694" /> upon a policeman the obligation that he will not belong to any political society or subscribe to any political society whatsoever, is, I think, going too far in the de-grading of a citizen once he becomes a policeman.  A political society would have to be defined, and subscribing to a political society may mean agreement with a political society.  It does not follow that the word &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; means to subscribe money.  The whole Bill would require examination, and I submit that it is going beyond the promise that only non-contentious measures would be submitted and required to be passed before the Dissolution.  I think that it is not beyond the capacity of the draftsmen at the disposal of the Government to introduce a Bill which would say that the present Civic Guard, and its present establishment, is legalised, and that, pending the enactment of a measure drawing up the Constitution of such a police force, the present force would have legal authority and legal sanction.  It seems to me that it is unnecessary in any way to go into all these details as to the future composition of a police force.  I object to the attempt to force us into passing a permanent Bill without an opportunity for proper examination.</P>

      <P>Strong as was the case for a temporary Bill for the Army, the case for a temporary Bill for the Civic Guard is much stronger.  Deputy Johnson has shown quite conclusively that the measure before us is a controversial measure; at least, in several of the sections it raises issues that are of a most controversial nature.  Not only that, but there is the argument, somewhat analogous to the point made on the Army Bill by Deputy FitzGibbon, that it is quite allowable that there should be different conceptions of the nature of a permanent police force in Ireland.  This provides for one kind of police force.  The strength of arguments may be in favour of that particular kind, that is a strongly centralised police force, at this moment, and until such time as things in Ireland become somewhat normal, but undoubtedly, if we were in normal time there would be a great strength of feeling in favour of a different and, perhaps, more localised police force. That is not possible under this Bill.  Deputy Johnson has mentioned some of the points that are controversial, and <Col N="1695" /> some of the things that require definition. There are one or two others which I will refer to briefly.  One is in the Second Schedule, the form of declaration to be taken by the Guards.  It is very elaborate, much more elaborate and much more inclusive, I think, than the oath to be taken by soldiers or officers in the army, but at the end of it there is this declaration:&mdash;&ldquo;And I will not while I hold the said office join, belong, or subscribe to any political society whatsoever, or to any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo;  I put it to the Dáil that it is equally necessary that there should be a definition of what a secret society is, as that there should be a definition of what a political society is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take it, for instance, that under these are included such bodies as, let us say, the A.O.H., the Masonic Order, the I.R.B., and various other organisations of that type?  From time to time bodies of that kind have been popular, and have been sometimes politically described as secret societies. Other organisations might conceivably come under the definition.  Take purely friendly societies of various kinds whose membership is not known publicly, and on which there is no legal obligation to declare their membership, are these, or are they not, to be included under this very wide heading of secret societies? It would require to be defined.  There is another point in Section 11 which, I think, would require some consideration. &ldquo;No member of the Civic Guard below the rank of Chief Superintendent shall be at liberty to resign his membership, or to withdraw himself from his duties as such member unless authorised so to do in writing by the Chief Superintendent of the Area in which he may for the time being be stationed.&rdquo;  These are points which undoubtedly, if time permitted, would raise a good deal of discussion and clarification, and perhaps if we could give them the time necessary, would receive amendment in Committee.  I do not think it is at all possible to do that within the two or three days that remain to us, and having regard to the measures that have come before the Dáil, but I do put it, with Deputy Johnson, that the least the Minister could do, would be to make it a purely temporary measure, and even making it a temporary measure will not remove it from the <Col N="1696" /> sphere of controversy, because there are some sections in it which can only be reluctantly agreed to in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I realise the force of the objections urged by the Deputy that there is scarcely time to give the Bill regulating the future of the police of the country the consideration that it deserves.  At the same time, I feel that there are very few of the 23 Sections of this Bill that any considerable contention could arise about.  There are some.  Some have been mentioned by the two Deputies who have spoken, but I would ask them to accept as a suggestion that the operations of the Bill be limited to twelve months, and that would give the next Dáil ample time to go very fully into the whole matter.  I would urge twelve months rather than six months, because to confine the lifetime of this Bill to six months might involve the matter being considered under pressure by the next Parliament.  At least one month will go practically from the time of the dissolution of this Parliament until the meeting of the next.  That would mean that a six months' lifetime would bind the next Parliament to the consideration of this whole question inside the first five months of its existence.  I would ask the Deputy to agree to an alteration limiting the operations of the Bill to twelve months, and leaving the matter of the permanent consideration of this question to the next Parliament.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the suggestion that there be a limitation of the Bill and the arguments that have been adduced in favour of it, which arguments have been accepted by the Minister&mdash; that twelve months would be a better period than six months&mdash;and for a reason that came forcibly before my mind in looking at the Fifth Schedule, because the Fifth Schedule sets out a series of the Acts which are to be repealed in whole or in part.  There are some of them that are entirely repealed, and there are some of them that are only preserved in so far as one or two sections are concerned.  I presume if a final enactment were to be drafted the procedure adopted in many places would lend itself to careful consideration&mdash; whether the new enactment should not repeal all existing legislation and be the <Col N="1697" /> document from which the future would date.  In that case, if all these had to be gathered together and framed into an entirely new statute, there is no question about it that six months would be too short a time; it would be a complicated business.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to the suggestion that this be regarded as a temporary measure, and that its being so regarded should be registered in the section.  I do urge, for the reasons he has stated, in addition to the one I have now mentioned, that twelve months would be a more satisfactory period than six months.</P>

      <P>I was going to move an amendment that this Act should expire at the end of six months.  I realise that there is some force in the argument in favour of a longer period of trial.  I am prepared to agree to a twelve months period on an understanding, so far as this Dáil can come to an understanding of the kind.  I realise that it is almost futile, certainly not very valuable, for a member here now, or a Minister there now, to pledge the future.  Nevertheless, I think that, so far as the members who are here to-day can make any promise in regard to these Acts that we are passing as temporary Acts, there should be an understanding that they shall not be included in some Expiring Laws Continuance Act, but that they will as a matter of fact, expire and new legislation be introduced. There is always a danger that the Schedule might be attached to a certain Bill, and it would be called number so and so of the year 1923, and this Act is continued. Nobody knows what it is about without very close research.  I want to make clear, so far as it is possible, that these Acts will, as a matter of fact, expire, and that new legislation will be introduced to deal with the subject, that they will go through the regular process of introduction, Second Reading and Committee examination.</P>

      <P>On this schedule I want to ask the Minister whether the last three lines, &ldquo;I do not now belong, and I will not while I hold the said office join, belong, or subscribe to any political society whatsoever, or to any secret society whatsoever,&rdquo; are essential at this stage, and whether the declaration would not be quite strong enough without them. I was going to raise the point as to the terms of employment or rather the relations between the Civic Guard and the State through the Ard-Chomhairle.  But I am told that at least in the definition we have been using that that means the Chief Council.  If that is so I take it that it means the Executive Council, and that being so, I think it is satisfactory.  With regard to the last three lines, even for the first twelve months, these three lines are not necessary and may rather create friction than smooth matters over.  The whole position of the citizen who is a policeman can be considered anew under the new legislation.</P>

      <P>I feel myself, if this provision were not embodied in the declaration, that it would have to be dealt with by some disciplinary regulation. Deputies will understand at once the extreme inadvisibility and extreme unwisdom of allowing members of the police force which is instituted to serve and protect the people impartially and impersonally from becoming associated with <Col N="1702" /> partisan politics of any brand while in their office, and as to the secret society aspect of the thing, it is clearly impossible to allow the servants of the State, the servants of the people, to join an organisation of the commitments of which we naturally and necessarily are unaware. These commitments may or may not conflict with the duties attached to the office; they may, or they may not, undermine the discipline of the Force, but what I submit is it is not a thing you can afford to have any doubt about whatever.  You are entitled to say to the people serving you in an individual capacity that, &ldquo;You must not join any society, or undertake any obligation of which we are unaware, and which may, for all the knowledge we possess, conflict, and conflict very radically, with the proper discharge of your duty.&rdquo;  That is the view of the matter I take, and I feel that if this were not dealt with specifically and explicitly in the form of declaration members take it would have to be dealt with very specifically in disciplinary regulations.</P>
      <P>But I think it is not too much to ask of an individual, coming into the service of the people in this capacity, that he should strip himself of an association of that kind, and that he should agree to stand aloof during his period of service free from partisan, political associations, and that he will agree also not to go into a society which may have commitments, and which at any rate will have commitments, that in the very nature of the case cannot be known to his employers&mdash; the people.  It is upon these grounds that I thought it wise to insert this provision in the declaration, and submit it to the Dáil.  If a strong view were expressed here&mdash;and when I say a strong, I mean strong in emphasis and strong numerically&mdash;for the deletion of these last lines, well, there is no use in my pretending that I would not be forced by that to take another view of the matter, but if that provision were to go out of the declaration it would have to come in in disciplinary regulations, I would consider that the position of the head of a police force would be impossible if its members were free to join political organisations, or to go into secret societies which would have commitments of which he would have no definite knowledge.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to <Col N="1703" /> make it possible or to encourage Civic Guards or any other public servants to join secret societies.  I am in the happy position of not knowing anything about secret societies, and I have often smiled when I have been approached by opponents of one secret society, telling me all about the enormities and the evil things of such a secret society, what tremendous power it has over this body and over that Government; and then I hear from another side about the tremendous power and influence of the opposite secret society. We are used to hearing about the Catholic Orangemen and the Orange Hibernians, and I think the same charges are made by secret societies of one kind against secret societies of the opposite persuasion, and most of them have political or religious persuasions.  I am glad I know nothing about them; but I think that the reference here in the declaration to political societies is an unfortunate thing to put into a Bill, and in such vague phraseology it may easily cause a good deal of trouble.  I do not believe in the attempt to prevent a Civic Guard having an opinion on public matters and of approving of the action of other people on public matters.  That is practically what this prohibition would mean.  It would mean, for instance, that a man could not subscribe to a society having for its object the abolition of capital punishment, because the object of that society is a political object, and might easily be construed into being a political object.  It could only be accomplished by a political act.  There are hundreds of causes which might be dealt with by political societies &mdash;societies having a political objective, and confining that political objective to one subject; and this clause is so framed as to make it impossible for a citizen who is a policeman to support or to belong to any such society.  A regulation made by the Commissioner to prohibit active participation in partly political propaganda, or something of that kind, might be desirable, but it would require care in the working out, and this has not that care, and hence I think the last two lines ought to be deleted.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister can see that the extent to which the term &ldquo;political&rdquo; can be stressed is so wide that the Civic Guard would be deprived of a great number of not only the <Col N="1704" /> ordinary citizen's rights, but even an ordinary person's rights.  The term could be applied to cultural associations. Some of these cultural associations might endeavour, either locally or nationally, to further their object by some kind of political action.  Take, for instance, an association like the Gaelic League or an association for the study of the Irish language or literature; or take another, the Gaelic Athletic Association, which is for the promotion of national games.  Now, it does not require any great stretch of imagination at all to describe some of these organisations as in some measure political in their object.  No doubt they are composed of people of all parties and of people who belong to no parties in the accepted sense, but to some extent their object is, I think, political in a good and decent sense, or else some of the steps that some of them advocate to promote their object are political.  You could take another which, at the moment, threatens to be decidedly political.  I refer to certain temperance organisations.  I wonder would the Minister regard these as political?  I hardly think he would because he has given particular directions to the Civic Guard for the legal enforcement of certain measures of temperance; but the temperance people are undoubtedly, and will undoubtedly be, attempting to influence the decisions of the next Parliament by putting certain questions to candidates for the coming elections.  If a Civic Guard man is a prohibitionist or a keen teetotaller, or if he were, for instance, a Pioneer, it might be construed that he belonged to a political organisation because that organisation was endeavouring to further its objects by political means.  The words there in the declaration are so vague that they could be easily applied to all these and to many similar organisations and to associations with purely non-party objects.  I think the Minister will see that the words in the declaration go too far.</P>

      <P>I was really surprised listening to the speeches of the last two speakers.  At least, I would be surprised if I thought they were serious, but I cannot believe that they were serious. I cannot believe, for instance, that Deputy O'Shannon was serious when he said it would take no great stretch of the imagination to regard a Temperance Society as a political organisation.  I <Col N="1705" /> suppose it depends a good deal whether you belong to a Temperance Society or not, to have that particular stretch of imagination.  The same Deputy made some suggestion with regard to the Gaelic League, which has hitherto been regarded as a non-political organisation, and the same applies to the Gaelic Athletic Association.  So that we are not going to have politics introduced into this organisation.  But I wonder do the Deputies who are opposing this realise the possibilities that might arise if Civic Guards were allowed to become active politicians, which this is tantamount to. We could imagine every barrack becoming a hotbed of politics.  We could imagine every barrack consisting of a series of henchmen of some political organisation, where there would be no possibility of toleration, of freedom of speech, for the section of the community which did not agree with the politics of that particular Civic Guard barrack.  I think that there is absolutely no argument, no logic, no reason, and no wisdom behind the idea that this should be deleted.  I think the argument, in logic, in reason, and in wisdom, is all on the other side, and I think it would be a very grave error for the Government to allow a body of public servants, whose outstanding duty it is to maintain the peace, to become associated with one section of politics or another.  How would Deputies who represent Labour like to have a Civic Guard barracks the entire members of which were vehement adherents of Deputy Gorey?  How would Deputy Gorey like to have in his vicinity, or in his constituency, a series of Civic Guard barracks the occupants of which were vehement supporters of the Labour Party?  How would either of these Parties like to have in their vicinity a Civic Guard barracks the occupants of which were vehement supporters of the only sane Party in the State, the Party sitting here?  If we are debarred from this idea of keeping the Civic Guard, the custodians of the public peace, entirely clear of politics and aloof from all sectionalism or the various intricacies of politics, we are inflicting not only a grave injury upon the conception of what citizenship is, but also we are guilty, I think, of one of the most serious errors that we could possibly fall into in evolving a body of police who will do their duty equally to all citizens within the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Milroy has missed the point.  It is not an uncommon complaint.  There was no suggestion even of allowing Civic Guard barracks to be hotbeds of political partisanship. Even the insertion of this will not prevent that.  You are not going to prevent men talking politics because you do not allow them to join a political society.  It is not the act of joining a society which makes a man a politician. He is generally a politician first.  The point of the objection to this is that it is too vague, and that it will not accomplish the object that Deputy Milroy seeks, but it may prevent men attaching themselves to organisations which have been frequently classed as political societies.  Deputy Milroy spoke of the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I have only to refer you to the files of the <i>Belfast News-Letter,</i> the <i>Northern Whig</i>, the <i>Morning Post</i>, and probably the <i>Irish Times,</i> and even the Belfast Government's official pronouncements, to show that these are political societies.  It is conceivable that even in the next twelve months some new aspirant for membership of the Dáil may become Minister for Home Affairs and may decide that these are political societies.  My objection to this is that it is too vague, that it is not going to accomplish the purpose sought for, and it will prevent legitimate exercise of civic rights.</P>

      <P>Or amend, or repeal some law.  I think the case for excluding members of the police force from participation in political activity lies in the fact that, for one thing, they have to serve, and serve with the same discipline and the same efficiency, succeeding Governments and, for another thing, they have the duty, more than other persons in the State, of seeing that the law is obeyed.  Whether they like it or not, whether they think that a particular law ought to be repealed or not, that happens <Col N="1707" /> to be their duty, the thing for which they are paid, and I do not think the undesirability of members of a police force participating in political activity needs to be stressed.  It was suggested that the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association might be held to come under that head.  Well, in point of fact, I do not think that the Deputies who urged that considered it a possibility.</P>

      <P>The Civic Guard have been taking part freely, with the full consent of the Government and of their Commissioner, in Gaelic Athletic activities, and I am glad to say are almost foremost in their eagerness to learn the national language.  These are not political societies, and I think that the words are not vague, and are not likely to be misunderstood by anyone.  If a case of honest doubt arises it can, no doubt, be resolved by consulting the Commissioner, or by the Commissioner consulting the Ministry for Home Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but on the question of what is and what is not a political society.  If a Civic Guard has any qualms of conscience about joining the Gaelic League, he will, no doubt, ask whether the declaration he has made excludes him, and similarly with the Gaelic Athletic Association.  It is impossible to say, in any cast-iron way, what is a political society.  Political societies, as Deputies know, come and go, and one set may exist to-day and another to-morrow, but the general sense is clear, that the object of those few lines is to exclude members of the police force from joining political organisations or secret societies.  I think the mass sense of the citizens would heartily endorse that provision, and I see no case for changing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation is that the Minister wants us to enact phraseology which will vulgarise the term politics.  It is commonly conceived as being a dirty game.  I was hopeful that the Dáil would rather take the view that it is a noble game, if it is a game at all, and that it can be clean, healthy and noble, but when we are asked to assume <Col N="1708" /> that a political society must be a society whose purpose is to put in Governments and to put out Governments, that is asking us to conceive politics as something merely sordid and ignoble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>Just one other point, and it disposes altogether of the Minister's exclusion from politics of certain organisations.  Take the Gaelic League.  I am sure that the objects of the Gaelic League are as highly political as the objects of any political organisation inside or outside of this country, and have been so for a number of years.  Not only that, but it is quite a likely thing, I believe, that locally the Gaelic League may, quite properly, take steps to put certain candidates into certain bodies and, further&mdash;I think, only yesterday&mdash; that Deputies received a letter from the Gaelic League, which came to a political decision with reference to the new judiciary system.  All these are in the proper sense of the word political acts and the organisation is, in the best sense of the word, a political society, and the words as they are included in the declaration, if we couple with them the conception the Minister has just given expression to, and his intention to deal perhaps widely or generously with the claims of conscientious individual Civic Guardsman, show that it is his idea that it would be within the power of the Chief Commissioner, or whoever is in charge of the Civic Guards, to say, that such and such is a political society, within the meaning of the Act, and that such and such an organisation is not a political society within the meaning of the Act. The words in the Bill are &ldquo;subscribe to any political society,&rdquo; and if you leave the interpretation of all that to the Minister <Col N="1709" /> or Chief Commissioner you will find you have gone very far away from the spirit that ought to animate this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes I want to repeat my objection to the passing of the Bill even for a period of twelve months, a Bill which embodies so long and detailed a scheme of organisation for the Army and the establishment of relations between the officers and men, Headquarters and the men, which I think whatever the intention, whatever the spirit may be in which they will be carried out, leave possibilities of abuse and the fixing of distinctions of caste. I have expressed my general objections to the Bill, and I do not want to go into details to any extent, but I want before it passes to say again that the passing of a Bill of this magnitude and this tremendous importance, in these circumstances, even for a period of twelve months, is most unsatisfactory and most objectionable.  I want to express the hope that the scheme of organisation, the scheme of administration, the various grades of commissioned rank, from General downwards will not be taken as <Col N="1711" /> establishing any vested interests for those officers of higher rank, in case the future Dáil decides upon a different scheme of organisation.  We have in this scheme, Generals, Lieutenant-Generals, Major-Generals, Colonels, Commandants, Lieutenants and Second Lieutenants.  I am informed that in the American Army, for instance, the highest rank is Major-General. I am not sure whether the title of General is in common use even in the British Army.  I do not think that it has been abolished, but the Army Council some years ago was constituted of men of whom the highest grade was Major-General.  We are beginning with Generals and Lieutenant-Generals above the rank of Major-General, which may mean nothing except title.  However, it may mean vested interests in higher scales of pay, pensions and the like.  I want just to put in this word of caution, that the next Dáil, in considering a future and permanent scheme of Defence forces, will not be bound by any regulation made in this Act which establishes this long tale of grades of commissioned officers, and that they will not recognise that they are bound in any way to conserve interests which may have been established by the establishment of this scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that we made it clear during the other discussions on this Bill that all commissions held at the present time are temporary commissions, and that all commissions that would be held under the present Act would be temporary commissions also, that nothing like a permanent commission would be granted, or could be granted, until after the passing of the subsequent Defence Forces Bill which is contemplated.  The present holders of either high or low ranks in the Army do not hold them as vested interests of any kind.  They hold their present positions because in a period of national crisis, whether it was four years ago, or whether it was this year, they stood up to the duty that they saw was theirs.  They undertook responsibility for the carrying out of certain work, work of responsibility and work of danger, when it was clear to them that the safety of their country demanded that they should undertake it.  They have no vested interests, except the type of interest that <Col N="1712" /> becomes vested in men who face responsibilities for their country, the type of vested interests that is common to men whose country turns to them and appreciates the fact that they have stood by it in danger and in difficulty.  They quite realise that their vested interests in any position that they hold are in the affections or regard of their people, and that they will cease when they fail to stand up to the responsibilities that come to them day by day, and which will change perhaps with the change of days, and when they in any other way fail to secure that regard in which they are held by their people.</P>
      <P>Because you have to-day men who are styled with military ranks that may be high compared with the size of other armies and the size of other countries, that does not mean that the country is suffering from anybody who claims to have a vested interest in anything.  It simply means that the country has happily had a very large number of men who have stood by their duties and stood by their responsibilities in this period of grave danger to the country.  In the matter of the possible or probable development of caste in the army or in the country, all I can say is that I do not understand what possible dangers or what possible developments are seen or foretold by the Deputies who have raised that particular question.</P>

      <P>It will be within the <Col N="1713" /> knowledge of Deputies that the Dye-stuffs Act of 1920 was passed to protect the British dye-making industry against German competition.  I think it is also generally admitted that the Germans were able to produce the best dyes obtainable. So far, we have no dye-making industry to protect, and the restriction on importation, so far from being an advantage, is a disadvantage to the Saorstát.  I might also mention that a proposal to repeal the Act has been considered by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee, which has reported that it is satisfied that many advantages to trade and industry would accrue from the removal of restrictions on the import of dye-stuffs.  I therefore move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this motion has come forward, and that it will become law.  It is, I hope, the first fruits of the work of the Fiscal Commission, and it is, at least, one sign that Commissions are not entirely useless. It will, perhaps, encourage Ministers to pay attention to the Reports of Commissions. I think that the benefits that may be derived from this will depend entirely upon the trade policy of Great Britain.  I think that the Ministry is well advised in removing this obstacle in the way of Irish manufacturers getting advantage out of the changed relations between the two countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill, which comes naturally after the period of disturbance such as we have known.  The first Section of it deals with restrictions on the taking of proceedings against certain persons for acts done, or purported to be done, for the purpose, or in the course of the suppression of armed revolt.  It gives indemnity to those persons, and also to acts done by them in good faith or in the execution of their duty, or acts done by persons holding office in the service of the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann. <Col N="1714" /> The second Clause deals with the provision being made for a Certificate to be supplied by an Executive Minister, certifying that the matters mentioned in the Section shall be conclusive evidence, and the third Section deals with the validation and review of sentences of military tribunals.  It affords an opportunity for investigating sentences which have been passed, and it restricts any increase on those sentences.  The Fourth Section deals with the definition of the words &ldquo;Provisional Government.&rdquo;  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Dáil is generally agreed upon the necessity for an Indemnity Bill.  We have not had time to read this Bill and to find how far it extends and whom and what it covers.  I, for one, agree that an Indemnity Bill is required and should pass.  I hope it will not be suggested that we should go any further than agree to the principle, until we have had a proper opportunity of examining the clauses and finding out how far they extend and what they cover.</P>

      <P>I had this Bill included for Third, Fourth and Fifth stages to-day, but I think the statement of Deputy Johnson is a perfectly reasonable statement, and I should like to know if it would be agreeable that we could take the Bill to-morrow if there is sufficient time.  If it was so desired, we could deal with one stage to-morrow, and take the other stages on Thursday, but I would like to have it finished on Thursday if possible; indeed, I would like to have it to-morrow, but I admit the reasonableness of the objections put forward, and, in view of the indulgence we got from the Dáil, I think it is the least that could be expected that we should meet them in regard to these next stages.  There is not much business on the Paper to-morrow, and unless I could persuade Deputies to take the Second Reading of the Judiciary Bill, I do not know whether it would be possible to get consideration for all the Bills by the Seanad in sufficient time this week to deal with them here in the event of amendments taking place. <Col N="1715" /> If that is so, I would like that we could keep in Session for a meeting one day next week up to Thursday.  If not, I think we would have to ask the Dáil to sit on Saturday.  It may not be necessary; but unless we get all the Bills returned on Thursday evening, or sit late on Friday, I am afraid it will be necessary to ask the Dáil to sit on Saturday, so as to receive and deal with any of those measures which would come back from the Seanad.</P>

I do not know what other business there is for to-morrow but I would agree, if this Bill is postponed now, to take its later stages to-morrow. On the question of a later sitting, it might be possible to make arrangements, as far as we are concerned, to meet the desires of the President.  I do not know how best to do it.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I beg the indulgence of the Dáil for the consideration of a very earnest request to grant permission for the introduction of a Bill, mention of which has already been made, and the introduction of which is, in a sense, completing as far as possible in that direction the Constitution which we have adopted.  I refer to the Judiciary Bill.  I shall have to ask for the very generous patience of the Dáil, because, in the first place, I feel unequal to the proper treatment of a subject of such magnitude and importance, and secondly, because I feel and know that if the subject-matter with which I am attempting to deal were in more capable hands, that all the concessions which I crave would <Col N="1716" /> be willingly assented to, though, perhaps, accompanied by some admonitions which would be certainly justified.  It is unnecessary to point out here, or to remind Deputies, that the Judiciary, as it is and was known in this country, did not obtain that public approval which is an essential precedent for its Constitution; that while that was so the people of this country were unable to effect any change; and that for a lengthened period &mdash;that is to say, since the institution of popular representation and the repeated return of popular representatives pledged to change the administration of the country and its control&mdash;prejudiced the selection of the Judiciary, which during that period, although appointed by the Crown, was, nevertheless, made by a Government which did not command the confidence of the people of the country. Judges then entering on their important, and one might well say sacred, duties were nominated by alien authority, and, however conscientiously and justly they may have discharged their duties&mdash; granted even, for the sake of argument, that they were in direct intellectual succession from Solomon, they had not that popular authorisation which is a fundamental principle of democracy.  There were then political associations which still further prejudiced that position of strict impartiality which is so necessary in the dispensation of justice.  I do not think it necessary to refer to the fact that during the period under review the Bench in Ireland had, neverthless, most distinguished and able jurists and conscientious lawgivers.  If I might digress for a moment I should say that in the many changes inseparable from the Treaty position, we have endeavoured so to regulate these necessary alterations with as little disturbance and as free from offence as was possible in the circumstances.  I hope that those who do not subscribe to the spirit of the change will give us credit for the consideration so shown, and that due appreciation of all the complexities will also be shown.  May I also express my keen desire that I should say nothing which would tend to leave any trace of bitterness or make for any want of confidence in the weighty responsibilities which have fallen on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the setting up of Dáil Eireann the position of the Judiciary became complicated, <Col N="1717" /> at least in the terms applied to it&mdash;namely, &ldquo;British Courts&rdquo;; and I think I must again draw on the patience of the Dáil.  Previous to the signing of the Treaty there were two Courts, which were termed &ldquo;The British Courts&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dáil Courts.&rdquo;  It will be immediately conceded that such a situation was not workable.  I am particularly anxious to avoid any possible complications in this explanation, and would like to confine my remarks to the problem which confronts us, and which is no doubt the wish of every member of the Dáil to solve.  The adoption of the Constitution made it necessary to reorganise our Judicial system.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an appeal for the consideration of this Bill.  We have passed the Constitution, and in it we have made provision for the proposals set out in this Bill.  I have already asked many concessions from the Dáil, and Deputies have responded generously. Every reasonable request which I have made, and many unreasonable demands which I have had to make, have been conceded graciously.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill drafted on the lines of the report of the Committee set up by the Government to advise the Government as to how best to give effect to the articles of the Constitution, and to provide for the setting up of national Courts of Justice in the Saorstát.  I think it is advisable that I should read the letter which I addressed to the members of the Committee at the time when they were invited to assist the Government in the matter.  The letter is dated the 29th January, 1923, and is addressed to Lord Glenavy, who was Chairman of the Committee, and it is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the long struggle for the right to rule in our own country, there has been no sphere of the administration lately ended which impressed itself on the minds of our people as a standing monument of alien government more than the system, the machinery, and the administration of law and justice, which supplanted in comparatively modern times the laws and institutions till then a part of the living national organism. The body of laws and the system of judicature so imposed upon this nation were English (not even British) in their seed, English in their growth, English in their vitality.  Their ritual, their nomenclature, were only to be understood by the <Col N="1718" /> student of the history of the people of Southern Britain.  A remarkable and characteristic product of the genius of that people, the manner of their administration prevented them from striking root in the fertile soil of this nation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thus it comes that there is nothing more prized among our newly-won liberties than the liberty to construct a system of judiciary and an administration of law and justice according to the dictates of our own needs, and after a pattern of our designing.  This liberty is established and the headline is set in the Constitution drawn up by the elected representatives of our people.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is provided by Article 64 of the Constitution that the judicial power of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall be exercised and justice administered in the public courts established by the Oireachtas by judges appointed in the manner therein mentioned.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is thereby further provided that the courts so established shall comprise:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Courts of First Instance (Cuirteanna Cead-Cheime) which shall include:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) a High Court (Ard-Chuirt) invested with full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions, whether of law or fact, civil or criminal; and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) Courts of local and limited jurisdiction with a right of appeal as determined by law.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  A Court of Final Appeal (Cuirt Aitheisteachta Deire) to be called the Supreme Court (Cuirt Uachtarach).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the full statement of provisions you are referred to Articles 64 to 72 (both inclusive) and Article 75 of the Constitution, whereof a print copy is sent you with this letter.</P>
    <P>The first Government entrusted by the people with a mandate to give effect to the Treaty from which this Constitution has sprung finds amongst its earliest tasks of presenting to the Oireachtas the measures which will establish courts in fulfilment of the Constitution, and will fashion an administration of justice upon which the people will lean with confidence and affection.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This task calls for grave consideration and much help in expert advice and suggestion drawn from diverse experience and varied knowledge.  The Executive Council felt that it must have the <Col N="1719" /> co-operation of a Committee so constituted as to serve it with that advice and suggestion in preparing the necessary measures.  On behalf of the Executive Council, I have to thank you for so readily accepting the invitation to become a member of this Advisory Committee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Glenavy. The Government invites the Committee to act in accordance with the following terms of reference&mdash;viz.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To advise the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann in relation to the establishment in accordance with the Constitution of Courts for the exercise of the judicial power and the administration of justice in Saorstát Eireann and the setting up of the offices and other machinery necessary or expedient for the efficient conduct of legal business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee is requested to approach the matters referred to them untrammelled by any regard to any of the existing systems in this country, to examine the nature and classification of the legal business, both contentious and non-contentious, for the due discharge of which in the interests of justice, machinery and establishment should be provided by the State, and to consider and report upon the requirements of the litigants and other persons interested, and especially as to accessibility, efficiency, expedition and cost.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Questions such as these of the centralisation or decentralisation of the Courts, the numbers and grades of judges and judicial persons and officials, and their respective qualifications for office, and manner of selection, the method of trial by jury, will be amongst the many subjects which must anxiously engage your attention.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hoped that the Committee will find it convenient to enter upon its labours immediately, and with a view to that end you are invited to attend a preliminary conference at the Government Offices, Upper Merrion Street, on Friday, the 2nd prox., at one p.m. o'clock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was signed by me in my capacity as President of the Executive Council.  The committee comprised Judges of recognised position and long experience in the existing courts which we took over from the British, as well as <Col N="1720" /> Judges who had been very successful in the work of the Dáil Courts.  It included representative men of both the legal profession and the President of the Chamber of Commerce.  It is a notable thing that the Committee arrived at an absolutely unanimous report.  The report was circulated by the Government, and met with a chorus of approval in all directions. The Bill which I now propose to introduce is a Bill for setting up Courts exactly on the lines of the report of that Commission, so that this Bill may be said to have behind it the unanimous recommendation of an expert Commission, and as far as one has been able to judge by the many expressions of opinion in the Press and elsewhere the hearty approval and endorsement of the public. The Government consider it very important to have National Courts of Justice in existence at the earliest possible moment in order that the people may have the most complete confidence in the administration of the law, and may be thereby led to respect for the law which previously existing circumstances did not inspire.</P>
    <P>The leading features of the measure are provision for expeditious and economical disposal of legal business, with the advantage of local hearings for the ordinary run of litigation of the country. In future, for actions involving money up to £300, people will not be taken away from their business in the country and kept hanging about in Dublin.  The Circuit Court is an innovation in one sense, though in another not, for it reproduces the Circuit Court of the old Dáil Courts System, which was found attractive to litigants.  Small debts will, under this Bill, be recovered promptly in the Courts of the District Justice, while a Court of Appeal will be constituted which will be the final Court of Appeal in the land.  If we get this Bill through, it will be possible to have the procedure and the business of these Courts organised during the summer, so that they may be able to start in the autumn.  If that be not possible, then the new Courts could hardly be anticipated before next year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have made many requests to the Dáil, and this may be the last.  I put that, not to influence your sympathy so much as to ease your mind. The Dáil is within its rights, within its privileges, and within its generosity in <Col N="1721" /> refusing this request.  But I put the request forward because I feel that it is due to the Dáil itself that, having accomplished so much, and it has accomplished much, still further to mark the great advance which it has made to secure the confidence of the people in their Parliament. I put this forward in the highest national interest to ensure the most priceless blessing which any Parliament can hope to secure, the cordial acquiescence of its people in their legislative assembly, an acquiescence which is attainable only by limiting complaints and by helping in the construction of institutions which will command their highest confidence.  I beg to move for leave to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has introduced another Bill of very great importance. He has thrown himself upon the generosity of the Dáil, and, of course, it is very hard to resist an appeal such as that which he has made.  But until the Bill is before us I think that we must harden our hearts, at least until then, and probably even afterwards.  While I have no doubt that it is of very great importance to the mind of the Minister that this Bill should become law, so that the new Courts could be set into operation during the summer, I do not think that is sufficient justification to us to make us promise that such a Bill should pass without discussion.  Ministers have their responsibilities, but we also have responsibilities, and we would be answerable along with the Ministry; we would be responsible for the measure when it becomes law to the extent that we supported it.  If we allow a Bill of this kind to pass through without discussion, as we have allowed two other Bills which were temporary, we have to share the responsibility for that acquiescence.  We cannot make a Bill of this kind a temporary provisions Bill, and I do not think that a Bill of this kind, which, I assume, is of considerable length, requiring careful consideration, should be pressed upon us. When we have seen the Bill we will be better able to express a more definite opinion, and I think that it is well that, even at this stage, we should not hold out a promise that there is general acceptance of this proposition that this Bill should pass through without full consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not think there would be any objection to having the Second Stage taken at any time, because I do not suppose that there will be any controversy as to the principles of this Bill.  We have all seen a Judiciary Committee Report.  But I do suggest that to run the Committee Stage through at short notice might be very dangerous, because when you have gone wrong in setting up your Courts, or made mistakes in details about them, it requires legislation to set it right again, and great injustice and great expense may be caused to litigants from blunders made in the beginning.  I think the sooner we see this Bill in print the better. If there were anything that ought to be considered in detail, not necessarily by us, but by the people who know what is to be done in setting up and running Courts, the innumerable details in which blunders may be made through haste, and the consequent enormous expense, I think it will be realised that it would be rash to try to force this Bill through, or to get it through without force, in twenty-four <Col N="1723" /> or forty-eight hours, or three days. I think that it would be quite possible, if this Bill were read a second time, for the country to turn its attention to its details, and probably an enormous number of obviously necessary and agreed amendments could be produced, and the Bill would be put through at very short notice when the new Dáil assembled. I have not seen the details of the Bill. I do not know whether it is a Bill that could possibly be put through in the short time at our disposal; but if not, I do not think much time would necessarily be lost, because probably a better or equally good Bill could be produced and put through on short notice after the new Dáil assembled, and the new Courts would be set up and in full swing by the time the ordinary Court business starts after the summer, which is usually in October.  I think it would be quite possible to give full consideration to this Bill as printed, to have amendments agreed and ready, so that the whole thing could be put through at short notice, but after careful consideration when the new Dáil came into its own.  As I say, I reserve judgement on that until I have seen the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was going to say that in view of that it would be quite easy for us to take the Second Reading this week, for although there is, as we have already seen by experience, a considerable difference between the report, as a report, and the draftsman's application of it in terms of sections and sub-sections, yet, in this case there can hardly be much room for departure or for alteration, and so we ought not, I think, lay ourselves open to any fair accusation of hasty legislation in this matter, if we carry the discussion no further than to pass the Second Reading. But I join thoroughly with Deputy FitzGibbon in deprecating going through the Committee Stage of such an important measure in a hurry, because this is quite as important for the future of the nation as any measure we have yet undertaken the consideration of.  There is a further thing to be borne in mind. Two of the remaining days, Wednesday and Friday, happen to be days set apart for private business, and it would be necessary for the Government to move to take that over for the greater supply of time for the important measures, so, it seems to me, the wisest course is that we should get the Bill, study it, and have a fair idea at least of how far it conforms to the impression we had derived of the measure from a study of the report upon which it is founded, and at that stage we would be in a better position to decide how much further, if at all, the Bill can proceed.</P>
