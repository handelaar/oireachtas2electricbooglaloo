      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government, in reference to his reply of May 16th, in which he stated that there was no agreement with any association or organisation in Co. Galway with regard to the collection of rates in that county whether his attention has been directed to a Press report of a meeting of the County Galway Executive of the Farmers Union, at which the action of the Government, in breaking an alleged agreement with regard to collection of rates, was severely criticised; whether he has received a letter from the Secretary of the Union referred to, alleging the existence of an agreement between the Minister for Agriculture and the Union, regarding the collection of rates in Co. Galway; whether his Department was, as alleged, approached by the Minister for Agriculture with regard to an agreement as to the collection of rates in Galway, and can the Minister state now the nature of the representations which led him to make the order, varying the Public Bodies Order, which it was afterwards decided not to enforce.</P>

      <P>I have not seen the Press report referred to.  As already stated, there was no agreement with any organisation in Co. Galway regarding the collection of rates.  The modification in the Public Bodies Order was made because of a technical difficulty in collecting arrears separately from the 1922-23 rate.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, could the Minister not make some regulations, or get some order made in Court, to have all houses closing at the one hour?  If one goes through the streets at night time one will see some houses closed, others open.  It is not fair to the closed premises that others should be allowed to remain open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that that anomaly exists.  The statutory hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and during the time of the British administration in this country there was a compulsory 9.30 p.m. closing hour.  The employees got used to the 9.30 p.m. closing and refused to work longer.  The position now is that the man who is running his own business takes full advantage of the statutory hours, but the man who has to rely upon employees is obliged to close at 9.30 p.m. I agree it is desirable to have uniformity in the matter of closing hours, and the Bill will introduce uniformity.  It cannot be done otherwise than by legislation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been called to reports which have recently appeared in the Press, in which <Col N="1979" /> it was alleged that an express promise was made by him to the Executive of the Farmers' Union to the effect that military would not be employed to execute decrees obtained against unpurchased tenants, as provided for in the Enforcement of Law Act; whether, in fact, any such promise was made by him to the Union or to any other body, and, if so, was such promise made after consultation with the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I am aware that reports have appeared in the Press alleging that promises were given by me that the military would not be employed to execute decrees against unpurchased tenants.  No such promise was given by me.  I have stated repeatedly that neither myself nor any other Minister is in a position to interfere with the course of law as between a plaintiff and a defendant. In fact the number of decrees for rent executed up to date is extremely few.  I propose to deal with this question on the resumed debate on the Second Reading of the Land Bill.</P>

      <P>I think this is a question for myself.  A statement was made, informally, after the adjournment on Tuesday evening last. Statements have appeared in the Press which are based altogether upon the statements of the Pressmen concerned. The editors of the papers have not, before publishing these statements, taken any steps to ascertain whether there was any other point of view.  My knowledge of the matter now is that according to the statements in the Press, the Pressmen have decided to send a letter to me.  I have not received that letter.</P>

      <P>May I ask whether anything will be done to find out the grievances as reported in the Press, that these men complain of, and if these grievances will be attended to.  I do not wish to go <Col N="1981" /> into it, but I understand that the grievances are lack of proper lavatory accommodation, lack of proper facilities for refreshments, and lack of facilities for their boy messengers, who have to wait outside the door in the rain.  I think if that is so, the Committee having charge of procedure should look into the matter, and give these men the facilities which they are entitled to.</P>

      <P>There is no question whatever as to the disadvantages under which the Press labour. These disadvantages are shared in common, I think, with the rest of us.  I received a notice from the Press last Friday evening, and I went into it on Monday.  The Clerk saw representatives of the Pressmen on Monday afternoon. Apparently some misunderstanding arose from that.  There is no change in the situation, which is that the grievances of the Pressmen can, to a certain extent, be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was to certain representatives of the Press.  The document sent to me was signed by 23 Pressmen, and the Clerk got into communication with the first signatories as being the most convenient, and understood in his conversation with three Pressmen that they would return to him, having received authority from their colleagues. They did not return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the position as outlined by you should be formally conveyed to the newspapers. The impression created by no counter-statement is that the representations that have been made got no consideration and no attention, and it is on that account the men are remaining away.  It is fair to the Dáil and fair to yourself that the statement that you have now made should be conveyed to the newspapers, and the editors asked to publish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather loth to send statements to the <Col N="1982" /> Press, but I recognise that it may be necessary to convey the statement that I have made to the Press.  However, yesterday afternoon the Managers of the Newspapers intervened, and when the Dáil was rising yesterday I was under the impression that the matter would by now be adjusted.  Pending that adjustment I thought better not to issue any statement to the Press.  The managers sent a letter to the Pressmen yesterday evening. It would appear from this morning's papers that a letter was sent by us to the Pressmen.  The fact is the letter was sent by the managers.  As it is stated in the newspapers to-day that a letter is being sent to me, I thought it better to await that letter rather than to issue a statement to the papers.  If an adjustment cannot be made to-day I shall have to consider the question of publishing the position as we see it.  The first communication that I had from the Newspaper men was last October.  They sent me in a statement of a number of difficulties under which they were labouring, and I interviewed them.  I gave instructions, and understood that certain remedies had been found, remedies that were as good as we could find in the circumstances. Subsequent to that interview I have had no communication until the one which I received last Friday.  There is no need to say that if, any time, either orally or in writing, I had been approached by the Pressmen, I would have been glad to see them, and discover whether their difficulties would be removed either partially or wholly, but I received no such representation until last Friday.  Subsequent to that I went round the ground myself.  I am under the impression that there is some misunderstanding in the matter which the managers thought they could remove yesterday.  Apparently, they have so far failed to remove it.</P>

      <P>I have read a statement in the Press which I take and which appears to be correct.  It stated that a meeting of the Journalists Association was held, and that a Committee was elected.  That Committee, as far as I know, was composed of the principal men who report the proceedings of this Dáil. I do not think there is any loss of dignity to be incurred by anybody approaching those people if they are the authorised representatives of the men suffering from these grievances.  I suggest that it be <Col N="1983" /> done in that way, and not be carried out through a third party, who, presumably, have no power at all to settle the matter in dispute.</P>

      <P>I think people who do not possess any dignity are most afraid of losing it, as a general rule in life.  At the earliest opportunity after I received this letter from the Pressmen, and before the Dáil met again, I took certain steps, and I am at a loss to understand now what further steps I am expected to take.  The Pressmen saw the Clerk, and if they have any misunderstanding about what occurred I take it they could indicate that to me, and we would see whether it could be remedied. With regard to the intervention of the managers, I saw one manager as readily as I would have seen one reporter or one editor.  The managers saw the Pressmen, and they believed they could settle the trouble.  They saw the Clerk, and conveyed to the Pressmen that they had an undertaking from the Clerk that remedies could be effected, and the managers communicated that to the Pressmen.  I think they were clearly within their rights.  I have no desire whatever to avoid meeting anybody, and I think it would be better if, perhaps, the matter were left so, so that we could see what will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to have printed and circulated a Bill entitled &ldquo;Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, 1923.&rdquo;  I expect that it is unnecessary to waste time in stating how much we regret the necessity for such a Bill; how much we regret that the Executive should have to come to this Dáil to ask for powers very much greater than the powers that would or should attach to an Executive in normal times.  But the Bill is based on a recognition of facts, however unpleasant, and a recognition of the conditions which are likely to exist, if not to prevail, in this country for 5 or 6 months, and the proposed lifetime of the Act is 6 months.  Its main provisions are as follows:&mdash;Power will be asked to continue in internment people whose internment is considered necessary in the public safety, and power will be asked from the Minister for Home Affairs to intern persons who are considered to be abusing their liberty to the detriment of the public safety.  I want it to be strictly understood that this Bill is not, at the moment at any rate, in any way a supercession of the existing powers of the military, powers inherent in the military by the situation which exists in the country; that it is ancillary to the powers vested in the military authorities at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I believe a <i>habeas corpus</i> action was before the Courts, and the Courts refused to consider the application of the prisoner.  There are facts within the knowledge of the Executive Council, within the knowledge of the military authorities, which go to show that things are far from being what they seem, or what they seem to people taking a casual, superficial view of the situation.  Consequently I want to stress the point that in bringing forward this Bill for the consideration of the Dáil and of the Oireachtas, we are not to be taken as in any way suggesting that the powers <Col N="1985" /> which have attached for some time to the military authorities ought now to cease, or even ought now to be vested in a civil department.  That is not the position. This Bill is introduced in the hope that within a period a situation may arise in which the powers vested at the moment in the military authorities might pass gradually and easily to be exercised by a civil department, and some to cease entirely.  The power of deterrent internment, as distinct from punitive imprisonment, is sought in this Bill both in regard to certain people who are at present interned, and with regard to certain people who are not at present interned, but whose internment might be considered necessary for the public safety.  The internment orders by the Minister for Home Affairs which the Bill provides for, are to be made only on the recommendation of a proper authority, and a proper authority is defined as being an officer of not less than a certain rank in the Army, and not less than a certain rank in the Civic Guard.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Bill is to attach to certain offences, two offences in particular&mdash;a signal penalty.  It is felt with regret that the offences of robbery under arms and arson, both of which have been so common in this country within the last 10 months, are not likely to cease at once, and it is considered eminently desirable that they should cease as quickly as possible.  I see little hope of achieving that end unless this Dáil and the Oireachtas face the fact that very signal deterrent penalties must be attached.  In considering robbery under arms I was for some time inclined to the view that there is very little to distinguish that crime from murder, that the barricade which divides it from murder is of the thinnest, depending upon purely accidental circumstances, such purely accidental circumstances for instance as the courage or lack of courage of the person whom it is sought to rob.  For some time the question of attaching to that offence the capital penalty was under consideration.  It is not proposed in the Bill to attach the capital penalty to that offence, but it is proposed to attach to that offence, and to the offence of arson the penalty of whipping, and the Dáil is asked to say that where these offences are clearly proved against a prisoner the Court shall impose a sentence of whipping varying in degree according to the <Col N="1986" /> age of the prisoner, depending upon whether the prisoner is over or under 16 years of age.  That will be called by many retrograde, and I direct attention to the fact that the offence is retrograde, and I leave it at that until the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides that in the case of open and flagrant defiance of the law in the matter of occupation of land where there is no question of title, and no question whatever of accidental trespass, that the Executive should have power to take the action in dealing with that particular problem which has been taken as a matter of military necessity within the past few months, that it should have power to seize and sell stock placed upon land in defiance of the law, and in defiance of the State, devoting the proceeds to the compensation of the owner of these lands and the surplus to the public exchequer.</P>
    <P>These provisions form the main outline of the Bill which I now ask leave to have printed and circulated to Deputies, and if it be not out of place or improper, I would ask Deputies to face it simply in the light of our experience of the past 10 months&mdash;face it as a Bill we are bringing forward as a necessity arising from the fact that the Government, the Executive of this country has to deal with the aftermath of two revolutions, our own revolt against British administration here, and the revolt of a minority against our administration within the last year.  Men's minds are high strung and hysterical, and we must, simply as human beings, and in a rational way, realise that there is going to be a pretty ugly aftermath to this whole business, and that it will take this country some time to settle down with a general acquiescence in the reign of law.  In the meantime there will be illegalities, there will be wantonness, there will be crime, and it is the duty of the Executive to attempt to reduce these to a minimum, and to seek for itself powers to deal adequately with the situation with which it is certain to be confronted.</P>

      <P>I am astonished that the Minister should come at this stage and introduce a Bill of this character, and ask the Dáil to give permission to have it printed, without offering one scintilla of justification.  Simply because <Col N="1987" /> he thinks as a consequence of two revolutions that there may be acts which the ordinary law would not touch he comes to the Dáil and asks for emergency legislation of this drastic character. Somebody said the other day that a certain statement was out-Heroding Herod. This is out-Heroding all the Herods.  It out-Higgins O'Higgins.  When coercion Bills have been introduced, and when emergency legislation has been called for elsewhere some explanation is always given as to their need.  The Minister stated that it is within the knowledge of the Ministry and within the knowledge of the military authorities that certain things are as they are.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to intervene and explain, that when I spoke matters within the knowledge of the Executive, and of the military authorities, I was referring rather to the military situation.  I am not basing the necessity for this Bill on any matters which I will not disclose fully to the Dáil on the Second Reading.  When I spoke of things not being as they seemed, I was stressing the fact that this Bill must not be taken in any way as a supercession of the powers which the military authorities have vested in them in consequence of the military situation.  I am basing this Bill simply on a recognition of the facts of recent months, and on what I claim to be a rational intelligent anticipation of conditions within the next six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that is not a justification for coming to the Dáil to ask for such abnormal powers to be placed in the hands of the Minister.  It may be the desire of the Minister to transfer powers from the military to the civil arm, but he says that that is not the intention.  We are asked to give power now&mdash;to duplicate to the Minister for Home Affairs, the power which the military have had by resolutions of the Dáil.  One is taken by surprise at such a proposal.  The law, I suggest, is quite strong enough to deal with robbery under arms.  I do not remember that there has been any modifications in the law since the Constitution of the Free State, or in the powers of punishment of offenders for robbery under arms, and I am quite confident that that which the Minister honestly professes to desire&mdash;that people <Col N="1988" /> shall come to have respect for law&mdash;that that end will be further from us&mdash;very much further from us&mdash;by attempting to pass this kind of legislation.  I am not going to say any more, but I am going to oppose the First Reading of this Bill.</P>

It has been occurring because certain people, as a result of the general turmoil and the change in the point of view, are ready to take the consequences of the present sentence which the law can give for a crime like that.  Is there any Deputy here who has any doubt whatever that robbery under arms has been occurring practically as a common thing for the last month?</P>

      <P>I will come to that later on.  Let us take one thing at a time.  Is the Minister for Home Affairs right when he says that robbery under arms is only one degree removed from murder, and <Col N="1989" /> right when he states that it is only removed from murder by one degree by reason of circumstances over which the robber has no control&mdash;chance circumstances and the courage of the particular person who happens to be robbed or the lack of courage.  Is that right, I ask? Remember, we are dealing not with suspicion in this matter, but with proof. Where it is proved that a man commits robbery under arms, where a man takes advantage of times like these when the national honour is at stake to feather his own nest, ought there to be such terrible pity and commiseration for him from any right-minded man?</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Deputy's heart bleeds for a man who commits robbery under arms, but what I do suggest is that any man who loves law and loves liberty, and I am sure the Deputy numbers himself <Col N="1990" /> amongst the number, must be anxious to see that we in this Dáil will give the Executive sufficient power and authority to make it definitely not worth that man's while to commit these crimes, crimes not only against the property of the Nation, but against the honour of the Nation.  As to why we should limit the operation of the Act to six months, my answer to that is that we hope better times will have come about within that period.  We hope the results of this measure will be such that, in six months, there will be no necessity for the extraordinary powers which the Deputy suggests there is not a necessity for at the moment.</P>
      <P>Now, the other crime for which power is taken under this Bill to inflict the penalty of flogging is the crime of arson, and I want to suggest to the Dáil that, if there is one crime that we should endeavour to repress, it is the crime of arson.  It was one of the foulest crimes committed during the last year.  It is an attempt to injure a man through his wife and children, through his associations and his sentiments and through everything he holds dear; and if there is one thing more than another that has done dishonour to this country during the last year it is this cowardly crime of arson, the burning of a man's home and his household goods.  I ask the Dáil to show, by the legislation they are going to pass, that that thing must stop, and that the coward who takes advantage of the present situation to commit that crime is going to suffer for it.  I should have hoped that any man who had any sense of humanity, or a sense of the honour of his country, would be glad and would be anxious to see that whatever terrors are necessary to deflect people who commit these crimes from such courses, should be exposed to these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather welcome the introduction of this Bill, and I do so on principle because it seems to me to be a step back towards the normal processes of law in the trying and conviction of criminals from the time we adopted regulations setting up military tribunals.  I have no fault to find with the Army as a whole or with military tribunals in their proper place when they deal with attested members of the Army; that is their proper function, but it is an indication of a grave state of things in <Col N="1991" /> the country when the law is superseded and criminals have to be tried, as they are being tried, by military tribunals. Now that is going on still.  This Bill does not supersede that procedure, and I think it is highly probable that military courts cannot yet be completely superseded in certain places and in certain cases.  But at any rate it does <i>pro tanto</i> in this Bill set up the ordinary methods of trial by a judge and jury or by a judge in some cases without a jury once again, and to that extent it seems to me to be a step back to normal procedure and to be a step along the right lines.  Now, I refrain from criticising the details of the Bill, which I have not seen and know nothing about.  I reserve the right to criticise any detail in the Bill when I see it in print, but the principle seems to me to be right, and it is a step back to normal law again.  With regard to its being only a temporary measure, it is proposed, from what I heard the Minister say, to give power to inflict some extraordinary punishments.  People with long memories who have attained my time of life can recollect a period in the last century when robbery with violence, not robbery under arms, was so prevalent in the streets of London that extraordinary punishment, of the nature indicated by the Minister here, was brought in, and in the space of, I think, eighteen months that crime was completely crushed out of London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if extraordinary punishment of this description had that effect upon the criminal classes in the British nation, it might go a long way towards putting down the far more dangerous crime of robbery by people armed with firearms, because, as the Minister said, there is only the pressure of a man's finger between robbery and murder in such cases; and probably, and under the circumstances, the least thing may, and often will, result in death, even although the robber himself never had the intention of inflicting death to attain his end.  It seems to me that it is a far greater crime, this robbery with arms, than robbery with violence, for which these punishments were first introduced. For this reason, which is the only matter of detail that occurs to me, it is most important, right, and proper that this punishment should be introduced. <Col N="1992" /> At best it is a substitute for capital punishments that the military tribunals which we set up have inflicted in one or two cases in recent months for this crime of robbery under arms.  It is a relaxation in favour of the criminal, and it must be a relief for everyone here to know that we are sanctioning a lesser punishment than that of taking human life at vengeance for, or deterrent to, crime.  To that extent again I think this Bill is a step along the right road.  As I say we can raise the details when we see them, but I respectfully repeat the claim that this Bill should be given the First Reading, and we should have an opportunity of seeing what its proposals are before we condemn it.</P>

      <P>I have listened with nothing short of amazement to the speech of the very learned and able Deputy who has just now given his views on this Bill.  He welcomes the Bill as a return to the normal.  I wish it was. There is nothing we want more, but he seems to have overlooked the fact that the principal item in the Bill is the giving of <i>carte blanche</i> to the Executive, or the officers of the Executive, to put in prison, and to keep in prison, persons whom they may regard as suspicious, and this is commended as a return to the normal. I am not going to say much about the Bill now, I agree with what Deputy Johnson said about it.  I think probably that it is, and will prove to be, the swan-song of Die-Hardism.  I am glad to see some of the Ministers seem to like that. My main purpose in rising was to draw attention to a very curious statement made by the Minister in introducing the Bill.  He told us in effect that the Bill was unnecessary because what he said was this: &ldquo;Do not let anyone suppose that this Bill is being introduced to supersede the military powers of the military tribunals&rdquo;&mdash;if I do him an injustice he will correct me, but I think he went on&mdash;&ldquo;the military in present circumstances <i>ipso facto</i> have all the necessary powers that they have been exercising, and four or five months hence perhaps the civil power will take over this work.&rdquo;  It seems to me to follow that on the Minister's own view of the case there will be no need whatever for this Bill until four or five months hence, because the military have all the power inherent in them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Bill is merely ancillary to the powers that the military have from the military situation which now exists, and when the military situation ceases to exist this Bill will be the normal procedure for dealing with the situation.</P>

      <P>I may have misunderstood the Minister, and, if so, I withdraw it, but what he did actually state is on the record of the shorthand writers' notes, and will appear in due course.  It does not affect the main issue. I assure the Minister that I had no intention of misrepresenting him.  He has taken up the position that military have inherent in them all these powers at present. That, I trust, is not a misrepresentation. I should like the position that the Minister takes up on that to be made clear.  Either it is or it is not necessary for some body other than the military to have these strange abnormal powers of internment on suspicion.  If the military have these powers now, it cannot be necessary for another body to have them.  One cannot get away from the suspicion that the real purpose of this <Col N="1994" /> Bill is to evade the successful <i>habeas corpus</i> application which the Minister sees coming along in the law courts. When they saw an application, which some Minister may have thought would be successful, coming along in another court, they took a simpler method and suppressed the court.  That would not do now, so we are to have a perpetuation of this Die-hardism introduced for the express and specific purpose of taking jurisdiction under <i>habeas corpus</i> out of the hands of the Judges, Castle Judges as they are, who would very likely, as the Minister knows, order the release of the prisoners who have been interned only on suspicion.</P>

      <P>I submit that no case has been made on principle for the introduction of this Bill at all. This is the first occasion, I think, since this Dáil met that there has been any opposition to the First Reading of any Bill, because everybody, no matter what their views and no matter how they differ, was prepared to let a case be stated for asking the Dáil to permit the introduction of this Bill.  One Minister has said that the Executive wants to give itself, or wants to get the permission of the Dáil for sufficient power to do certain things.  Unless my recollection is very much at fault, more than ordinary powers have already been given to the Executive, and to one arm of the Executive&mdash; namely, the Army&mdash;in previous regulations that were carried by a majority of the Dáil, and which are since then, I suppose, the law of the land.  The Minister now wants the Executive to have certain exceptional powers, but he has made no case for the reinforcement of the extraordinary measures which are already in force.  I submit that he has made no case at all.  Nobody inside or outside the Dáil, except people who refuse to look facts in the face, would deny that arson and robbery with violence have been pretty prevalent in the Saorstát, and in Ireland generally, indeed, within the last year, and I am not going so far as to say that, while we have come to a period of a kind of tranquillity, we will be free of that kind of thing for the next four or five months, or twelve months, or maybe for the next two years.  You cannot get rid of the example of the last year, or the last two or three years, without something <Col N="1995" /> of the worst effects of that example sticking in the hearts and minds even of some people who otherwise are, but for that, of the very best class of citizenship, and those of us who have heard about certain people engaging in these activities have been much surprised and amazed, as we were when we find the Ministry asking for this particular Bill.  I am not going to deal with any cases that are <i>sub-judice</i> at all, but that is the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture says we want to give the Executive sufficient power to do these things.  Has not the Executive sufficient power as it stands to punish these particular crimes, if they are proven?  There is no question, with all due deference to Deputy FitzGibbon, of proving all these crimes.  You have already thousands of people interned, and if you inquire from the Minister for Defence why some of them are interned, he will tell you they are interned because they were suspected of taking part in arson.  He has already stated so in the Dáil.  If he can do that under existing laws and regulations, what is the necessity for this new Bill?  Let the Ministry answer.  The same with other crimes mentioned.  It is not so much the punishment, though I think it would be really a degrading thing if one of the methods of punishment which the Minister suggests is going to be carried out; not only for the person suffering the punishment, but the person inflicting the punishment, and the authority authorising it.  I am not going to deal with that now.  I ask the Dáil to judge fairly and squarely whether there is any necessity at all for this Bill.  I submit the Ministry has made no case for giving this new power into the hands of the Executive.  They have sufficient power, and if one examines the previous regulations which we adopted here at some length, and examine the repressive regulations of other places, one will find that the Free State regulations are as comprehensive and repressive as can be found in any State.  They are so broad and comprehensive that they cover practically everything, but we are getting back into a period of a kind of tranquillity, and, as I say, there may be decisions reached in the Courts that we are not only back into a period of tranquillity but that we are out of a state of war.  If that happens, <Col N="1996" /> there is then a remedy in the hands of certain relatives of prisoners and others to take certain steps in the Court.  I submit to the Dáil, with Deputy Gavan Duffy, that what the Executive wants to do is to anticipate the ordinary course of law and to get this Bill through at this stage, so that when the Executive wants to take measures against certain people, it can turn around to an enactment of this Dáil and say, there is the law, and the judges must administer that law. Your law as it stands is not sufficient. Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that, I suppose, that they have a dozen or twenty British Coercion Acts at their back, still that is not sufficient. You have the most comprehensive code of Military repressive regulations that we have had in this country for a good many years, but they are not sufficient. Nobody on these benches, and nobody who supports us outside, would say to the Executive that you should neglect to use any legal or lawful measures you have for the suppression of robbery by violence or arson.  But we do submit, in all seriousness, that you have quite sufficient powers to do these things without bringing forward something that is going to characterise the Dáil and the State after this period of comparative tranquility as compared to the state of affairs for the last 4 or 5 years, as a very retrograde and reactionary State and body indeed.  There is no argument, I submit again, with all due deference to Deputy FitzGibbon, that in the last century or the century before certain exceptional measures had to be taken elsewhere, and perhaps in Dublin, for the suppression of certain crimes, because Deputy FitzGibbon, I am sure, as well as any Deputy, knows that measures of exceptional severity were taken in these periods here in Dublin, and in other places, and in London, for the most trivial offences.  I do not know whether they are still available, but if the Deputy will consult the old registers of Old Kilmainham, and certain of the registers, at all events, that are still in Mountjoy, he will find side by side with the entries of Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone records of transportation beyond the seas, flogging, and, in some cases, executions <Col N="1997" /> of men, women, and children for, perhaps, the theft of a goat, or of half a dozen handkerchiefs, or of a few pounds. These are notoriously the facts, but because these things were done in what might be called more barbarous times, the Deputy would seem to suggest that, therefore, now in 1923, after two revolutions or a revolution and a half, we should go back to the spirit of the penal legislation and penal administration of 80 or 90 or 100 years ago.  If the Ministry were prepared to withdraw the Military Regulations for which they got the sanction of the majority of this Dáil some months ago, there might be some case for allowing this Bill to be introduced, but are the military advisers of the Executive, or is the Executive itself, about to withdraw these regulations?</P>

      <P>It is the right, the duty, and the prerogative of the Executive Council, placed in a state of revolt, faced with the use of force against the law in the country, to oppose that force and revolt by military force, and the military forces of the Government, called upon to do so, have a right and duty to oppose that force by adequate military force.  When we asked for approval for certain resolutions in the Dáil for the taking of certain actions as a punishment or as a preventive of certain actions by force on the part of revolting persons in the country, we did not increase the prerogative or right of the military forces in the country in any way. We simply got an expression of Parliamentary approval of acts that were the right and prerogative of military forces as such.  At the time when we got approval for those resolutions here it will be remembered that we anticipated that a time would come when certain areas of the country would become more ordered, while certain areas might be in a disordered state.  So far as the application of military force is concerned, we are only applying military force at present in cases and in places where it is necessary to do so.  The Executive cannot divest itself of this right and duty to employ <Col N="1998" /> military force in any particular case of necessity.  On the other hand, as Deputies have admitted, the nature of the crimes that are likely to be committed in the country and the nature of certain disorders likely to exist, because of the history of the present and past years, are abnormal.  It is not advisable, and the Executive consider that it is not advisable, to retain the use of military forces in any particular area or district where it can be reasonably avoided.  On the other hand, the civil arm of the Executive cannot function, and cannot take action except in accordance with them. You cannot simply transfer to the civil arm of the Government powers that are intrinsic in military forces, and if you want to increase the powers of the civil arm of the Government to deal with any particular state of affairs in the country or any particular classes of offences, you have to define their powers by law.  We may argue that there is not a state of armed resistance in any part of the country, but so long as you have arms in any particular part of the country not under Government control you have practically to recognise that that portion of the country is in a state of revolt.  It is certainly in a state of potential revolt, and in the present atmosphere you have to regard it as in a state of revolt.  We have seen orders to shoot certain Deputies of this Dáil.  We have seen orders to shoot at sight Civil Servants and persons who are in any way responsible for carrying out and assisting in the present administration. These orders were definitely intended to be carried out.  They have not been carried out.  In the same way arms exist in part of the country for purposes of revolt, and we are aware that very strenuous attempts are being made to add to the number of arms so held. The holding of these arms may be just as ineffective as the issuing of certain instructions for the purpose of creating an actual state of revolt.  The Government is not prepared to saddle the country for a longer period of time than is necessary either with the maintenance of large military forces or the exercise of military force in the country.  It is endeavouring to hasten the return to normal times and the normal exercise of the law through the normal machinery of the law in seeking for its civil arm additional powers to deal with the special situation which will <Col N="1999" /> enable it to function through its civil arm, and it is a healthy and natural thing that we would seek additional powers for that civil arm, gradually withdrawing from actual operations in the country military forces.  We do anticipate that by taking those powers and using them judiciously, in the same way as we have used our military forces judiciously, that we will overcome the present period of revolt, or potential revolt, the subterranean revolt which exists at the present moment because of the possession of arms by, and the activities of, a number of people we know.  We will get over that period of revolt without the revolt itself fructifying to any greater extent than some of the instructions issued from time to time.  There is eminently a great necessity for the civil arm of the Government getting, in the process of law, additional powers that it can use in a legal way, while the Executive Council can withdraw as much as possible the use of military forces to overcome the forces used against them.</P>

      <P>If the death penalty does not deter him, and if flogging does, <Col N="2000" /> then flog him.  It is time to stop a recurrence of these crimes.  The Ministry with the responsibility of this country on their shoulders during a period of revolt come now to ask for powers at a time when the stand they made is bringing some fruit.  I say it is my duty to give them whatever powers they wish, and not to interfere with the men at the wheel.</P>

      <P>I think the statement of the last speaker calls for some explanation. He says he is prepared to give them whatever powers they ask for to do what they like.  That is the only inference one can draw from his speech.  He said he was listening as a neutral onlooker, and that, taking all the factors into consideration, he would prefer to hand his responsibility over to a smaller number of men rather than sit as a juryman and carry out the law.  I, at any rate, feel that certain things that happened in this country recently give ground for a feeling of confidence and tranquillity. There is something in the air that would make one feel optimistic as regards the future.  Anyone who goes through the country with his ear to the ground, visiting his constituents and listening to them, recognises that that is the actual position in the country, but the Minister for Home Affairs, asking leave for a Bill of this kind, is going to create an impression amongst the overwhelming masses that such is not the case.  I think it is a happy coincidence, though some Deputies regret it, that the Press is absent from our proceedings to-day, because I should prefer their absence rather than that they should report the speeches of those standing over the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy O'Shannon, and, speaking for myself in this matter, I am not going to prevent a Government, which is the authorised Government of this country, now or in the future dealing out what may be considered reasonable punishment to people who commit robbery under arms.  Let that be clearly understood as far as I am concerned.  I think the punishment should be in all cases in accordance with the crime.  I have read in the North-Eastern boundary documents which have been issued by the Government, or for which the Government is responsible, a certain lot of piffle referring to the flogging imposed by <Col N="2001" /> the Northern Government.  These documents cast a reflection upon punishment of this kind which has been dealt out by Sir James Craig and his Belfast Parliament to the people who support you within that area.  You are now coming forward to ask for leave to do the same thing yourselves.  When some of your people are responsible for documents, they should look a little to the future.  If they did so at the time they were writing that kind of stuff they would be sorry to think that the time would come when the same thing would happen in their own area as that which they condemned in other places.  I can quite see, and I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs can quite see, that any powers he asks us for on behalf of the Executive will be given, because men will march into the Dáil when the division bell rings, when we or anybody else challenges a division, and they will register their votes in accordance with your wishes.  That has been the procedure in the Dáil for the last six or nine months.  I oppose the Bill because I think a case has not been made out for it, and because I think it will create a wrong impression in the country at a time when a General Election is approaching.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that a wrong impression will be created in the country by the introduction of this Bill at a time when the General Election is approaching.  There have been complaints that people interned have been deprived of their votes.  It would be quite possible to take 12,000 more, and, by interning them on suspicion, deprive them <Col N="2002" /> of their votes in the coming election.  I can foresee that if Deputies, such as Deputy Gavan Duffy and others, go outside and repeat statements they have made in the Dáil, they will be landed in Mountjoy, and that, probably, before the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GEORGE NICHOLLS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very much struck by the arguments that came from the Deputies on the Labour Benches and Deputy Gavan Duffy.  They have told us that no case has been made out for the Bill.  Deputy Davin, who voted against the Act that gave certain powers to the Army, tells us that he has been going through the country and speaking to people who have had their ears to the ground.  As one who voted for the powers that were given to the Army, I say I know perfectly well that the people who have had their ears to the ground are speaking the truth.  What enabled Deputy Davin to get such answers from those people were the special powers that were given to the Army.  I would like to say &ldquo;Thanks be to Heaven, I have no relative in jail or mixed up in this conspiracy against the majority of the people.&rdquo;  If I had I would consider his chances of getting out would be damned by the advocacy we have heard from Deputy Gavan Duffy and the Deputies on the Labour benches. This emergency legislation Bill that is brought in now provides for interning certain people in regard to whom there is reasonable ground for suspicion.  Under the present powers we all know there are thousands of prisoners in jails who are liable to the death penalty.  Instead of their being brought forward for trial, as apparently the Labour Deputies and Deputy Duffy desire, they are simply to be interned if there is reasonable grounds for suspecting them.  I think that is a very admirable idea, and it is very much better than to have them brought before Military tribunals, now that things are getting back to normal.  I think the Minister for Home Affairs has made a much better case for the introduction of the Bill than has been made against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be necessary to emphasise that what the Dáil was asked for was permission to have this Bill printed and circulated for consideration. Now, at least, there is a case for its consideration.  You have in Military detention at the moment twelve or thirteen thousand people.  It has to be faced that many of those people have committed most serious crimes for which, in the ordinary times, they would be triable, and for which there would be very severe penalties.  It is not too much to assume that very many of them have committed murder, that a great many of them, indeed, have perpetrated arson and general sabotage, and the right to detain them as the law stands at present depends purely upon military necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they have sought the assistance of the law to secure their release the attitude of the Judges has been &ldquo;We are debarred from inquiring into the legality of their detention because in time of war or armed rebellion Courts are precluded from inquiring into the legality of the acts of the military.&rdquo;  Therefore, up to the present, until this morning, Courts have refused to consider the application of these men's release from custody.  Presumably a stage will come when the Courts will say &ldquo;There is no longer, in our view, a state of war or armed revolt which is sufficient to preclude us from inquiring into the legality of the detention of these people.&rdquo;  Quite frankly, that is the position which this Bill is intended to meet.  Because we are not prepared to consider the wholesale indiscriminate release on this country, which is barely beginning to settle down to normal conditions, of these twelve thousand men, whose worst instincts have been stirred up, and who have been hacking the face of their own country for the last ten months or a year. I say that not animated by any particular desire to censure these men individually, but simply stating the fact that they got a lead, and they got a call, from people to whom they gave habitual obedience, and they followed it, and followed it along very dark and very criminal ways.  We would not be executing <Col N="2004" /> fairly or decently or honourably our stewardship to the people of this country and to the interests that look to us for protection if we were to contemplate the wholesale, indiscriminate release of these men on a day or date that the Courts would decide that there was no longer a state of war or a state of armed rebellion.  It is called, and very aptly indeed called, a Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill.</P>
    <P>Crime against the person, crime against property, has been rampant in the country, and it cannot be expected to cease immediately when some Judge on the Bench decides that there is not a state of war or armed revolt.  The civil Ministry that is primarily responsible for peace and order and decency of life within the country must come, in a rational way, to lay its case before this Dáil for powers that will enable it to deal with the situation with which it is confronted and with which it will be confronted for some considerable time.  No case has been made, I am told, even for the introduction of this Bill, for asking the Dáil for leave to consider it.  Well, it was not for want of material to make the case.  I could produce the monthly report from the Civic Guard Headquarters, received conscientiously month by month, on the state of the country, and I could have brought them here and held the Dáil while I read them out.  I thought that there would be a pretty general admission that there was at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for the introduction of the Bill to give the Civil Ministry extra power to deal with the situation which admittedly exists in the country, and which may reasonably be calculated to continue to exist for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy does not quite follow me on that point. A military situation exists.  It has been decided this morning by the Courts that it does exist, and that the Courts are precluded from inquiring into the legality of the detention of persons in military custody.  But at some time in the future the Courts will certainly decide that that situation no longer exists.  And when, and if, that decision comes it is necessary to have a specific Act of this Dáil sanctioning their further internment. Heretofore they have been interned as a <Col N="2005" /> military necessity arising out of the situation of war or armed revolt.  I now come to this Dáil and say it is necessary in the public safety that some at any rate of these men should continue to be interned, and that power should be given to the Civil Ministry to intern certain other persons on specific representations from responsible officers after the state of war.  I could, as I say, have brought ample material here to prove the case and to show the necessity for this Bill. But I thought that there would be a general admission amongst the Deputies that there was that kind of <i>prima facie</i> case which is all that is required for the First Reading.  After all, you are simply asked for permission to have this Bill printed and circulated.  We can discuss its principles, we can discuss its provisions, on the Second Reading.  We can go on to the Committee Stage if it passes its Second Reading, and move amendments or deletions as we think fit.  But what you are asked now is simply that the Home Affairs Minister, on whom the primary responsibility lies for order and <Col N="2006" /> decency of life in the country, be enabled to bring in a Bill here to you asking for certain additional powers over and above those which are normally attached to the Executive.  I think that the very delicate situation in the country justifies me in coming to the Dáil to ask for powers of that kind.  The fact is that up and down the country you have an organisation, and up and down the country you have arms and explosives lying about, and you have breaches of the peace and robbery under arms, and arson and so on very generally through the country; we must not get in the way of regarding that as a normal state of affairs.  We must realise that if there is to be commercial security, if there is to be financial credit or credit in the other senses, national honour or national prestige, that the country must pull itself out of that situation.  It is to give power to the Executive to help to end that situation that I ask for leave to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wonder do we here in this Dáil, not to say the man in the street, realise what is taking place?  A question that has agitated our people for hundreds of years is about to be brought to what, I think, is a happy climax. After years and years of suffering and hardship for our people, we are at length seeing a measure of land purchase for Irishmen brought in to be legalised by Irishmen.  It is a terrible thing to throw our minds back and to think that seventy or eighty odd years ago the population of Ireland was practically double what it is to-day.  I venture to say that one of the main reasons that forced our people to emigrate in hundreds of thousands from a fruitful land was, unhappily, the question of Irish land.  I, for one, hope to see this Bill carried into law in a short time.  If there are, or if some of my colleagues in the Dáil think that there are, some spots in the Bill, I would say to them that even <Col N="2008" /> the sun has spots.  It may happen that these spots may be erased altogether, or perhaps diminished considerably in size. I hold no brief for any section&mdash;neither for the landlord nor the man who wishes to acquire land&mdash;and I have no land myself. The only thing I can say is that I am not an admirer of landlords, and, like my friend Deputy Wilson, I would repeat <i>fiat justitia.</i>  I think that if this Government, and, if you like, this Dáil, were out for popularity alone, they could, perhaps, do a very popular thing with some of our people by ignoring altogether a certain class, but I think that in any well-ordered country such a thing is impossible.  Again I can only repeat, like my friend Deputy Wilson, <i>fiat justitia.</i>  The price and the various figures have been very eloquently gone into by various Deputies, and not being a financial expert nor one very much in love with figures, I am not going to touch on that topic.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, and I, for one, recognise that this is a bold and honest attempt to try and settle one of the greatest difficulties that our nation has been faced with.  Listening the other evening to the speeches of some of the Deputies, they seemed to me, if I followed the course of their arguments aright, to suggest that a certain class in this country had no rights.  I have just said that in any well-ordered community there must be some kind of order.  What I wish to convey, perhaps, would be better illustrated by a little story I heard some time ago.  A landlord, not in Ireland, was walking through his estate, and he came across two poachers, to whom he said, &ldquo;These are my lands.&rdquo; The two poachers asked him from whom he got the land.  He said from his father.  The poachers then asked, &ldquo;From whom did your father get the land?&rdquo; and the reply was, &ldquo; From my grandfather.&rdquo;  The discussion went on until they came to the present owner's great-grandfather's great-grandfather. Eventually the poachers asked from whom he got the land, and the owner's reply was, &ldquo;He fought for it.&rdquo;  One of the poachers then said, &ldquo;Take off your coat now and fight me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That would seem to be the trend of some of the Deputies' remarks, <Col N="2009" /> if I interpreted them aright, the other day.  I suggest that if we are to progress and advance in Ireland we must have order and common-sense.  We cannot be idealistic in some things.  We must come down to bedrock, and we cannot follow the example of what the poacher ultimately said to the landlord. I think we have had enough of fighting and of heartbreaking events in Ireland. There are some other points in connection with the Bill that I would like to mention. There is the question of who are you going to put into these holdings when they are acquired by the Government. Of course we cannot discriminate, perhaps, as to who will be put on the land, but one thing I think the Government should do, and that is, make the people who are installed in these holdings cultivate the soil.  With all respect, I submit to my friends in the Farmers' Party that there should be a little more originality in the kind of crops grown in Ireland. One point struck me when I was thinking about this Bill, and that was that crops very suitable for agricultural pursuits would be many of them medicinal plants.</P>

      <P>Am I to be interrupted by the <i>enfant terrible</i>?  I have made this suggestion to my agricultural and horticultural friends.  Of course the ordinary crops will continue to be grown, but we should have a little originality and try some other crops which would undoubtedly repay the owners, such as the growing of medicinal plants.  Another point is that of mining interests. The mining interests are, I understand, vested in the Government of the country. The mining laws in Ireland are, I understand, very complex and intricate, and I would, with all respect, in the interests of the nation, make a suggestion to the Chief Legal Adviser of the Government. If that be possible these laws on mining should be overhauled and made less complex.  I only wish again to congratulate the Government, and especially the Minister for Agriculture, because, as a plain Irishman who knows little about the land, I believe that this Land Bill, which I hope to see very soon <Col N="2010" /> passed into law, will be the means of bringing to the mind of the man in the street, if they want any realisation of the matter, the magnificent and stupendous change that has come over our country, that we in Ireland, sitting here in an Irish Parliament in the capital of our country, are able to do things.</P>

      <P>So very much has been said about the Land Bill that I do not intend to add anything to what is already stated.  But there is one point I am very anxious to bring before the Dáil, and that is in reference to the matter raised by Deputy Johnson as to the support given by the Farmers' Party to the enforcement of Law Temporary Provisions Bill, and particularly to the Clause dealing with the recovery of debt. Speaking for myself, and the party to which I belong, I say we supported that Bill and we stand by the principle of that particular Clause still.  We defend the collection and the paying of debts, which is the law of every State, and which is in accord with the moral law, and we stood for that in the Act that is passed, and we stand for it still.  We never attempted the nonpayment of rent, and we do not do so now, but as tenants we claim the reduction to which we are entitled, and we claim that tenants were entitled to hold their rents until they got these reasonable reductions, and in cases where they did get it, and it was not in very many cases, the rents have been paid up, particularly in the County Louth and in other counties in Ireland. With regard to the Clause relating to arrears in the Land Bill, this clause will hardly be necessary if the Bill is delayed for a couple of months.  On the present lines of procedure the Bill will take some time in the Dáil, and some time will be taken on it in the Seanad, amounting in all to, probably, three months.  By that time the arrears will have been collected by the bailiffs, assisted by the military forces, which are now going through the country.  So I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that there will be no necessity for this arrears clause in the Land Bill at all.</P>

      <P>To a landless man like myself, who never expects to get more than six feet in Glasnevin, the course of this debate has been very peculiar.  In fact, the discussion has been of that <Col N="2011" /> nature that it made me come to the conclusion, although my perusal of the Bill has not been exhaustive, that this Bill must really be like Cæsar's wife&mdash;very largely above suspicion.  Because, for instance, in the most vigorous attempt at criticism that was made by Deputy Wilson, he tried to disguise himself as a critic of the Bill, but without effect, for he had really nothing but good to say of the Bill.  I take, again, the criticism of Deputy Doyle.  He spoke of prices, and then he launched into an attack which was not criticism of this Bill, but which was against something not at all germane to the Bill and had nothing to do with the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not law yet; he was speaking of operations that were existing, and said something suggesting threatened opposition to this Bill if the present law was not immediately modified.  Remember this was a complaint against the iniquity of the present law, and for that reason there is threatened opposition to a measure which proposes to do away with this very iniquitous law.  It seems to me very curious logic. As regards price, I think the staunchest upholder of the rights of the tenants will not deny that this Bill gives greater reductions than have been given by any previous land measure or any measure dealing with land matters in the past.  That is a matter of actual fact.  The tenants who purchased under the 1885 Act bought at an average of nearly eighteen years' purchase of their land; those who bought under the Land Act of 1891 bought at seventeen years' purchase; and those to whom this Bill applies are asked to buy at a little over 13½ years' purchase.  Just remember this: Deputy Wilson tried to make the Dáil believe that 13½ years would add up to 20 years.  I do not know who taught him his arithmetic, but certainly his arguments were not ones that lead to convincing conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there was one source from which I expected very vigorous criticism and a very searching analysis of the Bill.  I was quite disappointed.  Deputy Johnson, instead of analysing the Bill, waived it airily aside, and said let us talk of something else, and he gave us a dissertation which I can only describe as the <Col N="2012" /> teaching of a mystic Christianity which we heard enunciated the other night in the Mansion House.  It is true that it is a pity the State cannot take the land and hand it over gratuitously to the present occupiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is a pity.  It is a pity that the limitations of the situation with which the country is confronted do not permit that.  It is a pity that we have to pay rent for the houses that we inhabit, but it is one of the peculiar little drawbacks of life which I am afraid will continue to figure in the economy of the State for a considerable time to come. Then Deputy Doyle says that the present conditions warrant much more liberal terms than the tenants secured on previous occasions.  It would be splendid if terms more liberal than those of the present Bill could be given, but I think the limitations of the possibilities of the State must be considered.  I do think the main points to be achieved are these, and I think they are the vital points.  One is the security of ownership to the occupier at an annuity that he can bear with comfort, and which will enable him to carry on his holding as an economic holding. Remember it will be no small task upon the part of this Government to finance such an operation as this.  It will be an operation of a very serious and large nature, but it may be possible to successfully operate the Bill, and to introduce amendments which give larger terms or a shorter number of years of purchase; but it may also be possible, and let us bear it well in mind, that such operation may be at the expense of the life of the Bill.  It is one thing to finance fair play and fair terms all round, but it is another thing to finance something approximating to confiscation.  And let those who have to deal with this matter, and who are interested, consider not so much what is in their minds as to the greatest things they could get, but rather what are the greatest things that the State can give them.  You may be attempting too much to prevent even a fair measure of justice being meted out. The resources of the State are not inexhaustible. The land of Ireland is limited, and when the present untenanted lands have been portioned out, I presume <Col N="2013" /> we will see vastly increased production of the crops of the country necessary for the increased population to consume, or for the markets in foreign countries to consume. The amount of territory distributable in the country is limited, and you must remember that the State will have to engage upon every enterprise which will absorb the non-agricultural population which cannot find work on the land. Therefore, when you are considering such large measures as this, that goes to the root of one of the vital phases of national life, you have to consider them in relation to the general national economic policy, which will be sound and far-seeing in determining what the demands of the State will be in years to come.  I presume, therefore, there has been so little real adverse criticism so far, that it is all reserved for the Committee Stage, and all that we can say at this stage is to acknowledge the courage of the Government for tackling this question in the way they have done, and attempting to bring, as Deputy Dr. White has said, within measurable distance of conclusion and settlement one of those problems that has tortured and harassed the entire life of the Irish nation for many generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DINNEEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give my views on this important question of the land settlement.  I certainly must feel a bit small when I think of the many great men who represented the district which I now represent, from the days of Philpot Curran in the Irish Parliament down to a few years ago, when in the British Parliament the last to represent us was our present Governor-General.  I happen to be the senior member now, and all I can rely on is honesty of purpose. I intend to make an honest effort to help to end this strife, which has been the curse of our country for generations. The land question need not be used now, as in other days, as a means by which the national difficulties of Ireland are to be solved.  We have freedom, if we use it, for such a purpose, and need not enslave ourselves.  The divisions which I represent have given many champions to Irish liberty; so, too, have they given champions to the power and tyranny of landlordism. I thought that power and tyranny might have changed into good will.  I saw a Deputy standing up in the Dáil on the introduction of this Bill, the first who did so, pleading for the few remaining <Col N="2014" /> Ponsonby evicted tenants still out of their holdings.  I hope these tenants will soon be restored and put back on their land, as well as all other deserving tenants.  I hope also that provision will be made for deserving labourers and small holders.  The Deputy was moved with pity because he read about the sufferings on that estate.  There has been a change, and it is a good sign of the times.  Perhaps Lord Barrymore has changed from his principle of not selling his land.  If I did not weep for the Ponsonby tenants I worked for them when a boy with the boys and men of my parish with a view to lessening their sufferings when for three years they were kept in their miserable huts by the interference of Lord Barrymore.  I thought that Lord Midleton, the Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Barrymore too, had changed, and that they might be going to close amicably this class of fight, which for centuries has been a millstone on Irish progress. All industries in this country reflect the success that attends agriculture. If writs are to be sent broadcast through the country it looks as if we are going to have a renewal of the old land war, and I think all will admit that recently we have had enough of war, but where, I ask, is it all going to end?  No one knows better than Lord Barrymore that farming is not paying, and that farmers in many places, particularly in the County Cork, have not been able for the last three years to make their rents out of the land.  Lord Barrymore knows that as well as any farmer, for he, too, has had to suffer or rather contend against the sudden slump in prices, the absence of fairs being held regularly, the high rates that have to be paid, and the levies of different kinds that have to be met. The outlook for agriculture in the future is very dark.  As compared with their neighbours, unpurchased tenants have been paying excessive rents for a number of years, and it is not to the interest of the State that the tenant should be harassed on the eve of peace.  I would appeal to landlords and tenants to do what they can for peace within reason, and to settle this burning question of arrears.  It is no use appealing to some landlords, but I am sure there are some reasonable, men amongst them who would not wish to have the country plunged into chaos, and who want to live in this country in a spirit of friendship <Col N="2015" /> and co-operation with the general body of the people.  It is possible some poor landlords will be badly hit, but now is the time for landlords like Lord Barrymore, the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Midleton, in my native county, to show their magnanimity towards their poorer brethren, and likewise of landlords in other counties whose rentals were reduced very little in comparison to less influential and less favoured members. There should be a mutual understanding, a little give and take, between both parties to bridge over their differences and end this land war.  Such a settlement would tend to wipe out the bitter memories of the past.  We have had wars enough, and we do not want any more.  We want to create a good feeling for every creed and class and clan, as Thomas Davis taught, and to bear a love for all who desire to live here for the good of Ireland.  As Parnell said, Ireland cannot afford to lose a single Irishman. I like to practise what I preach, and I have tried to be fair to all classes.  As a representative on the public boards of my district, I did my best to cultivate a friendly feeling in the negotiations that went on to secure the measure of land purchase successfully carried through with my own landlord, who put aside the agent lest he might impede the sale. The tenant purchasers on that estate would have more respect than ever for their former landlord had he desired to live amongst them.  I should not love landlordism, because the second generations before me, at both sides of my family, were unjustly and cruelly evicted and not for the nonpayment of rent. The Farmers' Party do not want to aggravate this delicate situation, because not only are they the representatives of their class, but they ardently desire that nothing should be allowed to interfere with the accomplishment of a peaceful settlement.  We desire for the future peace, prosperity and stability, and to stand for the credit of our country, whose honour we desire to uphold. Some of the representatives on these benches have done their part in every national movement for more years than some of us can remember.  Shortsighted people sometimes say that we are narrow-minded, that we are flighty intellectuals and will never be broadminded. What we want at the present <Col N="2016" /> time is to be practical and clear minded. Our economic situation needs caution The time is not opportune for agitators and dreamers.  I hope the day will come, if not in the near future, when the farmers of Ireland will get the chance of proving that they can be statesmen as well as the Farmer Soldiers of South Africa, or the Farmer Generals of the United States who became Presidents We welcome this Bill as a good draft and a good foundation which, with improvements and amendments will, I hope, pass into law and give greater scope for more enduring good for the people of the nation than any of the Acts passed in the British Parliament.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on his ability and the honest effort he has made to settle this question.  I hope his success as an Irish statesman in this settlement will be greater than that of any of the English statesmen whose names are associated with measures for the solution of the Irish Land Question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not over impressed with the attempt made by Deputy Dr. White, speaking earlier in the debate to-day, to prove that the landlord in this matter had certain rights.  I was rather more inclined to the view taken yesterday by Deputy Johnson.  If we have read our history aright, I think most of us will agree that in the majority of cases these lands, which are now to be transferred, were acquired as a result either of plunder or conquest.  I do not believe that anybody will say that such an action was right at the time that it occurred, and I have yet to learn that the lapse of time justifies something which is in itself unjust.  It may not, perhaps, be a practical proposition now to bring back, as the Minister for Home Affairs suggested, the descendants of O'Donnell or O'Rourke, and plant them on these lands, but I think it is going too far when the Minister for Agriculture suggests that it is only doing justice to the descendants of those plunderers and robbers when he proposes to recognise certain legal rights which they have acquired in the course of time, and I have no doubt that the proposals which are in this Bill, and in the treatment which was meted out to former landlords who were bought out by the State, may be regarded as generous.  I suppose from that, arguing on those lines would be <Col N="2017" /> doing what the Minister for Home Affairs would describe as getting off our feet, and perhaps I should leave it at that. I think that whatever views we may have as to the rights of the landlords, we have to recognise the fact that for the past twenty or thirty years, perhaps longer, the demand of the vast majority of tenant farmers, and their ideal, was to be made proprietors of their holdings &mdash;peasant proprietorship&mdash;and my own view of the matter is that, whether we may hold different views as to the rights of the matter or not, it would be best to recognise that fact, do what we can to put these people's demands into practice, and wait for other times until those who hold different views are able to convince all the people, or the majority of the people, that the different views should be put into practical effect.  One of the chief provisions of this Bill is to relieve congestion, and in so far as it sets out to do that, and in so far as it does that, it has my support, knowing as I do, and as any of us who come from the Western portions of Ireland must know, the evils which have arisen and the evils which exist as a result of congestion. If a man earns his living by the land he should have so much of the land placed at his disposal as will enable him to live and rear his family comfortably or with a fair measure of comfort, on the produce of the land, in addition to providing this annuity, which must be paid to the State, and which should not, as Deputy Johnson said, be the first charge on the holding.  There are various opinions as to what an economic holding is.  Perhaps in the circumstances it is best that it should be left as it is in the Bill, without actually defining the figure or fixing a rigid limit.  In the last Bill, I think it was a 1909 Bill, a figure of £10 valuation was definitely fixed as being the limit over which any holding was economic.  I believe that there are very many holdings over that valuation which could not be described as economic holdings in the sense in which I understand what is meant by an economic holding. If it were suggested that the figure should be raised the difficulty would arise as to perhaps what the figure should be.  If we assume, and we have no right to assume otherwise, that the Land Commission will deal with this matter and judge it in a proper way, having regard to all these circumstances, it is perhaps <Col N="2018" /> best that the figure should be left to their judgment.  However, I would like to put a minimum figure below which it would not be possible for them to go. The question of the migration of existing tenants to large ranches will present very many great difficulties, and I agree that it is one on which all people interested in the land should support and help those who are trying to solve that very difficult problem.  It will require very careful handling.  The suggestion which I made before on one occasion is, I think, worthy of consideration, that is the question of migrating these people in colonies rather than individually.  One of the principal objections which migrants have to leaving their own districts is that they are leaving their neighbours and friends, and if it were possible to take a large number of them and migrate them to a certain ranch it would get over these difficulties to some extent.  Now, there is the question of evicted tenants.  Provision is made for restoring evicted tenants, but a limit of 25 years is set, that is 25 years before the passing of the Irish Land Act. If people were evicted before that time they have no claim under the provisions of this Bill.  That is a provision which I cannot understand or appreciate.  I do not see why, if the Land Commission are satisfied that people were evicted from the land even before that time, that their families should not now have a right to consideration when these lands from which they were evicted were being distributed. We know that very many of the evictions and clearances&mdash;clearances to which the existence of the present ranches in a great many parts of the country are due&mdash;took place long before the date specified in the Bill, during the period following the famine and during the fifties and sixties.  I think there is no reason why, if the descendants of the families which were cleared in these times can establish the fact that they had held portions of these lands in these times and were cleared out of them, why they should not have a claim under this clause to restoration in these ranches.  Regarding the division of these ranches, there is one particular provision that I would like to see introduced into the Bill.  I agree with my friends of the Farmers' Party that if our chief industry in the country is to prosper and progress as it should, we must have more agricultural education. Provision must be made for that, just as <Col N="2019" /> it is made in other countries, especially Denmark.  This education should not be entirely of a theoretical type and merely book education.  It should be rather of the practical and experimental kind, and if that is to be the case I think advantage should be taken of this division of land to set aside in each district a small portion of land which would serve as a demonstration or educational plot.  These plots might be attached either to the National schools or the County Agricultural or Technical Schools&mdash;plots which would be used, say, for horticultural demonstration or practical agricultural education. I think that is a matter the Minister might consider.  The point will be made, no doubt, that all the land available will be required for the relief of congestion; but the portion which would be required for this purpose would be so comparatively small, and its usefulness so comparatively great, that I think it would render a better service in the particular direction which I mention.  Nothing has been said, as far as I can discover&mdash;of course, land law is an extremely technical thing, and I think that we might all be prepared to admit that at best we are only amateurs at this kind of thing&mdash;and I can discover nothing in the Bill about accommodation land attached to towns, or what exactly will be the position of townparks, and whether it will be possible to buy these out, or what will be the position of towns situated in rural districts. Under the old Acts some provision was made for the purchase of town properties. Towns like Castlerea, Athenry, and other towns in the West of Ireland, were bought out under the provisions of the Land Act.  I do not know what is the provision in this Act, if any, and I would like if the Minister would clear up our minds on that particular point.  On the question of arrears, I was not impressed by the attempt made by my friend Deputy Rooney to explain away his action in voting for a measure which they find now has recoiled on their own heads, because it was not without warning as to what was likely to happen that that vote was cast.  I think it was the Minister for Home Affairs, speaking yesterday, who made the statement that in none of the cases in which decrees were executed by the aid of the military was any offer made of payment according to the provisions of <Col N="2020" /> this Bill.  I would like to put a question to the Minister, or the Minister for Home Affairs, and I would put it in this way, that if an offer is made in all these cases where writs have been issued and where decrees are pending, if the tenants are prepared to offer the rents in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Bill &mdash;that is, I think, a reduction of 25 per cent.&mdash;is the Minister prepared in that case to call off the writs and the executions? I do not know what his power in that matter is, but I take it that the Minister for Home Affairs, speaking yesterday, rather hinted that if such an offer were made the writs should not be proceeded with.  I want to be quite straight about that.  If the offer is made by the tenants, what is going to happen?  In a question which I put down a few days ago, and which was answered this morning, I was rather trying to get some light on a state of affairs which seems to be agitating a certain portion of the Minister's constituency and mine in County Galway.  I have a Press report before me, and I would like to give the Minister this opportunity of clearing up this matter which is causing such confusion down there.  The secretary of this meeting of unpurchased tenants held in Tuam, according to the report, &ldquo;read a letter received from the Minister for Agriculture stating that the Government could not interfere with decrees for rents awarded by the County Court Judges, but that military forces would not assist in the execution of the decrees.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to clear this up and tell us definitely what exactly was the justification for the secretary reading such a letter and alleging that it came from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The reading of that letter will, no doubt, clear away some of that confusion to which I refer.  With regard to the question of the creation of bogus tenancies, I think that provision is made in the Bill whereby any tenancy created since, I think, September, 1922, may not be recognised as a tenancy.  I think it should go back beyond that date. I think that untenanted lands which, during the past two or three years, were given over to tenants to avoid or evade the provisions of a Bill which they knew would come along, should not be recognised for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Bill, and power should be taken to apply the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that such bogus tenancies were created.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, has now appointed this Committee.  The members are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Professor Smiddy, Chairman.</P>
      <P>Professor Bastable.</P>
      <P>Professor R.M. Henry.</P>
      <P>Mr. Geo. O'Brien.</P>
      <P>Professor J.G. Smith.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will appoint the Secretary to the Committee, and an Assistant Secretary will be appointed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Terms of Reference to the Committee are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To investigate and report&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  as to the effect of the existing fiscal system, and of any measures regulating or restricting imports or exports, on industry and agriculture in the Saorstát, and</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  as to the effect of any changes therein intended to foster the development of industry and agriculture,</P>
      <P>with due regard to the interests of the general community and to the economic relations of the Saorstát with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifications of the members of <Col N="2023" /> the Committee do not need much enlargement. The Chairman, Professor Smiddy, is well known as the Professor of Economics in University College, Cork, and as the representative of the Saorstát in the United States for some considerable time past.  Before accepting his appointment in University College, Cork, Professor Smiddy had practical experience of business; he acted as Economic Adviser in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty, and while in the United States he had opportunities of studying intimately the working of the tariff system of that country.</P>
    <P>Professor Bastable is the author of the standard work on principles of taxation, and his reputation extends far beyond Ireland.  We are fortunate to have available his special experience.</P>
    <P>Professor Henry, of Queen's University, Belfast, has had many years' experience of industrial questions as Chairman of Trade Boards since their inception, and will greatly assist the Committee in considering the effect of a fiscal system in its relation to the important industrial area of the North.</P>
    <P>Mr. Geo. O'Brien, nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, is a member of the Agricultural Commission and a specialist in agricultural economics.  As the Committee will first be considering industrial questions it is intended that Mr. O'Brien should continue his valuable work for the Commission on Agriculture, being concerned for the present with the inquiries of this Committee only in so far as they affect agriculture and the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Professor J. G. Smith, who is a native of Galway and a Scholar of Trinity College, Dublin, is Professor of Economics in Birmingham University.  He has a close acquaintance with economic conditions both in Ireland and Great Britain, and has recently published works on practical aspects of Commerce that have commanded wide appreciation.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the distinguished members of the Committee will bring to their inquiries not only a knowledge of the conditions in Ireland, North and South, but also an acquaintance with conditions in Great Britain and the United States, two countries with which the trade relations of the Saorstát have an immense importance.</P>
    <P>In a recent discussion in the Dáil the <Col N="2024" /> view was advanced that the inquiry should be conducted by &ldquo;business men affected every day by the operation of the present fiscal system.&rdquo;  The Committee is not intended to be an instrument by which beneficially interested parties can secure the acceptance of particular doctrines; its purpose, on the contrary, is to secure a disinterested, balanced and exhaustive analysis of a complex problem on which the future of the whole country largely depends.</P>
    <P>This purpose would not be achieved by drawing the <i>personnel</i> of the Committee from the various business and trading interests, every one of which claims an alteration of the fiscal system for its own particular advantage.</P>
    <P>What we feel is essential is that we should have a Committee consisting of persons with expert knowledge of all the various factors and circumstances that make towards the economic welfare of the country, who are at the same time disinterested parties and can accordingly give impartial consideration as between the interests of the general community and the interests of any particular section that may seek to establish a privileged position.</P>
    <P>The problem of adjusting and regulating the fiscal system of the country in the manner best calculated to accord with the economic needs of the country is a problem of supreme importance. The people of this country have had little opportunity in the past of informing themselves in regard to all the related facts on which their decision as to the economic policy of the future depends&mdash; for this is not a question merely for a section or a party, but for the whole people&mdash;and it is, therefore, essential that the facts should be reviewed by experienced and disinterested men, accustomed to examine all sides of such a question without prejudice or bias.  The country may have full confidence in the ability of the Committee appointed by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and for Agriculture to ascertain and present all the data necessary for a right conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is facts and not policy which the Committee is intended to determine. Every proposition that is advanced will be examined solely with a view to ascertain and to inform the community as to all the facts.  The Committee is not expected to advocate policy.  That will be <Col N="2025" /> a matter for the people and the Government when they have the facts before them.  The Committee will be accessible to every interest affected in this matter, and the Government, which intends to develop the resources of the country by every means consistent with the general well-being of the community, will ensure that every interest has full consideration for its difficulties and its needs.</P>
    <P>The Committee will determine its own procedure, and will, no doubt, prefer to hold its sittings in private in view of the confidential nature of much of the matter it will require to discuss with traders and others.  It will probably find it convenient to begin by an investigation into the effects of the situation as it is. Any party that has a case to put before the Committee should prepare a preliminary written statement, giving in detail all relevant particulars.  It is obviously desirable that, so far as possible, proposals should be put forward by bodies acting in a representative capacity. The circumstances of particular firms or persons may need special enquiry, but if each manufacturer or trader insisted on putting forward his own special case, the enquiry would be prolonged indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I must add one word regarding what I may describe as the financial aspect of the Committee's investigations.  It will not be the task of the Committee to overhaul the complete fiscal system of the Free State from the point of view of taxation and revenue, and in the nature of things the Government must especially reserve to itself freedom to review the Committee's recommendations in the light of their effect on the National Budget by reference to the existing state of the national finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the position of the ex-teachers whose pensions were based on the emoluments received by them prior to the 1st April, 1920, is one of great hardship; and that legislation empowering the Minister for Finance to increase the amount payable as pension to such ex-teachers should be introduced without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I will have to inflict something more in reference to schoolmasters on Deputy Gorey before this evening is over.  I bring forward the motion standing in my name because of the rather unsatisfactory way in which the position was left at the close of the debate on the Education Estimates.  I must claim the indulgence of the Dáil to explain how these grievances, which this resolution is intended to remedy, arose.  Up to the year 1880 there were no pensions for National Teachers.  Before that time there was some system of gratuities.  In that year a Pension Act was introduced and passed in the British Parliament, and a sum equal to £1,300,000 was taken from the Irish Church Surplus Fund and used as the nucleus of a Pension Fund. From time to time since there have been various Grants-in-Aid, and the Teachers themselves have contributed each year a certain proportion of their salaries to the fund.  The fund is now a very valuable asset, and from that fund Teachers' pensions are paid.  I would specially emphasise the fact that Teachers from that time have been contributing towards this fund. Rules for its administration were drawn up by the Treasury, and have been altered from time to time.  There was a revision of the rules in 1898.  In that year the maximum pension for Male Teachers was fixed at £60, and for women, <Col N="2030" /> I think, it was £45 or £50; I do not know the exact figure.  No further revision took place for fourteen or fifteen years, although there was much agitation in the matter.  In 1913 another revision of these Pension Rules took place, and in the same year the principles which underlie Civil Service pensions were introduced. I say the principles because the Pension Scheme introduced for teachers that year is different from the Civil Service scheme. Pension is based on salary.  It would bear a certain proportion&mdash;one-eightieth of the salary was to be paid for each year of service up to a maximum of forty years.</P>
    <P>That was the highest pension a teacher could get under the rules, and these rules are still in existence.  That pension would be half the average salary at the time of retirement&mdash;half his average salary for the three years before his retirement.  There was no provision such as is made under the Civil Service Scheme for a lump sum, and there was no provision for a gratuity to the dependents of deceased teachers.  That was agreed to in 1913, and I would wish the Deputies to note that while it was agreed to in 1913, it was laid down that the rules would come into operation in October, 1914.  As I say, I would wish you to remember particularly that date and that fact, and remember at the same time that the Great War broke out in August, 1914, because that fact has a very special bearing on what I want to put before you.  This Scheme that was introduced in 1914 applied to all teachers who were in the service.  The benefits of it, such as they were, were applicable to teachers who had retired before that date or rather to teachers who had retired since 1900, that is, 14 years before that date.  If it were the fact that the pension which they had was less than half the salary which they had on retiral, they could get a higher pension.  That was the fact in a great many cases. Salaries of teachers a few years ago were notoriously low.  There is no need to argue that.  The pensions were accordingly low.  The average pension of teachers retiring up to the period when the teachers' salaries were increased was something between £40 and £50 per annum.  The War came in 1914 and 1915-16-17 and '18 came along. All this time there was no increase whatsoever of the pensions to teachers.  The <Col N="2031" /> existing Civil Servants got a bonus.  The teachers in the service got the bonus Nothing whatsoever was done for the pensioners.  That I should say was the case not only of the teacher-pensioners but of Civil Service pensioners&mdash;all Government pensioners.  In 1920 a motion was brought forward in the British Parliament, and the Government were defeated on the motion, with the result that they were forced to bring in, or promised to bring in, a Bill to increase the pensions of teachers.  In 1920 the Pensions Increases Bill was introduced in England, which applied to all Government pensioners and to all Irish teachers. That Pensioners Act provided that a certain percentage of increases should be given to the pensioners&mdash;50 per cent., I think, and 40 per cent. in cases of a pension of, say, over £100.  I am not sure of the figures.  I know that 50 per cent. would have applied in a great many cases to Irish teachers.  There was this provision in that Act that it would not apply to any Pension Scheme or any pension paid under the Scheme which was introduced after the 4th August, 1914.  In spite of the representations which were made by the Educational Department here, and by the Pension Office people here, the British Treasury at the time made a rule to the effect that the 1914 Pension Scheme was a post-war scheme for the purposes of the Act.  I pointed out earlier that this Scheme, this 1914 Scheme, was actually agreed upon between the Treasury and the Irish Representatives in 1913, and it was only just an accident that the rules came into operation on the 1st October, 1914, instead of in October, 1913.  The British Treasury took advantage of that accident, and ruled that the pensions on which the percentage increases would be based would not be the actual increases which they had, but the pensions which they would have if the latter revision never took place.  That is, I quite recognise, rather technical. I will illustrate what it means by giving you an example.  Suppose a man had a pension of £50.  Under the 1914 Rules the percentage increase on that would be 50, and he would be entitled, under the Pension Increases Act, to have his pension increased to £75.  When he came to apply for that they told him: &ldquo;Oh, no, your pension is not £50.  Under the <Col N="2032" /> old rules your pension would be £30. Therefore we must base your increase, not on the £50 which you have, but on the £30 which you would have, and so you are entitled to an increase of 50 per cent. on the £30; that would bring it up to £45 and you have £50 already.  Therefore you get no increase.&rdquo;  That was the system on which this Pensions Increases Act worked as applied to the Irish teachers.  The number of teachers who benefited was exceedingly small, and the benefits which they received were equally small.  That brought the position down to the signing of the Treaty.  When the Provisional Government took over charge of Irish affairs, representations were made on behalf of these pensioners to the then Minister for Education, Mr. Finian Lynch.  He was good enough to recognise, and he had no difficulty in recognising, the very great plight of these poor people, and he promised immediately that he would do his best to get what had been asked for by those who made representations on their behalf.  What had been asked for was the same terms which had been given in Scotland to the pensioners in Scotland.  Briefly, that was £1 of an increase for each year of service. The biggest increase a man could get would be £40.  That had already been provided for teacher pensioners in Scotland. As I say, Mr. Lynch made representations to the Finance Department at the time, and several interviews took place between those who represented the claims of the pensioners and the Minister for Education.  On one occasion, the 20th May, 1922, a deputation waited on Mr. Lynch, and there was present on that occasion a representative of the Minister for Finance, Mr. Bewley.  I was present at the deputation, and we put before them the points which I have just mentioned and the claims of these pensioned teachers.  After a delay of two months or more we got a definite statement to the effect that all that could be done would be to allow for the purpose of this Pensions Increase Act these 1914 rules to stand.  In other words, that the increase would be based on the 1914 rules.  We were not satisfied with that.  We pointed out that it involved very many complicated calculations, and was not on the whole a fair way of increasing or giving these increases, because it worked this <Col N="2033" /> way: The percentage increases we held, and we do still hold, were wrong in principle to meet such cases as these.  If one man had £20, say, and another man had a pension of £60, and if you take these two cases there is no doubt that the man who had £20 was the worst off, and was entitled to the biggest increase, but under the percentage basis he would get only £10, and the man who had the £60 would get £30 of an increase. We pointed out that the increase ought to be based on the service, and that each man should get a proportionate increase according to the length of his service.  In any case, as I say, in May or June last year we were told that they would do a certain thing, and that that was all they would do.  Of course, we had to rest more or less satisfied with that, as we could not get any more, and we were quite prepared to accept, and did all we could to get it paid.</P>
    <P>Now, a most extraordinary thing happened. Inquiries were made at the Finance Department, at the Education Department, at the Law Department, and the Teachers' Pensions Office, and each of these Departments had the knack of saying that the whole blame for the delay rested with another Department.  The fact remains that up to October of last year nothing had been done, as far as we could find out.  On that occasion we approached the new Minister for Education (Professor MacNeill), who had been just then appointed.  He made certain representations to the Treasury, and the result was that on November 3rd a letter was received from the then Secretary of the Ministry of Finance (Mr. O'Brien), from which the following is a quotation:&mdash;&ldquo;The matter of the Pensioned Teachers' Grant was fully considered by the late Minister for Finance earlier in the year, and the Minister cannot now consent to reopen the question.  Rules to give effect to the decision then arrived at are being drafted, having been delayed by legal difficulties, and the Minister hopes that it will be possible to issue them shortly.&rdquo; We waited for the rules, and the pensioners waited for their money.  Some of them have gone to their graves in the meantime without having got anything. On December 19 I put a question down to the Minister for Finance as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if it is true that the late Minister for <Col N="2034" /> Finance, General Michael Collins, agreed last May to give a grant to increase the inadequate pensions now paid to ex-teachers; further, will he explain the extraordinary delay which has taken place in distributing this grant, and if he is now in a position to say when these increases will be paid?</P>
    <P>The reply to that was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A draft of the rules to give effect to the increase asked for in May last is now before the Law Officer.  It has been much delayed by reason of legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for the rules.  I took the matter up with the Law Department after this, and at the end of December last I was informed that there was a legal difficulty in the way, a legal bar that had to be got over, and that immediately after the Recess the Government would bring in a Bill to remedy the matter.  In the list of Bills which was distributed some time ago a Superannuation Bill figured, and I was under the impression that that referred to a Bill to give effect to the decision of the late Minister for Finance. I was therefore rather surprised at some remarks which were made by the present Minister for Finance on the occasion of the Education Debate, and that is why I put down this motion, in order that we would find out definitely and distinctly where we are with regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that this money would amount altogether, I think, to something less than £50,000 for the first year, and would be, of course, a gradually decreasing sum, according as these pensioners would drop out.  I do not think it would be even that amount. It is not suggested that this should be added to the Vote.  My suggestion is that it should be paid out of the proceeds of the Pension Fund.  The present income of the Pension Fund is approximately £250,000 per annum.  Of that sum the teachers in the service, I assume, would contribute something like £120,000.  After the expenditure on pensions there was last year a surplus of some £90,000, and this year I would estimate the surplus at about £120,000.  The suggestion is that the relief that is claimed for these old pensioners, who are trying to eke out an existence on an average pension of less than £50, would be payable out of this fund, a fund which they, by their contributions during their service, helped <Col N="2035" /> largely to establish and to build up.  I will again quote the figures which I quoted on a former occasion of the number of pensioners and the amount which they are paid as pension.  There are 225, we were told in a return I received from the Ministry. of these teachers who retired before 1920 having pensions of £20 per annum or under, and 1,171 with pensions between £20 and £52 a year.  I think I need say no more to convince the Dáil of the necessity for making immediate and urgent provision for these pensioners. We have suggested to the Ministry that as regards distributing whatever is available for distribution that the best method is to follow that of the Scotch Education Department, that is giving a certain definite sum for each year of service given by the teacher.  Distributing it on the percentage basis is not fair; it is cumbersome, and it leads to very cumbersome calculations and difficulties in administration. The other method is a much simpler one.  Whatever method is adopted, the matter is extremely urgent. Twelve months and more have now gone by since a definite promise was given to do something to remedy the position of these people.  I know that within the twelve months many old men and women have gone to their graves with disappointed hopes, as they got nothing, although they expected that they would get something. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us quite definitely this evening that the promises which have been made will be carried out immediately.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.  I do not pretend to know the case in its technical aspects as intimately or with one-tenth of the accuracy of Deputy O'Connell.  But he has made a case that I think is quite unanswerable; and when he dealt as he did with the financial aspect, I think he convinced the economists of the Dáil, and even the arch-economist, the Minister for Finance.  In case he did not succeed quite, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to what may be fairly well taken as a means of comparison.  These pensioners served the arts of peace for many years, and contributed largely to the fund out of which their pensions are to be drawn.  The pensions they are receiving are very largely based upon the <Col N="2036" /> conditions prevailing before 1914.  Comparisons are odious, but we have had presented to us for consideration a pension scheme dealing with those who have suffered, and who have been injured in pursuing the arts&mdash;arts is hardly the word in this respect&mdash;of war. When we were told that there is an average of £1 per week for men who have surely not been disabled by shock or wounds, but have been worn out in the public service, and in the course of their wearing out have put by their funds for their superannuation, their claim is quite good for a payment which would compare favourably with that we promised to soldiers who have suffered wounds in the defence of the State.  I will not read out the figures that are proposed, which the Minister for Finance is supporting, and the Dáil generally will support.  I would impress upon the Minister and the Dáil that for long service in peace something better than the average that Deputy O'Connell has quoted ought to be granted out of the fund which these same people have to a very considerable extent built up for the very purpose of providing a competence for their old age.  Bear in mind, too, that the present teachers, who are now contributing, are unanimous and enthusiastic in urging that the funds which they are contributing should be made use of to supplement the pensions which the pensioners are now drawing. There is no fear, from any actuarial calculation, that the response to the appeal that is made will damage the foundation of the pension scheme.  In view of all that has passed, and the promises and delays&mdash;further promises and further delays&mdash;one would hope that at last a decision will be taken, and that within a week a Bill will be introduced to give effect to the decision that has already been taken by the Ministry.  I have had visits and representations from some of these men, and it has been pitiable to hear their stories, in view of the promises and in view of the assurances that have been given from official sources, that their cases will be taken up and dealt with satisfactorily.  I would lay special stress upon the last five words of the motion, that these pensions &ldquo;should be introduced without delay.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to give us a promise now that the legislation empowering him to increase the amount payable <Col N="2037" /> as pensions shall be introduced within the next week.</P>

      <P>The Deputies who have spoken are, no doubt, under the impression that the case they have made out is so clear that it must be convincing and irresistible, but they forget that to the cogency of an argument applies pretty much the same principle as applies to the jest in the words of one of Shakespeare's characters: &ldquo;A jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him who hears it, not in the mind of him that makes it.&rdquo;  Your best jest may fail in its effect if there is no sense of the ludicrous in the mind on which the jesting remark may fall.  I remember a barrister complaining that though his argument was as plain as A.B.C. the Court did not see it.  A friend pointed out to him that when your argument is as plain as A.B.C. the Judge is D.E.F. to it.  Then there is no advantage in the simplicity and clearness of your case.  Now, I know from a remark let fall by the Minister for Finance that these ardent and humanitarian Deputies were speaking to ears that hear, but heed not.  After all, who are these people for whose relief Deputy O'Connell pleads?  Schoolmasters !  What right have schoolmasters to any consideration in a land like this, which is proud in its professions, proud of its reverence and its veneration for learning and all who devote themselves to learning.  We have no laurels for any except those who have won their reputations in war.  Those who taught the children of the generation before last, and the last generation and the present generation, let them retire if they like to the workhouse.  What are the workhouses for but for the derelicts?  Those men chose an occupation with their eyes open, a badly paid occupation.  They might perhaps have found more remunerative employment, but they gave themselves up to the education of Irish children.  They knew what they were doing.  Are we now to come to their relief and pay them?  This is the impudent importunity of the schoolmaster who has been victimised for years and years and to whom promises have been held out&mdash;made only to be broken.  They, simple-minded schoolmasters, believed that statesmen were not liars, but were good men and true like themselves. Well, they deserve to be punished for being such bad men of the world and so <Col N="2038" /> ill-trained in what life means and involves. I took down the figures given by the Deputy.  225 of these pensioners have pensions of £20 a year to live upon. Well there are thousands of people who have not twenty pence.  What is the hardship, then, in their case.  Deputy O'Connell also says that there are 1,171 who have the rich income of from £20 to £52 per year.  These go to swell the numbers of that new and most objectionable class, the new aristocracy.  This is really what Deputy Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party, lends himself to this afternoon.</P>
      <P>He wants actually to swell the ranks of the new aristocracy, and to pose here as a champion of democracy.  The position is hopelessly inconsistent.  If we pension these men for past service, look at what we are committing ourselves to; that we take the same interest in educational affairs as they do in Scotland&mdash; a people notorious for the love of money, a people remarkable for their strict economy and for the close scrutiny to which they subject every item of expenditure not merely of private funds, but more particularly of public moneys.  Are we to follow the example of Scotland and to become the advocates of the better remuneration for teachers, and to take into account the educational services that men have rendered to the country?  Furthermore, they rendered it under the British Government&mdash;let us not forget that; they were servants of the National Board, and they in turn were servants of the British Government.  Do they deserve to be pensioned?</P>

To Deputy O'Connell I would say what was said on a famous occasion in the Roman Senate by Cataline, &ldquo;How long will you weary our patience?&rdquo; Hardly a month passes but some schoolmaster or another gets up in this Dáil to urge some weary round of argument that the remuneration for teachers is bad. Only a fool or an enthusiast, which is the next thing to a fool, would embark on education as a means of living.  I think it is high time to put an end to these preposterous claims.  We have no money&mdash; let the public understand it&mdash;for rewarding <Col N="2039" /> men of that stamp&mdash;men and women who were foolish enough to shut themselves up for six or seven hours every day in miserable hovels and apply their souls' energy for the miserable pittance for the training of the young.  They deserve to be punished, and I am glad to see that the Minister for Finance is determined that they shall be punished.  Not one penny of this money, part of which is their own, shall go to them.</P>

      <P>The two speeches that have just been made rather puzzle me.  I am warned on the one hand, no doubt by an education expert of the highest eminence, not to give any money, and I would like to hearken to that if I could, but on the other hand I am to some extent relieved by an undertaking given by the late Minister for Finance, and which it is my intention to carry out. I am puzzled also by the statement made by Deputy O'Connell that there are difficult and cumbersome calculations which may render the position not clear.  Now, if that was said, let us say of politicians or of soldiers or of members of the Dáil, I might believe it, but to say it of schoolmasters, no matter how long they may be retired from school, is to ask me to believe something beyond my gullibility at the present moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>You can leave that to us.  We will have to see if we can make anything out of them.  Most of what Deputy O'Connell said is correct, but at the same time I must correct two little items in his statement.  One is that the late Minister for Finance gave an undertaking that certain promises of certain conditions were made and were offered, and when it was discovered that the rules could not be made without legislation, I think the Deputy demanded bigger terms &mdash;I think he demanded the Scottish terms &mdash;and then the usual haggling began and went on.  I said I would bring in no Bill unless he would take what was promised by the late General Collins, and then the Deputy demanded the Scottish terms. Now, the speech of the learned Deputy, notwithstanding the case for Scotland, is altogether different.  I may be wrong, but I think I read somewhere that education in Scotland is on a higher scale than <Col N="2040" /> it is here.  It started earlier, was nurtured much more carefully, and had much more money spent upon it.  Some years ago I saw a return of the estimated revenues of Scotland, and at that time I think it was 104 millions, and the expenditure only amounted to 20 millions, and therefore there was a profit of 84 millions. Now, if I was Minister for Finance in Scotland I would be ready to provide large grants out of that 84 millions.  Remember well the position here is that we have a revenue that does not cover our outgoings, and we are faced each day with a continuous everlasting retinue of persons coming forward declaring that they are unjustly treated, so much so that when I find anyone who will suggest some time or another that he is properly and justly treated I would suggest, whether it is man or woman, that they should be given a prize of £1,000.  It is getting more and more difficult to find the money.  We have a certain state of affairs here.  We have inherited it, and we are asked in the space of a short year or so to remedy every single injustice that had grown up and permeated this country not only for many generations, but, as some people would term it, for seven centuries.  Now, it is not possible to do that, but I think if Deputies will look up the suggested list of Bills that are still to be dealt with, they will find there is one called the Superannuation Bill, and amongst those mentioned in that Bill are teachers.  I am prepared to introduce a Bill to carry out the terms agreed by the late Minister for Finance.  Speaking at that time, he was speaking for a Treasury that was not empty.  We are speaking for an empty Treasury today, and Deputies know it.  There is no use calling me an arch-economist.  A man is an arch-economist if he has anything to show for it.  I have nothing. Yet people would make it worse by making these additional demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These terms were announced twelve months ago.  A revision of the rules was not accomplished in the autumn of 1914, after the war broke out, with the result that the pensions calculated under these rules were not treated as pre-war pensions under the Act of 1920.  We are prepared to bring in a clause in the Superannuation Bill which will regard them as if made before October, 1914.  If that is accepted, there is nothing more to talk <Col N="2041" /> about.  If you demand the Scottish terms, you demand more than you demanded from the late General Collins or that he agreed to give you.</P>

      <P>No.  The agreed Bill was offered upon the lines of the undertaking, that is regarding the rules published in October, 1914, as if they had been published before the War started, but then the Scottish terms were demanded, and these, as far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to accede to.  I would like to advise Deputies that very shortly we will have no Budget here except the Pensions Budget.  Nothing else.  There will not be money for anybody else.  Everybody in the country must be pensioned&mdash;there is no other way, if we are to deal justly with the people.  We are at present paying from 5 to 6 millions in pensions.  Ten years ago the revenue of the country, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, was 12 millions, and now we are paying in pensions half of what the whole revenue was 10 years ago.  I am told this Fund has plenty of money in it, but look up the list of Estimates and you will find that in respect of gratuities to persons retired that a sum of something like £50,000 a year is down in the Estimate for public education.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of this fund the outgoings are always much heavier than the incomings.  The fact is that there is £50,000 in the Estimate in respect of this particular service, and if one compares this Vote with, as Deputy Johnson did, the expenditure in the year 1912 it will be found to have increased proportionately much more than any other service.  Is it, or is it not, a fact that teachers are much better paid now than any other order in the community if one regards the 1913 scale. What effort is going to be made by people to help their own class?  It is coming to that.  Sooner or later you will be face to face with the financial axe, if not in my time, certainly in somebody else's.  Expenses must come down, or you must tax still more.  I am afraid there is no disposition, nor ability, to bear additional tax, and I have only got to say that I am prepared to carry out the proposal that the late General Collins agreed to, and that is to regard these rules as such, and to embody them in a Bill which I will bring in within the next fortnight.</P>

      <P>That is quite true. The Minister for Agriculture did not wait until the landlords and the tenants had agreed before he introduced his Land Bill. The Minister for Finance is labouring under a misapprehension, because what I did suggest was that he should calculate the amount of money involved in the terms outlined by the late Minister for Finance, and in the terms which he himself offers this evening.  What we ask is that the money be distributed in accordance with the Scottish principle. If he cannot agree to that, if he cannot agree to accept that sensible suggestion, then the responsibility will be upon him, but that is what our suggestion comes to. The suggestion which I make does not involve more money.  What we ask is that the amount which he is prepared to give, and which he promised this evening, should be distributed in a way which we hold would be fairer than the manner in which it has been distributed under the Pensions Increase Act.  The money was distributed on the principle of fifty per cent. increase.  That is to say, if a man had a pension of £20 a year, he got an increase of £10, and if he had £60, he got an increase of £30.  We say that is not fair.</P>

We hold, if that principle were adopted, it would be much fairer all round than the method adopted under the Pensions Increase Act. I had intended referring to some remarks made by the Minister but I will not do so in view of the definite promise which he has made to introduce a Bill within the next fortnight dealing with this matter.  I, therefore, propose to ask the leave of the Dáil to withdraw my motion.
